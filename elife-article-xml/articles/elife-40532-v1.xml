To establish titin’s contribution to skeletal muscle passive stiffness, relative to that of the extracellular matrix, a mouse model was created in which titin’s molecular spring region was shortened by deleting 47 exons, the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model. RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy predicts a much stiffer titin molecule. Mechanical studies with this novel mouse model support that titin is the main determinant of skeletal muscle passive stiffness. Unexpectedly, the in vivo sarcomere length working range was shifted to shorter lengths in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice, due to a ~ 30% increase in the number of sarcomeres in series (longitudinal hypertrophy). The expected effect of this shift on active force generation was minimized through a shortening of thin filaments that was discovered in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice. Thus, skeletal muscle titin is the dominant determinant of physiological passive stiffness and drives longitudinal hypertrophy.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

The contractile unit of the striated muscle is the sarcomere, consisting of three types of myofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Squire et al., 2017</xref>). The thick filaments are located in the middle of the sarcomere and contain the molecular motor myosin that underlies active force development. The thick filaments overlap with the actin-based thin filaments that are attached to the ends of the sarcomere (the Z-disks) and that transmit the active forces generated by myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Squire et al., 2017</xref>). The focus of the present study is on titin, the largest known protein (~3800 kDa), that forms the third myofilament type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Granzier and Labeit, 2005</xref>), spanning the half-sarcomere from Z-disk to M-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fürst et al., 1988</xref>). The I-band region of titin functions as a molecular spring that extends and generates force (passive force) when muscles are stretched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trombitás et al., 1995</xref>). Titin’s molecular spring consists of two main sub-segments, the tandem Ig segment (serially-linked immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains) and the PEVK segment (rich in proline (P), glutamate (E), valine (V), and lysine(K)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trombitás et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>). These segments have different biophysical properties and therefore their extensions dominate at different but physiological sarcomere length ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trombitás et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watanabe et al., 2002a</xref>). Titin’s force maintains the structural integrity of the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horowits and Podolsky, 1987</xref>) and limits sarcomere length variation along myofibrils (serially-linked sarcomeres) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Granzier and Pollack, 1990</xref>).</p><p>While the contribution of titin to sarcomere passive stiffness (slope of the passive force-sarcomere length relation) in single fibers is widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granzier and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granzier and Labeit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prado et al., 2005</xref>), there are conflicting views on the relevance of titin to passive stiffness at the skeletal muscle level. It has been proposed that the extracellular matrix (ECM) dominates whole muscle passive stiffness and that titin is less relevant at the whole muscle level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lieber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tirrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyer and Lieber, 2011</xref>). This contrasts with studies that concluded that the passive stiffness of whole muscle fully resides in single fibers (titin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magid and Law, 1985</xref>) and also with work on cardiac muscle, where titin’s stiffness exceeds ECM-stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Granzier and Irving, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). An important goal of the present study was to directly address this controversy. Understanding the role of titin in passive muscle has clinical relevance as titin-based passive stiffness is known to be altered in skeletal muscle diseases. In fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) titin-based stiffness is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lassche et al., 2013</xref>) and in cerebral palsy patients, an increase in titin-based passive stiffness has been implicated as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ottenheijm and Granzier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fridén and Lieber, 2003</xref>). In contrast, diaphragm fibers in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a reduced titin-based stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ottenheijm et al., 2006</xref>). It is unknown if changes in titin-based stiffness carry through to the level of the muscle and, importantly, if altered titin stiffness causes disease, or reflects an adaptation to disease. An in-depth understanding of titin’s roles in skeletal muscle stiffness is required.</p><p>To aid in this work, a mouse model was created in which titin’s stiffness was increased by shortening titin’s molecular spring region. We targeted for deletion 47 PEVK exons (<italic>Ttn</italic> exon 112–158), referred to as the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model. Transcript, protein and functional studies (muscle mechanics, exercise testing) were performed, to determine the effects of the deletion on the single fiber, whole muscle, and organismal levels. The <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model also provides a unique opportunity to test the effects of altered titin-based tension on active muscle function. Recently, several novel mechanisms have been proposed that link titin-based tension to active tension. For example, titin might store elastic energy by unfolding Ig domains in passive muscle. Through their refolding during contraction, titin might generate forces that add to the active force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eckels et al., 2018</xref>). An alternative mechanism consists of titin-based effects on thick filament structure that contribute to activating the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piazzesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies on the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model that was created reveal that in skeletal muscle the size of the PEVK segment length is reduced by ~75%, and that this highly increases the passive stiffness at the sarcomere, single fiber, and whole muscle levels. Furthermore, within the physiological sarcomere length range of skeletal muscle, titin is the dominant determinant of the passive stiffness in both WT and <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice. Hypertrophy occurs in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice, due to longitudinal growth that serially adds sarcomeres. This shifts the in vivo working sarcomere length ranges of <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscles to shorter lengths, supporting that titin-based stiffness is functionally important and that its level is carefully controlled.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Creating the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse model</title><p>The targeting strategy used homologous recombination to replace exons 112–158 (chr2:76,839,202–76,867,333) with the exon numbers from orthologous human titin exons. The 47 targeted exons are all PEVK exons and their location in titin’s I-band region is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>. These exons are not expressed in the main cardiac titin isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>) and a skeletal-muscle-specific effect is expected. The genotype distribution of mice born to heterozygous parents followed Mendelian genetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and homozygous <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice survived without an outwardly noticeable phenotype (oldest mice ~ 1 year). Homozygous <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice had body weights indistinguishable from WT littermates at 60 days of life but as mice grew older a weight reduction appeared with two-way ANOVA measured across all ages revealing a significant effect of genotype on weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice had the same skeleton size, as suggested by their tibia lengths that were the same as that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, a viable mouse model was created that had a normal size but that developed over time a weight deficit. Considering the lack of a weight difference in 60 day old mice, most studies were conducted at this age and with male mice, unless indicated otherwise. Homozygous <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice were studied and experiments were largely focused on the diaphragm, because of its critical importance for the vital respiratory function, and two contrasting peripheral muscles, the slow-twitch soleus, and fast-twitch EDL muscles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40532.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Titin’s I-band region is shown schematically in (A) and the exon composition of the PEVK and flanking region is indicated in B).

It is well known that skeletal muscle titin appears on gels as two bands, a major upper band which is full-length titin (or T1) and a minor lower band (T2) that is a large degradation product that consists mainly of the A-band segment of titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helmes et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscle lysates also revealed T1 and T2 bands but, compared to WT lysates, T1 had a higher mobility in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as expected from the exon deletion (representing a maximum of 181 kDa protein). The mobility of T2 was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), also as expected because T2 of WT mice does not contain the targeted PEVK segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helmes et al., 1996</xref>). In each muscle type, the total titin (T1 +T2) expression level was determined, relative to myosin heavy chain, and the amount of T1 relative to total titin. No differences were found in titin expression in any of the studied muscle types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As titin is known to undergo extensive alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>) it was tested whether in response to deleting exons 112–158, splicing had adapted in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse, by up-or-down-regulating exons outside the targeted area. This could occur but not noticeably alter protein mobility on gels because of their limited resolution in the mega-Dalton protein size range. A RNA sequencing study was performed on diaphragm, EDL and soleus muscles and the percent-spliced-in-index (PSI) was determined for each <italic>Ttn</italic> exon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the diaphragm data and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, EDL and soleus data.

Only minimal differences outside the deleted region were found. In all muscle types, there was only consistent upregulation of Z-disk exons 12 and 13 and PEVK exon 159.

To test this, a whole-body perfusion-fixation study was performed, in which muscles were chemically fixed in a known physiological state and their sarcomere lengths measured ex vivo in dissected muscle strips. Before perfusion, ultrasound imaging was used to measure during the respiration cycle, the diaphragm strain amplitude (fractional shortening of the muscle fibers during inspiration).

This relation has a plateau at sarcomere lengths where thin-thick filament overlap is maximal (thin filament tips are located in the bare-zone of the thick filaments) and at longer sarcomere lengths force is reduced due to partial overlap between thin and thick filaments (descending limb) and at shorter sarcomere lengths force is reduced due to double overlap of titin filaments (ascending limb), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, bottom.

By deleting exons 112–158 from the <italic>Ttn</italic> gene, a mouse model was created in which skeletal muscles express a ~75% shortened PEVK segment (~420 vs~1600 residues). As expected from the much shortened PEVK segment, the passive stiffness of single muscle fibers is greatly increased in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), in line with the prediction based on the reduced PEVK segment extension in stretched sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results support the importance of the PEVK segment in determining the passive stiffness of skeletal muscle fibers.</p><p>Most of the PEVK exons that were deleted are fully expressed in WT skeletal muscle (PSI ~ 100%) but 15 exons are expressed at a reduced level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), 10 have a PSI of ~50% and five exons have a PSI of ~25%. This indicates the presence of multiple splice variants in the samples. In addition to the expected absence of the 47 targeted PEVK exons in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice, only minimal adaptions elsewhere in the titin transcript were found. One adaptation that was consistently detected was in exon 159, immediately downstream from the deleted PEVK region. This exon makes in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice a novel splice junction with exon 112 and as a result exon 159 is upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Exon 159 encodes only 28 PEVK residues and its upregulation will only slightly increase the length of the PEVK segment and minimally lower passive stiffness (this has been accounted for when calculating fractional extensions and sarcomere stiffness). A second consistent adaptation outside the targeted region is the upregulation of the Z-disk exons 12 and 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These exons encode ~45 residue repeats that interact with α-actinin and that are known as Z-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautel et al., 1996</xref>). The <italic>Ttn</italic> gene contains seven Z-repeats that have variable expression levels in different muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Granzier et al., 2007</xref>). It has been proposed that this variable expression of Z-repeats is a means of assembling Z-disks of variable thickness and mechanical strength in different fiber types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sorimachi et al., 1997</xref>). However, considering that there is no fiber type switch in the muscles that were studied in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is unlikely that the upregulation of exons 12 and 13 reflects a change towards fiber types with wider Z-disks. Instead, we propose that the upregulation of exons 12 and 13 is triggered by the increased titin-based tension in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice, in order to mechanically strengthen this critical region of the sarcomere when titin’s stiffness is high. The similar expression patterns of the PEVK exons in the three studied muscle types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) was unexpected, considering the different fiber type composition and functions of the muscle types that were studied (diaphragm, soleus, and EDL). Thus, highly similar splice patterns can exist in distinct muscle types.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Passive muscle stiffness</title><p>Although it is well accepted that titin underlies the passive tension of the skeletal muscle single fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granzier and Wang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granzier and Labeit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 1991</xref>), titin’s contribution to whole muscle stiffness, relative to that of the ECM, is not well established. Our mechanical studies on intact diaphragm, EDL and soleus muscles show that intact muscle passive tensions, of all muscle types studied, are much higher in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings support that titin is a dominant passive tension source, unlike the conclusion drawn from earlier work that the ECM is dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tirrell et al., 2012</xref>). We also dissected the contribution of titin and the ECM to whole muscle passive stiffness using the EDL 5<sup>th</sup> toe muscle, a muscle chosen because it has as a major advantage that it is thin enough for sarcomere length measurement with laser diffraction. The muscles were studied first intact, then following skinning and a final time after KCl/KI extraction. The skinning vs. intact comparison shows that skinning has no effect on passive tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) indicating that the sarcolemma and its direct connections to the ECM do not contribute to passive tension. This result is different from a study on fiber bundles isolated from rabbit muscle where skinning resulted in a 20–40% reduction in tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). It is not immediately obvious why the earlier result on rabbit fiber bundles differs from ours. We speculate that the dissection required to free the fiber bundles from their surrounding (including cutting the ends) made the fiber bundles more vulnerable to skinning. The present work reveals that when using whole intact muscle, skinning does not affect passive tension.</p><p>The KCl/KI extraction that was used in the present work has previously been shown in cardiac muscle to remove titin’s anchors in the sarcomere, thereby rendering titin mechanically inactive but leaving the ECM mechanically unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Granzier and Irving, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). For this extraction method to be useful in skeletal muscle, the extraction needs to fully abolish all of titin’s passive tension, while not affecting that of the ECM. To test whether this was the case, the KCl/KI sensitive tensions of skinned muscles were compared to the measured passive tensions of single fibers that had been mechanically skinned and that were, therefore, devoid of ECM. Identical results were obtained, in both WT and <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This supports that the KCl/KI extraction specifically and fully abolishes titin’s passive tension from whole muscle and that this extraction method is suitable to mechanically differentiate the titin-based passive tension (KCl/KI sensitive) from the ECM-based tension (KCl/KI insensitive). The obtained titin-based passive tension of muscle far exceeds that of the ECM and in the SL range used in this study (~2.2-3.2 µm) is 73 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 4% of total tension in WT and 71 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 6% in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscle. Thus, titin is a dominant source of passive tension in both WT and <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice. The tension-sarcomere length data were also used to determine the average titin and ECM stiffness in the sarcomere length range of 2.45-2.75 μm. This range was selected because it captures most of the physiological sarcomere length range of the muscle types that were studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), as well as that of many other muscle types in a wide range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkholder et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkholder and Lieber, 2001</xref>). The stiffness of titin and ECM were both significantly increased in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> EDL muscle but the titin stiffness far exceeded the ECM stiffness, ~5-fold in WT and ~10-fold in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This does not mean that the ECM is unimportant for longitudinal stiffness. At sarcomere lengths at or beyond the physiological range limit, the ECM stiffness greatly increases and functions as a brake on the movement range of muscle. Within the physiological length range of skeletal muscle, however, titin’s contribution to whole muscle stiffness is dominant. This is analogous to cardiac muscle where titin also dominates within the physiological sarcomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Granzier and Irving, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). An advantage of titin dominating passive stiffness is that this allows for rapid regulation through intracellular signaling mechanisms that post-translationally modify titin’s molecular spring region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hidalgo and Granzier, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Active tension</title><p>In recent work, several novel mechanisms have been proposed in which titin affects the myosin-based active tension. Based on single-molecule studies on titin, it has been proposed that prior to activation, titin’s immunoglobulin (Ig) domains unfold and that upon muscle activation these domains refold, adding to the developed force [26, 42]. Considering the higher passive forces in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscles, this mechanism predicts that unfolding of Ig domains will be more pronounced in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice and that, consequently, the refolding-induced force of titin generated during activation will be higher, adding to the measured tetanic force level. However, the results of the present study (Fig. 6A and B) do not show higher active tensions in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscles. The tetanic tension was measured at L<sub>0</sub>, the experimentally determined length at which active tension is maximal (overlap between thin and thick filament during the tetanic tension plateau is optimal). At L<sub>0</sub>, passive tension is significantly higher in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscles than in WT muscles (for example passive tension in the EDL 5<sup>th</sup> toe muscle is 11.8<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 1.1 compared to 2.5 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.4 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> in WT muscle). Yet active tensions are not different (Fig. 6B). It is possible that the refolding mechanism is not active because passive forces at L<sub>0</sub> are too low, in both genotypes. Perhaps, at longer lengths sufficient levels of unfolding might take place, due to the higher passive tensions, and the mechanism is operational. Presently we conclude that at the macroscopic scale of a whole muscle contracting at L<sub>0</sub>, the titin unfolding/refolding mechanism is unlikely to significantly add to the level of tetanic tension.</p><p>A second recent mechanism by which titin might affect active tension is based on the active state of the thick filament. It is well known that regulation of contraction in striated muscle is thin filament based, but new evidence suggests that the thick filament also has OFF and ON states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piazzesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>). In the OFF state, many of the myosin heads in the thick filament are bent backward towards the center of the sarcomere, by an asymmetric arrangement of the two heads of the myosin molecule that folds the heads against the myosin tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, these heads are unable to interact with actin, that is they are OFF. In the ON state, the myosin heads have moved away from the thick filament surface and have an orientation more perpendicular to the thick filament long axis, permitting interaction with the thin filament and generating force. It has been proposed that the ON state can be promoted by mechanically stressing the thick filament, either through the generation of active tension (by constitutively ON myosin molecules) or by titin-based passive tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piazzesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular spring region of titin spans from near the Z-disk to the tip of the thick filament with the remaining segment of titin spanning along and interacting with the thick filament backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tonino et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, when passive sarcomeres are stretched, titin stresses the thick filament and this promotes the ON state; upon calcium activation, this increased ON state then enhances force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model allows this activation model to be evaluated. Most relevant for the thick filament activation model results at submaximal activation because if titin-based tension sensitizes the system by enhancing the thick filament ON state, a measurable effect on force is most likely to occur under those conditions. However, no genotype effect was detected when examining the frequency required for half-maximal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). An increase in tension was seen in the EDL 5<sup>th</sup> toe muscle at frequencies &lt; 60 Hz (average increase 15.7%) with a two-way ANOVA revealing a significant genotype effect (p&lt;0.001), but this effect was not consistent in other muscle types. Interestingly, the time required to reach half-maximal tension was significantly reduced in all <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscle types, on average by 17.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Because no fiber type switch was found in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) it is unlikely that this increased speed of force development is due to the expression of faster fiber types. Instead, we speculate that this more rapid force development is due to the higher passive tension in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> muscle that increases the thick filament ON state and that this accelerates force generation when a muscle is stimulated. Clearly, more work is required to examine the effect of titin-based tension on force generation of skeletal muscle and the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> model will be useful for this purpose.</p><p>Finally, it has also been reported that the passive stiffness of titin increases in the presence of calcium. The effect is likely due to glutamate rich (E-rich) domains within the PEVK region of titin that have a reduced persistence length in the presence of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labeit et al., 2003</xref>). This gives rise to a 10–20% increase in passive stiffness in the presence of calcium, the level of which varies with the number of E-rich domains that are expressed in the titin isoforms found in different muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labeit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujita et al., 2004</xref>). The calcium sensitivity of E-rich PEVK domains might also contribute to the force enhancement that occurs after an active muscle has been stretched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herzog, 2005</xref>). It is noteworthy that most E-rich PEVK domains that are expressed in skeletal muscle are located in the N-terminal end of the PEVK element that has been deleted in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Granzier et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mouse model will be very useful for future studies of the role of E-rich domains in muscle physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sarcomere length working range</title><p>In all examined muscle types of <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice, a large shift was found in the physiological working range, towards shorter sarcomere lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). That this shift is functionally important can be evaluated by plotting the average passive stiffness of titin in the physiological sarcomere length range. This reveals an identical passive stiffness in the two genotypes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Thus, the adaptation in the physiological sarcomere length range of the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice is remarkably effective at normalizing passive stiffness. This adaptation might explain why exercise performance of <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice is normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The shifted sarcomere length working range is expected to have a minimal impact on active tension development because of the reduced thin filament length that was found in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice that left shifted the force-sarcomere length relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

To our knowledge, our study is the first in which the number of sarcomeres is increased primarily in response to increasing the stiffness of titin without changing muscle length. It is possible that the adaptation in sarcomere number based on lengthening or shortening muscle and the adaptation due to an increased passive stiffness of titin share a common mechanism. The mechano-signaling mechanism identified recently that involves an increased strain on titin’s molecular spring as well as the upregulation of titin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Pijl et al., 2018</xref>) is a good candidate.

A subsequent RNAseq-based expression analysis using WT and <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> Diaphragm, EDL, and soleus muscles did reveal multiple differentially expressed genes, but follow-up protein expression studies did not support their relevance (results not shown). We speculate that the underlying signaling mechanisms that cause longitudinal hypertrophy are only transiently active and that these mechanisms are ‘dialed down’ when the increase in the number of sarcomeres in series has been accomplished (and titin’s strain has been normalized). A transient activation is also suggested by the longitudinal muscle hypertrophy in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice that is independent of age (most muscle types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> show no significant interaction between genotype and age). Clearly, future work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the serial addition of sarcomeres. This work should focus on changes that occur at an early age when the longitudinal growth that increases the number of series sarcomeres is not yet complete.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>Within the physiological sarcomere length range of skeletal muscle, titin is the main determinant of skeletal muscle passive stiffness. Shortening titin’s molecular spring region in <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice results in longitudinal hypertrophy that increases the number of sarcomeres in series and, importantly, that shifts the in vivo sarcomere length working range to shorter lengths where operating passive stiffness is low. The expected negative effect of this shift on active force generation is minimized through shortening of thin filaments. The lowering of passive stiffness through the serial addition of sarcomeres requires multiple major adaptations, indicating that increased passive stiffness is functionally detrimental and has to be avoided. Normalizing function through the addition of ~30% sarcomeres is energetically costly, as suggested by the reduced weight of the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and ultimately might be detrimental.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">gene <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">Titin (Ttn)</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Ensembl: <break/>ENSMUSG00000051747</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">Ttn<sup>∆112-158</sup></td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Deletion of <break/>(GRCm38/mm10) <break/>chr2:76,839,202–76,867,333</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">‘mixed C57BL/6J and <break/>129P2/OlaHsd &quot;</td><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Homologous recombination <break/>in E14TG2a cells (129/Ola <break/>strain, PMID: 3683574).

Sutures were then tied around both tendons of the muscle and the muscle was mounted in a heated bath (30°C) filled with Ringer’s solution with 95%/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled through, with one suture attached to a fixed end and the other to a force transducer/length controller (Aurora Scientific Model 300C-LR-FP). After letting the muscle equilibrate, the muscle was stretched to its optimal length (L<sub>0</sub>) of maximal force output using 20 Hz stimulations. Then a 150 Hz tetanus was performed to tighten the sutures before starting the protocols. First, a passive stretch protocol was performed. The muscle was stretched in steps 5% for the diaphragm, 3.5% for the soleus and 2.5% for the EDL of the muscle’s slack length at 1% per second followed by a 20 s hold to allow for force relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ottenheijm and Granzier, 2010</xref>). For the diaphragm, the muscle was stretched by a total of 50% of muscle length while the EDL and soleus muscles were stretched by 25% and 35%, respectively (The EDL and Soleus have fibers that only run part of the way of the whole muscle, so the fiber length to muscle length ratio has to be considered when estimating sarcomere length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkholder et al., 1994</xref>). The fiber length to muscle length ratios were attained from the whole-body formaldehyde perfusion study (see below). The diaphragm has parallel fibers going from end to end of the muscle and therefore did not need to be adjusted. After allowing the muscle to reach a steady state at the end of the 20 s hold, force was determined.</p><p>Following the passive stretch protocol there is a 7 min waiting period, and then L<sub>0</sub> was reestablished and a force-frequency protocol was performed. The force-frequency protocol involves stimulating the muscle at varying frequencies using electrodes submerged in the bath. From this data, the maximal force produced, the minimal force produced, the time it takes to reach maximal force, the time the muscle takes to relax, and the frequency required to reach ½ of the maximal force can be extrapolated by fitting the force-frequency curve.

The PCSA used for normalizing forces produced by the diaphragm was determined from the width and thickness (determined optically using a calibrated eyepiece) and assuming an elliptical shape of the cross-section of the muscle strip.

Fiber bundles were then dissected and the sarcomere lengths were measured using high-magnification optical microscopy (Aurora Scientific Model 901A HVSL, Model 600A v1.81 Digital Controller). From this sarcomere length, the sarcomere lengths during the passive stretch protocol were determined using the equation: SL + ((%Stretch/100)/fiber length:muscle length ratio) x SL); SL = Sarcomere Length obtained at the slack muscle length.

Prior to starting the protocols, a150Hz tetanus was performed under modest passive tension to settle the preparation. The optimal length for active force generation (L<sub>0</sub>) was determined using 1 Hz twitch stimulations. The muscle length was measured using a calibrated eyepiece and the SL was measured in real time using laser diffraction from a class 3B laser (Milles Griot 25-LHR-991–249). A force frequency protocol was performed as described above. The muscle was then set to slack length and a 30% passive stretch protocol was implemented. The muscle was removed from the setup and skinned overnight in 1% Triton X-100 in relaxing solution(in mM: 40 BES, 10 EGTA, 6.56 MgCl2, 5.88Na-ATP, 46.35 K-propionate, 15 Creatine Phosphate, 1 DTT, 1 E64, 1 Leupeptin, 1.25 PMSF).

The fiber was set to slack length (the shortest length at which passive force first develops) and the diameter and depth of the fiber were measured at four points along the fiber. The cross-sectional area of the fiber was calculated assuming an elliptical shape. The tension was calculated by dividing force with fiber cross-sectional area.

Briefly, Myosin heavy chain isoform composition was visualized using 8% acrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue. MHC type I and IIB are well separated on gels but the IIA overlaps with a small amount of IIX that exists in mouse skeletal muscle. Therefore, we refer to this band as IIA/X.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Formaldehyde perfusion study and ultrasound</title><p>We followed the method explained in Van der Pijl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Pijl et al., 2018</xref>). 60 day old mice were sedated using a ketamine/xylazine cocktail. Once sedated, the mice were cannulated in the left jugular vein that was securely tied off. Using an echo machine, the left costal of the diaphragm was visualized at the height of the vena cava. A B-mode image was recorded to establish strain on the diaphragm. One of the lower limbs of the mouse was fixed in a fully plantar flexed position while the other leg was fixed in a fully dorsiflexed position, taking care not to force the joints into a non-physiological position. Before injection of formaldehyde, hair on the abdomen was removed using NAIR cream (Church and Dwight Co.) and ultrasound data were collected. The probe was put on the abdomen of the mouse at a 45° angle aiming to the thoracic cavity. Standard B-mode images of the diaphragm were obtained and were analyzed using Vevo Strain software (Fujifilm VisualSonics; Toronto, Canada). A single respiration cycle was selected using a reiterated M-mode image. Using a free curve, a 4–5-point region of interest was set in the arching region of the costal diaphragm dome to measure strain. The inferior vena cava was used as a reference point to ensure data was taken from the same area in each mouse.</p><p>After cutting the femoral vein, 3 mL 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected through the cannula at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/s. An M-mode image was collected during diaphragm arrest. After waiting for five additional minutes for the fixation to take place, the whole diaphragm was dissected out while still attached to the ribcage, and the diaphragm with ribcage was placed into a 4% formaldehyde in PBS solution and fixed overnight. The two limbs of the mouse were removed by cutting the limbs at the femur and the entire leg was placed into a 4% formaldehyde in PBS overnight. The diaphragm, both EDLs, and both Soleus muscles were carefully dissected in PBS. The length of the diaphragm fibers of the left costal were measured using a calibrated eyepiece. The left costal was then dissected into small bundles and sarcomere length was measured using laser-diffraction. The EDL and Soleus muscles from both limbs were digested in 15% sulfuric acid for 40 min before fibers were carefully dissected, ensuring full lengths of the fibers were kept intact. The lengths of these fibers were then measured using a calibrated eyepiece. Following this measurement, the sarcomere length of the EDL and Soleus was measured using laser-diffraction. Using the fiber lengths and the total muscle length, a fiber-length to muscle-length ratio was calculated. From the sarcomere length and the fiber lengths, the number of sarcomeres in series was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Free wheel running</title><p>Mice were placed individually in a cage containing a running wheel with no resistance when the mice were 40 days of age. These mice could run voluntarily on the running wheel. Daily exercise values for running distance, time, and speed were collected (Lafayette Instruments Model 80820FS). The mice continued to exercise at will for 40 days. Data measured in 5 day-running intervals starting at day one when the running wheel was presented. The values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> are the average of days 31–35. After 40 days the mice were sacrificed and muscles were harvested and muscle weights collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Metabolic treadmill</title><p>Mice ran on an indirect calorimetry treadmill (TSE Systems). Mice underwent a graded exercise tolerance test until exhaustion using the following parameters (speed, duration, incline grade): (0 m/min, 3 min, 0°), (6 m/min, 2 min, 0°), (9 m/min, 2 min, 5°), (12 m/min, 2 min, 10°), (15 m/min, 2 min, 15°), (18 m/min, 1 min, 15°), (21 m/min, 1 min, 15°), (23 m/min, 1 min, 15°), and (+1 m/min, each 1 min thereafter, 15°). Exhaustion was defined as the point at which mice maintained continuous contact with the shock grid for 5 s or 20 visits to the shock grid in a 1 min period. During testing, gas was collected continuously and analyzed every 5 s. PhenoMaster software (TSE Systems) recorded and calculated oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide consumption (VCO2), the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), distance ran, speed ran, duration, and visits to the shock grid. VO2max was determined by the peak oxygen consumption reached during this test when RER was &gt;1.0. Maximum running speed was defined as the treadmill speed at which VO2max was achieved. Mice failing to reach an RER &gt;1.0 were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Titin protein expression analysis</title><p>Titin isoforms expression was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hidalgo et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, solubilized muscle samples were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels. Each gel was stained with Coomassie blue, scanned, and analyzed densitometrically. The slope of the linear relationship of titin isoforms and MHC was determined to quantify expression ratios. We analyzed separately T1 titin (the full-length molecule), T2 titin (a major titin degradation product) and total titin (T1 and T2 combined). The same protocol was used in order to investigate possible nebulin size changes. For these experiments WT, <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic>, and two samples which contain heterozygous expression of both WT nebulin and a smaller or larger nebulin. The mobility of nebulin in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> samples was compared for the heterozygous nebulin samples to get insight into possible nebulin size changes in the <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM)</title><p>The immunofluorescence experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tonino et al., 2017</xref>). Dissection of muscles was performed mice anesthetized with isoflurane (USP, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. A diaphragm strip from the left costal and the EDL muscle were quickly dissected and skinned in relaxing solution ([in mM]: 40 BES, 10 EGTA, 6.56 MgCl2, 5.88 Na-ATP, 1 DTT, 46.35 K-propionate, 15 creatine phosphate, pH 7.0) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors ([in mM]: 0.01 E64, 0.047 leupeptin and 0.25 PMSF). The diaphragm strip and EDL muscle were skinned overnight at 4°C, washed thoroughly with relaxing solution and stored in 50% glycerol/relaxing solution at −20°C and used within two weeks for experiments. Female mice (n = 4 in each group) aged around 60 days were used in the study. Skinned left costal diaphragm and EDL fiber bundles were embedded in O.C.T compound and immediately frozen in 2-methylbutane precooled in liquid nitrogen. 4 μm thick cryosections were then cut and mounted onto microscope slides. Tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, blocked with 2% BSA and 1% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr at 4°C, and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The primary antibodies included: a chicken polyclonal anti-X105-X106 (N2A) (5.75 μg/mL) (Myomedix), a rabbit polyclonal anti-BK283-BK284 (I84-86) (1 μg/mL) (Myomedix), a mouse monoclonal anti-α-actinin (1:1000) (EA-53, Sigma-Aldrich) antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Tmod4 (1:750) (Proteintech Group). Sections were then washed with PBS for 2 × 30 min and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 3 hr at room temperature. The secondary antibodies included: AlexaFluor-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen), AlexaFluor-568 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250, Invitrogen), AlexaFluor-647 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250, Invitrogen), CF-633 conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY (1:200, Biotium).</p><p>The sections were then washed with PBS for 2 × 15 min and covered with number 1.5H coverslips using ProLong Diamond mounting medium (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). A Zeiss ELYRA S1 SR-SIM microscope was used with UV and solid-state laser (488/561/642 nm) illumination sources, a 100 × oil immersion objective (NA = 1.46), and a sCMOS camera. Typical imaging was performed on a 49.34 × 24.67 μm<sup>2</sup> area with 1280 × 640 pixel dimensions. Image stacks comprising of 40 slices were acquired with 0.101 μm Z-steps, five angles and five phases/angles for each slice. Image reconstruction and fluorescence intensity plot profile generation were performed with ZEN two software (Zeiss). Plot profiles were fitted with Gaussian curves to determine the epitope peak position using Fityk 1.3.0 software. Note that the N2A and I84-86 antibodies do not bind exactly adjacent to the PEVK and this was accounted for by subtracting 15 nm (~4 Ig domains) from the measured values, to determine the extension of the PEVK, z. Thin filament length was determined by measuring the distance between Tmod epitopes across a Z-disk and dividing by two (i.e., the length contains the half Z-disk width.)</p><p>The measured thin filament length and the 1.6 µm thick filament length and 0.15 µm bare-zone width from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sosa et al., 1994</xref>) allows the construction of the force-SL relation in WT and <italic>Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup></italic> diaphragm as follows. Force is maximal along the plateau of the force-sarcomere length relation where the thin filament tip is within the bare-zone of the A-band (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, middle bottom panel). At longer sarcomere lengths where the thin filaments do not reach the bare-zone, the sarcomeres are on the descending limb (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, right bottom) and force decreases linearly with sarcomere length (−69% of maximal force per μm sarcomere length) to reach zero force at the sarcomere length where overlap is zero (two times thin filament length plus thick filament length). Finally, at short sarcomere lengths where the thin filament tip is beyond the edge of the bare zone in the adjacent half sarcomere, sarcomeres are on the ascending limb (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, left bottom) and force increases linearly with sarcomere length. The submaximal force on the ascending limb is due to the force inhibition in the thin filament overlap zone; the magnitude of the slope of the ascending limb is +69% of maximal force per µm sarcomere length.

The contour length (CL) of the PEVK segment was estimated from the number of amino acids contained in the segment (see above) and assuming a random coil structure with a maximal residue spacing of 0.38 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2002b</xref>), the relative extension of the PEVK was calculated as z/CL. The obtained values were used in the wormlike chain (WLC) force equation and the force per titin molecule was determined. The WLC equation: FxPL/k<sub>B</sub>xT = z/CL +1/(4(1 −z/CL)<sup>2</sup>)− 1/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kellermayer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bouchiat et al., 1999</xref>). The WLC model describes the molecule as a deformable continuum of persistence length PL (a measure of bending rigidity); k<sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann’s constant and T is absolute temperature. The PL was taken as 1.4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labeit et al., 2003</xref>). For fitting, we used Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fits of the WLC model (written in IgorPro (Wavemetrics) and KaleidaGraph(Synergy software)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are reported as means ± standard error.

The topic is highly relevant since titin is a main player in the mechanical performance of striated muscle, and because different diseases originate from mutations in the titin gene. Hence, there is a pressing need in the field to understand how the mechanical properties of titin molecules influence the performance of striated muscle. The group has produced before several mouse models in which different segments of titin have been altered. The novelty of the Delta<sup>112-158</sup> model comes from the fact that it involves a massive deletion (46 exons) in the PEVK region of the protein, which is believed to be one of the major contributors to the passive mechanical properties of titin. It is very interesting to examine how mice adapt to such a massive deletion in titin, which the authors do in their manuscript combining several top-notch physiology and molecular biology techniques.</p><p>The authors provide data supporting the expression of shortened titin in the homozygous Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice, both at the RNA and protein levels. Using super-resolution microscopy on muscle preparations and modelling, the authors confirm that Delta<sup>112-158</sup> titin is stiffer than wild-type, as expected. Interestingly, even though higher muscle stiffness is found in Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice, the authors find that mice do well in general terms (including exercise tests). This increased stiffness is found at the level of intact, skinned and KCl/KI-extracted muscle. Indeed, results are in agreement with a prominent role of titin in setting the passive stiffness of skeletal muscle, since the stiffness of Delta<sup>112-158</sup> muscles correlates very well with the increase in titin-based stiffness. Titin-based stiffness is deduced from data obtained after KCl/KI extraction, a method that can potentially affect other muscle components. However, they provide nice supporting data obtained with single fibers, which are naturally devoid of extracellular matrix (Figure 5C). The authors also measured active contraction, and found that Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice develop force faster than wild-type mice, with no difference in the maximal force developed.</p><p>In our opinion the most striking observation is that there are compensatory changes that enable myocytes to adjust to the shortened titin, e.g. reduced sarcomere length working range and shortened thin filaments, which are accompanied by longitudinal hypertrophy at the muscle level. These adaptations probably lead to normal viability and development of Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice.</p><p>Although the characterization of the new model is very thorough already, we believe that there are highly interesting questions to address in the future, such as how is the new sarcomere length working rate set?, how early in development these adjustments occur?, are these adjustments already completed at the embryo stage? It may be interesting also to analyze heterozygous mice to check how myocytes adapt to a titin stiffness imbalance.</p><p>We have some concerns regarding the current version of the manuscript:</p><p>1) It seems that adaptation in sarcomere length working range can lead to equal working stiffness of titin (and muscle) in wild-type and Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice, which would be a very interesting observation. Can the authors compare stiffness at the sarcomere length working range for both wild-type and Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice? The insets in Figures 3C, 4, and 5 are calculated at the same sarcomere lengths, which can be misleading since sarcomere length working ranges are different for both mice.</p><p>2) It is argued in subsection “Active tension” that results with Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice provide evidence against the recently proposed mechanisms of titin folding contributing to active contraction. In our opinion, the arguments raised by the authors do not support this view because they don't take into account the different sarcomere length working ranges (see above). Results in Figure 3C suggest that at the different sarcomere length working ranges (as measured in Figure 7D), both WT and Delta<sup>112-158</sup> titin experience very similar forces and hence the expected rate of folding/unfolding in both cases should be very similar.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>3) The facts that Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice weigh less than wild-type, but have heavier muscles are somehow contradictory. Can the authors provide an explanation? Do Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice have less adipose tissue, less water content, etc? This should be at least discussed and more data provided if already available.</p><p>4) It would be nice to describe in the Materials and methods section how the force-sarcomere length relations were calculated (Figure 10B).</p><p>5) Some techniques employed by the authors are very specialized. Although the Materials and method section is in general very detailed, it may help to show some illustrative raw data in some cases, for instance the kind of images used to calculate CSA.</p><p>6) Subsection “Force-sarcomere length relation”: A-band length instead of width</p><p>7) Subsection “Sarcomeres in series and longitudinal hypertrophy”: what does &quot;interaction between genotype and age&quot; refer to? Consider rephrasing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent and comprehensive evaluation of the changes in muscle structure and function in a genetic model, Ttn<sup>112-158</sup>, of 46 exons deletions in titin's spring region. By shortening titin's spring region, titin became significantly stiffer, and affected passive force (interestingly not active force) in fibers and muscles, and was associated with structural changes (other than just the changes to titin) most remarkably, a shortening of the actin filaments by about 63nm, an increase in fiber lengths, and a vast increase (30%) in serial sarcomeres.</p><p>Some small limitations of the study include that:</p><p>i) titin stiffness was never measured directly, but was obtained indirectly. Titin stiffness or passive force contribution as a function of sarcomere length can be directly obtained in single myofibrils, thus eliminating any concerns of indirect measurements where titin is deleted from muscles/fibers, and skinning may affect (although apparently not in this preparation), the passive forces.</p><p>ii) it has been argued by that titin's stiffness changes/increases upon activation and actin-myosin-based force production. The idea that titin might play a different role in activated muscle compared to passive muscle was not discussed, and with some of the authors having published evidence of a change in titin stiffness with activation/force production/muscle stretch, this might have added to a more complete discussion.</p><p>iii) ranges of sarcomere excursions in muscles were derived from fixed (passive) specimens. It is accepted that depending on the muscle and the length of the muscle, fibers and average sarcomere lengths decrease between 5-30% in active compared to passive muscles. If we assume that the Ttn<sup>112-158</sup> muscles have greater passive stiffness, then shortening of sarcomeres in these muscles upon activation might be less than for the wild-type muscles. Therefore, the sarcomere excursions between the Ttn<sup>112-158</sup> and WT muscles might be closer during active force production than the passive results suggest.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>The only minor comment I have is regarding a statement in the Introduction section. Here it is said that: &quot;…. and in cerebral palsy patients, titin-based passive stiffness is increased several fold [22, 23]&quot;. Reference 22 is not dealing with cerebral palsy, and reference 23 has just one reference to cerebral palsy (Friden and Lieber, 2003). Measurements in that study were performed in single fibers of patients with cerebral palsy, and they found that the elastic modulus of the passive fibers was doubled compared to control. However, fibers do not only give titin stiffness and passive force contributions but an unknown amount of passive force can also come from other sources, which is hard to control and estimate in single fibers.</p><p>We just performed a study on single myofibrils from spastic muscles of patients with cerebral palsy and found that single myofibril passive forces (at given sarcomere lengths) and stiffness (at given sarcomere lengths) were about 50% smaller than those of corresponding myofibrils from control subjects. These passive forces are exclusively due to titin in myofibrils. Measuring titin molecular mass, we did not find a difference between the control and cerebral palsy samples. However, when quantifying the amount of titin, we found that the amount of titin was reduced by about 50% in the samples from the cerebral palsy patients compared to control. Unfortunately, our study is still in the review process, and thus does not need to be considered here. But likely, titin-based stiffness, as directly assessed by us, rather than the indirect methods used by Friden and Lieber, 2003, seems much less in patients with cerebral palsy than controls because of a reduction in the amount of titin.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>There is no need (from my point of view) to add additional files and/or to change any of the statistical approaches. They seem perfectly appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Granzier and colleagues have a long history of designing and characterizing mouse models in which the titin gene has been altered. The phenomenology that emerges from their work is useful in our budding attempts to understand how titin is integrated into the structure of muscle. Their previous models have included deletion of the elastic N2B segment from myofibrils, M-line domains, splicing factors responsible for regulating titin length, and a piece of the PEVK segment. This last paper (&quot;Truncation of titin's elastic PEVK region leads to cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction&quot;, Circulation Research, 2009) identified a marked cardiac phenotype and also established that titin was the principal source of muscle elasticity and not its collagen sheath. In the current work, by removing more exons to truncate the PEVK segment by 1180 amino acids, they get new phenotypes, this time in skeletal muscles. While deletion of the C-terminal exons of the PEVK segment (exons 219-225) resulted in a diastolic dysfunction phenotype with increased titin based passive tension (Circ Res, 2009), deletion of the N-terminal PEVK segment here (exons 112-158) caused a very different phenotype where they now observe a shift in several different muscle types, to shorter sarcomere length, shorter thin filaments, and longitudinal hypertrophy where an increased number of sarcomeres spans the same muscle length. It is likely that these adaptations result from a homeostatic change aimed at keeping the mean force per titin at a constant working value. This can be easily pictured by drawing a horizontal line, say at 5 pN, in both panels of Figure 3C and finding the intercepts with the WT and TtnD122-158 mice. It is clear then that to keep the titin working force at the same set-point, the mutant mouse has to work at sarcomere lengths that are shorter by about 0.5 micrometers which is exactly what the authors observe in vivo.</p><p>Why is it that the organism places such a premium on keeping the force per titin at a constant value? A likely explanation can be found in Rivas-Pardo et al., 2016 and Eckels et al., 2018 who proposed that titin folding plays a role both in muscle elasticity and contraction. This theory demands that titin operates precisely over a range of forces that straddles the folding probability of the titin Ig domains (~4-8 pN): If the force is too high (&gt;12 pN), folding never occurs, and if it is too low titin is always folded (&lt; 3 pN). In either case, titin folding would not play a role. By contrast, if titin operates in vivo at forces that are on average in the middle of the Ig domain folding probability curve, say ~5-6 pN, then muscle tissue can take advantage of the storage and release of elastic energy that takes place with Ig domain folding. If this were true, muscle physiology would place a high premium on getting titin to operate over a tight range of forces. Indeed, Rivas-Pardo et al., predicted that the optimal sarcomere length in vivo would closely track this fundamental requirement adjusting widely amongst different muscle types, tracking their alternatively spliced differences in stiffness (Figures 5C and 5D in Rivas Pardo et al., 2016).</p><p>Unwittingly, the current work by Granzier and colleagues lends strong support to this hypothesis. How the titin operating force is transduced into such large scale adaptations is a work in progress. However, we do know that titin has a force sensor at its C-terminus end (Mayans Nature 1998, Lange Science 2005) and that undergoes force-induced structural changes to activate downstream pathways of gene expression, presumably as a feedback mechanism to control the operating force range. Thus, a coherent view emerges, where a high premium is placed by the organism on exactly controlling the operating force of titin molecules; this has the signature of protein folding under force.</p><p>More excitingly, the current work offers an approach for a definitive test of this theory. If all the Ig domains of the proximal I band region were replaced by PEVK segments -while maintaining the same molecular weight-, then titin would be converted into a mostly passive entropic spring. The kinase control would adjust the sarcomere length to restore the correct operating force in all muscles, and the sarcomere would become longer to achieve the correct resting tension per titin, however, there would be no Ig domain folding/unfolding reactions. If under these conditions the peak contractile force remains unchanged, then the mechanical power developed by Ig domain folding plays no role in muscle contraction. However, If Ig domain folding is crucial for muscle contraction, then obviously the peak force would be greatly diminished by the removal of the Ig domains and the experiments would validate the hypothesis. As they stand, the current experiments do not answer this question. Given that the authors have removed only the elastomeric PEVK segment but left the Ig domains intact, the Ig folding mechanisms remains a viable theory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40532.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors deleted an extremely large stretch of titin that is believed to be responsible for passive elasticity, and mice with that deletion indeed turn out to have a reduction in passive stiffness.

We selected this muscle type because its sarcomere length can be directly measured with laser diffraction, making the requested comparison relatively straightforward. We evaluated the titin-based stiffness in whole muscle (KCl/KI sensitive tension of skinned whole muscle) and in single fibers. The two genotypes were compared at the same sarcomere length range and, importantly, at their experimentally determined physiological sarcomere length working range. At the same sarcomere length range, average passive stiffness is much higher in the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>EDL muscles (Figure 7A) but at their physiological sarcomere length ranges, stiffness in the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>EDL muscle is identical to that of WT muscle (newly added Figure 7B). Thus, the shift in the sarcomere length working range of the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup> mice (towards shorter lengths) is remarkably effective in normalizing passive stiffness. We highlighted this new result in the revised manuscript, subsection “Sarcomere length working range”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is argued in subsection “Active tension” that results with Delta<sup>112-158</sup> mice provide evidence against the recently proposed mechanisms of titin folding contributing to active contraction.

Results in Figure 3C suggest that at the different sarcomere length working ranges (as measured in Figure 7D), both WT and Delta<sup>112-158</sup> titin experience very similar forces and hence the expected rate of folding/unfolding in both cases should be very similar.</p></disp-quote><p>Active tensions were not measured at their physiological sarcomere lengths as this would likely result in the two genotypes demonstrating a tetanic force difference due to unequal overlap between thin and thick filaments. Instead, tetanic force was measured at L<sub>0</sub>, i.e., the optimal muscle length for tetanic force generation (L<sub>0</sub> is commonly used as a reference length in intact muscle experiments as it results in tetanic force generation at optimal overlap between thin and thick filaments). The passive tension level at L<sub>0</sub> was higher in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup> muscle, for example in the EDL 5th toe muscle passive tension was 11.8 ± 1.1 (n=9) compared to 2.5 ± 0.4 mN/mm2 (n=9) in WT muscle. The higher passive tension in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup> muscle relative to WT muscle is expected to cause a higher degree of unfolding prior to activation. As a result, internal sarcomere shortening occurring during the tetanus (see also below) is expected to cause a higher degree of refolding in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup> muscle and, according to the recently proposed titin refolding mechanism, tetanic tension is expected to be higher in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup> muscle. Yet measured active tensions are not different (Figure 6A and B). In the revised manuscript we expanded our discussion of this issue that you raised, including highlighting that our conclusions only apply to force measurements at L<sub>0</sub>.

For the EDL and soleus muscles, we calculated the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle using the measured muscle mass, muscle length, the pennation angle of the fibers, and the fiber length to muscle length ratio (this is not needed for the diaphragm because fibers run parallel and from end-to-end of the muscle strip). The PCSA of the EDL and soleus were calculated using the following equation: PCSA(cm2)=musclemassg*cos⁡θ⁡ρgcm-3*fiberlengthcm (Lieber and Ward, 2011; θ is the pennation angle and ρ is the physiological density of muscle).

The muscle weight data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA with age and genotype as factors. This revealed that in most muscle types both genotype and age had a significant effect on muscle weight (i.e., muscles were hypertrophied in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>mice and hypertrophy increased with age). Two-way ANOVA analysis also reveals the interaction between the factors that are evaluated, which is of interest as it will reveal whether hypertrophy in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>mice is progressive (which is what we initially expected), or is independent of age. For most muscle types we found no significant interaction, indicating that age similarly affected WT and Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>muscle weights.

It is accepted that depending on the muscle and the length of the muscle, fibers and average sarcomere lengths decrease between 5-30% in active compared to passive muscles. If we assume that the Ttn<sup>112-158</sup> muscles have greater passive stiffness, then shortening of sarcomeres in these muscles upon activation might be less than for the wild-type muscles. Therefore, the sarcomere excursions between the Ttn<sup>112-158</sup> and WT muscles might be closer during active force production than the passive results suggest.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous work on single muscle fibers we controlled sarcomere length using a feedback system and prevented sarcomere shortening during contraction. Unfortunately sarcomere length control has not been achieved at the whole muscle level, due to, for example, the sarcomere length signal that is too noisy. Instead we limited series compliance bytying muscles to the force transducer very close to their tendon insertions. In the EDL 5<sup>th</sup> toe muscle we were able to follow sarcomere length during activation in some muscles. Minimal internal shortening was observed (typically ~5-10% ) without an indication that internal shortening was less in the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>muscles. It is also relevant to note that the sarcomere length range of the diaphragm was based on a strain analysis on contracting muscle, using ultrasound imaging (Figure 7A). This revealed that the diaphragm strain amplitude (fractional shortening of the muscle fibers during contraction) did not vary between Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>and WT mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>The only minor comment I have is regarding a statement in the Introduction section. Here it is said that: &quot;…. and in cerebral palsy patients, titin-based passive stiffness is increased several fold [22, 23]&quot;. Reference 22 is not dealing with cerebral palsy, and reference 23 has just one reference to cerebral palsy (Friden and Lieber, 2003). Measurements in that study were performed in single fibers of patients with cerebral palsy, and they found that the elastic modulus of the passive fibers was doubled compared to control. However, fibers do not only give titin stiffness and passive force contributions but an unknown amount of passive force can also come from other sources, which is hard to control and estimate in single fibers.</p><p>We just performed a study on single myofibrils from spastic muscles of patients with cerebral palsy and found that single myofibril passive forces (at given sarcomere lengths) and stiffness (at given sarcomere lengths) were about 50% smaller than those of corresponding myofibrils from control subjects. These passive forces are exclusively due to titin in myofibrils. Measuring titin molecular mass, we did not find a difference between the control and cerebral palsy samples. However, when quantifying the amount of titin, we found that the amount of titin was reduced by about 50% in the samples from the cerebral palsy patients compared to control. Unfortunately, our study is still in the review process, and thus does not need to be considered here. But likely, titin-based stiffness, as directly assessed by us, rather than the indirect methods used by Friden and Lieber, 2003, seems much less in patients with cerebral palsy than controls because of a reduction in the amount of titin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.Citations 22 and 23 referred back to both FSHD and cerebral palsy and to avoid confusion we have now moved citation 22 immediately after the FSHD discussion. We have also softened our statement with respect to titin in cerebral palsy. See revised Introduction section. The work that you discussed is interesting and we look forward to learning more about it and including it in our discussions of future papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>There is no need (from my point of view) to add additional files and/or to change any of the statistical approaches.

It is likely that these adaptations result from a homeostatic change aimed at keeping the mean force per titin at a constant working value. This can be easily pictured by drawing a horizontal line, say at 5 pN, in both panels of Figure 3C and finding the intercepts with the WT and TtnD122-158 mice. It is clear then that to keep the titin working force at the same set-point, the mutant mouse has to work at sarcomere lengths that are shorter by about 0.5 micrometers which is exactly what the authors observe</italic> in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript and your thoughtful and constructive comments. We would like to briefly highlight that most of the previous models were created in order to study the role of titin in the heart, for example the model in which exon 49 was deleted is a cardiac-specific model that does not affect skeletal muscle titins (exon 49 is not included in skeletal muscle titin). In contrast, the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>mouse model is the first model with an expected skeletal muscle specific phenotype as the targeted exons are not expressed in the main cardiac isoform (the N2B titin isoform).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Why is it that the organism places such a premium on keeping the force per titin at a constant value? A likely explanation can be found in Rivas-Pardo et al., 2016 and Eckels et al., 2018 who proposed that titin folding plays a role both in muscle elasticity and contraction. This theory demands that titin operates precisely over a range of forces that straddles the folding probability of the titin Ig domains (~4-8 pN): If the force is too high (&gt;12 pN), folding never occurs, and if it is too low titin is always folded (&lt; 3 pN). In either case, titin folding would not play a role. By contrast, if titin operates</italic> in vivo <italic>at forces that are on average in the middle of the Ig domain folding probability curve, say ~5-6 pN, then muscle tissue can take advantage of the storage and release of elastic energy that takes place with Ig domain folding. If this were true, muscle physiology would place a high premium on getting titin to operate over a tight range of forces. Indeed, Rivas-Pardo et al., predicted that the optimal sarcomere length</italic> in vivo would closely track this fundamental requirement adjusting widely amongst different muscle types, tracking their alternatively spliced differences in stiffness (Figures 5C and 5D in Rivas Pardo et al., 2016).</p><p>Unwittingly, the current work by Granzier and colleagues lends strong support to this hypothesis. How the titin operating force is transduced into such large scale adaptations is a work in progress. However, we do know that titin has a force sensor at its C-terminus end (Mayans Nature 1998, Lange Science 2005) and that undergoes force-induced structural changes to activate downstream pathways of gene expression, presumably as a feedback mechanism to control the operating force range. Thus, a coherent view emerges, where a high premium is placed by the organism on exactly controlling the operating force of titin molecules; this has the signature of protein folding under force.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the adaptation in the sarcomere length working range in the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>model is striking and that as a consequence the operating force levels per titin molecule are normalized. As per Figure 3C and 7D the operating force levels per titin molecule are in both WT and in Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>mice below ~3 pN, possibly explaining why the folding mechanism does not augment tetanic tension (see above). It is worth noting that when tetanizing skeletal muscle on the descending limb (lengths in excess of L<sub>0</sub> and with passive tension towards the limit of the physiological range), tetanic tension exceeds the level expected based on the degree of overlap between thin and thick filaments (this is best seen in the work of ter Keurs, Iwazumi and Pollack, <italic>J Gen Physiol.</italic> 1978;72(4):565-92). Perhaps the titin folding mechanism plays a role under those conditions, a notion consistent with the finding that when maintaining sarcomere length constant during tetanic contractions on the descending limb (using a sarcomere length feedback system), the tetanic tensions are reduced and are as expected from the degree of overlap between thin and thick filaments (e.g., Granzier and Pollack, <italic>J Physiol</italic>. 1990 Feb;421:595-615.) In our revised manuscript we discuss the topic that you raised, see subsection “Active tension”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More excitingly, the current work offers an approach for a definitive test of this theory. If all the Ig domains of the proximal I band region were replaced by PEVK segments -while maintaining the same molecular weight-, then titin would be converted into a mostly passive entropic spring. The kinase control would adjust the sarcomere length to restore the correct operating force in all muscles, and the sarcomere would become longer to achieve the correct resting tension per titin, however, there would be no Ig domain folding/unfolding reactions. If under these conditions the peak contractile force remains unchanged, then the mechanical power developed by Ig domain folding plays no role in muscle contraction. However, If Ig domain folding is crucial for muscle contraction, then obviously the peak force would be greatly diminished by the removal of the Ig domains and the experiments would validate the hypothesis. As they stand, the current experiments do not answer this question. Given that the authors have removed only the elastomeric PEVK segment but left the Ig domains intact, the Ig folding mechanisms remains a viable theory.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thought-provoking comments.Unfortunately, the mouse model that you describe would be extremely difficult to make due to the extreme size of the targeted region (~80 kb), which far exceeds what is currently possible with either CRISPR-Cas9 or homologous recombination techniques. Additionally the Ig domains of the proximal tandem Ig are not continuous but have intermingled several novel exons, as well as the cardiac-specific N2B exon 49 (see Bang et al., 2001). Thus, multiple models would have to be made in which different regions of the proximal tandem Ig would have to be targeted sequentially. Presently we can conclude from the Ttn<sup>Δ112-158</sup>model that making titin stiffer does not alter the maximal tetanic force at the optimal muscle length (L<sub>0</sub>). However, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the Ig folding mechanism contributes to active tension at lengths longer than L<sub>0</sub> where the forces on titin are higher and unfolding during stretch and refolding during contraction might be more prominent. In the revised manuscript we address this possibility. Please see subsection “Active tension”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
