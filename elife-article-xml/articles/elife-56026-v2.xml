During cell division, the centromere binds to a specialized protein complex known as the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>). Most centromeres are regional, sequence-independent, and defined by the replacement of the canonical histone H3 by the histone homolog CENP-A (CenH3 or Cse4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henikoff and Furuyama, 2010</xref>). In humans, centromeres contain higher-order α-satellite DNA arrays that span 0.1 to 4.8 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNulty and Sullivan, 2018</xref>), which is in contrast to most fungal centromeres, which contain transposable elements and repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman and Freitag, 2017</xref>). Fungal regional centromeres range from the small centromeres of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, (the CENP-A enriched regions range from 2 to 3.3 kb and are located in 4 to 18 kb open-reading frame ORF-free regions), to the large regional centromeres described in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, (which range from 174 to 287 kb and consist mainly of truncated transposable elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanyal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to mice, some fungi have pericentric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guenatri et al., 2004</xref>). The most prominent examples are the centromeres of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> which have a CENP-A-enriched region comprised of a central core flanked by heterochromatic pericentric regions divided into ﻿outer and inner repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>). Budding yeast have sequence-dependent centromeres, which are short and have a conserved organization with three centromere DNA elements (consensus DNA elements (CDEs) I-III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). However, the budding yeast ﻿<italic>Naumovozyma castellii</italic> has unique consensus DNA elements that differ from those of other budding yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Infrequently, centromeres can be spontaneously inactivated, resulting in neocentromere formation (i.e., evolutionary new centromeres) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ventura et al., 2007</xref>). Neocentromere formation can occur either while the native centromeric sequence is still present on the chromosome or when the native centromere has been mutated or deleted (e.g., from chromosomal rearrangements or γ irradiation damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrack and Berman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tolomeo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ventura et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, several studies have described neocentromere formation after deletion of native centromeres by molecular genetic engineering in fungi, chickens, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). In some organisms, the formation of neocentromeres can be deleterious, leading to disease, cancer, or infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrack and Berman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garsed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nergadze et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scott and Sullivan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Warburton, 2004</xref>). For example, human neocentromeres are often identified in liposarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garsed et al., 2014</xref>). However, neocentromere formation also can be beneficial, leading to speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ventura et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Fungal neocentromeres are well described in the diploid yeast <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the haploid fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thakur and Sanyal, 2013</xref>). Deletion of <italic>C. albicans</italic> native centromere 5 or 7 has been shown to induce neocentromere formation and does not result in chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thakur and Sanyal, 2013</xref>). In these cases, neocentromeres conferred chromosomal stability similar to the native centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of a native centromere in <italic>S. pombe</italic> led to either neocentromere formation or chromosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohno et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> neocentromeres formed in telomere-proximal regions near heterochromatin, and neocentromere organization featured a CENP-A-enriched core domain and heterochromatin at the subtelomeric (distal) side. Interestingly, neocentromere formation occurred at the same regions in both wild-type and heterochromatin-deficient strains, suggesting that heterochromatin is dispensable for neocentromere formation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, although the rate of survival by chromosome fusion was significantly increased in heterochromatin-deficient mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of kinetochore proteins (<italic>mhf1</italic>∆ and <italic>mhf2</italic>∆) led to a shift of CENP-A binding, resulting in a CENP-A-enriched region directly adjacent to the native centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and He, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In some cases, neocentromeres span genes that are silenced, such as the neocentromeres in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However the mechanisms that mediate silencing of neocentromeric genes are unknown in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> as proteins that are necessary for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in other species (﻿HP1, Clr4, and DNA methyltransferase) are absent in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketel et al., 2009</xref>). Neocentromeres of <italic>S. pombe</italic> can also span genes. These genes are upregulated during nitrogen starvation and expressed at low levels during stationary growth in wild-type cells, but are silenced under all conditions tested when spanned by neocentromeres. In addition to neocentromeric genes, genes located within native centromeres have been identified in other fungi as well as rice and chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the centromeres of the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> were characterized and compared to those of the closely related species <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (centromeres ranging from 27 to 64 kb), revealing dramatically smaller centromeres in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> (ranging from 8.7 to 21 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janbon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is responsible for an ongoing cryptococcosis outbreak in the Pacific Northwest regions of Canada and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to the sister species <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> commonly infects immunocompetent patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is a haploid ﻿basidiomycetous fungus with 14 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Souza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). The dramatic reduction in centromere size in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> may be attributable to loss of the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). The centromeres of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> consist of truncated transposable elements, and active transposable elements are missing throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). This is in stark contrast to <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> which has active transposable elements in centromeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumesic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janbon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Neocentromeres are frequently formed near genomic repeats, yet <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> lacks active transposons that might seed neocentromere formation. Thus, <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is a unique organism in which to study centromere structure and function. To elucidate centromeric organization, the native centromeres of chromosomes 10 and 9 were deleted, leading to characterization of the first neocentromeres in the <italic>Basidiomycota</italic> phylum of the fungal kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of centromere 9 and 10 results in neocentromere formation</title><p>To determine if neocentromere formation occurs in the <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> reference strain R265, either centromere 9 or 10 was deleted. Centromere 9 (<italic>CEN9</italic>) was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated transformation. Two guide RNAs flanking the centromere were used and <italic>CEN9</italic> was replaced with a <italic>NAT</italic> dominant drug-resistance gene by homologous recombination. Biolistic transformation was used to replace centromere 10 (<italic>CEN10</italic>) with either the <italic>NAT</italic> or <italic>NEO</italic> dominant drug-resistance gene via homologous recombination. Viable transformants with the correct integration and deletion were obtained and confirmed by 5’ junction, 3’ junction, loss of deleted regions, and spanning PCRs as well as Southern blot analysis for <italic>cen10</italic>∆ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In comparison, deletion of nonessential genes by homologous recombination in the <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> R265 strain typically results in ~100 colonies with a high success rate (~80–90% homologous integration). We estimate that the likelihood of deleting a centromere and recovering a viable colony is at least 1000-fold lower than would be expected from the deletion of a non-essential gene.

The GC content of neocentromeres is similar to the overall GC content of chromosome 9 and 10, whereas the native centromere has a lower GC content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Comparing the reference genome with de novo genome assemblies of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic>, <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-B</italic>, and <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-E</italic> confirmed that transposable elements did not enter these genomic regions during neocentromere formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

One gene was completely covered by CENP-A and this gene encodes a transglycosylase SLT domain-containing protein. The two other genes (a gene encoding a xylosylphosphotransferase and a gene encoding glutamate synthase (NADPH/NADH)) were partially covered with CENP-A. Mutant <italic>cen9</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic> had a 3.87 kb long neocentromere located 26 kb 3’ to the native centromere and spanned two genes. The first gene was completely spanned by CENP-A and encodes an ESCRT-II complex subunit (Vps25) protein. The second gene was only partially covered and encodes an iron regulator protein. The neocentromere of <italic>cen9</italic>∆<italic>-D</italic> was located directly to the left of the native centromere and was 4.37 kb in length. This neocentromere spanned two genes, coding for a hypothetical protein (92% covered by CENP-A) and a gene encoding for Derlin-2/3 that was completely covered by CENP-A. Lastly, the neocentromere of mutant <italic>cen9</italic>∆<italic>-F</italic> was 3.83 kb in length and spanned one gene (encoding a xylosylphosphotransferase, <italic>XPT1</italic>), which was completely covered by CENP-A.

In addition to the gene encoding CENP-C, the CENP-A-enriched region spanned a hypothetical protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The primary CENP-A-enriched region of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic> and <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-C</italic> spanned a gene encoding a serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A activator 2 (<italic>RRD2</italic>) and a hypothetical protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This neocentromere spanned 2.85 kb and was located closer to the native <italic>CEN10</italic> (21 kb from the native centromere) than the neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>∆-B and the secondary CENP-A peak of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic> and <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-C</italic>. The neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-D</italic> was the smallest neocentromere (2.5 kb) and partially (88.4%) spanned a gene encoding a Ser/Thr protein kinase and formed 7.4 kb from the location of the native <italic>CEN10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-E</italic> spanned two hypothetical proteins, was 4.38 kb in length and was located directly adjacent to the right telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Mutant <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-F</italic> had a neocentromere of 2.64 kb, which spanned one hypothetical gene completely and two genes (hypothetical and a hexokinase (<italic>HXK1</italic>)) partially; the neocentromere formed at a chromosomal location 20 kb 5’ of the native centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-G</italic> was the largest neocentromere with a CENP-A-enriched region of 7.97 kb, and was in fact larger than the native <italic>CEN10</italic>. This neocentromere spanned four genes, including a gene coding for a high osmolarity protein (Sho1) and three genes coding for hypothetical proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To test if the kinetochore was binding to the CENP-A-enriched regions of chromosomes 9 and 10, and to validate if the neocentromeres were fully functional as centromeres, two additional kinetochore proteins were epitope-tagged with GFP. <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants were transformed with an overlap PCR product expressing <italic>CENPC-GFP</italic>. As the neocentromeres of three <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants spanned the gene encoding CENP-C, all <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants were transformed with an overlap PCR product, expressing Mis12-GFP. In addition to the <italic>cen9</italic>∆ and <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants, the wild type was transformed with constructs expressing Mis12-GFP and CENP-C-GFP, and these served as controls. ChIP-qPCRs for <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants, <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants, and wild-type strains with Mis12-GFP or CENP-C-GFP were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Because Mis12 is an outer kinetochore protein, the formaldehyde cross-linking was extended to 45 min (15 min was used for CENP-A and CENP-C) for this protein. For all qPCR analyses, the native centromere 6 <italic>CEN6</italic>) was used as an internal control and for each neocentromere specific primer pairs were designed. For <italic>cen9</italic>∆ and <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants a similar level of Mis12 or CENP-C enrichment at the neocentromeres and (<italic>CEN6</italic>) was observed. This suggested that the CENP-A-enriched regions of chromosome 9 of the <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants and chromosome 10 of <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants identified by ChIP-seq were functional centromeres and indeed neocentromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Previously generated RNA sequence data were remapped to the <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> reference strain R265 and analyzed to determine if the regions where neocentromeres formed in the <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants were transcribed in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). In the wild-type strain, all genes spanned by neocentromeres in the <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the expression levels of the neocentromeric genes were lower than their neighboring genes. For example, the expression level of the gene (CNBG_5686) flanking native centromere 9 was three times higher than the genes spanned by neocentromeres in <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The same trend was observed in the <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants. Here, the expression level of the gene (CNBG_4365) 3’ flanking the neocentromere (primary CENP-A peak) of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic> and <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-C</italic> was more than six times higher than the genes spanned by the neocentromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Also, the neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-D</italic> is flanked by genes whose expression was two times higher than the genes spanned by the neocentromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests that neocentromeres are formed in chromosomal regions with lower gene expression in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic>. The majority of the genes (24/28) flanking native centromeres are transcribed in the direction towards the native centromere. All of the neocentromeres observed span one or more genes and most of the flanking genes are transcribed in the direction away from the neocentromere.</p><p>The expression levels of the neocentromeric genes in <italic>cen9</italic>∆ and <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants were assayed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The neocentromeric genes of chromosome 9 were normalized to actin.

PFGE analysis suggested that this fragment was duplicated on chromosome 10, resulting in a larger chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast to the other fused chromosomes, this chromosomal fragment did not fuse to a chromosome with a native centromere, and the fact that the mutant still exhibited a fitness defect was consistent with this interpretation. The larger chromosome was euploid, suggesting that the unstable neocentromere(s), rather than causing aneuploidy, resulted in a fitness cost in this isolate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Composition of neocentromeres in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic></title><p>The native centromeres of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> are found in repetitive regions and are flanked by, but do not contain, protein-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>).

Our results suggest that neocentromeres form by mechanisms that do not rely on nearby transposable elements/repeats to initiate de novo centromere assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neocentromeric genes are expressed</title><p>Neocentromeres induced in several species can span genes, resulting in silencing or reduced gene expression. For example, all genes within five independent neocentromeres in <italic>C. albicans</italic> that spanned nine genes were suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrack et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> neocentromeres span genes that are only expressed in response to nitrogen starvation in the wild-type strain, and neocentromere formation silences these genes during nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>). The native centromere 8 of rice contains an approximately 750 kb CENP-A-enriched region with four genes that are expressed in both leaf and root tissues of three closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagaki et al., 2004</xref>). Neocentromeres of rice span genes that are expressed at similar levels as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Chicken neocentromeres have been induced on chromosome Z or 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). Chromosome Z neocentromeres span eight genes, but in wild-type cells only <italic>MAMDC2</italic> is expressed during normal growth. The other seven genes were either not expressed at any detectable level in all tested developmental stages or were only expressed during early embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). When a neocentromere formed, expression of the MAMDC2-encoding gene was reduced 20- to 100-fold. Chromosome 5 of chickens is diploid, and neocentromeres on this chromosome span genes that are expressed. The hypothesis behind this phenomenon is that one allele functions as a centromere, while the other allele codes for the genes.</p><p>Because the <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> were aneuploid, the expression of genes spanned by chromosome 10 neocentromeres was normalized to expression levels of a housekeeping gene located on chromosome 10. The expression of genes enriched for CENP-A chromatin is similar to that of wild type, and if the allelic hypothesis, like in chickens, were valid, the expectation would be a 60% reduction in expression levels. The genes spanned by neocentromeres of <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants are also expressed at wild-type levels. As the <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants have uniform, wild-type colony sizes, the ploidy levels of these mutants were not tested and we hypothesize that these mutants are haploid/euploid.</p><p>Genes contained in regions in which <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> neocentromeres formed in <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants were actively expressed in the wild-type strain, and this is similar to human neocentromeres that can form in regions with or without gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall et al., 2008</xref>). However, we have identified chromosomal regions that lack gene expression on chromosomes 9 and 10, although these regions were not close to the native centromere.</p><p>Of the <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> genes spanned by the neocentromere region, one encodes the kinetochore component CENP-C. Several independent biolistic transformations were performed to delete the gene encoding CENP-C, but all attempts were unsuccessful. This suggests that <italic>CENPC</italic> is an essential gene. In fission yeast, deletion of the gene encoding the CENP-C homolog <italic>Cnp3</italic> was lethal at 36°C, but mutants were still viable at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suma et al., 2018</xref>). However, CENP-A was mislocalized in the <italic>cnp3</italic>∆ mutants. Another gene partially located inside a <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> neocentromere encodes the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A activator 2 (<italic>RRD2</italic>).

First, neocentromere formation could lead to a dicentric chromosome 10 in which the centromeres may differ in functional capacity. Dicentric chromosomes are not by definition unstable, for example the dominant-negative mutation of the mammalian telomere protein TRF2 results in chromosome fusions, leading to the formation of dicentric chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stimpson et al., 2010</xref>). The formation of dicentric chromosomes occurred in 97% of the fused mammalian chromosomes, which were stable for ﻿at least 180 cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stimpson et al., 2010</xref>). Several microscopic studies showed that chromosomes with two regions of centromere-protein enrichment are stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higgins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stimpson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stimpson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sullivan and Willard, 1998</xref>). This suggests that a dineocentric chromosome 10 could be stable in the population. Second, the two CENP-A-enriched peaks could be the result of a mixed population and either due to an unstable primary neocentromere and/or aneuploidy. The primary neocentromere could be associated with the majority of the cells, whereas the secondary CENP-A peak would be only found in a small number of cells (and the primary neocentromere is lost in these isolates). This is reflected by lower CENP-A enrichment for the secondary peak, and the hypothesis of putative dicentrics is due to a mixture of alleles in the population. Third, the neocentromeres could be unstable, which could lead to the formation of two CENP-A-enriched regions with centromere function switching between the regions. However, our data would argue against this latter model. Prior to the ChIP-seq analysis of the <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants, colonies were isolated by streak purification (eight times), suggesting that the presence of two distinct CENP-A peaks occurs continuously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants are partially aneuploid</title><p>Neocentromere formation in chickens results in a low number of aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). Based on whole-genome sequencing of a population of cells, the <italic>C. deuterogattii cen10</italic>∆ isolates are partially aneuploid for chromosome 10. For fully aneuploid isolates, the coverage of Illumina reads is expected to be 2-fold; the <italic>cen10</italic>∆ isolates with two CENP-A peaks showed aneuploidy levels up to 1.28-fold or were even euploid.

Compared to other great apes, humans have a reduced karyotype, which is due to the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes that resulted in chromosome 2 in modern humans, Denisovans, and Neanderthals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miga, 2017</xref>). Human chromosome2 still harbors signatures of telomeric repeats at the fusion point (interstitial telomeric sequences [ITS]), suggesting that this chromosome is derived from a telomere-telomere fusion. By synteny analysis, the inactive centromere of chimpanzee chromosome 2b can be identified on human chromosome 2, and there are relics of α satellite DNA at this now extinct centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miga, 2017</xref>). Moreover, a dominant-negative mutation of the human telomeric protein TRF2 leads to telomere-telomere fusions, mainly between acrocentric chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stimpson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Steensel et al., 1998</xref>).

Based on our de novo genome assemblies of the <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> large-colony <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants, chromosome fusions occurred with no signs of chromosome rearrangements.

Liquid YPD cultures were inoculated from single colonies of solid media and grown, while shaking, at 30°C overnight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Genetic manipulations</title><p>DNA sequences (1 to 1.5 kb) of the <italic>CEN10</italic>-flanking regions were PCR-amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich MA, USA). Flanking regions were fused on both sides of either the <italic>NEO</italic> or <italic>NAT</italic> dominant selectable marker via overlap PCR, conferring G418 or nourseothricin resistance, respectively. Deletion of <italic>C. deuterogattii CEN10</italic> was achieved through homologous recombination via biolistic introduction of an overlap-PCR product as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billmyre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>). Deletion of <italic>CEN9</italic> was performed by CRISPR-CAS9 mediated transformation with two guide RNAs flanking <italic>CEN9</italic> and homologous recombination was mediated by the introduction of an overlap PCR product as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan and Lin, 2018</xref>). Transformants were selected on YPD medium containing G418 (200 μg/mL) or nourseothricin (100 μg/mL).</p><p>Subsequently, the 5’ junction, 3’ junction, and spanning PCR and Southern blot analyses were performed to confirm the correct replacement of <italic>CEN10</italic> by the appropriate drug resistance marker. To identify centromeres, the gene CNBG_0491, which encodes CENP-A, was N-terminally fused to the gene encoding the fluorescent mCherry protein by overlap PCR, and <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> strains were biolistically transformed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billmyre et al., 2017</xref>). A subset of <italic>cen9</italic>∆ mutants were biolistically transformed with an overlap PCR product containing <italic>CENPC</italic> C-terminally fused with <italic>GFP</italic>. As three <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants have a neocentromere that spans the gene encoding CENPC, a subset of <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutants were transformed instead with an overlap PCR product containing <italic>MIS12</italic> C-terminally fused with <italic>GFP</italic>. Both PCR products encoding <italic>CENPC-GFP</italic> and <italic>MIS12-GFP</italic> were randomly integrated in the genome and confirmed by a PCR spanning either <italic>CENPC-GFP</italic> or <italic>MIS12-GFP</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Growth and competition assays</title><p>Three replicate cultures for seven independent <italic>cen10</italic>∆ deletion mutants and the wild-type strain were grown in liquid YPD at 30°C overnight. Cells were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01 and grown in 50 mL YPD at 30°C. The OD<sub>600</sub> of the triplicate cultures was measured every two hours with a SmartSpec 3000 (BioRad) until stationary phase was reached (T = 22 hr).</p><p>For competition assays, three independent replicate cultures (<italic>cen9</italic>∆, <italic>cen10</italic>∆, control, and wild type) were grown overnight in 8 mL YPD. Subsequently, the cell density of the cultures was determined using a hemocytometer. For each independent <italic>cen</italic>Δ deletion mutant, 500,000 cells were co-cultured in a 1:1 ratio with wild-type cells. After 24 hr, the cultures were inoculated on 1) a YPD plate to determine the total colony-forming units (CFUs) and 2) a YPD plate containing G418 or nourseothricin to calculate the proportion of <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutant CFUs compared to the wild-type CFUs. Plates were incubated at 30°C and the colonies were counted after 4 days. The cell morphology of &gt;1000 cells of the wild type and of five <italic>cen10</italic>∆ mutant strains was analyzed, and the number of elongated cells was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Whole-genome sequencing, read mapping for aneuploidy/RNA-seq, and de novo genome assemblies</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated using the CTAB protocol and sent to the Duke University Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Shared Resource facility for library preparation and Illumina sequencing.

In short, 500 mL YPD cultures (1000 ml YPD for Mis12 ChIPs) were grown overnight at 30°C, after which 37% formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of ﻿0.5% for crosslinking. The cultures were then incubated for 15 min, formaldehyde was quenched with 2.5 M glycine (1/20 vol), and cells were washed with cold PBS. The crosslinking time of Mis12-GFP tagged isolates was extended to 45 min. Cells were resuspended in chromatin buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5; 20 mM NaCl; 1 mM Na-EDTA, pH 8.0; 1% [v/v] Triton X-100; 0.1% [w/v] sodium deoxycholate [DOC]) containing protease ﻿inhibitors (cOmplet Tablets, mini EDTA-free EASYpack, Roche), followed by homogenization by bead beating with a miniBead beater (BioSpec products) using 18 cycles of 1.5 min on and 1.5 min off. The supernatant containing chromatin was sheared by sonication (24 cycles of 15 s on, 15 s off, burst at high level) (Bioruptor UCD-200, Diagenode). Chromatin was isolated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was divided into a sample fraction and a sonication control. The sample fraction was precleared with protein-A beads (1 to 3 hr) and subsequently divided into two aliquots. One tube served as the input control, and a mCherry or GFP antibody (MCherry: ab183628, Abcam, GFP: ab290, Abcam) was added to the remaining half of the sample. The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C and then processed according to a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soyer et al., 2015</xref>). After completing the ChIP experiment, the samples were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR or sent to the Duke University Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Shared Resource facility for library preparation and Illumina sequencing. Samples <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-A</italic>, <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-B</italic> and <italic>cen10</italic>∆<italic>-C</italic> were sequenced with a HiSeq 2500 sequencer, and single reads of 50 bp were obtained. All other ChIP-seq samples were sequenced with a NovaSeq 600 sequencer and 50 bp PE reads were obtained. For each centromere mutant and the wild type, a ChIPed and input sample were sequenced. Reads were mapped to the reference genome, similar to the whole-genome sequencing reads. To analyze the ChIP-seq data the ChIPed sample was normalized with the input sample and visualized with the IGV viewer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA isolation and qPCRs</title><p>Cells were grown in an overnight culture of 25 mL YPD at 30°C.

9 and 10 in the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>. The authors identify the formation on neocentromeres at two different locations on chromosome 10. Elevated growth temperature selects for chromosome fusions of chromosome 10 with another chromosome involving inactivation of the neocentromere. The chromosomes 9 with neocentromeres do not display this behavior. Notably, the neocentromeric genes are constitutively expressed. The events described in this work present a mechanism that could explain the changes in genome organization within the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Centromere deletion in <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> leads to neocentromere formation and chromosome fusions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wolf-Dietrich Heyer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you can see from the reviews, there was a span of opinions, which converged at the end of our discussion. We all agreed that the manuscript is interesting and that the process of neocentromere formation is an important topic. We appreciate the amount of work required to adequately analyze and describe these events, but the analysis offers little new insights into the mechanism of neocentromere formation beyond the description. As <italic>eLife</italic> wants to limit the required revisions to take no more than 2 months, we could not see how the major points listed in the reviews could be addressed in that time span. For this reason, we decided on a rejection. However, if you elect to address the comments in a future submission to <italic>eLife</italic>, I would be happy to serve as a reviewing editor again.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well written manuscript analyzing the consequences of centromere 10 deletion in the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>. The authors identify the formation on neocentromeres at two different locations on chromosome 10. Elevated growth temperature selects for chromosome fusions of chromosome 10 with another chromosome involving inactivation of the neocentromere. The events described in this work present a mechanism that could explain the changes in genome organization within the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex.</p><p>The evidence presented supports the conclusions, and my main comment is that the analysis of the 2 isolates with 2 mapped neocentromeres remains inconclusive.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) The authors identify 2 isolates that contain 2 neocentromeres on chromosome 10 as defined by CENP-A ChIP. They present 4 models to explain the observation of having 2 CENP-A enrichment loci in a single chromosome: 1) aneuploidy, 2) a dicentric, 3) instability and neo-centromere switching, 4) only one CENPA locus being a functional centromere. The authors show that only a minority fraction of cells is aneuploid based on sequence read analysis. In the Discussion, they argue against a switching model, and discuss the possibility of the other two model. This is not very satisfying, and a ChIP experiment using a kinetochore component could be conducted to assess the functionality of both CENPA loci to assemble a kinetochore. There may be alternative routes to resolve this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> has regional centromeres and lacks active transposons. In this paper, authors deleted centromere 10 and examined chromosomes in surviving clones after centromere deletion (<italic>Cen10Δ</italic> mutants). This deletion caused neocentromere formation in two particular sites. Unlike neocentromere observed in other organisms, neocentromere formation in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> did not prevent expression of gene that cover neocentromeres. <italic>Cen10Δ</italic> mutants showed growth defects and aneuploidy. If growth temperature was increased, neocentromeres were inactivated and chromosome-fusion occurred. Finally authors speculated that these observations might occur under natural situation during speciation.</p><p>This is potentially interesting study, but work in this study is relatively descriptive. My major concern is unclearness how authors' observation in this study will be generalized. Authors performed various nice experiments and data are clear, however, I am not sure whether chromosomes with a neocentromere always get fusion with other chromosomes with growth fitness. In addition, it is also unclear whether cells with a neocentromere always show aneuploid. I agree that neocentromeres in this study are relatively weak compared with native centromeres, but I am not sure whether neocentromeres in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> are always weak or not. If authors show an evidence that observations in this study frequently occur or they can clearly explain about generality of this work, my mind will be changed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Centromeres vary in size and sequence between organisms. In most organisms studied, the centromere is marked by the presence of the histone H3 variant, CENPA. Accumulated evidence indicates that CENPA is the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity. Consistent with an epigenetic mode of centromere propagation in which sequence does not dominate, neocentromeres can arise on chromosomal regions which have no homology to centromere sequences. Many naturally-occurring neocentromeres have been reported and neocentromeres have been experimentally induced in several organisms, including fission yeast, Candida and chicken.</p><p>This manuscript describes the isolation and characterization of neocentromere strains in the human pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>, using an approach similar to previous studies in other species including <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The authors delete the centromere of chromosome 10 and recover rare survivors which they go on to show by CENPA ChIP-seq have acquired either one or two neocentromeres on chromosome 10. They report that this has little impact on underlying gene expression. By whole genome sequencing the authors provide evidence that the strains have a degree of aneuploidy, and are growth impaired. By incubation of neocentromere strains at 37<sup>o</sup>C, small and large colonies are isolated and the authors show that the large colonies have undergone fusion of chromosome 10 with various other chromosomes. They also claim that the neocentromeres become inactivated upon chromosome fusion.</p><p>Although this manuscript is interesting, it has a preliminary feel. Whilst it is interesting that neocentromeres can form in Cryptococcus, which, like Candida, is a human pathogen, it is questionable whether the study provides significant advances in understanding the processes of neocentromere formation. The manuscript would also benefit from significant rewriting.</p><p>There is little discussion of potential relevance to the virulence / pathogenicity of <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>.</p><p>Several points need to be addressed before the manuscript could be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A more detailed description of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> centromeres is required – size, how many types of transposons are present? What is the level of sharing between centromeres? How much unique sequence is at each centromere? In particular a more-detailed diagram of cen10 is needed.</p><p>How many total transformants were obtained from the 99 transformations? Was it only the 7 mentioned? Or were there many NAT/NEO positive transformants that were incorrect? The approach used relies on correct integration and neocentromere formation to both occur almost in quick succession in order to recover the desired isolates. Did the authors consider/try a “two-step” approach such as that used in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Ishii et al., 2008), in which a split marker gene is united via Cre-lox to delete the centromere?</p><p>Three strains are analysed by CENPA ChIP-seq and two neocentromeres are identified. <italic>Cen10Δ</italic>-1 has CENPA enrichment at both neocen1 and neocen2 sites, <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-2 has only neocen1, and <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-3 has both. What about the other neocen strains (<italic>cen10Δ</italic>-4,5,6,7)? Where is CENPA located in these other isolates, especially in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-5?</p><p>Figure 1: cen10 and the precise region deleted must be indicated (either as a bar above the region or with shading that extends down Figure 1A). Relevant features, such as the transposon remnants at cen10, neocen1 (or A), neocen2 (or B), the gene names for the genes that are mentioned in the text and/or analysed in other figures must be labelled.</p><p>I assume that the reads mapping to the (deleted) cen10 region in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-1,-2,-3 are due to CENPA ChIP-seq reads from copies of the transposons at other centromeres mapping to cen10 in the reference genome? This must be explained in the legend.</p><p>In part B the peak height at <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-2 neocen1 looks higher than those in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-1, and -3. But in C – a zoom-in of that region – they all look similar. Also the “background”? across the chromosome arm in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-1 appears higher than in the other isolates – what is real and what is due to differences in what is being displayed / scales?</p><p>The information associated with all ChIP-seq data (and similar) figures must be improved. The y axes are not labelled. What exactly is plotted? Has the data been normalized to input? Are the scales the same in all parts of the figure (the absence of any numbers on the y axes makes it impossible to interpret)? The legends must be more precise and informative.</p><p>What are the segregation properties of chr10 in the <italic>cen10Δ</italic> strains? Do neocen1 and/or neocen2 behave as centromeres? Ideally this should be done by integration of lacO arrays on chr10 and visualization via LacI-GFP. Integration of arrays near neocen1 and (separately) near cen10/neocen2 would enable predictions about the behavior of different loci to be tested. For instance, one would expect the neocen2 locus to be far from the spindle pole body in wild type (non-neocen) cells but close to it in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-2/neocen cells. In addition, a single chr10 bearing two neocentromeres might exhibit segregation defects such as lagging/stretched chromosomes or chromosome breakage. Introduction of lacO arrays should be attempted, alternatively <italic>cen10Δ</italic> cells should at least be stained for CENPA and DAPI and cells with observable chromosome segregation defects quantified.</p><p>To assess whether either/both neocentromere is assembling a bona fide kinetochore ChIP-qPCR should be performed for a kinetochore protein (ideally an outer kinetochore protein). (Subsection “Deletion of centromere 10 results in neocentromere formation” paragraph three)</p><p>Differences in colony size are mentioned multiple times in the manuscript. It would be of interest to see examples of colonies of the various <italic>cen10Δ</italic> strains at different temperatures (in addition to the growth curves).</p><p>Figure 2: Has the qRT-PCR data presented in Figure 2 been normalized in any way to account for the ploidy difference between the wild-type strain and the <italic>cen10Δ</italic> strains? For instance, <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-2-S3 (which is presumably similar to <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-2) has a chr10 ploidy of 1.4 X wild-type. qPCR could be performed on genomic DNA (relative to a control euploid locus) and the qRT-PCR expression data normalized to it. If such normalization has been done already it is not described in the manuscript (and it should be).</p><p>Figure 4: Is it known where on chr10 the extra centromere-containing region of chromosome 5 is in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-5-S3? It is intriguing that the neocen1 region appears to be duplicated in <italic>cen10Δ</italic>-L2, and, based on PFGE it is a duplication on chr10. What are the levels of CENPA on (duplicated?) neocen1? Is a double copy of neocen1 giving improved chromosome segregation?</p><p>It is interesting that cen10-Δ5 derivatives are euploid for chr10 but aneuploid for chr8. What might be the explanation for this observation?

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a well written manuscript analyzing the consequences of centromere 10 deletion in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii. The authors identify the formation on neocentromeres at two different locations on chromosome 10. Elevated growth temperature selects for chromosome fusions of chromosome 10 with another chromosome involving inactivation of the neocentromere. The events described in this work present a mechanism that could explain the changes in genome organization within the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex.</p><p>The evidence presented supports the conclusions, and my main comment is that the analysis of the 2 isolates with 2 mapped neocentromeres remains inconclusive.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) The authors identify 2 isolates that contain 2 neocentromeres on chromosome 10 as defined by CENP-A ChIP. They present 4 models to explain the observation of having 2 CENP-A enrichment loci in a single chromosome: 1) aneuploidy, 2) a dicentric, 3) instability and neo-centromere switching, 4) only one CENPA locus being a functional centromere. The authors show that only a minority fraction of cells is aneuploid based on sequence read analysis. In the Discussion, they argue against a switching model, and discuss the possibility of the other two model. This is not very satisfying, and a ChIP experiment using a kinetochore component could be conducted to assess the functionality of both CENPA loci to assemble a kinetochore. There may be alternative routes to resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for summarizing the findings, models, and sequencing. To confirm the CENP-A ChIP data, we have transformed a large subset of the centromere mutants with genes encoding either CENP-C or Mis12 epitope-tagged with GFP. As <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutant-A, -B and -C span the gene encoding CENP-C we have transformed these isolates with Mis12-GFP. The <italic>cen9</italic>Δ mutants were transformed with CENP-C-GFP. Subsequently, we performed ChIP-qPCRs and this experiment showed that Mis12 and CENP-C co-localize with the CENP-A-enriched regions and confirmed that the neocentromeres are functional centromeres. The fact that we still see two enriched CENP-A regions in <italic>cen</italic>Δ-A and -C suggests that the observation is real; however, we cannot exclude the models above. Unfortunately, we cannot perform single-cell ChIPs and with the current experiment we are sequencing a population of cells. For example, we noticed when we streak purify <italic>cen10</italic>Δ cells, we obtain a population of colonies of mixed sizes (large and small). When we streak purify the small colonies, we again obtain a population of mixed size colonies, which is in contrast to streak purifying large colonies which only subsequently produce large colonies. As we show in the manuscript, the large colonies are the products s of chromosome fusion and the neocentromere is silenced.</p><p>In addition, we have identified the neocentromeres of <italic>cen10</italic>Δ-D to -G and have six mutants wherein centromere 9 is deleted. This allowed us to compare the neocentromeres on different chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Cryptococcus deuterogattii has regional centromeres and lacks active transposons. In this paper, authors deleted centromere 10 and examined chromosomes in surviving clones after centromere deletion (Cen10Δ mutants). This deletion caused neocentromere formation in two particular sites. Unlike neocentromere observed in other organisms, neocentromere formation in C. deuterogattii did not prevent expression of gene that cover neocentromeres. Cen10Δ mutants showed growth defects and aneuploidy. If growth temperature was increased, neocentromeres were inactivated and chromosome-fusion occurred. Finally authors speculated that these observations might occur under natural situation during speciation.</p><p>This is potentially interesting study, but work in this study is relatively descriptive. My major concern is unclearness how authors' observation in this study will be generalized. Authors performed various nice experiments and data are clear, however, I am not sure whether chromosomes with a neocentromere always get fusion with other chromosomes with growth fitness. In addition, it is also unclear whether cells with a neocentromere always show aneuploid. I agree that neocentromeres in this study are relatively weak compared with native centromeres, but I am not sure whether neocentromeres in C. deuterogattii are always weak or not. If authors show an evidence that observations in this study frequently occur or they can clearly explain about generality of this work, my mind will be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. To answer the question raised, we have deleted another centromere (<italic>CEN9</italic>) and have identified the neocentromeres of <italic>cen10</italic>Δ isolates -D to -G. Only <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants have reduced fitness and undergo chromosome fusion. Centromere 9 mutants also exhibit a slow-growth phenotype, but the fitness defect is not as pronounced as in the <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants and we did not observe a population of mixed colony sizes in <italic>cen9</italic>Δ mutants. In the revised manuscript evidence is presented that the <italic>cen10</italic>Δ neocentromeres may be less fit than the native centromere and at higher growth temperature chromosome fusion has occurred in isolates producing large colonies. This shows a parallel with previous studies on neocentromere formation in <italic>S. pombe.</italic> However, in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> upon centromere deletion, either neocentromere formation or chromosome fusion occurs. Based on de novogenome assemblies, three chromosome fusions were identified and confirmed by PFGE, indicating that chromosome fusion occurred in all of the large <italic>cen10</italic>Δ isolates analyzed. In addition, the neocentromeres of <italic>cen9</italic>Δ and <italic>cen10</italic>Δ span actively transcribed genes, which has not been shown before. In <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> the genes are silenced. In chickens, genes are expressed in neocentromeres; however, these chromosomes are diploid and the neocentromere could bind to one only chromosome and the gene on the other chromosome could still be expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Centromeres vary in size and sequence between organisms. In most organisms studied, the centromere is marked by the presence of the histone H3 variant, CENPA. Accumulated evidence indicates that CENPA is the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity. Consistent with an epigenetic mode of centromere propagation in which sequence does not dominate, neocentromeres can arise on chromosomal regions which have no homology to centromere sequences. Many naturally-occurring neocentromeres have been reported and neocentromeres have been experimentally induced in several organisms, including fission yeast, Candida and chicken.</p><p>This manuscript describes the isolation and characterization of neocentromere strains in the human pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii, using an approach similar to previous studies in other species including Candida albicans. The authors delete the centromere of chromosome 10 and recover rare survivors which they go on to show by CENPA ChIP-seq have acquired either one or two neocentromeres on chromosome 10. They report that this has little impact on underlying gene expression. By whole genome sequencing the authors provide evidence that the strains have a degree of aneuploidy, and are growth impaired. By incubation of neocentromere strains at 37<sup>o</sup>C, small and large colonies are isolated and the authors show that the large colonies have undergone fusion of chromosome 10 with various other chromosomes. They also claim that the neocentromeres become inactivated upon chromosome fusion.</p><p>Although this manuscript is of interest, it has a preliminary feel. Whilst it is interesting that neocentromeres can form in Cryptococcus, which, like Candida, is a human pathogen, it is questionable whether the study provides significant advances in understanding the processes of neocentromere formation. The manuscript would also benefit from significant rewriting.</p><p>There is little discussion of potential relevance to the virulence / pathogenicity of Cryptococcus deuterogattii.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments and suggestions. We have included a section about possible effects on virulence in the Discussion. The competition assays showed that both <italic>cen9</italic>Δ and <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants grow slower than the wild type. If centromere deletions occurred in nature, we hypothesize that the wild type would outcompete <italic>cen</italic>Δ isolates. Based on the reduced fitness of the <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants we hypothesize that <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants would be less virulent than the wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several points need to be addressed before the manuscript could be considered for publication in eLife.</p><p>A more detailed description of C. deuterogattii centromeres is required – size, how many types of transposons are present? What is the level of sharing between centromeres? How much unique sequence is at each centromere? In particular a more-detailed diagram of cen10 is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The centromeres of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> were described in detail in a recent publication of the lab (Yadav et al., 2018). In that article the centromere content was analyzed in great detail, including the transposable element composition of the centromeres.</p><p>In the Introduction we have added more information about the size of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> centromeres. “Recently, the centromeres of the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> were characterized and compared to those of the closely related species <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (centromeres ranging from 27 to 64 kb), revealing dramatically smaller centromeres in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> (ranging from 8.7 to 21 kb) (Janbon et al., 2014; Yadav et al., 2018).” In the updated figures of the revised manuscript, we have employed the same color scheme for Tcn1-6 as presented by Yadav et al., 2018.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many total transformants were obtained from the 99 transformations? Was it only the 7 mentioned? Or were there many NAT/NEO positive transformants that were incorrect? The approach used relies on correct integration and neocentromere formation to both occur almost in quick succession in order to recover the desired isolates. Did the authors consider/try a “two-step” approach such as that used in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Ishii et al., 2008), in which a split marker gene is united via Cre-lox to delete the centromere?</p></disp-quote><p>We only saw 14 false positives for all 99 biolistic transformations. For the false positives, the <italic>NAT</italic>/<italic>NEO</italic> cassette was integrated randomly in the genome and these transformants were not characterized further. Thus, a total of 21 transformants were obtained, of which 7 were bona fide <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants (a frequency of 33%). While deleting genes for other projects, we have observed that the homologous recombination transformation rate is high in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion to use the Cre-lox method for the deletion of centromeres. To our knowledge, this method has not been developed or applied for <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic>. Instead, we have applied a CRISPR-Cas9 based homologous recombination method to delete centromere 9. This resulted in the successful deletion of centromere 9. The efficiency of centromere 9 deletion was significantly improved; however, the false positive (<italic>NAT</italic> ectopic integration in the genome) rate was significantly higher as well. As we have used CRISPR-Cas9, we did not make any conclusions for the transformation rate to delete centromere 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Three strains are analysed by CENPA ChIP-seq and two neocentromeres are identified.

Where is CENPA located in these other isolates, especially in cen10Δ-5?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed ChIP-seq for all of the <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants (-A to -G) and included the neocentromeres of <italic>cen10</italic>Δ -D to -G in our analysis in the revised manuscript.

This allowed us to define the chromosomal position for all of the neocentromeres. The neocentromere of <italic>cen10</italic>Δ-E is located directly adjacent to the left telomere.

Do neocen1 and/or neocen2 behave as centromeres? Ideally this should be done by integration of lacO arrays on chr10 and visualization via LacI-GFP. Integration of arrays near neocen1 and (separately) near cen10/neocen2 would enable predictions about the behavior of different loci to be tested. For instance, one would expect the neocen2 locus to be far from the spindle pole body in wild type (non-neocen) cells but close to it in cen10Δ-2/neocen cells. In addition, a single chr10 bearing two neocentromeres might exhibit segregation defects such as lagging/stretched chromosomes or chromosome breakage. Introduction of lacO arrays should be attempted, alternatively cen10Δ cells should at least be stained for CENPA and DAPI and cells with observable chromosome segregation defects quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion to test for segregation properties.

The same strains in Figure 4 and 5 were used for this analysis and we have added this information in the figure legend of Figure 6 (<italic>cen10</italic>Δ-A-L1 and <italic>cen10</italic>Δ-B-L2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CENPA ChIP-qPCR should be done for all original strains (and/or S strains) and fast-growing (L) derivatives. Ideally including qPCR for cen10 (as appropriate) and the centromere of the fusion chromosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included qPCR data for an additional kinetochore protein and this confirms the CENP-A sequencing shown in Figure 1. This is based on independent experiments and before the ChIPs were performed, we had to transform all of the original <italic>cen</italic>Δ mutants. After transformation, all of the transformants obtained were streak purified twice.</p><p>When we streak purify <italic>cen10</italic>Δ mutants for single colonies, we always observe a mixed population of colony sizes. When we streak purify small <italic>cen10</italic>Δ colonies we again always see a mixed population. Streak purification of large <italic>cen10</italic>Δ colonies instead results in only large colonies. The growth curves of Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows that small colonies grow like the original mutants and, in contrast. the large colonies have wild-type fitness levels. All of the ChIP experiments are based on large volumes as we cannot conduct single cell ChIPs. As mentioned, we cannot perform ChIP-qPCRs for the native centromere 10, as this centromere has been deleted.</p><p>Based on all of these experiments and conclusions we hypothesize that all small colonies of the same <italic>cen10</italic>Δ have the same neocentromeric location and all large colonies have inactive neocentromeres.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting that CENPA is apparently present on rrd2-1/neocen2 in wild type cells (in qPCR at least). There is no comment on this in the text. Could it be that wild-type cells do contain a small amount of CENPA at this location and, in the case of centromere deletion, this seeds further CENPA deposition to establish a neocentromere?</p></disp-quote><p>The qPCRs shown in Figure 6 show a slight enrichment of CENP-A on the <italic>RRD2</italic> gene. However, this was only in one region located in the gene, and the second region was not enriched. We now included CENP-A reads of the wild type and show this for all chromosomal location where neocentromeres are formed. Based on ChIP-seq we do not see any enrichment for CENP-A in the <italic>RRD2</italic>-2 region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B and subsection “cen10Δ chromosome is rescued by chromosome fusion”. The evidence that cen10Δ-3-L1 has a fusion between chr10 and chr13 should be explicitly described. Has PCR been done to confirm this?</p></disp-quote><p>Long-read sequencing data for this strain is not available and thus it is challenging to design a primer pair to validate the fusion junction. However, all of the chromosome fusions based on de novogenome assembly were confirmed by PCR and this information is now included as a panel in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. T. Beside the PCR confirmation, the chromosome fusions were confirmed by read coverage. In the de novoassembly, the reads show a continuous pattern and there are no read breaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All cen10Δ-5 strains analysed by PFGE are aneuploid for chromosome 8. In the figure legend there is the speculation that this occurred during or before transformation. Such speculative statements should not be placed in figure legends. I understand from the text and strain list that strain cen10Δ-5 (KS6) in the originally-derived and restreaked neocentromere strain and that the small and large colonies (KS21-25) are derived from that one original strain by growing at 37 and selecting small and large colonies. So the chr8 aneuploidy could have arisen in KS6 after transformation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion; we have removed this speculation. We can only speculate when the chr8 aneuploidy occurred in this mutant. The chromosome duplication might have occurred after the transformation event. As we see this chromosome duplication for all small and large colonies it suggests that all of the cells have the parental chr8 duplication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B. Conclusions from data must be stated in the text, not the legend! Cen10Δ-5-L1 – from the data presented in the figure it can only be concluded that the chromosome 10 band is gone, it could have fused with another chromosome resulting in a fusion chromosome that migrates at the same size as other chromosomes. Southern would need to be performed with a chr10 probe to rigorously assess this. The sequencing data also confirms the fusions. But what is the data for 10-13 fusion in cen10Δ-L2?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include this strain in our sequencing experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure legends should only describe what was done and what is presented so that the reader can understand the data. Legends should not contain interpretation or discussion. All legends should be reviewed and modified accordingly. In addition, the figures themselves would be far easier for the reader to comprehend if the labelling of figures was improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated all figure legends to enhance the labeling and presentation of the content.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has substantially improved and all reviewers recognized the strong efforts put into this revision. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The remaining revisions do not require new experimentation.</p><p>2) The major point is the analysis of the ChIP seq experiments, which should change to fold enrichment over input on the y axis in ChIP-seq analyses.</p><p>Original comment:</p><p>In part B the peak height at cen10Δ-2 neocen1 looks higher than those in cen10Δ-1, and -3. But in C – a zoom-in of that region – they all look similar. Also, the “background”? across the chromosome arm in cen10Δ-1 appears higher than in the other isolates – what is real and what is due to differences in what is being displayed / scales?</p><p>Author response:</p><p>We thank the reviewers for noticing these issues, which are due to the &quot;auto scale setting&quot; feature of the IGV viewer. For the revised Figure 1, we set the read coverage to the maximum peak height, which reduced the background.</p><p>Reviewer comment:</p><p>OK, but it is more informative and best practice to indicate the fold enrichment over input on the y axis in ChIP-seq analyses.</p><p>Original comment:</p><p>The information associated with all ChIP-seq data (and similar) figures must be improved. The y axes are not labelled. What exactly is plotted? Has the data been normalized to input? Are the scales the same in all parts of the figure (the absence of any numbers on the y axes makes it impossible to interpret)? The legends must be more precise and informative.</p><p>Author resposne:</p><p>We have introduced &quot;The read coverage (y-axis) shows the enrichment of CENP-A and</p><p>the x-axis shows the chromosome coordinates.&quot; All data shown are the result of the ChIP sample normalized with input. As expected, there is some variation in the number of reads of each ChIP analysis and this might be due to the ChIP, sequencing, library preparation, or experimental variation. For each sample, the reads are normalized to 1 within the sample.</p><p>Reviewer comment:</p><p>OK, but as above it is more informative and best practice to indicate the fold enrichment over input on the y axis in ChIP-seq analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now indicated the height of the CENP-A peaks on the right side of each panel in the revised version of Figure 1. The height of the ChIP-seq peak shows the fold enrichment of the CENP-A peak when subtracted from the input sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The quality of the graphs, e.g. those presented in Figures 2 and 6 could be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To improve the figure quality we have removed the pattern of the bar plots and we use now a solid grey fill for the revised versions. In addition, each bar plot now has a black border and the error-bars are have been re-colored to black.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the strange effect on the ethidium-stained gels in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment; to be honest we don’t have a good explanation. We might have exceeded the voltage limits while running the gels as the shape of the ladder bands show a V-shape. Another option could be improper mixture of the agarose gel; however, this seems less unlikely as each PCR series was run on independent agarose gels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion is quite lengthy and would benefit from being edited down. There are many of redundant descriptions. It is not necessary to summarize results there.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As suggested, we have removed redundant text and the revised Discussion is now ~1.2 pages shorter. In addition, two short paragraphs were moved to the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) “C. deuterogattii is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in the Pacific Northwest regions of Canada and the United States” – outbreak of what?</p></disp-quote><p>The outbreak referred to is that of cryptococcosis in the Pacific Northwest. The sentence in the revised manuscript has been replaced by: “<italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is responsible for an ongoing cryptococcosis outbreak in the Pacific Northwest regions of Canada and the United States (Fraser et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In some places in the text it would be helpful to refer to specific parts of figures, e.g. Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have inserted several references to the figures in the text and this should make the presentation more readily understood by the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please indicate the precise region deleted in cen9Δ and cen10Δ in Figure 1. Discuss cen9Δ and cen10Δ in same order in text and figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The deleted region of chromosome 9 in Figure 1A and the deleted region of chromosome 10 in Figure 1D are now indicated with a grey line in the revised figure. In the revised manuscript, each paragraph starts now with the description of results of centromere 9 followed by centromere 10.</p></body></sub-article></article>
