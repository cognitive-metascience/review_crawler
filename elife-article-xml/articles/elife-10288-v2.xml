at the levels of transcription, translation, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modification and degradation. However, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the temporal control of cell cycle is not well understood. By sequencing the human transcriptome through two continuous cell cycles, we identify ~1300 genes with cell cycle-dependent AS changes. These genes are significantly enriched in functions linked to cell cycle control, yet they do not significantly overlap genes subject to periodic changes in steady-state transcript levels. Many of the periodically spliced genes are controlled by the SR protein kinase CLK1, whose level undergoes cell cycle-dependent fluctuations via an auto-inhibitory circuit. Disruption of CLK1 causes pleiotropic cell cycle defects and loss of proliferation, whereas CLK1 over-expression is associated with various cancers. These results thus reveal a large program of CLK1-regulated periodic AS intimately associated with cell cycle control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10288.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10288.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10288.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitosis is a key step in the normal life cycle of a cell, during which one cell divides into two new cells. As a cell progresses through the cell cycle, it must carefully regulate its gene activity to switch particular genes on or off at specific moments. When a gene is activated its sequence is first copied into a temporary molecule called a transcript. These transcripts are then edited to form templates to build proteins. One way that a transcript can be edited is via a process called alternative splicing, in which different pieces of the transcript are cut and pasted together to form different versions of the final template. This allows different instructions to be obtained from a single gene, introducing an added layer of biological complexity. However, the role of alternative splicing in the timing of key events of the cell life cycle is not well understood.</p><p>Dominguez et al. have now looked for the genes that undergo alternative splicing during the cell cycle. The sequences of gene transcripts produced within human cells were collected while the cells went through two rounds of division. This approach revealed that around 1,300 genes are spliced in different ways at different stages of each cell cycle. Many of these genes were known to play roles in controlling the cell’s life cycle, but few of the genes showed large changes in the amount of total transcript that is generated over time.</p><p>Dominguez et al. also showed that an enzyme called CLK1 influences about half of the 1,300 periodically spliced genes during the cell cycle. The production of CLK1 is itself carefully controlled throughout the cell cycle, and the enzyme’s activity prevents its own overproduction. Further experiments showed that blocking CLK1’s activity while a cell is replicating its DNA halts the cell cycle, but blocking this enzyme’s activity after the cell had replicated its DNA did not. Given this pivotal role in the cell cycle, Dominguez et al. also examined the role of CLK1 in cancer cells and found that high levels of CLK1 in tumours were linked to lower survival rates. These findings indicate that CLK1 warrants further investigation, particularly in relation to its role in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10288.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10288.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>cancer genomic</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA158283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zefeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extensive periodic regulation of alternative splicing during the cell cycle in genes is linked to cell cycle functions, and involves an auto-inhibitory mechanism that uses the protein kinase CLK1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a critical step of gene regulation that greatly expands proteomic diversity. Nearly all (&gt;90%) human genes undergo AS and a substantial fraction of the resulting isoforms are thought to have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). AS is tightly controlled, and its mis-regulation is a common cause of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Cooper, 2007</xref>). Generally, AS is regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting splicing regulatory elements that recruit <italic>trans-</italic>acting splicing factors to promote or inhibit splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matera and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Burge, 2008</xref>). Alterations in splicing factor expression have been observed in many cancers and are thought to activate cancer-specific splicing programs that control cell cycle progression, cellular proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David and Manley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oltean and Bates, 2014</xref>). Consistent with these findings, several splicing factors function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and cancer-specific splicing alterations often affect genes that function in cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Progression through the mitotic cell cycle requires periodic regulation of gene function that is primarily achieved through coordination of protein levels with specific cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vermeulen et al., 2003</xref>). This temporal coordination enables timely control of molecular events that ensure accurate chromatin duplication and daughter cell segregation. Periodic gene function is conventionally thought to be achieved through stage-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabek et al., 2015</xref>), protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satyanarayana and Kaldis, 2009</xref>), post-translational protein modifications, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mocciaro and Rape, 2012</xref>). Although AS is one of the most widespread mechanisms involved in gene regulation, the relationship between the global coordination of AS and the cell cycle has not been investigated.</p><p>Major families of splicing factors include the Serine-Arginine rich proteins (SR) proteins and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), whose levels and activities vary across cell types. SR proteins generally contain one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a domain rich in alternating Arg and Ser residues (RS domain). Generally, RRM domains confer RNA binding specificity while the RS domain mediates protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions to affect splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou and Fu, 2013</xref>). Post-translational modifications of SR proteins, most notably phosphorylation, modulate their splicing regulatory capacity by altering protein localization, stability or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gui et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prasad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>). Dynamic changes in SR protein phosphorylation have been detected after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leva et al., 2012</xref>) and during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gui et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>), suggesting that regulation of AS may have important roles in cell cycle control. However, the functional consequences of SR protein (de)phosphorylation during the cell cycle are largely unclear.</p><p>Through a global-scale analysis of the human transcriptome at single-nucleotide resolution through two continuous cell cycles, we have identified widespread periodic changes in AS that are coordinated with specific stages of the cell cycle. These periodic AS events belong to a set of genes that is largely separate from the set of genes periodically regulated during the cell cycle at the transcript level, yet the AS regulated set is significantly enriched in cell cycle- associated functions. We further demonstrate that a significant fraction of the periodic AS events is regulated by the SR protein kinase, CLK1, and that CLK itself is also subject to cell cycle-dependent regulation. Moreover, inhibition or depletion of CLK1 causes pleiotropic defects in mitosis that lead to cell death or G1/S arrest, suggesting that the temporal regulation of splicing by CLK1 is critical for cell cycle progression. The discovery of periodic AS thus reveals a widespread yet previously underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of gene function during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alternative splicing is coordinated with different cell cycle phases</title><p>To systematically investigate the regulation of AS during the cell cycle, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis of synchronously dividing cells using a total of 2.3 billion reads generated across all stages (G1, S, G2 and M) of two complete rounds of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To maximize the detection of regulated AS events, we used the complementary analysis pipelines, MISO and VAST-TOOLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). These pipelines have different detection specificities and employ partially overlapping reference sets of annotated AS events, and therefore afford a more comprehensive analysis when employed together. Both pipelines were used to determine PSI (the percent of transcript with an exon spliced in) and PIR (the percent of transcripts with an intron retained). Alternative exons detected by both pipelines had highly correlated PSI values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>; see below). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Joseph et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whitfield et al., 2002</xref>), transcripts from approximately 14.2% (1182) of expressed genes displayed periodic differences in steady-state levels between two or more cell cycle stages (see below). Remarkably, 15.6% (1293) of expressed genes also contained 1747 periodically-regulated AS events, among a total of ~40,000 detected splicing events (FDR &lt; 2.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10288.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global detection of periodic cell cycle-dependent alternative splicing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map representation of periodically spliced events.

This indicates that genes with periodic changes in AS and transcript levels are largely independently regulated during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further supporting this conclusion, we did not observe a significant correlation (positive or negative) between exon PSI values and mRNA expression levels for genes with both periodic expression and periodic exon skipping (data not shown). A gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that genes with periodic AS, like those with periodic transcript level changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Joseph et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whitfield et al., 2002</xref>), are significantly enriched in cell cycle-related functional categories, including M-phase, nuclear division and DNA metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; adjusted p&lt;0.05 for all listed categories, FDR&lt;10%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Similar GO enrichment results were observed when removing the relatively small fraction (10%) of periodically spliced genes that also display significant mRNA expression changes across the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results thus reveal that numerous genes not previously linked to the cell cycle, as well as previously defined cell cycle-associated genes thought to be constantly expressed across the cell cycle, are in fact subject to periodic regulation at the level of AS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a full list).</p><p>Among the different classes of AS analyzed (cassette exons, alternative 5'/3' splice sites and intron retention [IR]), periodically regulated IR events were over-represented (relative to the background frequency of annotated IR events) by ~2.2 fold whereas periodically regulated cassette exons, represent the next most frequent periodic class of AS (p=2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR assays across different cell cycle stages validated periodic IR events detected by RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, one of these IR events is in transcripts encoding aurora kinase B (AURKB), a critical mitotic factor regulated at the levels of transcription, protein localization, phosphorylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmena et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lens et al., 2010</xref>). The AURKB retained intron is predicted to introduce a premature termination codon that elicits mRNA degradation through nonsense mediated decay, and is thus expected to result in reduced levels of AURKB protein. The splicing of the retained intron lags behind changes in the total <italic>AURKB</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We computationally corrected levels of fully spliced, protein coding <italic>AURKB</italic> mRNA by taking into account the fraction of intron-retaining (i.e. non-productive) transcripts across the cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The expression curve for corrected <italic>AURKB</italic> mRNA levels is substantially different from total <italic>AURKB</italic> transcript levels, with a shifted peak coinciding with mitosis. Periodically-regulated IR events detected in other genes, including those with known cell cycle functions such as HMG20B and RAD52, are similarly expected to affect the cell cycle timing of mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). Collectively, these results provide evidence that the temporal control of retained intron AS provides an important mechanism for establishing the timing of expression of AURKB mRNA and protein, as well as of the timing of expression of additional genes during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The SR protein kinase CLK1 fluctuates during the cell cycle</title><p>Alternative splicing is generally regulated by the concerted action of multiple <italic>cis-</italic>elements that recruit cognate splicing factors. Consistently, analysis of our RNA-seq data revealed 96 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) with periodic mRNA expression, including RS domain-containing factors like <italic>SRSF2, SRSF8, TRA2A</italic> and <italic>SRSF6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These 96 RBPs were significantly enriched in the GO term 'splicing regulation' (adjusted p=10<sup>-4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that periodic AS is likely controlled by multiple RBPs. Correlations between these RBPs and periodic splicing events were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For example, SRSF2 expression is significantly correlated with the splicing pattern of a retained intron in the <italic>SRSF2</italic> transcript. Further supporting a role for these RBPs in controlling periodic splicing was the identification of RNA motifs bound by a subset of periodically expressed RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To further examine periodic RBP regulation during cell cycle, we measured the abundance of known splicing regulatory proteins at different stages of the cell cycle by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among the proteins analyzed, CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), an important regulator of the Ser/Arg (SR) repeat family of splicing regulators, displayed the strongest cyclic expression peaking at the G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), consistent with the results of a recent mass-spectrometry-based screen for cycling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ly et al., 2014</xref>). CLK1 is one of four human CLK paralogs (CLK1-4) and is known to regulate AS via altering the phosphorylation status of multiple SR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ninomiya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prasad et al., 1999</xref>).

The levels of total CLK1 mRNA, as well as the levels of specific CLK1 splice variants, did not change significantly during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) indicating that periodic expression of CLK1 is controlled at the level of protein translation and/or turnover. Consistent with this, an exogenously expressed CLK1 protein displayed cell cycle-dependent fluctuations similar to those observed for endogenous CLK1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, CLK1 was rapidly degraded upon inhibition of translation by cycloheximide, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Additionally, polyubiquitination of Flag-tagged CLK1 was detected following immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody from cells treated with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data suggest that the levels of CLK1 protein are controlled by ubiquitin-mediated degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner.</p><p>Periodically regulated protein levels are often controlled through negative feedback circuits involving auto-regulatory loops. CLK1 has been reported to auto-phosphorylate on several residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David et al., 1991</xref>). To investigate whether auto-phosphorylation of CLK1 affects its periodic regulation, we tested whether blocking its kinase activity affects its stability. Inhibition of CLK1 kinase activity using a selective inhibitor, TG003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muraki et al., 2004</xref>), markedly stabilizes both endogenous and exogenously expressed CLK1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, activity-dependent destabilization of CLK1 was observed with a wild type (WT) protein, but not with a catalytically inactive (KD) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). We further observe that WT CLK1 is rapidly degraded upon cycloheximide treatment, whereas the KD mutant is more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We next tested whether CLK1 activity is sufficient to trigger its own degradation by co-expressing KD CLK1 with increasing amounts of WT CLK1. As expected, increasing amounts of WT CLK1 reduces levels of KD CLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with these results, WT CLK1 is more highly polyubiquitinated compared to the KD mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare lanes 2 to 4), and treatment with TG003 reduces polyubiquitination levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lane 2 <italic>vs.</italic> 3 and lane 4 <italic>vs.</italic> 5). Decreased polyubiquitination of WT CLK1 is more prevalent than is apparent upon TG003 treatment, as CLK1 is stabilized by TG003 inhibition and thus more total Flag-CLK1 is immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To further examine whether this auto-feedback loop is required for changes in CLK1 protein levels during the cell cycle, we treated synchronized cells with TG003 (or DMSO as a control) and measured CLK1 protein levels. We observed that CLK1 inhibition prevents its turnover after the G2/M phase for both endogenous and exogenously expressed kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that CLK1 protein levels are controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in a cell cycle stage-specific manner, and that an activity-dependent negative feedback loop is required for this periodic regulation. These results further suggest that changes in the levels of CLK1 could account for many of the periodically regulated AS transitions we have detected during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CLK1 regulates AS events in genes with critical roles in cell cycle control</title><p>RNA-Seq analysis of cells treated with TG003 revealed 892 AS events (in 665 genes) that significantly change after CLK1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), including known CLK1-regulated splicing events (e.g. exon 4 of CLK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncan et al., 1997</xref>]). It is worth noting that TG003 can also inhibit CLK4 (although to a lesser extent than inhibition of CLK1). However, RNAi of CLK1 is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype of CLK1/4 inhibition (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fedorov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muraki et al., 2004</xref>). Intron retention and cassette exons are the most overrepresented types of AS affected by TG003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Most (70%) of the CLK1-regulated exons display increased skipping upon CLK1 inhibition, whereas 87% of CLK1-regulated introns show increased retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), consistent with a recently reported role for CLK1 in the regulation of retained introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>). Of nine analyzed TG003-affected AS events detected by RNA-Seq analysis, all were validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These observations indicate that CLK1 inhibition mainly suppresses splicing, consistent with a general requirement for phosphorylation of SR proteins to promote splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prasad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, there is a significant overlap between genes with cell cycle periodic AS events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and those with CLK1-regulated AS events, involving 156 genes (p=8.5×10<sup>-10</sup>, hyper-geometric test). In contrast, consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we do not observe a significant overlap between genes containing CLK1-regulated AS events and periodically expressed genes. These results thus support a widespread and rapidly acting role for CLK1 in controlling cell cycle-regulated AS.

Expression of WT CLK1 in the presence of TG003, or a catalytically inactive CLK1, had little to no effect on the splicing of this exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom panels), indicating that the catalytic activity of CLK1 is essential for regulating CHEK2 AS. Over-expression of the SR protein splicing regulator SRSF1, a known target of CLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prasad et al., 1999</xref>), had a similar effect as over-expression of CLK1, resulting in CHEK2 exon 9 skipping, whereas knockdown of SRSF1 had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel). Furthermore, the activation of CHEK2 requires homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2004</xref>), and we observe that the CHEK2 isoform lacking exon 9 still interacts with full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that this CLK1-regulated isoform may function in a dominant-negative manner to attenuate CHEK2 activity.</p><p>CENPE is known to be tightly controlled at multiple levels (including transcription, localization, phosphorylation and degradation), and disruption of its regulation leads to pronounced mitotic defects. <italic>CENPE</italic> AS generates long and short isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), with the predominant variant being the short isoform that lacks amino acids 1972–2068.

TG003-treated cells entered mitosis normally, as measured by nuclear envelope breakdown, but displayed delayed or aberrant cytokinesis, typically resulting in multi-polar divisions, increased time in metaphase, failure to undergo chromatin de-condensation and eventual cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>). To further determine at what cell cycle stage CLK1 activity is required, we inhibited CLK1 using TG003 at different time points after early S phase release. Consistent with the imaging data, both control and TG003-treated cells entered mitosis normally, as measured by 4N DNA content. However, inhibition of CLK1 before late S-phase impaired progression through mitosis, whereas cells treated 5 hr after early S phase release underwent a round of normal mitotic division, although failed to enter the next cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the primary defects caused by CLK1 inhibition occur in late S-phase and G2 phase, which is when CLK1 levels normally begin to rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that CLK1-dependent AS targets, such as those detected in <italic>HMMR</italic> and <italic>CENPE,</italic> are periodically expressed during cell cycle and peak during G2 and M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Supporting this, shRNA knockdown or chemical inhibition of CLK1 with TG003 or KHCB-19 in HeLa cells results in a near complete block in cell proliferation, as measured by anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As mentioned above, CLK1 is likely the primary target of inhibition in these experiments since RNAi of CLK1 recapitulates the phenotype seen with these chemical inhibitors.</p><p>Using RNA-Seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2013</xref>) we observe that CLK1 displays significantly higher expression in 72 kidney tumors compared to matched normal tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, p=10<sup>-5</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Consistently, most CLK1-controlled AS events that are altered in tumors have expected splicing changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, patients with tumors that have elevated CLK1 expression (i.e. the upper quartile of all samples) have significantly lower survival rates relative to other patients in the comparison group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, p<italic>=</italic>0.007). While there was also an increase in CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4 mRNA expression in these tumors, CLK1 displayed the highest relative mRNA expression levels compared to CLK2 and CLK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Levels of the CLK4, which is ~80% identical to CLK1, did not correlate with survival differences despite its increased levels in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, CLK1-regulated AS events, as defined by the RNA-Seq analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, were also altered across multiple tumor types, including breast, colon, lung and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data are further consistent with a multi-faceted role for CLK1 in regulating cell cycle progression, and also suggest that CLK1 contributes to increased cell proliferation in cancer, at least in part through its role in controlling periodic AS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have shown that splicing and the cell cycle are intimately connected processes. Indeed, cell cycle division (CDC) loci originally defined in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> namely <italic>cdc5</italic> and <italic>cdc40</italic>, were subsequently shown to encode spliceosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Yehuda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonald et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, genome-wide RNAi screens for new AS regulators of apoptosis genes in human cells revealed that factors involved in cell-cycle control, in addition to RNA processing components, were among the most significantly enriched hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tejedor et al., 2015</xref>). An RNAi screen performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells for genes required for cell-cycle progression identified numerous splicing components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Björklund et al., 2006</xref>) as well as a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of CLK kinases, <italic>Darkener of apricot Doa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004</xref>). In other studies, negative control of splicing during M phase was shown to be dependent on dephosphorylation of the SR family protein, SRSF10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>), and the mitotic regulator aurora kinase A (AURKA) was shown to control the AS regulatory activity of SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2010</xref>). Our study shows for the first time that AS patterns are subject to extensive periodic regulation, in part via a global control mechanism involving cell cycle fluctuations of the SR protein kinase CLK1. At least one likely function of this periodic AS regulation is to control the timing of activation of AURKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as well as of numerous other key cell cycle factors shown here to be subject to periodic AS. The definition of an extensive, periodically-regulated AS program in the present study thus opens the door to understanding the functions of an additional layer of regulation associated with cell cycle control and cancer.</p><p>Since many RBPs are found to be periodically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it is likely that other aspects of mRNA metabolism are also coordinated with cell cycle stages. For example, differential degradation could potentially contribute to the observed periodic fluctuation of splice isoforms during cell cycle. The degradation of mRNA is closely linked with alternative polyadenylation, which has emerged as a critical mechanism that controls mRNA translation and stability. Generally, shortened 3’ UTRs are found in rapidly dividing cells and more aggressive cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>). This study identified 94 cases periodic alternative poly-A site usage (data not shown) in genes known to regulate cell cycle and/or proliferation, including <italic>SON, CENPF and EPCAM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bomont et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaves-Perez et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, many mRNAs have recently been found to be translated in a cell cycle dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aviner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maslon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stumpf et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a fraction of periodically translated genes are also periodically spliced, including key regulators of cell cycle (e.g., <italic>AURKA, AURKB, TTBK1</italic> and <italic>DICER1</italic>). This observation is consistent with recent findings that the regulation of AS and translation may be coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, we have demonstrated that AS is subject to extensive temporal regulation during the cell cycle in a manner that appears to be highly integrated with orthogonal layers of cell cycle control. These results thus provide a new perspective on cell cycle regulation that should be taken into consideration when studying this fundamental biological process, both in the context of normal physiology and diseases including cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and synchronizations</title><p>HeLa (a kind gift from J.

Briefly, for mRNA expression, RSEM expression values for the indicated genes were analyzed in 79 paired KIRC (tumor and normal) samples and the paired ks-test was used to test significance. For alternative splicing analysis data from BRCA: Breast invasive carcinoma, COAD: Colorectal adenocarcinoma, KIRC: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, LUAD: Lung adenocarcinoma, LUSC: Lung squamous cell carcinoma, LIHC: liver hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed through the MISO pipeline as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). Relapse-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier plots. All plots and statistical analyses (<italic>survdiff</italic>) were generated using the R package version 3.1.1 <italic>survival</italic> function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Jan Prins and Darshan Singh for helpful suggestions in analyzing RNA-Seq data, and Drs.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Gene Yeo), and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identify widespread periodic changes in alternative splicing (AS) (&gt;1000 AS events) that are coordinated with stages of the cell cycle, noticing that periodically regulated intron retention is prominent. The authors discover that SR protein kinase CLK1 is subject to cell cycle-dependent changes and appears to play a central role in the control of AS during cell cycle.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were major concerns with regards to the poor overlap of the two pipelines (VAST and MISO) in the identification of AS events. While the reviewers and myself appreciate that the point of the manuscript is not a systematic comparison of both software, the authors are expected to explain the rationale for decisions taken which likely impact the interpretation of the results. Greater detail in the bioinformatics analysis is expected in the revision. Also, why are both tools used? And given the relatively poor overlap, is the use of either or both of these tools justified?</p><p>2) A more complete treatment of the contribution of other splicing factors to cell cycle AS is necessary. I do not believe it has to be exhaustive, but in its present form, the manuscript led to concerns by the reviewers that CLK1 is not necessarily a clear outlier (and therefore candidate) in terms of its regulation, compared to other factors. CLK4 modification and levels should be certainly verified by Western blot analysis. Based on these new results (in the revision), the authors are encouraged to alter/broaden their title (as suggested by Reviewer 3 as well).</p><p>3) The authors should address the major concerns of Reviewers 1 and 2 with regards to why is the CLK1 inhibitor used (rather than depletion) and address clearly their interpretation of specificity since the inhibitors also target CLK4.</p><p>4) The authors should address queries with regards to the PTC-induced degradation of AURKB (Reviewer 1) and known IR events (Reviewer 3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this interesting paper, the Blencowe and Wang labs investigate the role of Alternative splicing (AS) during cell cycle progression.</p><p>First, Dominguez and co-authors carried out a sequence analysis of the human transcriptome during two continuous cell cycles. This analysis resulted in the identification of widespread periodic changes in AS that are coordinated with specific stages of the cell cycle. In particular, they identified 1,747 AS cell cycle-dependent AS events in 1,293 genes. They found that periodically regulated intron retention is the predominant event.</p><p>The authors next focused on the SR protein kinase, CLK1 and found that its expression also fluctuates during the cell cycle. These and other results suggested that CLK1 might have a specific role in regulating cell cycle-dependent AS. Following this, the authors went on to identify endogenous CLK1 AS targets using an RNA-Seq approach. Altogether, these data suggests that temporal regulation of splicing by CLK1 is critical for cell cycle progression. Finally, the authors conclusively show that CLK1 is indeed required for normal mitosis and cell proliferation. The authors put forward a model whereby CLK1 has an essential role in controlling cell cycle-dependent AS.</p><p>Defining a central role for CLK1 in the regulation of AS during cell cycle is of importance. The authors also nicely show that the levels of CLK1 are indeed self-regulated and depend on its own catalytic activity. The main targets of CLK1 are SR proteins, yet only in the case of CHEK2 pre-mRNA splicing, it is shown that the effect of CLK1 operates via SRSF1. It would be important to show some evidence that links the role of CLK1 in cell cycle regulated splicing with a particular SR protein/s.</p><p>In summary, this is a very good study that represents and important contribution to our understanding of Alternative splicing and cell cycle progression.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In the Abstract and again in paragraph two of the Introduction, the authors refer to periodic regulation of gene function at the levels of transcription, protein modification and degradation, etc.; however, they ignore the role of mRNA translation. There are several papers describing the regulation of mRNA translation during mitosis, which would enrich the Discussion section. Some of these include:</p><p>Stumpf et al. (2013) The translational landscape of the mammalian cell cycle. Mol Cell. 2013 Nov 21;52(4):574-82. PubMed PMID: 24120665.</p><p>Maslon et al.

PubMed PMID: 24842991.</p><p>2) Is there any overlap in those genes found here to be regulated at the AS level and those previously reported to be regulated by mRNA translation?</p><p>3) There seems to be independent regulation of transcriptionally and AS-regulated genes during the cell cycle. Are those genes that show an overlap (133) more likely to be regulated by the kinetic control mode of AS regulation? In other words, are those genes preferentially regulated by the processivity of RNA pol II?</p><p>4) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, has the PTC-induced degradation of AURKB been experimentally determined?</p><p>5) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, why is a CLK1 inhibitor preferred to a depletion of CLK1 (either via CRISPR or siRNA approach)?</p><p>6) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, is the <italic>CENPE</italic> AS also regulated by SRSF1, as is the case with the CHEK2 pre-mRNA?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Dominguez et al., describes a thorough and important analysis of transcriptome changes during the cell cycle, with particular emphasis on alternative splicing. This analysis then motivates the authors to investigate a potential role of the kinase CLK1 in regulating cell cycle splicing and progression, and its possible link to cancer. If fully substantiated, this work would add tremendously to the growing body of knowledge regarding how different cellular growth conditions impact splicing. However, some additional analysis and important controls are required for this manuscript to achieve its full impact.</p><p>Firstly, much of the analysis of the RNA-Seq data is poorly defined. Why were VAST-TOOLs and MISO both used and what is the advantage of this? What is &quot;Periodic score&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>? The authors may feel these are readily apparent, but readers should not have to dig deeply through the Methods to understand the first figure. More importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> should either be replaced with a version that gives raw PSI, or a version with raw PSI should be included in the supplement. Use of the &quot;row normalized&quot; method raises concerns that many of the changes observed in AS events are modest and potentially not of biologic significance.</p><p>Secondly, the justification for focusing on CLK1 is not clear. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> certainly support a role of the CLK family in cell cycle splicing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is not convincing that CLK1 is a clear outlier in terms of its regulation. A quick glance through the GE values in supplemental table 1 indicates that genes encoding several SR proteins vary throughout the cell cycle. Have SR proteins other than SRSF1 been analyzed by Western? Moreover, CLK4 should be certainly tested by Western – due to it being a target of TG003 and KHCB-19 (see next point).</p><p>Finally, there is significant concern that both the inhibitors used target CLK4 as well as (or more potently than) CLK1. The authors should either conclusively rule out a role for CLK4, or broaden their conclusions to acknowledge a potential role for this family member.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work the authors create a genome wide map of oscillating alternative splicing events, and identify CLK1 as a major regulator of a subset of these oscillating events. Roughly, two thirds the paper are focused on exploring the regulatory role of CLK1 through a series of elaborate and thoughtful experiments after establishing it plays a major role in regulating oscillating AS. We found relatively few and mostly minor concerns regarding these later sections. Most critical concerns regard the first, genome wide, analysis.</p><p>1) The two pipelines used, based on VAST and MISO, are basically in severe disagreement with respect to which AS events are oscillating. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> shows that not only is the number of events detected very different (244 vs 513) but the overlap of those is a mere 27% or 12%(!). This is coming from two pipelines that use the same downstream procedure to check for oscillation and differ only in their approach to quantify the raw PSI values fed into the pipeline. This poor overlap puts the entire genome wide mapping presented here into questioning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> may have been added to address this concern (it's not explained) but actually does little to alleviate this concern: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> basically shows that the correlation between VAST and MISO based PSI values are much better for the same condition (diagonal) than for different conditions when looking across the &gt;4K events quantified. That is actually to be expected: most events are either highly included or highly excluded. Such highly included/excluded events would (a) make the extreme values dominating the correlation coefficient and (b) would make the majority of cases that are generally not changing and thus both methods agree on. In fact, a closer look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> shows the average PSI correlation between VAST and MISO for the same condition (diagonal) is ~0.55 which is again troubling (btw, setting the dark red color for 0.55 is misleading). Some suggestions that may help alleviate the discrepancies between the two pipelines are given below.</p><p>Related to this: why does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> contain only 513 events but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> contains 1747 events? If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> is VAST's list why does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> show 513 for MISO?</p><p>2) Basic &quot;normalized PSI&quot; (subheading “Identification of periodic AS”) means we are only looking at <italic>relative</italic> changes of PSI. This may introduce a lot of variability/noise to the analysis and may contribute to the substantial differences between the results from the two analysis pipelines (see above). The authors may be better off screening for events for which (a) min(max(PSI) &gt; VAL1) and (b) max(PSI) – min(PSI) &gt; VAL2. Similarly, increasing the threshold on number of reads per event to be included could help. For example, using VAL1=VAL2 = 20% could help avoid fluctuations that may just appear as periodic or changing dramatically in a relatively small/insignificant range.</p><p>Related to this: the authors do not explain how events are screened for coverage across the experiments.</p><p>3) The method for detecting the oscillating AS events and its effect on their results is not discussed or evaluated. Specifically, the authors use 7 previously characterized profiles from GE analysis. It's not clear whether the same kind of profiles is the best choice for analyzing periodic AS. For example, profiles 3,4 are similar in phase but one has a wider shape – why would that be the best fit for AS profiles? It seems reasonable to at least compare the results from this approach to an unbiased approach where the entire set of AS events are clustered with no specific periodic profiles and then the most prominent periodic profiles are extracted or executing a more directed search against theoretical periodic profiles.</p><p>4) More convincing/exhaustive search of RBPs that may contribute to cell cycle AS:</p><p>While there's significant overlap between CLK1 inhibitor AS events and periodic cell cycle events, this only explains a fraction of all the periodic events they find. It would be good to acknowledge at least that there are likely other factors out there that contribute to this program of AS. The authors should discuss how much of the oscillation signal is explained by CLK1. The WB data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is not exhaustive, but it is convincing for those factors tested. It should be straightforward to supplement this analysis by applying their pipelines and RNA-seq data to report known/suspected splicing factors and/or RBPs that change at the level of GE or AS. Any changes found in this analysis could potentially contribute to the large AS program they observe beyond CLK1 regulation.</p><p>5) Analysis on IR/AS-PTC introducing events:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D/E</xref> suggests that periodic IR can affect transcript expression levels (probably by the introduction of PTCs) in the case of AURKB and some other genes they examined by qRT-PCR that are important for cell cycle progression. However <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> argues little overlap between splicing regulation and mRNA expression levels, save for 133 overlapping events. Are the events in the overlap of periodic AS and periodic gene expression overrepresented for IR like in their example for AURKB and/or other PTC-introducing AS? The same could be done with CLK1 regulated AS and gene expression that is mentioned in the text later (paragraph one, subheading “CLK1 regulates AS events in genes with critical roles in cell cycle control”).</p><p>6) Blot for phospho-SR proteins: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that CLK1 seems to be unique among splicing factors tested in periodic protein expression level changes. An obvious mechanism that likely contributes to the observed periodic splicing changes is altered SR protein phosphorylation, particularly since SRSF1 doesn't change protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Can the authors use a phospho-RS-specific antibody (1H4?) to see if the phosphorylation state of any SR proteins is altered through the cell cycle and, if so, if any of these phosphorylation changes are deadened upon CLK1 inhibition with TG003?</p><p>7) Experimentally test known IR event identified in their analysis in CLK1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A</xref> and B show neither CLK1 mRNA levels nor inclusion of exon 4 changes significantly through the cell cycle. Boutz et al. (2014) and others cited within have described regulated intron retention (or &quot;detained introns&quot;) of the upstream and downstream introns flanking CLK1 exon 4 that affects the transcript's localization and stability. Since periodic IR is suggested to be a common point of AS regulation through the cell cycle in this paper, showing that these introns are or are not retained across the cell cycle using additional primer sets, as was done for exon 4 skipping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref>, could further rule out splicing regulation or add another interesting layer of regulation controlling CLK1 in the context of the cell cycle. Indeed, the MISO analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> calls IR in this region as one of the 1747 periodic splicing events (event: chr2:201726189-201725961:-@chr2:201724469-201724403:-) so this may very well be an additional layer of regulation upstream of the kinase-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated turnover that the authors convincingly demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>. Similarly, the authors could test and report results for variations of CLK1's 3'UTR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10288.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) There were major concerns with regards to the poor overlap of the two pipelines (VAST and MISO) in the identification of AS events.

More importantly, different libraries of annotated AS events are also utilized by these pipelines, such that they capture overlapping but also distinct events. For example, VAST-TOOLS includes annotations for microexons and a larger set of retained introns than MISO. Accordingly, employing the two pipelines provides a more comprehensive survey of periodic AS, whereas a complete overlap in the detected AS events is not expected. Importantly, we observe a strong correlation between PSI values for periodic AS events detected by both pipelines (Spearman’s Rho &gt; 0.8, p value &lt; 10-16). We have clarified these points in paragraph one, subheading “Alternative splicing is coordinated with different cell cycle phases” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> in the manuscript of the revised manuscript and below in response to Reviewer 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><p>It is also worth noting that raw read data were mapped, filtered and analyzed for AS and gene expression independently using MISO and VAST-TOOLS (see Methods). The fact that we obtain very similar results with both pipelines indicates that our overall results are robust and can be recapitulated using independent pipelines. We therefore respectfully disagree with one of the reviewers that the “poor overlap puts the entire genome wide mapping presented here into questioning.”</p><p>2) A more complete treatment of the contribution of other splicing factors to cell cycle AS is necessary. I do not believe it has to be exhaustive, but in its present form, the manuscript led to concerns by the reviewers that CLK1 is not necessarily a clear outlier (and therefore candidate) in terms of its regulation, compared to other factors.</p><p>Our study focuses in CLK1 for the following reasons: (1) It shows a periodic expression pattern; (2) It affects a large number of AS events by modifying multiple SR proteins that are key splicing factors; and (3) Its levels are controlled by a self-inhibitory feedback circuit that likely accounts for its periodic regulation. While we fully agree that CLK1 is not the only key regulator of cell cycle dependent splicing, an in depth, comprehensive analyses of the role of other splicing regulators in periodic regulation of AS during the cell cycle is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the reviewers’ comments we have included a new analysis in our manuscript that systematically examines all annotated RNA-binding proteins for periodic expression patterns that may relate to cell cycle dependent splicing regulation. The results from these new analyses are described on page 7 and 8, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and Table 1 in the manuscript, and additional information is provided below for the reviewers’ consideration.</p><p>Analysis of our RNA-seq data revealed that 96 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) with periodic mRNA expression, and include RS domain-containing factors like SRSF2, SRSF8, TRA2A and SRSF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1A</xref>). These 96 RBPs were significantly enriched in the GO term “splicing regulation” (adjusted P = 10-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1B</xref>), indicating that periodic AS is likely controlled by multiple RBPs. Correlations between these RBPs and periodic splicing events were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1C</xref>), SRSF2 expression for example, significantly correlated with the splicing of the pattern of a retained intron in the SRSF2 transcript. Further supporting a role for these RBPs in controlling periodic splicing was the identification of RNA motifs bound by a subset of periodically expressed RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10288.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map representation of RNA-bound proteins (RBPs) with periodic expression.</title><p>Row-normalized FPKM levels are shown.

Based on these new results (in the revision), the authors are encouraged to alter/broaden their title (as suggested by Reviewer 3 as well).</p><p>We have repeatedly attempted to measure the levels of CLK4 by immunoblot. However a reliable antibody to CLK4 is not available.</p><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the small molecules utilized in our study likely also inhibit the activity of CLK4. However, shRNA mediated depletion of CLK4 did not reveal significant alteration in cell cycle-associated phenotypes (whereas knockdown of CLK1 did; see below), which is another reason why we focused our efforts on CLK1. Furthermore, in our subsequent kidney tumor analysis, CLK4 expression did not correlate with patient outcomes, whereas CLK1 expression did.</p><p>3) The authors should address the major concerns of Reviewers 1 and 2 with regards to why is the CLK1 inhibitor used (rather than depletion) and address clearly their interpretation of specificity since the inhibitors also target CLK4.</p><p>The main advantage of employing CLK inhibitors vs. RNAi or CRISPR depletion is that they have rapid effects, which is critical for studying temporal control of splicing as it causes rapid changes in splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, due to the self- regulatory feedback of CLK1, its efficient depletion in the context of synchronization experiments was not possible with siRNA pools. As such, we found that the only viable way to assess the activity of the kinase in cell cycle control was to use available chemical inhibitors. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, we show in the manuscript that knockdown of CLK1 using a shRNA phenocopies cell cycle defects observed with both inhibitors, providing evidence that the effects of these inhibitors are due to CLK1 inhibition.</p><p>4) The authors should address queries with regards to the PTC-induced degradation of AURKB (Reviewer 1) and known IR events (Reviewer 3).</p><p>We carried out additional experiments to address this point.

There are several papers describing the regulation of mRNA translation during mitosis, which would enrich the Discussion section. Some of these include:</p><p>Stumpf. et al. (2013) The translational landscape of the mammalian cell cycle. Mol Cell. 2013 Nov 21;52(4):574-82. PubMed PMID: 24120665.</p><p>Maslon et al. (2014) The translational landscape of the splicing factor SRSF1 and its role in mitosis. eLife. 2014 May 6:e02028. doi: 10.7554/eLife.02028. PubMed PMID: 24842991.</p><p>We apologize for this oversight, and have now included this point and cited the references in the new Discussion (paragraph two, Discussion).</p><p>2) Is there any overlap in those genes found here to be regulated at the AS level and those previously reported to be regulated by mRNA translation?</p><p>See our response above.</p><p>3) There seems to be independent regulation of transcriptionally and AS-regulated genes during the cell cycle. Are those genes that show an overlap (133) more likely to be regulated by the kinetic control mode of AS regulation? In other words, are those genes preferentially regulated by the processivity of RNA pol II?</p><p>This is a very insightful comment, which raises the possibility that the 133 overlapping genes may be periodically spliced as a result of slower or faster polymerase movement across the gene during transcription. According to the conventional kinetic model, certain genes may be transcribed more rapidly in a specific cell cycle stage, which could potentially modulate AS. Unfortunately, we currently lack measurements for pol II elongation rates in the corresponding genes making it difficult to address the reviewer’s comment at the present time. Related to this question are additional analyses regarding the correlation between a gene’s expression and alternative splicing during cell cycle (please see our response to Reviewer 3, point 3).</p><p>4) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, has the PTC-induced degradation of AURKB been experimentally determined?</p><p>We have addressed this point and included a supplementary figure on this. Please see the essential revision point #4 (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>) for details.</p><p>5) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, why is a CLK1 inhibitor preferred to a depletion of CLK1 (either via CRISPR or siRNA approach)?</p><p>Please see response above.</p><p>6) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, is the CENPE AS also regulated by SRSF1, as is the case with the CHEK2 pre-mRNA?</p><p>This is an interesting possibility but we feel that it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Dominguez et al., describes a thorough and important analysis of transcriptome changes during the cell cycle, with particular emphasis on alternative splicing. This analysis then motivates the authors to investigate a potential role of the kinase CLK1 in regulating cell cycle splicing and progression, and its possible link to cancer. If fully substantiated, this work would add tremendously to the growing body of knowledge regarding how different cellular growth conditions impact splicing. However, some additional analysis and important controls are required for this manuscript to achieve its full impact.</p><p>Firstly, much of the analysis of the RNA-Seq data is poorly defined. Why were VAST-TOOLs and MISO both used and what is the advantage of this? What is &quot;Periodic score&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>? The authors may feel these are readily apparent, but readers should not have to dig deeply through the Methods to understand the first figure. More importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> should either be replaced with a version that gives raw PSI, or a version with raw PSI should be included in the supplement. Use of the &quot;row normalized&quot; method raises concerns that many of the changes observed in AS events are modest and potentially not of biologic significance.</p><p>Please see our response to Dr. Yeo’s essential revision #1. We have included a figure with raw PSI values below as well as added data regarding the methodology of periodic score.</p><p>Secondly, the justification for focusing on CLK1 is not clear. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> certainly support a role of the CLK family in cell cycle splicing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is not convincing that CLK1 is a clear outlier in terms of its regulation. A quick glance through the GE values in supplemental table 1 indicates that genes encoding several SR proteins vary throughout the cell cycle. Have SR proteins other than SRSF1 been analyzed by Western? Moreover, CLK4 should be certainly tested by Western – due to it being a target of TG003 and KHCB-19 (see next point).</p><p>Finally, there is significant concern that both the inhibitors used target CLK4 as well as (or more potently than) CLK1. The authors should either conclusively rule out a role for CLK4, or broaden their conclusions to acknowledge a potential role for this family member.</p><p>Please see our response to the essential revision point #3.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>In this work the authors create a genome wide map of oscillating alternative splicing events, and identify CLK1 as a major regulator of a subset of these oscillating events. Roughly, two thirds the paper are focused on exploring the regulatory role of CLK1 through a series of elaborate and thoughtful experiments after establishing it plays a major role in regulating oscillating AS. We found relatively few and mostly minor concerns regarding these later sections. Most critical concerns regard the first, genome wide, analysis.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The two pipelines used, based on VAST and MISO, are basically in severe disagreement with respect to which AS events are oscillating. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> shows that not only is the number of events detected very different (244 vs 513) but the overlap of those is a mere 27% or 12%(!). This is coming from two pipelines that use the same downstream procedure to check for oscillation and differ only in their approach to quantify the raw PSI values fed into the pipeline. This poor overlap puts the entire genome wide mapping presented here into questioning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> may have been added to address this concern (it's not explained) but actually does little to alleviate this concern: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> basically shows that the correlation between VAST and MISO based PSI values are much better for the same condition (diagonal) than for different conditions when looking across the &gt;4K events quantified. That is actually to be expected: most events are either highly included or highly excluded. Such highly included/excluded events would (a) make the extreme values dominating the correlation coefficient and (b) would make the majority of cases that are generally not changing and thus both methods agree on. In fact, a closer look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> shows the average PSI correlation between VAST and MISO for the same condition (diagonal) is ~0.55 which is again troubling (btw, setting the dark red color for 0.55 is misleading). Some suggestions that may help alleviate the discrepancies between the two pipelines are given below.</italic></p><p>Related to this: why does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> contain only 513 events but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> contains 1747 events? If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> is VAST's list why does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> show 513 for MISO?</p><p>We have adjusted the color of the heat map scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> heat map representation of the sample correlations is actually comparing normalized PSI (normalized across cell cycle), which is why higher positive correlations between samples in the cell cycle stage are observed. This was meant to demonstrate that even though the overlap between the two pipelines is not perfect, there is still a significant correlation between these two pipelines. Furthermore, it demonstrates that even when using 4,000 AS events periodicity can still be observed in aggregate.</p><p>For clarity we have now included the correlation by raw PSI value (which is much higher &gt;0.8). When low and high PSI values are excluded (0.2 &gt;PSI&lt;0.8) the correlation between VAST-TOOLS and MISO are still positive and very significant (~0.5-0.6 Spearman’s Rho), showing that the positive and significant correlation between our AS measurements are not solely driven by high and low PSI values.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10288.024</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot representation of raw PSI values called by VAST- TOOLS and MISO pipelines.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Heat map representation of possible pair-wise correlation between commonly detected exons by VAST-TOOLS and MISO.

Similarly, increasing the threshold on number of reads per event to be included could help. For example, using VAL1=VAL2 = 20% could help avoid fluctuations that may just appear as periodic or changing dramatically in a relatively small/insignificant range.</italic></p><p>In the main figures we used relative PSI values for presentation purposes, as it more clearly shows the data and patterns of periodicity.

Specifically, the authors use 7 previously characterized profiles from GE analysis. It's not clear whether the same kind of profiles is the best choice for analyzing periodic AS. For example, profiles 3,4 are similar in phase but one has a wider shape</italic> –</p><p><italic>why would that be the best fit for AS profiles? It seems reasonable to at least compare the results from this approach to an unbiased approach where the entire set of AS events are clustered with no specific periodic profiles and then the most prominent periodic profiles are extracted or executing a more directed search against theoretical periodic profiles.</italic> </p><p>The difference in width of these curves came from analysis on periodic mRNA expression patterns (please see associated manuscript) where known and clearly periodic mRNAs were missed in our first pass analysis due to wider or narrower shapes expression curves. We dealt with this by including wider and narrower periodic seeds.</p><p>We also attempted an unbiased clustering approach for both AS and gene expression (this was the easiest first-pass analysis of the data), this analysis revealed very interesting results. However, we have detected ~30,000 AS events making it very difficult to de-convolute the clusters. We also found it hard to assign a specific “score” to AS events belonging to a cluster. Furthermore, we employed a Fourier transform in some of our preliminary analysis to identify periodic expression patterns as was previously reported by Whitfield et al. (2002), and found similar results. We did feel that the Fourier transform method likely works best when more sampling times are taken along the time course, which was a practical and financial limitation to our sequencing based approach. Below is a heat map representation of hierarchical clustering on all detected events.

We feel that an exhaustive comparison of methods to determine periodic AS/gene expression patterns is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>4) More convincing/exhaustive search of RBPs that may contribute to cell cycle AS:</p><p>While there's significant overlap between CLK1 inhibitor AS events and periodic cell cycle events, this only explains a fraction of all the periodic events they find. It would be good to acknowledge at least that there are likely other factors out there that contribute to this program of AS. The authors should discuss how much of the oscillation signal is explained by CLK1. The WB data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is not exhaustive, but it is convincing for those factors tested. It should be straightforward to supplement this analysis by applying their pipelines and RNA-seq data to report known/suspected splicing factors and/or RBPs that change at the level of GE or AS. Any changes found in this analysis could potentially contribute to the large AS program they observe beyond CLK1 regulation.</p><p>This comment was addressed by additional data and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>). Please see the response to essential revision point #2.</p><p>5) Analysis on IR/AS-PTC introducing events:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D/E</xref> suggests that periodic IR can affect transcript expression levels (probably by the introduction of PTCs) in the case of AURKB and some other genes they examined by qRT-PCR that are important for cell cycle progression. However <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> argues little overlap between splicing regulation and mRNA expression levels, save for 133 overlapping events. Are the events in the overlap of periodic AS and periodic gene expression overrepresented for IR like in their example for AURKB and/or other PTC-introducing AS? The same could be done with CLK1 regulated AS and gene expression that is mentioned in the text later (paragraph one, subheading “CLK1 regulates AS events in genes with critical roles in cell cycle control”).</p><p>We have verified that AURKB is indeed an NMD target (essential revision #4). Although the overlap is small, we addressed this point and show a table with the overlapping event types (see our response to the other comment #3 of this same reviewer). As you can see here, there is no specific enrichment for any of the four AS types shown here. As suggested by the reviewer the same overlap analysis was carried out for CLK1-regulated events.</p><p>6) Blot for phospho-SR proteins: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that CLK1 seems to be unique among splicing factors tested in periodic protein expression level changes. An obvious mechanism that likely contributes to the observed periodic splicing changes is altered SR protein phosphorylation, particularly since SRSF1 doesn't change protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Can the authors use a phospho-RS-specific antibody (1H4?) to see if the phosphorylation state of any SR proteins is altered through the cell cycle and, if so, if any of these phosphorylation changes are deadened upon CLK1 inhibition with TG003?</p><p>We have attempted this. Unfortunately the results were not consistently reproducible in cell synchrony experiments. Furthermore, we obtained different results when we used mab104 and mab1H4. In addition, conflicting results in terms of changes in the pattern of SR protein phosphorylation during cell cycle were reported previously by Fu and Manley’s labs using the same antibody and cell line.</p><p>7) Experimentally test known IR event identified in their analysis in CLK1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A and B</xref> show neither CLK1 mRNA levels nor inclusion of exon 4 changes significantly through the cell cycle. Boutz et al. (2014) and others cited within have described regulated intron retention (or &quot;detained introns&quot;) of the upstream and downstream introns flanking CLK1 exon 4 that affects the transcript's localization and stability. Since periodic IR is suggested to be a common point of AS regulation through the cell cycle in this paper, showing that these introns are or are not retained across the cell cycle using additional primer sets, as was done for exon 4 skipping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref>, could further rule out splicing regulation or add another interesting layer of regulation controlling CLK1 in the context of the cell cycle. Indeed, the MISO analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> calls IR in this region as one of the 1747 periodic splicing events (event: chr2:201726189-201725961:-@chr2:201724469-201724403:-) so this may very well be an additional layer of regulation upstream of the kinase-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated turnover that the authors convincingly demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>. Similarly, the authors could test and report results for variations of CLK1's 3'UTR.</p><p>Our data support a model in which CLK1 levels and activity change during the cell cycle. We agree with this reviewer that intron retention of CLK1 may very well be another form of regulation during cell cycle, but feel that investigating this aspect of CLK1 regulation is beyond the scope of what is already a result-rich manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
