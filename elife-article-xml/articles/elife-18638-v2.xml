Despite its central role in stress resistance, disease and aging, the mechanisms that control Hsf1 activity remain unresolved. Here we show that in budding yeast, Hsf1 basally associates with the chaperone Hsp70 and this association is transiently disrupted by heat shock, providing the first evidence that a chaperone repressor directly regulates Hsf1 activity. We develop and experimentally validate a mathematical model of Hsf1 activation by heat shock in which unfolded proteins compete with Hsf1 for binding to Hsp70. Surprisingly, we find that Hsf1 phosphorylation, previously thought to be required for activation, in fact only positively tunes Hsf1 and does so without affecting Hsp70 binding. Our work reveals two uncoupled forms of regulation - an ON/OFF chaperone switch and a tunable phosphorylation gain - that allow Hsf1 to flexibly integrate signals from the proteostasis network and cell signaling pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18638.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18638.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18638.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are strings of amino acids that carry out crucial activities inside cells, such as harvesting energy and generating the building blocks that cells need to grow. In order to carry out their specific roles inside the cell, the proteins need to “fold” into precise three-dimensional shapes.</p><p>Protein folding is critical for life, and cells don’t leave it up to chance. Cells employ “molecular chaperones” to help proteins to fold properly. However, under some conditions – such as high temperature – proteins are more difficult to fold and the chaperones can become overwhelmed. In these cases, unfolded proteins can pile up in the cell. This leads not only to the cell being unable to work properly, but also to the formation of toxic “aggregates”. These aggregates are tangles of unfolded proteins that are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p><p>Protein aggregates can be triggered by high temperature in a condition termed “heat shock”. A sensor named heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1 for short) increases the amount of chaperones following heat shock. But what controls the activity of Hsf1?</p><p>To answer this question, Zheng, Krakowiak et al. combined mathematical modelling and experiments in yeast cells. The most important finding is that the ‘on/off switch’ that controls Hsf1 is based on whether Hsf1 is itself bound to a chaperone. When bound to the chaperone, Hsf1 is turned ‘off’; when the chaperone falls off, Hsf1 turns ‘on’ and makes more chaperones; when there are enough chaperones, they once again bind to Hsf1 and turn it back ‘off’. In this way, Hsf1 and the chaperones form a feedback loop that ensures that there are always enough chaperones to keep the cell’s proteins folded.</p><p>Now that we know how Hsf1 is controlled, can we harness this understanding to tune the activity of Hsf1 without disrupting how the chaperones work? If we can activate Hsf1, we can provide cells with more chaperones. This could be a therapeutic strategy to combat neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18638.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18638.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>heat shock</kwd><kwd>Hsf1</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>systems modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5 OD017941-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pincus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1350949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalil</surname><given-names>Ahmad S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001353</institution-id><institution>Alexander and Margaret Stewart Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pincus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative dissection of the roles of chaperone binding and phosphorylation in regulating heat shock factor 1 leads to a predictive model of the dynamics of the yeast heat shock response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The heat shock response is an ancient and conserved signaling pathway in cells that regulates the expression of molecular chaperones in the presence of thermal and other environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindquist, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). Chaperones function to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by enabling de novo protein folding in the crowded intracellular environment and targeting proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). Although the heat shock response has been extensively studied, key aspects of the pathway remain a mystery including the mechanisms governing its activation and regulation.</p><p>In eukaryotes, the master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response is heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). Hsf1 and its cognate DNA binding site, the heat shock element (HSE), represent one of the most conserved protein•DNA interactions known, having been maintained since the last common ancestor of the eukaryotic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu, 1995</xref>). The depth of functional conservation is underscored by the observation that an active form of human Hsf1 can carry out the essential function of Hsf1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, both mammalian and yeast Hsf1 drive a compact set of genes dedicated to proteostasis that forms a densely connected network centered around Hsp70, Hsp40 and Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). The small size of the Hsf1 regulon belies its outsize importance in cellular viability.</p><p>In addition to maintaining proteostasis at the cellular level, Hsf1 plays important roles in organismal health and disease. Critically, Hsf1 is frequently activated in cancer cells: it has been shown to be required for cancer progression in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2007</xref>), its activation is associated with poor prognosis in many human cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santagata et al., 2011</xref>), and it drives cancer-specific gene expression programs in both tumor cells and the supporting stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, a lack of Hsf1 activity has been suggested to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases with hallmark protein aggregates, and activation of Hsf1 has been proposed as a therapeutic avenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neef et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Hsf1 contributes to organismal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2003</xref>) and protects against obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the deep conservation of Hsf1 and its physiological and clinical importance, the mechanisms regulating Hsf1 activity during stress remain poorly defined, and thus to date it is unclear how Hsf1 controls the heat shock response in cells. Some aspects of Hsf1 regulation are organism- and cell type-specific, such as trimerization, which is a regulated event in mammalian cells but constitutive in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sorger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Westwood et al., 1991</xref>). However, two common features are thought to contribute to Hsf1 regulation in all organisms: chaperone titration and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The chaperone titration model suggests that Hsf1 is bound in an inhibitory complex by chaperones in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voellmy and Boellmann, 2007</xref>). Upon heat shock, the chaperones are titrated away by unfolded or misfolded proteins, leaving Hsf1 free to activate transcription of chaperone genes. Once proteostasis is restored, client-free chaperones again bind to Hsf1 and deactivate it. There is biochemical, pharmacological and genetic evidence to support roles for the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones, their co-chaperones and the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex in regulating Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baler et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duina et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neef et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). However, direct, unequivocal evidence for this model – i.e., a complete cycle of Hsf1 ‘switching’ by dynamic dissociation and re-association with specific chaperone(s) during heat shock – is lacking. As a result, though widely invoked, the details of the chaperone titration model remain unclear.</p><p>The second putative Hsf1 regulatory mechanism common across organisms is heat shock-dependent phosphorylation. Multiple phosphorylation sites have been mapped on Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guettouche et al., 2005</xref>), and mutational analysis has suggested activating, repressing, fine-tuning and condition-specific roles for individual sites of phosphorylation in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budzynski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hahn and Thiele, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashikawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashikawa and Sakurai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hietakangas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Høj and Jakobsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kline and Morimoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knauf et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soncin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorger and Pelham, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work in which 15 phosphorylation sites were simultaneously mutated in human Hsf1 failed to disrupt Hsf1 activation during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budzynski et al., 2015</xref>), and a genome-wide RNAi-based screen for modulators of Hsf1 activity found no evidence for kinase regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raychaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, despite being a hallmark of the heat shock response, no clear role for Hsf1 phosphorylation has yet emerged.</p><p>Here, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to elucidate the mechanism of Hsf1-mediated activation and control of the heat shock response in budding yeast. Specifically, we combine mass spectrometry, biochemistry, mathematical modeling, genetics and synthetic biology to propose and validate that Hsp70 dynamically interacts with Hsf1 to form the basis of a bona fide activation ‘switch’ and feedback loop that regulates Hsf1 activity during heat shock. Based on this finding, we then investigate the role and quantitative contribution of Hsf1 phosphorylation in regulating the output of the heat shock transcriptional response. We use en masse mutational analysis, combined with transcriptomic and genome-wide ChIP-seq measurements, to systematically define the function of Hsf1 phosphorylation. We find that phosphorylation is fully dispensable for Hsf1 activation during heat shock, but contributes by enhancing transcriptional output levels as a 'positive gain'. Phosphorylation does not control the interaction between Hsf1 and Hsp70, but rather enhances transcription independent of whether Hsp70 is bound or not. Our findings reveal that Hsf1 uses these two modes of regulation – a chaperone switch and phosphorylation fine-tuning – in a largely uncoupled fashion to dynamically control the heat shock response. We propose that this allows Hsf1 to integrate diverse signaling information without disrupting its direct readout of the proteostasis network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hsp70 binds to Hsf1 and transiently dissociates during heat shock</title><p>To identify proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of Hsf1 during heat shock, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of Hsf1 from cells harvested over time following a shift from 25°C to 39°C and analyzed the IP samples by mass spectrometry (MS).

We purified recombinant Hsf1-6xHIS and 6xHIS-3xFLAG-Ssa2 from <italic>E. coli</italic>, mixed the recombinant proteins together at an equimolar ratio and performed an anti-FLAG IP. We precipitated Hsf1 only in the presence of Ssa2, demonstrating that they can specifically and directly bind to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We reversed the affinity tags and likewise precipitated Ssa2 in the presence of 3xFLAG-Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Addition of ATP neither enhanced nor disrupted the interaction between Hsf1 and Ssa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, addition of a five-fold molar excess of the aggregation-prone, Alzheimer’s disease-associated Aβ42 peptide reduced the interaction between Hsf1 and Ssa2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This suggests that hydrophobic peptides can titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro results confirm that Hsp70 dynamically dissociates and re-associates with Hsf1 during heat shock.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A mathematical model of the heat shock response</title><p>Based on our finding that Hsp70 transiently dissociates from Hsf1 during heat shock, we next sought to develop a simple mathematical model of the heat shock response. The goal of the model was two-fold: (1) to quantitatively explore if Hsp70 interaction ‘switching’ could serve as a core, minimal regulatory mechanism that recapitulates the dynamics of heat shock response; (2) to generate quantitative predictions to further test this molecular mechanism. Our model consisted of a system of six coupled ordinary differential equations, describing a feedback loop in which free Hsf1 induces production of Hsp70, and free Hsp70 in turn binds to Hsf1 in a transcriptionally inactive complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, see Materials and methods). In addition to binding to Hsf1, Hsp70 can also bind to an unfolded protein (UP), but cannot bind to both Hsf1 and UP simultaneously. UPs are introduced at a level that is based on the temperature in accordance with biophysical measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lepock et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheff et al., 2015</xref>). In this manner, temperature upshifts increase the level of UPs, simulating protein folding stress caused by heat shock. UPs titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1, leaving Hsf1 free to activate expression of more Hsp70, thus generating the feedback loop. This minimal model ignores any potential role for phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications in regulating Hsf1 activity.</p><p>We used the apparent kinetics of Hsp70 dissociation from Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to constrain the model by computationally screening for parameter sets that captured key features of these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). This parameter screening approach revealed that a broad range of values satisfied the experimental constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We settled on parameter values that appeared most frequently in simulations that fulfilled the experimental constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The chaperone titration model recapitulates Hsf1 activation dynamics</title><p>We tested the mathematical model by simulating time courses of temperature upshifts (25°C to 35°C, 25°C to 39°C, and 25°C to 43°C). As an output of the model, we tracked transcription of a ‘reporter’ whose levels are dependent on Hsf1 activity. This in silico reporter can be directly compared to experimental measurements of an Hsf1-dependent HSE-YFP reporter that we integrated into the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Simulations of the HSE-YFP reporter generated induction curves that reached temperature-dependent plateaus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since YFP is a long-lived protein – in cells and in the model – the plateaus indicate that no more YFP is being produced in the simulation and Hsf1 has deactivated. We performed the same temperature step time course experiments in cells and measured the HSE-YFP reporter at discrete time points by flow cytometry. As predicted by the model, we observed induction leading to temperature-dependent maximal responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, following the initial rapid accumulation of YFP that was predicted by the model, the cells continued to accumulate signal slowly through the later time points (this later phase of transcriptional output is addressed further below). These results suggest that a chaperone titration model is sufficient to account for the immediate Hsf1 activation dynamics in response to temperature steps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Predicting synthetic perturbations of the Hsf1-Hsp70 feedback loop</title><p>To rigorously test our model of the heat shock response, we used the mathematical framework to predict the Hsf1 activation response for synthetic perturbations of the feedback loop. For example, in addition to activation by UPs (via increases in temperature), the model predicted that Hsf1 transcriptional activity can be driven by Hsf1 overexpression in the absence of temperature upshifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Less intuitively, the model also predicted that overexpression of an Hsf1 ‘decoy’, which lacks the ability to trimerize or bind DNA, would activate endogenous Hsf1 by titrating Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). We next used synthetic biology approaches to experimentally test the model predictions. We constructed a decoy mutant by removing the DNA binding and trimerization domains from Hsf1 and replacing them with the well-folded fluorescent protein mKate2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then placed either a wild type allele of <italic>HSF1</italic> or the decoy under the synthetic control of a β-estradiol (estradiol) inducible system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods). In agreement with the model, both full length Hsf1 and the decoy activated the HSE-YFP reporter in dose-dependent manners, with full length Hsf1 serving as a more potent activator than the decoy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). By contrast, expression of mKate2 alone led to only a modest increase in HSE-YFP levels as a function of estradiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, the decoy does not form aggregates when overexpressed, remaining diffusely localized in the nucleus in both basal and heat shock conditions, but does interact with the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1/2 and disrupts the interaction between endogenous Hsf1 and Ssa1/2 in co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Domain truncation analysis of the decoy revealed that the C-terminal activation domain of Hsf1 is both necessary and sufficient to activate endogenous Hsf1, while the N-terminal activation domain is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, the decoy is not merely a UP, but rather functions as a specific activator of Hsf1, likely by titrating away Hsp70 via its C-terminal activation domain.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18638.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prediction and validation of synthetic perturbations to the Hsf1-Hsp70 feedback loop.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of activation by overexpressing full length Hsf1.

To isolate the consequences of inducing the transcriptional program in the absence of stress, we constructed a synthetic fusion of the Hsf1 DNA binding and trimerization domains with a transcriptional activation domain derived from the herpes simplex virus protein 16 (DBD<sub>Hsf1</sub>-VP16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadowski et al., 1988</xref>), and placed this fusion under estradiol control.

These data suggest that over-activating the Hsf1 transcriptional program impairs growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppress Hsf1 overexpression</title><p>Since Hsf1 overexpression impairs growth, inhibitors of Hsf1 activity should be genetic suppressors of the growth phenotype. To test if chaperones would behave as Hsf1 inhibitors, we placed Ssa2 (Hsp70), Hsc82 (Hsp90) and Ydj1 (Hsp40) under the control of strong Hsf1-independent promoters (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solís et al., 2016</xref>) and assayed for their ability to suppress the growth defect of cells overexpressing Hsf1. Interestingly, both Hsp70 and Hsp40 partially suppressed the growth inhibition caused by Hsf1 overexpression, while Hsp90 failed to provide any growth rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data are consistent with prior reports in mammalian cells showing that overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 attenuate Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 1998</xref>) and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showing that loss of Hsp70 results in &gt;10 fold more Hsf1 activation than loss of Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guisbert et al., 2013</xref>). Since Hsp40 chaperones deliver substrates and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>), Hsp40 may be enhancing the activity of endogenous Hsp70 to suppress Hsf1 overexpression. To determine if Hsp40 is required for efficient Hsp70 binding to Hsf1, we deleted <italic>YDJ1</italic> and performed a co-IP heat shock time course. We observed that Hsp70 was still able to robustly bind to Hsf1 under basal conditions and transiently dissociate during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, basal Hsf1 activity was increased &gt;3 fold as measured by the HSE-YFP reporter in <italic>ydj1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that there is likely to be greater total Hsp70 in these cells and complicating direct comparison of <italic>ydj1∆</italic> and wild type cells. Thus, overexpression of Hsp40 may directly increase the ability for Hsp70 to bind to Hsf1 or generally improve global proteostasis such that there is more unoccupied Hsp70 available to repress Hsf1. Co-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 afforded more rescue than either chaperone alone, but addition of Hsp90 did not enhance the suppression provided by Hsp70 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hsp70 and Hsp40 together diminished the ability of Hsf1 and the decoy to inhibit growth and induce the HSE-YFP reporter across the estradiol dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By contrast, Hsp90 failed to rescue growth or reduce HSE-YFP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Given these results, we wondered if we could identify a role for phosphorylation in regulating Hsf1 activity. To address this question, we mapped Hsf1 phosphorylation sites in basal and heat shock conditions, performed site-directed mutagenesis of identified sites and assayed for changes in HSE-YFP levels (see Materials and methods). Across 11 IP/MS experiments, we observed phosphorylation of 73 out of 153 total serine and threonine (S/T) residues in Hsf1 in at least one condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Strikingly, none of the 40 single point mutations we tested – whether mutated to alanine to remove the ability to be phosphorylated or to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation – showed significant differences in HSE-YFP levels compared to wild type Hsf1 in basal or heat shock conditions, even when we created sextuple mutants of clustered residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Removing phosphorylation modestly reduces Hsf1 activity during heat shock</title><p>Since Hsf1 activity was robust to so many mutations, we opted to remove phosphorylation altogether.

To determine if Hsf1 phosphorylation could explain this sustained activity, we monitored Hsf1 phosphorylation kinetics via mobility shift of Hsf1-3xFLAG-V5 throughout a heat shock time course by Western blot. Rather than coinciding with the dissociation of Hsp70, which occurs within the first five minutes following temperature upshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), Hsf1 phosphorylation peaked after 20 min and was maintained out to at least two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

However, the elegance of this model has perhaps overshadowed the lack of data to support it. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence for a chaperone titration model in budding yeast. Specifically, we showed that the Hsp70 chaperone binds to Hsf1 in basal conditions, dissociates during the acute phase of heat shock, and subsequently re-associates at later time points, thus providing the first direct evidence of a dynamic Hsf1 ‘switch’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we reconstituted the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 in vitro with recombinant proteins and partially disrupted the complex with a hydrophobic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then constructed a minimal mathematical model of the Hsp70 feedback loop, and showed that it recapitulated the dynamics of Hsf1 transcriptional activity during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). The model also correctly predicted that synthetic perturbations to the feedback loop, such as adding a ‘decoy’ of Hsf1, would activate the endogenous Hsf1 response via Hsp70 titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, we provided independent genetic support for the model by showing that increased expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 (an Hsp70 co-factor) suppresses the growth impairment caused by Hsf1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, biochemical, genetic and computational approaches converged to support a model in which Hsp70 and Hsf1 form a feedback loop that controls heat shock response activation.</p><p>While our results are consistent with studies reporting biochemical and genetic interactions between Hsf1 and Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baler et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guisbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 1998</xref>), they are inconsistent with other reports that implicate Hsp90 as a major repressor of Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duina et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zou et al., 1998</xref>). Biochemically, our inability to detect Hsp90 binding to Hsf1 could be due to the serial affinity purification strategy that we employed: if Hsp90 weakly associates with Hsf1, we would likely lose the interaction during the two-step purification. However, the combination of the lack of biochemical evidence with the genetic result that Hsp90 overexpression is unable to suppress Hsf1 overexpression suggests a parsimonious explanation that Hsp90 simply does not repress yeast Hsf1.

Consistent with this observation, human Hsf1 also remained heat shock-inducible following mutation of a subset of its phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budzynski et al., 2015</xref>). Despite its qualitative functionality in the absence of phosphorylation, Hsf1<sup>∆po4</sup> was quantitatively impaired in its ability to induce its target genes during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Conversely, mimicking hyper-phosphorylation increased basal expression of the Hsf1 target regulon without disrupting its heat shock inducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). Moreover, the number of phospho-mimetic residues correlated with transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that phosphorylation is required for activation, we conclude that phosphorylation is not the switch that activates Hsf1; rather, phosphorylation is a positive fine-tuner that amplifies the transcriptional activity of Hsf1. We propose that increased negative charge in the transcriptional activation domains of Hsf1, endowed by phosphorylation or phospho-mimetic mutations, increases the ability of Hsf1 to recruit the Mediator complex and initiate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In this manner, phosphorylation renders the activation domains into the 'acid blobs' that have long been associated with potent transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sigler, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Although this work yields a coherent synthesized model for Hsf1 regulation during heat shock, a number of interesting questions remain. These include identifying the molecular determinants of the Hsf1•Hsp70 interaction, defining the mechanism by which Hsp70 represses Hsf1 under basal conditions and whether this mechanism also applies to Hsf1 deactivation, determining potential roles for other chaperones (such as Hsp40, Hsp90 and chaperonins) in Hsf1 regulation – particularly in different evolutionary lineages – and identifying the kinases that phosphorylate Hsf1. On the latter, many kinases have been shown to regulate Hsf1 in various conditions, but the pathways that converge on Hsf1 have yet to be systematically defined. Given the low level of conservation of the Hsf1 activation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>) and the preponderance of S/T residues in putatively unstructured, solvent exposed regions of the protein, many kinases could potentially find a substrate site on Hsf1. Defining the cohort of active kinases present in the nucleus in various conditions would provide a useful starting point to identify the kinases responsible for phosphorylating Hsf1.</p><p>Although both Hsp70 binding and phosphorylation contribute to regulating Hsf1 activity, they are independent events that exert orthogonal control. Hsf1 phosphorylation does not interfere with Hsp70 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), and the kinetics of Hsf1 phosphorylation are delayed with respect to Hsp70 dissociation, with phosphorylation peaking after Hsp70 has re-associated with Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). These two distinct regulatory modes correlate with an immediate surge in Hsf1 transcriptional activity followed by a sustained moderate level of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Uncoupled regulation by chaperone binding and phosphorylation allows Hsf1 to function as an integration hub. Hsf1 can directly link to the proteostasis network by sensing the availability of Hsp70 as a proxy for protein folding conditions as well as respond to signals from multiple kinase pathways that convey information about other intracellular and extracellular conditions, such as oxidative stress and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hahn and Thiele, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). In this manner, proteotoxic stress could activate Hsf1 without phosphorylation, and kinases could activate Hsf1 without chaperone dissociation.</p><p>In this study, we employed a suite of approaches that allowed us to converge on a simple model of Hsf1 regulation and the ensuing dynamics of the heat shock response in budding yeast. However, given the poor conservation of the regulatory domains of Hsf1, combined with the promiscuity of chaperone protein interactions and the ease with which phosphorylation sites are gained and lost through evolution, Hsf1 regulation has the potential to be rewired in different organisms and perhaps even in different cell types within the same organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guisbert et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, this work for the first time defines a regulatory scheme that synthesizes the roles of both canonical Hsf1 regulatory mechanisms, and as such can serve as both a precedent and template for the dissection of Hsf1 regulation in other cellular models. With a quantitative understanding of how Hsf1 is regulated when it is functioning properly, we can begin to unravel how it breaks down in neurodegenerative disorders and is usurped in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this work are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">2</xref>, respectively.

According to the model, free Hsp70 binds to Hsf1 in a transcriptionally inactive complex, while free Hsf1 induces production of Hsp70 (and the YFP reporter). In addition to binding to Hsf1, Hsp70 can also bind to unfolded protein (UP) and become titrated away from Hsf1. There are a few key assumptions to the model. First, the model assumes Hsp70 cannot bind to both Hsf1 and UP simultaneously. Second, the dilution rate of YFP molecules due to cell division is assumed to be negligible (<italic>k<sub>dil</sub></italic> ~0); this is because the time course for our simulations and reporter heat shock assays is short (~1 cell generation) and YFP molecules are relatively long lived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Third, this initial implementation of the model ignores any potential role for Hsf1 phosphorylation. Fourth, for simplicity, the model assumes the on-rate constants of Hsp70 for both clients (UP and Hsf1) are the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pierpaoli et al., 1998</xref>).

rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Specifically, we chose a range of values for each parameter (Figure S2C). We then ran simulations for all possible combinations of parameters equally distributed across the ranges (7 × 10<sup>5</sup> total parameters) to select parameter sets that satisfy three features of our Hsp70 dissociation data. First, Hsf1 must be bound to Hsp70 in basal conditions at 25°C. Second, the Hsf1•Hsp70 complex must dissociate to ≤10% of its basal level within five minutes following a shift from 25°C to 39°C. Third, the Hsf1•Hsp70 complex must re-associate to ≥90% of its initial level within 60 min following a shift from 25°C to 39°C. As an initial condition, we set the ratio of the level of Hsp70:Hsf1 to 500:1, which is in the range of measured values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>). We obtained parameter sets that satisfied these constraints (Figure S2C), from which we selected final parameters that quantitatively recapitulated the transient dissociation behavior of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Satisfyingly, this analysis revealed that most parameters tolerated a broad range of values (Figure S2C), provided that Hsf1 induces transcription cooperatively (i.e. one of our assumptions), which is consistent with prior work showing that Hsf1 binds DNA as a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18638.021</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Model parameter values.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18638.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18638.021</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><p><italic>Parameter</italic></p> </th><th valign="top"><p><italic>Value</italic></p> </th><th valign="top"><p><italic>Description</italic></p> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>3</sub></p></td><td valign="top"><p>166.8 min<sup>−1</sup> a.u.<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td valign="top"><p>Client•Hsp70 on-rate constant</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>k<sub>2</sub></p></td><td valign="top"><p>2.783 min<sup>−1</sup></p> </td><td valign="top"><p>Hsp70•HSF1 off-rate constant</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>k<sub>4</sub></p></td><td valign="top"><p>0.0464 min<sup>−1</sup></p> </td><td valign="top"><p>Hsp70•UP off-rate constant</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>k<sub>5</sub></p></td><td valign="top"><p>4.64e-7 min<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td valign="top"><p>Degradation rate of UP by Hsp70•UP</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p><italic>β</italic></p> </td><td valign="top"><p>1.778 min<sup>−1</sup></p> </td><td valign="top"><p>Transcriptional activation rate</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>K<sub>d</sub></p></td><td valign="top"><p>0.0022 a.u.</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Dissociation constant of Hsf1-DNA interaction</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>k<sub>dil</sub> (fixed)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>0 min<sup>−1</sup></p> </td><td valign="top"><p>Dilution rate of YFP</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>n (fixed)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>3</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Hill coefficient</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>To simulate responses for different heat shock temperatures, we used a simple function to relate the concentration of UPs with temperature (Figure S2B). According to calorimetry and other previous work investigating cellular protein unfolding during heat shock, the relationship between UP and temperature can be simply described by an exponential function for low temperatures (25°C–50°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lepock et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheff et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we used an exponential function that passes through our fixed value of [UP] at 39°C (the value used for the parameter screen described above, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), a small basal value of [UP] at 25°C ([UP]<sub>o</sub> = 0.52), and [UP] values at other temperatures that generally capture steady state YFP reporter outputs. [UP] for other temperatures could then be obtained using this function, and used as initial values for simulating upshifts to other temperatures, such 35°C and 43°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18638.022</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Model initial conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18638.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18638.022</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Species</p></th><th><p>Initial value (a.u.)</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>[HSP]<sub>o</sub></p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Free Hps70</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[Hsf1]<sub>o</sub></p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>Free Hsf1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[HSP•Hsf1]<sub>o</sub></p></td><td><p>1/500</p> </td><td><p>HSP70•Hsf1 complex</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[HSP•UP]<sub>o</sub></p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>Hsp70•UP complex</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[YFP]<sub>o</sub></p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Initial YFP concentration</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[UP]<sub>o</sub> (@ 39°C)</p></td><td><p>10.51</p></td><td><p>UP concentration at 39°C</p> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Simulation details</title><p>All simulations were run on MATLAB; ode23s was used to solve our coupled ordinary differential equations for a length of two hours.

At designated time points, 50 µl samples were taken and cycloheximide was added at 50 µg/ml to arrest translation. Arrested cells were incubated at 30°C for 2 hr to allow fluorophores to mature. Samples were measured by flow cytometry, and population medians were computed with FlowJo. Each data point is the mean of three or four biological replicates. Error bars are the standard deviation.</p><p>For basal versus heat shock experiments, we developed a protocol in which samples were pulsed with repeated 15 min heat shocks at 39°C followed by recovery at 25°C for 45 min. As a control, a sample was kept at 25°C during the same time as heat-shocked pulses experiment. All experiments were performed using C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Cells had been serially diluted five times (1:5) in SDC and grown overnight at room temperature. Cells in logarithmic phase were chosen the next morning for the experiment and 50 µl of each strain was transferred to two sets of PCR tubes and thermal cycled as described above.

The GEM construct makes the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter ‘leaky’ enough that the cells are viable in the absence of estradiol and the presence of glucose. Cells were first grown to saturation overnight in synthetic media with dextrose and complete amino acids (SDC). To assay for growth impairment and transcriptional activity as a function of expression level, cells in 10 different concentrations of estradiol ranging from 512 nM to 1 nM in SDC across a two-fold serial dilution series in deep well 96 well plates (5 µl of saturated culture diluted into 1 ml of each estradiol concentration). Each dose of estradiol was performed in triplicate. To prevent saturation of the cultures, each estradiol concentration was serially diluted 1:4 into media with the same concentration of estradiol. Following 18 hr of growth, cell counts, HSE-YFP levels and mKate levels were measured by flow cytometry by sampling 10 µl of each culture (BD LSRFortessa equipped with a 96-well plate high-throughput sampler) and the data were analyzed in FlowJo.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamic control of Hsf1 during heat shock by a chaperone switch and phosphorylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matthias P Mayer (Reviewer #1) and David S Gross (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Here, the authors rigorously tested two previously proposed hypotheses for Hsf1-dependent transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes upon temperature upshift in yeast: the chaperone titration model, which assumes that chaperones inhibit Hsf1 under non-stress conditions and are titrated away by stress-denatured proteins, and the Hsf1 phosphorylation model, which argues that Hsf1 is inhibited and activated by differential phosphorylation. They also re-assessed the somewhat enigmatic role of Hsf1 phosphorylation in its transcriptional activation. Through the use of mass spectrometry to identity a large number of heat shock-induced Hsf1 phosphorylation sites, the generation of phosphosite mutants, yeast genetic analysis, mathematical modeling, and a synthetic biology approach, the authors provide convincing evidence that Hsf1 is repressed by the Hsp70 chaperone in the non-stressed state and that titration of Hsp70 by unfolded proteins dominates the initial phase of the heat shock response. Phosphorylation of Hsf1 occurs only at later stages of the response and is responsible for sustained induction of target genes by recruitment of the mediator complex to the heat shock promoters, rather than Hsp70 dissociation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are a number of issues with the modeling of the heat shock response that need addressing:</p><p>A) The differential equations mentioned in the Materials and methods seems to contain some mistakes:</p><p>First equation: shouldn't it be &quot;- <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>[<italic>HSP][UP</italic>] &quot; instead of &quot;+ <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>[<italic>HSP][UP</italic>]&quot;, as one would expect the concentration of free Hsp to decrease as it associates with unfolded protein?</p><p>B) Third equation: a &quot;- <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>[<italic>UP</italic>] &quot; parameter could be added to the equation, as the unfolded proteins could also be degraded independently of Hsp70 or in other ways like aggregation be taken out of the equation.</p><p>C) How are the initial conditions used for the mathematical model established? Although the model nicely recapitulates the authors' observations, the basic settings of the parameters are far from known values. For example, the number of Hsf1 molecules per yeast cells was determined to be 49 (Chong et al. 2015) to 361 (Kulak et al. 2014), and the number of Ssa1 + Ssa2 molecules together was 19,306 (Chong et al. 2015) to 435,927 (Kulak et al. 2014), which gives a ratio of Hsp70 to Hsf1 of 394 to 1207. In their model the authors use a value of 10. Also, does 10.51 times more unfolded proteins than Hsp70 make sense? Since Hsp70 is considered to be 1% of cellular proteins, such a ratio would mean that 10% of cellular proteins misfold at a temperature when yeast is still able to grow.</p><p>D) <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> are bimolecular rate constants and should have the unit min<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>.

Does the authors' model also recapitulate the shut-off phase of the heat shock response?</p><p>2) The authors present intriguing genetic evidence indicating that Hsp40 enhances the ability of Hsp70 to suppress Hsf1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This raises the question of whether Hsp40 enhances Hsp70 binding to Hsf1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The authors should compare the co-IP heat shock time course in WT and <italic>ydj1Δ</italic> mutant cells?</p><p>3) The prior literature on the interaction of Hsf1 with Hsp70 needs to be discussed in more depth (see below for examples).</p><p>A) To strengthen their argument, Guisbert et al.

Because Hsf1 has a role in so many cellular processes, some discussion of the possibility that the highly mutagenized Hsf1 protein may not totally reflect wild type Hsf1 function with respect to chaperone activation but still may retain some basal function required for cell viability is needed.</p><p>In this regard, although not essential, further experimental evidence that the highly mutated non-phosphorylatable Hsf1 is not acting as a neomorph would strengthen the paper, as would some experiments with another non-amyloidogenic unfolded protein.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18638.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There are a number of issues with the modeling of the heat shock response that need addressing:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The differential equations mentioned in the Materials and methods seems to contain some mistakes:</italic> </p><p><italic>First equation: shouldn't it be &quot;- k<sub>3</sub>[HSP][UP] &quot; instead of &quot;+ k<sub>3</sub>[HSP][UP]&quot;, as one would expect the concentration of free Hsp to decrease as it associates with unfolded protein?</italic> </p><p>We have corrected this typo in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>B) Third equation: a &quot;- k<sub>6</sub>[UP] &quot; parameter could be added to the equation, as the unfolded proteins could also be degraded independently of Hsp70 or in other ways like aggregation be taken out of the equation.</italic> </p><p>We agree that there are likely to be Hsp70-independent mechanisms of protein degradation and that we could include such a term in the model (just as there are many other chaperones that participate in protein folding and are part of the Hsf1 target regulon). However, since we don’t know the rate at which this occurs relative to Hsp70-dependent degradation, we chose to keep the model narrowly focused on the roles of Hsp70 and omit this term. In future iterations of the model where the aim is to more realistically capture the full scope of events and activities that occur during heat shock, we will factor in other degradation pathways.</p><p><italic>C) How are the initial conditions used for the mathematical model established? Although the model nicely recapitulates the authors' observations, the basic settings of the parameters are far from known values. For example, the number of Hsf1 molecules per yeast cells was determined to be 49 (Chong et al. 2015) to 361 (Kulak et al. 2014), and the number of Ssa1 + Ssa2 molecules together was 19,306 (Chong et al. 2015) to 435,927 (Kulak et al. 2014), which gives a ratio of Hsp70 to Hsf1 of 394 to 1207.

Since Hsp70 is considered to be 1% of cellular proteins, such a ratio would mean that 10% of cellular proteins misfold at a temperature when yeast is still able to grow.</italic> </p><p>We have explored more thoroughly how the values chosen for the initial conditions affect the model. In particular, we increased the ratio of Hsp70:Hsf1 to a more realistic 500:1and found that we can still get the model to recapitulate the data. We replaced all model plots in the paper with results from simulations that include this constraint. As for the level of unfolded proteins, the 10.51 value is the initial bolus of unfolded proteins that appear immediately upon temperature upshift: this value drops back to zero once homeostasis is restored, consistent with a resumption of cell growth.</p><p><italic>D) k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>3</sub> are bimolecular rate constants and should have the unit min<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>. The actually observed association rate depends on the concentration of the components, in this case Hsp70, which changes after heat shock.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected the units of these terms to reflect that they are bimolecular rate constants. However, we used arbitrary concentration units in the model (rather than molarity), so the units are min<sup>-1</sup> a.u.<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p><italic>E) It would also be interesting to look at recovery from heat shock when the unfolded proteins are cleared out and the system returns to its baseline. Does the authors' model also recapitulate the shut-off phase of the heat shock response?</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting idea. However, all of the experiments we performed were step inputs where we increased the temperature and maintained it at the elevated level for the duration of the experiment; we did not perform any experiments where we heat shocked the cells and then returned them to the basal temperature to monitor deactivation. Thus we have nothing for the model to recapitulate. We will incorporate this into future work.</p><p><italic>2) The authors present intriguing genetic evidence indicating that Hsp40 enhances the ability of Hsp70 to suppress Hsf1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This raises the question of whether Hsp40 enhances Hsp70 binding to Hsf1</italic> in vivo <italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The authors should compare the co-IP heat shock time course in WT and ydj1Δ mutant cells?</italic> </p><p>We knocked out <italic>YDJ1</italic> in the background of our Hsf1-3xFLAG-V5 strain and performed the co-IP heat shock time course. We also monitored Hsf1 transcriptional activity in the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> strain under basal and heat shock conditions using the HSE-YFP reporter. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and described in the subsection “Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppress Hsf1 overexpression”. We observed that Hsf1 was still able to bind to Hsp70 in the absence of Ydj1 under basal conditions and transiently dissociate during heat shock. In fact, there appears to be more Hsp70 relative to Hsf1 in the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> strain compared to wild type. Also, the degree of Hsp70 dissociation was reduced and the duration of the dissociation was shorter. So at a first pass, it appears that loss of this Hsp40 <italic>increases</italic> the association between Hsf1 and Hsp70 rather than decreasing the association as would be expected if it enhanced binding. However, the problem with interpreting this experiment is revealed by the HSE-YFP reporter assay: the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> cells have ~3-fold higher HSE-YFP levels than wild type cells under basal conditions. Since all four <italic>SSA</italic> genes are Hsf1 targets, it is likely that there is more total Hsp70 in the cell under basal conditions in the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> strain. Thus, without a conditional depletion of Ydj1, the altered initial conditions in the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> strain preclude a direct comparison of the role of Hsp40 in the binding of Hsp70 to Hsf1. We look forward to exploring the roles of the Hsp70 co-chaperones in regulating Hsf1 in depth in future work.</p><p><italic>3) The prior literature on the interaction of Hsf1 with Hsp70 needs to be discussed in more depth (see below for examples).</italic></p><p><italic>A) To strengthen their argument, Guisbert et al. (2013) should be cited, where the Morimoto lab shows through a genome wide screen that knockdown of hsp70 not hsp90 yields the largest activation of heat shock responders, hsp70 and a small hsp.</italic> </p><p>We have referenced and included discussion of this paper (subsection “Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppress Hsf1 overexpression”).</p><p><italic>B) It was shown that deletion of hsc82, the yeast Hsp90, and cpr7, an Hsp90 cochaperone, leads to the induction of the heat shock response (Duina et al. 1998 JBC). The authors should discuss this discrepancy with their inability to find a role for Hsp90.</italic> </p><p>We have included discussion of this discrepancy (Discussion, third paragraph). We can rationalize this genetic result by supposing that loss of Hsp90 function impairs general proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins that titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1. We would also invoke this reasoning to explain why Hsp90 inhibitors activate Hsf1.</p><p><italic>C) The Shi et al. (1998) paper from the Morimoto group addressing the regulatory mechanism of human HSF1 and deriving similar conclusions to the authors with respect to the role of Hsp70, is relevant, and should be discussed by the authors in the context of their findings.</italic> </p><p>We have now included a discussion of this work with respect to our results in addition to the reference we had already included (subsection “Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppress Hsf1 overexpression” and Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>D) It is becoming more apparent in recent years that Hsf1 has pleotropic effects in cell growth, proliferation, protein translation and stress protection which appear independent of chaperone activation (e.g. Baird et al., Science 2014; Mendillo et al., Cell 2013; Santagata et al., Science 2013). Because Hsf1 has a role in so many cellular processes, some discussion of the possibility that the highly mutagenized Hsf1 protein may not totally reflect wild type Hsf1 function with respect to chaperone activation but still may retain some basal function required for cell viability is needed.</italic> </p><p>In another study from the Pincus and Denic labs (Solís et al. 2016), we have shown that the essential function of yeast Hsf1 is in fact to drive basal expression of chaperones. Thus, the highly mutagenized Hsf1 mutants we describe here, which support growth when expressed as the only copy of Hsf1 in the cell, are performing their essential basal function of driving chaperone gene expression (as can be seen in the RNA seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>).</p><p><italic>In this regard, although not essential, further experimental evidence that the highly mutated non-phosphorylatable Hsf1 is not acting as a neomorph would strengthen the paper, as would some experiments with another non-amyloidogenic unfolded protein.</italic> </p><p>To strengthen the argument that Hsf1<sup>∆po4</sup> is not a neomorph, we monitored its subcellular localization and performed ChIP-seq of wild type Hsf1 and Hsf1<sup>∆po4</sup>. As can be seen in Figure 4—figure supplement 4D, the localization patterns are the same. And importantly, as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 4E, the genome-wide DNA binding profiles of wild type Hsf1 and Hsf1<sup>∆po4</sup> are superimposable, indicating that the mutations we introduced in the DNA binding domain do not alter DNA binding site preference. Moreover, the genome-wide mRNA levels in Hsf1<sup>∆po4</sup> cells matches the wild type to a striking degree (R<sup>2</sup>=0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Understanding how these mutants function in response to other challenges to proteostasis, such as over-expression of an unfolded protein and treatment with amino acid analogs such as canavanine or AZC – as well as other stresses that Hsf1 responds to such as glucose depletion and oxidative stress – will be an important focus of future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
