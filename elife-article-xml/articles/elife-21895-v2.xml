Olfactory neurons in the nose can detect and distinguish between tens of thousands of different odor producing substances. They do so by using hundreds of unique sensors called olfactory receptors, each of which responds to a specific type of odor. During development, each olfactory neuron “chooses” to produce only one type of olfactory receptor. Once the neuron recognizes that the functional receptor is being generated and transported to the cell surface, it will stop making all the other olfactory receptors.</p><p>Chaperone proteins are responsible for transporting many olfactory receptors to the cell surface. To investigate how the loss of these chaperones affects how the olfactory system develops, Sharma et al. studied mice that were unable to produce the olfactory chaperone proteins. In these mice, developing neurons that chose to produce a type of olfactory receptor that depends on chaperone protein transport could not fully shut off other olfactory receptor genes. This led either to the neuron attempting to produce another type of receptor, or the death of the neuron. As a result, more neurons than usual produced receptors that do not require chaperone proteins to transport them to the cell surface. The olfactory neurons therefore produced only a fraction of all possible olfactory receptors, which decreased the ability of the mice to respond to odors.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to understand what determines whether an olfactory receptor can be transported to the cell membrane in the absence of chaperone proteins. Olfactory receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are the largest molecular class of drug targets for cancer and diseases that affect the brain and heart. Thus, results presented by Sharma et al. will also be relevant to researchers who study how GPCR malfunction causes diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21895.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21895.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>odorant</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC014423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsunami</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC012095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsunami</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>G protein-coupled odorant receptors regulate their own gene transcription based on their cell surface trafficking, which is facilitated by receptor transporting protein (RTP) family members.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), are diverse and the largest superfamily of receptors. Their roles are well established in sensing various stimuli including odorants, tastants, light, hormones, neurotransmitters and proteins. Some GPCRs require the presence of specific accessory proteins such as chaperones, vesicular targeting molecules and co-receptors for their cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salahpour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Mammalian olfactory receptors (ORs), which are GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>), are retained in the ER when expressed in non-olfactory cells. RTP1 (Receptor Transporting Protein 1) and RTP2 (Receptor Transporting Protein 2), both single transmembrane proteins strongly and exclusively expressed in the peripheral olfactory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhuang and Matsunami, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gimelbrant et al., 1999</xref>), greatly enhance the trafficking of ORs to the cell surface of heterologous cells. However, the role played by the RTPs in vivo remains unclear.</p><p>The mouse genome encodes over one thousand intact OR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niimura et al., 2014</xref>), which are expressed in a singular and monoallelic fashion in each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shykind et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serizawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>). Each OR is not chosen at random; rather, OSNs express different ORs with dramatically varying probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>OSNs in the olfactory epithelium (OE) are organized in overlapping zones defined by the expression of each OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ressler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vassar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miyamichi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanageswaran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saraiva et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in a pseudostratified manner with progenitor cells forming the basal layer and mature neurons forming the upper layers. Mature OSN dendrites project into the nasal cavity forming a dendritic knob at the surface of the OE where they express ORs to interact with odorant molecules. Mature OSN axons expressing the same OR project to the olfactory bulb (OB) to converge onto specific glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aungst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gire et al., 2012</xref>). When the β<sub>2</sub> Adrenergic Receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) is expressed instead of an OR, the β<sub>2</sub>AR –expressing OSNs target their axons to the OB and form glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feinstein et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Omura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, the development of the peripheral olfactory system is dependent on functional GPCRs.</p><p>The mechanisms by which an OSN makes an OR choice have not been fully elucidated. Locus control-region like enhancers scattered on the genome and relative location of ORs from these elements have important roles in determining the probabilities of OR gene choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). Various epigenetic mechanisms, for example histone modification by lysine demethylase (LSD1), allow the escape of an OR gene from repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armelin-Correa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kilinc et al., 2016</xref>). OR expression is unstable until one OR is functionally expressed which then represses the expression of other OR alleles via negative feedback signaling through the unfolded protein response (UPR) and G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li and Matsunami, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewcock and Reed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we generated <italic>Rtp1</italic> and <italic>Rtp2</italic> double knockout mice (RTP1,2DKO) to investigate their role in the functioning and development of the olfactory system in vivo.

Unexpectedly, we found that some ORs are overrepresented (referred to as oORs) while others are underrepresented (referred to as uORs) in RTP1,2DKO. Cells expressing a uOR lack stable gene choice in the mutant compared to wild-types while cells expressing an oOR do not show this instability, a result that links OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of RTP1,2DKO mice</title><p>In order to study the role played by RTP1 and RTP2 in regulating OR expression and trafficking in vivo, we consecutively knocked out these genes while the intervening ~500 kb genomic region was not disrupted in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that the unfolded protein response (UPR) plays an important role in OR gene choice mechanisms. During the initial phase of OR expression, the UPR pathway gives rise to an increased translation of nuclear activating transcription factor (nATF5) over an upstream inhibitory ORF via eIF2α signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godin et al., 2016</xref>). Once the OSN has matured, OR gene choice is stabilized and the UPR is relieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that the lack of RTP1 and RTP2 causes persistent UPR in OSNs expressing uORs, leading to unstable OR gene choice in these OSNs, which in turn contributes to the skewed OR repertoire in mice lacking RTP1 and RTP2. We first asked whether the expression of nATF5, a marker for UPR, is different in RTP1,2DKO. Indeed, we observed that there were more nATF5 positive OSNs in RTP1,2DKO mice (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U Test) and some of these OSNs were located closer to the apical surface, a phenomenon that was not observed in the wild-types, suggesting that nATF5 expression persists during the OSN development in RTP1,2DKO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). Similarly, expanded expression was observed for LSD1, a histone demethylase whose expression depends on nATF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Next, we asked whether the ectopic expression of nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO is due to their protein sequence or the gene locus. We first compared the co-expression of nATF5 and Olfr151 between the wild-type and RTP1,2DKO using M71-IRES-tauGFP mice, and then asked whether the same co-localization occurs for β<sub>2</sub>AR expressed from the Olfr151 gene locus using β<sub>2</sub>AR-IRES-LacZ mice. We observed that the number of OSNs co-expressing Olfr151 and nATF5 was significantly higher in RTP1,2DKO than in the wild-type (p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s exact test). In contrast, the number of OSNs co-expressing β<sub>2</sub>AR and nATF5 in the β<sub>2</sub>AR:IRES:tauLacZ mouse was not different from the wild-type (p=1, Fisher’s exact test)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>).

As expected, higher numbers of OSNs expressing uORs colocalized with nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO as a group (p=0.007, Mann-Whitney U test), whereas no significant difference was observed when oORs were tested (p=0.937, Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>).

This led us to hypothesize that OSNs that initially express a uOR may later turn off the OR and stabilize the expression of another OR. To directly address this, we used a lineage tracing strategy to study the stability of OR gene choice in RTP1,2DKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shykind et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</xref>). In our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), we crossed a mouse that had one allele expressing Cre recombinase under the Olfr151 promoter, M71-IRES-Cre, to a mouse that had the Cre inducible fluorescent reporter Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). In this mouse, any OSN expressing the M71-IRES-Cre allele at any point in time, would give rise to the permanent expression of tdTomato even if the OSN went on to express a different OR gene. We counted the number of tdTomato positive neurons that were also Olfr151 positive (double positive), which reflect the OSNs that initially chose as well as stably express Olfr151. OSNs that were tdTomato positive but not Olfr151 positive are the ones that switched their initial gene choice. We found that only 17% of tdTomato positive cells from RTP1,2DKO OE (n = 24/140 neurons) also express Olfr151 in comparison to 31% OSNs from the wild-type (n = 79/258 neurons) (p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s exact test) and 38% (n = 66/172 neurons) in the heterozygotes (p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>).

This translates into a change in the numbers of OSNs choosing each OR. How do the RTPs regulate the probability of OR gene choice?</p><p>Our data indicate that protein sequences of ORs differentially influence OR gene choice, which is linked to trafficking of ORs to the cell surface. Our attempts to identify protein motifs, domains, or features specific to either uORs or oORs were so far unsuccessful. This fits with recent reports where large-scale mutational analysis of Olfr151 in heterologous cells failed to identify any specific amino acids or domains that regulate its cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamet et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, this study provides a large set of sequence information of ORs that will allow us to conduct future structure-function studies by testing uOR/oOR chimeras and/or searching for hidden features within uORs or oORs, which may in turn give us clues as to why nearly half of the ORs are retained in the ER in the absence of the RTPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Prolonged UPRs in OSNs expressing uORs in RTP1,2DKO</title><p>Previous studies have suggested the UPR protein nATF5 is induced once an OSN starts actively expressing an OR and is lost when OR expression is stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>). Our results show an expanded expression of nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO OSNs, suggesting persistent UPR during OR gene choice. Importantly, the frequency of co-localization between nATF5 and uORs increases in RTP1,2DKO whereas this increase is not observed for oORs. This suggests that the persistent UPR phenotype observed in RTP1,2DKO is due to the OSNs that express uORs resulting in unstable OR gene choice for these OSNs. This is reinforced by our observation that OSNs initially expressing Olfr151, a uOR, are more likely to terminate their expression in RTP1,2DKO mice. We present a model for the role played by RTP1 and RTP2 in the gene choice made by an OSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). In our model, the RTPs suppress UPR response by allowing ORs to exit the ER and be transported to the plasma membrane. uORs are not trafficked to the cell surface in the absence of the RTPs, giving rise to persistent UPR in the OSNs that express them; as a consequence, destabilization of the initial OR gene choice leads to cell death or to the stabilization of another OR. In contrast, oORs are trafficked to the cell surface as functional proteins in the absence of the RTPs, allowing these OSNs to terminate UPR and stabilize gene expression. Although we cannot rule out that RTPs themselves play a role in the elimination of the UPR response, the lack of increase in nATF5 observed in OSNs expressing oORs in RTP1,2DKO suggests interaction between the RTPs and the UPR pathway through ORs. Even for OSNs expressing oORs and β<sub>2</sub>AR, UPR is likely to be induced in the initial stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>). Recent reports utilizing single cell RNA-Seq suggest that immature OSNs express as many as 12 ORs at low levels but mature OSNs only show the expression of one dominant OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saraiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>). Low-level expression of uORs precedes the expression of the RTPs and may be sufficient to trigger UPR in the developing OSNs. Alternatively, both oORs and uORs induce UPR at the initial stage.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21895.023</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of RTP1 and RTP2 in OR gene choice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model showing that in the wild-type (left), ORs are transported to the surface of the cell in conjunction with the RTPs.

Alternatively oORs tend to ‘win the competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</xref>) even in the presence of RTPs probably because of its ability to suppress UPR. Both change in probability of OR gene choice and biased cell death could alter OR population representation both in the level of transcripts and in the number of OSNs. The relative contributions of cell death and gene switching to the differential representation of ORs can be further clarified using Bax knockout mice where cell death in developing neurons is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>OR genes that did not significantly change in RTP1,2DKO mice showed lower abundance in wild-type mice suggesting that these ORs are chosen less frequently. Deeper sequencing and/or increased sample sizes will help classify these ORs as underrepresented, overrepresented, or not changed.</p><p>In our lineage tracing experiment, we were unable to distinguish tdTomato-positive, Olfr151-negative OSNs between those express Olfr151 as one of the low-level ORs, and the others express Olfr151 as the dominant OR later switch to express another OR. Irrespective of this our data show greater gene instability for Olfr151 expression without the RTPs. Consistent with multiple OR gene expression in developing OSNs, our lineage tracing results suggest that only 31% of OSNs that initially expressed Olfr151 went on to stabilize its expression in the wild-type. Curiously, the vast majority of OSNs that initially expressed Olfr1507 (MOR28) show stable expression in a similar experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shykind et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that some ORs are more likely to be stabilized than other ORs.</p><p>The frequency with which any OR is chosen is different and the underlying cause for this difference remain unknown. Our results show that the number of OSNs expressing β<sub>2</sub>AR expressed from the Olfr151 locus is lower than the number expressing Olfr151. Our data call for future experiments to test whether protein sequences of ORs differentially influence initial OR gene choice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RTP1,2DKO mice show diminished but not abolished responses to odors</title><p>Our data suggest that mice without RTP1 and RTP2 had diminished but not abolished responses to odorants. Even though we see a clear reduction in the number of mature OSNs and dramatically diminished responses to odors in RTP1,2DKO mice, functional OSNs are not completely eliminated. Previous studies suggest that anosmic mice often die in the first few days after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunet et al., 1996</xref>), but the RTP1,2DKO mice seem to have the sufficient olfactory ability for postnatal development. Our data show that OSNs expressing oORs are likely to mature and be functional in RTP1,2DKO, explaining the residual responses observed in the mutant. These OSNs become more abundant in the mutant OE as the mouse ages indicating that these ORs help maintain the olfactory ability of these mice. It will be interesting to assess olfactory-mediated behaviors of the RTP1,2DKO mice in which only a minor fraction of the ORs are functional, since this could address a fundamental question of why most mammals have so many ORs.</p><p>No GFP-positive glomeruli were observed in RTP1,2DKO;M71-IRES-tauGFP indicating OSNs expressing Olfr151 are unable to converge their axons without RTP1 and RTP2. Yet we observed small tdTomato-positive glomeruli in RTP1,2DKO; M71-IRES-cre; Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato. These tdTomato-positive glomeruli could be formed by OSNs that initially chose Olfr151 and then switched and/or stabilized the expression of the same OR, presumably an oOR. Previous reports have shown that OR gene switching tend to take place within the same gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roppolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pacifico et al., 2012</xref>) leading us to test the hypothesis that the tdTomato-positive axons forming these glomeruli in RTP1,2DKO mice could be stabilizing the expression of Olfr143, an oOR near the Olfr151 gene locus. However, we found no tdTomato-positive OSNs that also expressed Olfr143. This suggests that at least a portion of tdTomato positive OSNs stabilize the expression of the same OR, which is probably an oOR other than Olfr143. Further investigation of the identities of tdTomato-positive OSNs could further our understanding of the OR gene switching mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional ORs expressed outside olfactory system</title><p>A number of reports have shown that ORs are expressed in various organs outside the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feldmesser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flegel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang and Koo, 2012</xref>), whereas expression of RTP1 and RTP2 appears to be confined to the peripheral olfactory tissues. One well-established example of a functional OR outside the olfactory system is Olfr78 (also known as MOR18-2) and its human ortholog OR51E2, which have been reported to function in the prostate, airway and kidney as well as the carotid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aisenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pluznick et al., 2013</xref>). This receptor is an oOR and is trafficked to the cell surface in heterologous cells without the RTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pluznick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neuhaus et al., 2009</xref>). It is also interesting to note that ORs expressed in the bladder and thyroid (Olfr544, Olfr558, and Olfr1386) are all oORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Together, it is tempting to speculate that oORs expressed outside the OE are more likely to play chemosensory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feingold et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests the importance of OR trafficking by the RTP family members in OSN function and the probability of OR gene choice. Our studies contribute to a broader understanding of how cells discern the presence of a GPCR on their cell surface post translationally and link protein trafficking to epigenetic modifications that give rise to changes in the cell’s expression profile. In the future, it will be interesting to ask whether the UPR pathway that links the functional trafficking of receptors to the cell surface with epigenetic modifications is utilized by other tissue types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of RTP1 and RTP2 double knockout mice</title><p>The strategies for generating RTP1 and RTP2 knockout mice are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The coding regions of RTP1 and RTP2 were replaced by loxP and puromycin (Pac) cassette, respectively. Fragments used for the left and right arms were amplified by PCR using BAC clone derived from C57BL/6 mice as templates. For RTP1, ACN cassette and DT-A cassette were used for positive and negative selection, respectively. A targeting vector was electroporated into the ES cell line EF-1, which is 129/B6 hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bronson et al., 1996</xref>).

To generate RTP1&amp;2 double knockouts, the RTP2 targeting vector was electroporated into two ES cell lines in which RTP1 is replaced by loxP-Cre-neo-loxP cassette. Colonies were picked up in puromycin -containing medium. Genomic DNA was digested by Bgl II and hybridized with a 500 nt external probe on Southern blots. Targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6 mice. Mice with RTP1,2 mutant allele were maintained by backcrossing with C57BL/6.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Olfactory receptor accessory proteins play crucial roles in receptor function and gene choice&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ron Yu (Reviewer #3). As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p>The three reviews (lightly edited) are included at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. The reviewers had specific technical concerns (that you can likely address) regarding the data. Importantly, they also considered the data presented to be insufficient to uniquely support your model for a direct active role for RTPs in the choice process that directs expression of one OR within each individual single OSN. In the absence of additional data that rule out alternate models (described in the reviewers' comments), the alternate models should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The majority of mammalian odorant receptors do not traffic to cell membrane in heterologous expression systems. The authors' group previously identified RTP1 and RTP2, which are specifically expressed in OSNs and promote surface expression of ORs in heterologous systems (Saito et al., Cell 2004). The authors now address the function of RTP1 and RTP2 in vivo by using RTP1,2 double knockout mice. Generation of the double knockout is not trivial as the two genes are 500 kb apart on the same chromosome. The authors achieved this by consecutive manipulation of the same ES cell. The authors show that OR proteins, at least for OR M71, accumulated in the soma and do not traffic to the dendrite and cilia in RTP1,2(-/-) OSNs, thus demonstrating that RTP1 and RTP2 are necessary for proper OR trafficking in OSNs. Consistently, RTP1,2(-/-) olfactory epithelium exhibits substantially reduced odor response, and M71 OSNs exhibit axon targeting defect. The authors also show that the RTP1,2(-/-) OE has less mature OSNs, increased cell death and altered representation of OR transcripts with about half of OR genes being downregulated and, very interestingly, 8% OR genes upregulated. The authors further conducted experiments examining the unfolded protein response, a process that has been suggested to play roles in OR gene choice, by correlating OR expression with nATF5 translation and the stability of OR gene choice by a clever lineage tracing strategy. The results of these experiments support a role of RTP1,2 in alleviating UPR and stabilizing OR gene choice for ORs that are dependent on RTP for surface trafficking.</p><p>This is a significant study addressing questions not only fundamental to the olfactory field, but also important to GPCR trafficking, cell survival and gene expression regulation in general. The experiments are well designed and well conducted in large. Although many more experiments need to be done to fully address the relationship between RTP1,2 and OR gene and protein, the current work stands as a significant progress toward this goal. I have several comments for the authors to consider, mostly concerning technical and/or interpretational issues.</p><p>1) The evidence for a role of RTP1,2 in regulating OR gene choice can be complicated by the substantial cell death phenotype in RTP1,2(-/-) mice. A biased cell death alone, independent of the change in probability of OR gene choice, could sufficiently alter OR population representation both in the level of transcripts and in the number of OSNs. Using, say, Bax knockout mice might help to address this issue, but this would be too much for the current work. Although the authors have beautifully done the OSN lineage tracing experiment and the ATF5 correlation experiment, it is still important to carefully discuss how cell death may influence (exaggerate) the observed changes in OR population representation.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> should also provide the total thickness of OE and a ratio of the OMP layer vs. the total. The OE thickness varies upon location, more detailed information should be provided about these quantification analyses.</p><p>3) The largely diminished odor response is quite striking in RTP1,2(-/-) mice, despite the OE being overly populated by presumably those oORs encoded by 8% of total OR genes. Are any of the 7 odorants a ligand of those oORs? In the subsection “Odorant evoked electrophysiological responses in RTP1,2(-/-) mice are diminished” the authors state, &quot;some sensitivity was maintained for a subset of odorants (2-heptanone, amyl acetate, isomenthone)… (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>).&quot; However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that all 7 odorants give rise to noticeable responses. How was the quantification done here? Also, what does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> tried to show? Is it the response to the odor mix? Arithmetic cumulative of individual odorants may not be appropriate.</p><p>4) In the second paragraph of the subsection “OR expression is biased in RTP1,2(-/-)”, the authors wrote, &quot;A majority of ORs (559/1098) were underrepresented&quot;. It may be better to use the term &quot;half of&quot; to describe this 51% of OR population. Similarly, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Persistent expression of nATF5 is observed in RTP1,2(-/-) OSNs expressing uORs”, &quot;with most ORs being underrepresented&quot;.</p><p>5) The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is interesting, where the β2-AR is markedly underrepresented compared to M71 in RTP(+/+) mice, even though they are both from the same M71 locus. How would this result fit to the authors' model?</p><p>6) A significant portion (41%) of OR genes exhibit no change in the level of transcripts in RTP1,2(-/-) mice. This portion of ORs is completely ignored in the manuscript. It is proper to at least clearly mention this portion of ORs in the Results and discuss how this unchanged level may relate to the RTP function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Sharma et al. provides important in vivo evidence consistent with for a role of the RTP proteins in trafficking of ORs in mouse olfactory epithelium. For the most part, the data presented is clear and of high quality. The major concern regarding the manuscript centers on the authors interpretation of the data to infer a direct, active role of the RTP proteins in OR choice.</p><p>The authors have previously demonstrated a role for the RTP proteins in the trafficking of OR proteins in heterologous systems. This evidence, combined by the selective expression of these proteins in OSNs, suggest that a similar important role exists in vivo. Previous evidence from several laboratories, including the author, suggest that RTPs are required for, or contribute significantly to, the plasma membrane trafficking of some ORs expressed from CMV promoters in modified HEK cells while other ORs can achieve significant levels of surface expression in the absence of these proteins. Presumably, in these heterologous cell lines the process of OR choice is not operative. Given the requirement for trafficking of ORs to OSN surface membranes to achieve proper axon targeting and cell survival, the most likely explanation is that RTPs produce the observed selective enrichment of some ORs (oORs) over others (uORs) through a passive mechanism.</p><p>All of the author's data appears to be consistent with OSNs expressing ORs that are relatively independent of RTP are preferentially retained, while those that require RTP are preferentially lost. As subsequent continued proliferation of progenitors proceeds, those that stochastically select RTP dependent ORs will again have limited life span/viability. Over time, this will enrich the tissue for the observed subset of all ORs. Other data, including the findings from b-2 AR are consistent with this model. Finally, the persistent expression of nATF5 in the M71-expressing population of cells reflects the fact that these cells are immature and fated to shortly die. This model contrasts with that proposed in the Abstract and the body of conclusions of the paper – “We present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER. Our study sheds light on the new link between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation”. Instead it suggests simply that cells expressing ORs that cannot traffic efficiently in the absence of RTPs die/turnover and ones that can traffic in the absence of RTPs accumulate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Sharma and colleagues examined odorant receptor (OR) expression in the mouse olfactory epithelium of RTP1 and RTP2 knockout mice. They found that mutation of both genes results in elevated apoptosis and the reduction of mature OSNs. OR trafficking to the dendrites are affected in a subpopulation of OSNs. Global survey and in situ hybridization indicate a change in the representation of the ORs expressed. The authors further found that molecules involved in regulating the monoalleleic expression of OR genes, including ATF5 and LSD1, are dysregulated. The authors conclude that RTP family of proteins affect OR transcription regulation and receptor gene choice by regulating OR protein trafficking.</p><p>The experiments were carried out in a logical fashion and the data quality is high. The evidence clearly establishes that affecting OR protein trafficking causes dysregulation of genes involved in receptor choice and instability of receptor gene expression. The data support current model of receptor choice and reveal the involvement of molecular chaperones in the process.</p><p>My main concern is conceptual. Although it is manifest as population frequency of expression in the OE, receptor choice is fundamentally a process at single cell level. For this study, the authors appear to have conflated the two. It is not clear to what extent the redistribution of OR expression reflects the change in receptor gene choice at single cell level per se. There are two potential mechanisms that can result in the underrepresentation of some ORs and overrepresentation of others at the population level. First, RTPs have direct impact on receptor gene choice at individual cell levels, by facilitating receptor protein transport and stabilizing receptor gene expression. In the absence of RTPs, OR gene expression is only stabilized for receptors that do not require RTPs for surface expression is expressed. In this scenario, the cell keeps switching ORs until an oOR is expressed. Therefore, the overrepresentation of oORs is the result of switching that settles on the oOR. Alternatively, protracted instability of receptor gene expression leads to apoptosis, resulting in the loss of cells that express ORs requiring RTP. In this scenario, the redistribution of OR expression is the result of displacement of these dying neurons by those expressing ORs not requiring RTPs. The authors clearly favor the former as they conclude as such, when it is equally possible that the second mechanism can completely or partially account for the observations.</p><p>It is likely that both mechanisms are at play. The authors should discuss these possibilities and clarify their position. Additional analyses listed below should also help achieving a better understanding of the observations:</p><p>1) Because transcriptome analyses are performed on the entire OE, the diminished number of OSNs may skew the actual change of OR expression in the OSN population. The FPKM values should be normalized against mature OSN markers such as OMP, Gnal or CNGA2, to show OR expression change in the OSNs.</p><p>2) It is widely accepted that switching of OR gene expression occurs preferentially among genes clustered within the same locus. I suggest the author to perform in situ hybridization of oORs (e.g. olfr143) in the M71-Cre marked mice. According to the author's model, it is expected that the frequency of oOR expressing will increase in the M71-Cre marked cells.</p><p>3) The analyses were all performed in 3 week old mice. No developmental changes were captured. The authors should perform in situ hybridization of a few uOR and oOR in early postnatal and adolescent mice. If cell death is the main drive of redistribution of OR expression in the RTP mutant, it would be expected that at early developmental stages the effect is less striking whereas at later stages it is more pronounced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21895.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] This is a significant study addressing questions not only fundamental to the olfactory field, but also important to GPCR trafficking, cell survival and gene expression regulation in general.

We agree with the reviewer in carefully discuss the role of cell death in OR representation. We have addressed these points in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Both change in probability of OR gene choice and biased cell death could alter OR population representation both in the level of transcripts and in the number of OSNs. The relative contributions of cell death and gene switching to the differential representation of ORs can be further clarified using Bax knockout mice where cell death in developing neurons is suppressed (Robinson, Conley and Kern, 2003).”</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> should also provide the total thickness of OE and a ratio of the OMP layer vs. the total.

Therefore, we used sections from equivalent positions of OE along the anterior-posterior axis. We have carried out new experiments to quantify the ratio of the area occupied by OMP compared with the total area occupied by OSNs. We have confirmed that RTP1,2DKO have a smaller fraction of OMP positive cells, represented by the area occupied by the RNA in situ hybridization, in different parts of the OE. We have added the following to our Results:</p><p>“Upon examination of the OE we found that its thickness was significantly reduced in RTP1,2DKO mice.

Since we do not have available data for active ligands for most of the ORs, we decided to take advantage of the data that we recently published in Jiang et al. (2015) in which we identified ORs activated by two odorants, acetophenone and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5- trimethylthiazoline (TMT), in vivo. We selected a uOR, olfr923, that robustly responded to acetophenone, and an oOR, olfr1395, that robustly responded to TMT. We carried out further experiments using these ORs and obtained data consistent with the idea that OSNs expressing oORs but not uORs respond to their cognate ligands in RTP1,2(‑/-) mice. We have detailed our findings as follows:</p><p>“To evaluate function of OSNs expressing uORs or oORs, we chose a uOR and an oORs that have been previously deorphanized. Olfr1395 is an oOR found to respond to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5- trimethylthiazoline (TMT) and Olfr923, a uOR, to acetophenone in vivo (Jiang et al., 2015). […] In contrast OSNs expressing Olfr923 in het, but not RTP1,2DKO were activated by their cognate ligand acetophenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>).

We revised both our Methods section (subsection “Electroolfactrograms (EOG)”), Results (subsection “Odorant evoked electrophysiological responses in RTP1,2DKO mice are diminished”) and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3</xref> legend 3. We agree that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is confusing and have therefore removed it from our manuscript.</p><p>“The blanks are an average of multiple interleaved trials interspersed within the series. This averaged blank is re-displayed for each different odorant for comparison.”</p><p>“Responses to most odors were identical to the blank stimulus (air only), although some sensitivity was maintained for a subset of odorants (2-heptanone, amyl acetate, isomenthone) compared to the wild-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref>).”</p><p>“(C) Quantification of the EOG amplitudes for each of the 7 odorants showing that only a few of the odors elicit responses from the RTP1,2DKO OE and these responses are lower than the wild-type. Each bar represents the difference between the peak of the odor minus the peak of the air only blank.”</p><p><italic>4) In the second paragraph of the subsection “OR expression is biased in RTP1,2(-/-)”, the authors wrote, &quot;A majority of ORs (559/1098) were underrepresented&quot;. It may be better to use the term &quot;half of&quot; to describe this 51% of OR population. Similarly, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Persistent expression of nATF5 is observed in RTP1,2(-/-) OSNs expressing uORs”, &quot;with most ORs being underrepresented&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Based on new sequence mapping, we have obtained updated estimates which show that 531/1088 ORs are underrepresented constituting 49%. We have changed our Results and Discussion sections to read “close to half of”.</p><p>“Close to half of the annotated intact ORs (531/1088) were downregulated in RTP1,2DKO (FDR corrected p&lt;0.05), consistent with fewer OSNs in the mutant.”</p><p>“The absence of RTP1 and RTP2 leads to the underrepresentation of nearly half of the ORs, while about 10% of the ORs are significantly overrepresented.”</p><p><italic>5) The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is interesting, where the β2-AR is markedly underrepresented compared to M71 in RTP(+/+) mice, even though they are both from the same M71 locus. How would this result fit to the authors' model?</italic> </p><p>I agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting observation, because it suggests that the amino acid sequence of an OR influences the initial frequency with which it is chosen leading to different ORs being differentially abundant in the OE. That said, we would like to interpret the data with caution, as β2-AR is not an OR. We have addressed the reviewer’s comment</p><p>in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“RNA-Seq data in the wild-type suggests that oORs as a group tend to be more frequently expressed. It could be that initial expression of RTP1 and RTP2 in the developing OSNs is not stable or abundant enough, causing oORs to be stabilized. […] The relative contributions of cell death and gene switching to the differential representation of ORs can be further clarified using Bax knockout mice where cell death in developing neurons is suppressed (Robinson, Conley and Kern, 2003).”</p><p><italic>6) A significant portion (41%) of OR genes exhibit no change in the level of transcripts in RTP1,2(-/-) mice. This portion of ORs is completely ignored in the manuscript. It is proper to at least clearly mention this portion of ORs in the Results and discuss how this unchanged level may relate to the RTP function.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers concern but we do not believe that 41% of OR genes exhibit no change in their transcript levels in RTP1,2(-/-), instead, we believe that a large portion of these ORs do not show statistical significance due to their low-level expression. In fact, log fold change of “not significant” ORs ranges from -3 to 4 (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, H</xref>). To clarify our position, we added the following point to our Results and Discussion:</p><p>“Curiously, we found that oORs as a group are more abundantly expressed than uORs in the wild-type. The OR genes that were not classified as either underrepresented nor overrepresented (NS, not significant) exhibited wide range of changes in expression levels between the wild-type and RTP1,2DKO, but are expressed at significantly lower abundance levels than both oORs and uORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001 one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test).”</p><p>“OR genes that did not significantly change in RTP1,2DKO mice showed lower abundance in wild-type mice suggesting that these ORs are chosen less frequently. Deeper sequencing and/or increased samples sizes will help classify these ORs as underrepresented, overrepresented, or not changed.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The manuscript by Sharma et al. provides important in vivo evidence consistent with for a role of the RTP proteins in trafficking of ORs in mouse olfactory epithelium. For the most part, the data presented is clear and of high quality. The major concern regarding the manuscript centers on the authors interpretation of the data to infer a direct, active role of the RTP proteins in OR choice.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors have previously demonstrated a role for the RTP proteins in the trafficking of OR proteins in heterologous systems. This evidence, combined by the selective expression of these proteins in OSNs, suggest that a similar important role exists in vivo. Previous evidence from several laboratories, including the author, suggest that RTPs are required for, or contribute significantly to, the plasma membrane trafficking of some ORs expressed from CMV promoters in modified HEK cells while other ORs can achieve significant levels of surface expression in the absence of these proteins. Presumably, in these heterologous cell lines the process of OR choice is not operative. Given the requirement for trafficking of ORs to OSN surface membranes to achieve proper axon targeting and cell survival, the most likely explanation is that RTPs produce the observed selective enrichment of some ORs (oORs) over others (uORs) through a passive mechanism.</italic> </p><p> <italic>All of the author's data appears to be consistent with OSNs expressing ORs that are relatively independent of RTP are preferentially retained, while those that require RTP are preferentially lost. As subsequent continued proliferation of progenitors proceeds, those that stochastically select RTP dependent ORs will again have limited life span/viability. Over time, this will enrich the tissue for the observed subset of all ORs. Other data, including the findings from b-2 AR are consistent with this model. Finally, the persistent expression of nATF5 in the M71-expressing population of cells reflects the fact that these cells are immature and fated to shortly die. This model contrasts with that proposed in the Abstract and the body of conclusions of the paper “We present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER. Our study sheds light on the new link between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation”. Instead it suggests simply that cells expressing ORs that cannot traffic efficiently in the absence of RTPs die/turnover and ones that can traffic in the absence of RTPs accumulate.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we have revised the Abstract and the body. We have added the following text to clarify our position:</p><p>“We present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER or undergo cell death.”</p><p>“In our model, the RTPs suppress UPR response by allowing ORs to exit the ER and be transported to the plasma membrane. […] Although we cannot rule out that RTPs themselves play a role in the elimination of the UPR response, the lack of increase in nATF5 observed in OSNs expressing oORs in RTP1,2DKO suggests interaction between the RTPs and the UPR pathway through ORs.”</p><p>“RNA-Seq data in the wild-type suggests that oORs as a group tend to be more frequently expressed. It could be that initial expression of RTP1 and RTP2 in the developing OSNs is not stable or abundant enough, causing oORs to be stabilized. […] The relative contributions of cell death and gene switching to the differential representation of ORs can be further clarified using Bax knockout mice where cell death in developing neurons is suppressed (Robinson, Conley and Kern, 2003).”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] My main concern is conceptual. Although it is manifest as population frequency of expression in the OE, receptor choice is fundamentally a process at single cell level. For this study, the authors appear to have conflated the two. It is not clear to what extent the redistribution of OR expression reflects the change in receptor gene choice at single cell level per se. There are two potential mechanisms that can result in the underrepresentation of some ORs and overrepresentation of others at the population level. First, RTPs have direct impact on receptor gene choice at individual cell levels, by facilitating receptor protein transport and stabilizing receptor gene expression. In the absence of RTPs, OR gene expression is only stabilized for receptors that do not require RTPs for surface expression is expressed. In this scenario, the cell keeps switching ORs until an oOR is expressed. Therefore, the overrepresentation of oORs is the result of switching that settles on the oOR. Alternatively, protracted instability of receptor gene expression leads to apoptosis, resulting in the loss of cells that express ORs requiring RTP. In this scenario, the redistribution of OR expression is the result of displacement of these dying neurons by those expressing ORs not requiring RTPs. The authors clearly favor the former as they conclude as such, when it is equally possible that the second mechanism can completely or partially account for the observations.</italic> </p><p><italic>It is likely that both mechanisms are at play. The authors should discuss these possibilities and clarify their position. Additional analyses listed below should also help achieving a better understanding of the observations:</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and we have clarified our position regarding this point in the Discussion:</p><p>“RNA-Seq data in the wild-type suggests that oORs as a group tend to be more frequently expressed. It could be that initial expression of RTP1 and RTP2 in the developing OSNs is not stable or abundant enough, causing oORs to be stabilized. […] The relative contributions of cell death and gene switching to the differential representation of ORs can be further clarified using Bax knockout mice where cell death in developing neurons is suppressed (Robinson, Conley and Kern, 2003).”</p><p><italic>1) Because transcriptome analyses are performed on the entire OE, the diminished number of OSNs may skew the actual change of OR expression in the OSN population. The FPKM values should be normalized against mature OSN markers such as OMP, Gnal or CNGA2, to show OR expression change in the OSNs.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that transcripts from non OSN cells may introduce confounding factors. We have therefore reanalyzed our RNA seq data set using only OR data to normalize the representation of each OR. We find that the number of uORs falls from 531 to 504, the number of oORs increase from 114 to 174 and the number of non-significant ORs falls from 444 to 411. We have added these data to the Results:</p><p>“The disparity in the abundance of transcripts for these ORs raised the possibility of a difference in probabilities of OSNs expressing each OR in RTP1,2DKO. To remove any possible confounding variables from non-OSN cells, we normalized our read counts using only reads mapped on intact ORs and found that 503/1088 were underrepresented and 175/1088 were overrepresented (FDR corrected p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) It is widely accepted that switching of OR gene expression occurs preferentially among genes clustered within the same locus. I suggest the author to perform in situ hybridization of oORs (e.g. olfr143) in the M71-Cre marked mice. According to the author's model, it is expected that the frequency of oOR expressing will increase in the M71-Cre marked cells.</italic> </p><p>We carried out a gene switching experiment with Olfr143. We were unable to find any neurons double positive for both tdTomato and olfr143. We have added the following to our Results:</p><p>“To determine whether the Olfr151 gene switched to an oOR within the same locus we carried out a co-localization analysis between Olfr143, an oOR within the Olfr151 locus and tdTomato under the control of M71-cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found no Olfr143 and tdTomato double positive OSNs in both RTP1,2DKO or their wild-type littermates, indicating that there is no higher likelihood of the gene switching between these ORs.”</p><p><italic>3) The analyses were all performed in 3 week old mice. No developmental changes were captured. The authors should perform in situ hybridization of a few uOR and oOR in early postnatal and adolescent mice. If cell death is the main drive of redistribution of OR expression in the RTP mutant, it would be expected that at early developmental stages the effect is less striking whereas at later stages it is more pronounced.</italic> </p><p>We carried out our analysis on 1 day old, 21 day old as well as 6 month old mice. We found that the fraction of cells expressing oORs rises dramatically in 6 month old mice compared to 21 day old. We do not observe a rise in the number of OSNs expressing uORs in RTP1,2(-/‑) mice.</p><p>We observe an increase in the number of wild type OSNs expressing the uORs we tested with age. We believe this is due to the increase in the proportion of mature OSNs in older OEs. This is supported by increasing percentage of the OMP layer with increasing age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We have added our results to the manuscript:</p><p>“We wondered what happens to the proportion of OSNs expressing uORs and oORs in RTP1,2DKO mice at different ages. […] However, RTP1,2DKO showed no obvious increase in the fraction of cells expressing these ORs with age, while on the other hand, in RTP1,2DKO the number of neurons expressing oORs showed a dramatic increase both from 1 day old to 21 days and from 21 days to 6 months (p&lt;0.0001 one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>) demonstrating that the RTP1,2DKO OE is progressively populated by oORs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
