The evolutionary mechanism driving the adaptation of a species to a toxic host is, however, intriguing. We analyzed the tight association of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> to its sole host, the fruit of <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic>, which is toxic to other members of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> species group. Molecular polymorphisms in the dopamine regulatory protein Catsup cause infertility in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> due to maternal arrest of oogenesis. In its natural host, the fruit compensates for the impaired maternal dopamine metabolism with the precursor <sc>l</sc>-DOPA, resuming oogenesis and stimulating egg production. <sc>l</sc>-DOPA present in morinda additionally increases the size of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> eggs, what in turn enhances early fitness. We argue that the need of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA for successful reproduction has driven <italic>D. sechellia</italic> to become an <italic>M. citrifolia</italic> obligate specialist. This study illustrates how an insect's dopaminergic system can sustain ecological adaptations by modulating ontogenesis and development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03785.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03785.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03785.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many insect species rely on another animal or plant species for their own reproduction. For example, a fruit fly called <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic>—which is found in the Seychelles—will only feed and lay its eggs on the fruit of a species of tree called <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic>. This pairing is particularly unusual because these fruits, commonly called morinda, are toxic to all other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species.</p><p>Female <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> flies produce fewer eggs than other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, which makes it difficult to raise this species in the laboratory. However providing these flies with morinda fruit, or chemicals from this fruit, was known to increase the expression of many genes involved in egg production and stimulate the flies to lay more eggs. Nevertheless, the reasons why this species of fruit fly depends on the toxic morinda fruit were unclear.</p><p>Now Lavista-Llanos et al. have confirmed that feeding <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> flies a diet of morinda fruit—instead of a typical laboratory diet—causes these flies to produce six-times as many eggs. Furthermore, this morinda diet had effects that went beyond the previously reported stimulatory effects of acidic chemicals in the fruits triggering the flies to lay more eggs.</p><p>Egg production in flies is controlled by dopamine, and a lack of this hormone is known to reduce the size of other fruit flies' ovaries and the number of eggs that they produce. Lavista-Llanos et al. went on to feed female <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> flies the chemical building blocks that make up the dopamine hormone, and one such chemical (called <sc>l</sc>-DOPA) caused the flies to produce more eggs. This did not occur when the flies were fed dopamine itself.</p><p>Lavista-Llanos et al. discovered that <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> flies have very high levels of dopamine but much lower levels of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA than other <italic>Drosophila</italic> fly species; and revealed that this was because a gene called <italic>Catsup</italic> is mutated in <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic>. When Lavista-Llanos et al. mutated the same gene in another <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, the mutant flies produced fewer eggs and abnormally accumulated an enzyme (which makes <sc>l</sc>-DOPA) inside their developing eggs—just like <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic>.</p><p>The presence of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in morinda fruit partly compensates for the reduced fertility of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> and the other flies with mutations in the <italic>Catsup</italic> gene. Lavista-Llanos et al. discovered that removing or replacing <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in the morinda fruit caused the flies to produce fewer eggs. Furthermore, the <sc>l</sc>-DOPA present in morinda increases the size of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> eggs, which in turn helps them to survive their toxic environment.</p><p>Lavista-Llanos et al. also discovered that feeding dopamine to vulnerable <italic>Drosophila</italic> species helps them to cope with the toxic effects of a morinda diet. One of the next challenges will be to uncover how chemicals from the morinda fruit affect the dopamine system of the flies. It is also unknown if the dopamine hormone also influences the strong attraction that <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> feels towards its only host, the morinda fruit.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03785.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03785.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic></kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>tyrosine hydroxilase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavista-Llanos</surname><given-names>Sofía</given-names></name><name><surname>Svatoš</surname><given-names>Aleš</given-names></name><name><surname>Kai</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Stensmyr</surname><given-names>Marcus C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansson</surname><given-names>Bill S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ESPCI ParisTech</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riemensperger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Birman</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riemensperger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Birman</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The insect dopaminergic system serves an important function in the regulation of ontogenesis and early development, contributing to the evolutionary processes that limit the ecological niche of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic> fruit (morinda) is the sole host of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsacas and Baechli, 1981</xref>), a close relative of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and endemic to the Seychelles archipelago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louis and David, 1986</xref>). A peculiar aspect of the specialization is that morinda fruits are toxic to all other drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Legal et al., 1992</xref>). The toxicity stems from a high content of carboxylic acids (primarily octanoic and hexanoic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Legal et al., 1994</xref>), to which <italic>D. sechellia</italic> appears to be resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farine et al., 1996</xref>). The chemosensory system of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> is specialized in detecting and coding key volatiles produced by morinda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dekker et al., 2006</xref>) while devoid of the repellence towards the acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuo et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> females exhibit a low reproductive potential, partly because of a low ovariole number and partly because of fairly low egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R'Kha et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R'kha et al., 1997</xref>), making it difficult to raise <italic>D. sechellia</italic> under laboratory conditions. In turn, morinda stimulates egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R'kha et al., 1997</xref>), and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> clearly prefers to oviposit in medium containing morinda carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amlou et al., 1998</xref>). On its host, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dworkin and Jones, 2009</xref>). Thus, we here examined the dependence of <italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic> on morinda, for optimal reproduction.</p><p>All animal embryos rely on maternally provided gene products for their initial development prior to zygotic genetic synthesis. Maternal effects can thus act as a form of cross-generational phenotypic plasticity, playing a role in an animal's adaptation to toxic environments. Embryonic survival in morinda is a maternally inherited trait and does not depend on the genotype of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R'Kha et al., 1991</xref>). We therefore considered if maternal effects sustained the evolutionary process that has driven the specialization of <italic>D. sechellia</italic>. Results enhance our understanding of the reproductive behaviour of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and suggest an ontogenetic mechanism of insect adaptation to a toxic host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We first examined the influence of chemicals found in morinda on the reproductive system of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> by testing the effect of diet on egg production. We raised two geographically different populations of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> on standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> cornmeal medium (standard diet), on morinda fruit (morinda diet), or on a non-host fruit (banana diet). For comparison, we also raised two strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (wild-type Berlin and Canton-S) on the same media (see ‘Materials and methods’). To score the rate of egg production, we transferred the flies to oviposition cages containing agar plates devoid of oviposition stimuli (i.e., yeast or morinda carboxylic acids). In agreement with previous reports, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> raised on standard diet produced few eggs compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Canton-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), raised on the same media. The addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the standard diet did not increase egg production in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>D. sechellia</italic> raised on a non-host fruit (banana diet) showed a slight increase in the number of eggs laid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but this number did not increase further with the addition of morinda carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>D. sechellia</italic> raised on morinda diet, however, showed a sixfold increase in egg production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Morinda diet did not affect the number of eggs produced by <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin and slightly reduced those of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Canton-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as did the addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Banana, however, tripled egg production in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase could be inhibited by the addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the banana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the presence of a natural host modulates the reproductive capacity of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In particular, morinda has a strong effect on <italic>D. sechellia</italic> egg production that goes beyond the reported stimulatory effect of the carboxylic acids on oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amlou et al., 1998</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03785.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morinda increases egg production in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Egg production (egg/female/day) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 20) (<bold>A</bold>) and its relative change (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 5) (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (14021–0248.25, sec) and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (wtB) fed a standard diet (sd), or morinda diet (md), or banana diet (bd), or diets supplemented with morinda carboxylic acids (+OA:HA).

The low number of ovarioles in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R'kha et al., 1997</xref>) was reflected in the low number of total cysts compared to in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The halt in oocyte development explains the low production of eggs in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> raised on standard diet. <italic>D. sechellia</italic> fed on morinda diet showed a significantly increased vitellogenesis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Adding the morinda carboxylic acids, however, had no effect on vitellogenesis in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We thus conclude that <italic>D. sechellia</italic> requires components of the morinda fruit other than just the carboxylic acids to induce vitellogenesis and increase egg production.</p><p>Environmental and physiological stressors can cause egg chambers in the ovaries of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to be eliminated by apoptosis at oogenesis checkpoints in region-2/3 of the germarium or cyst stage S7/S8 (the mid-oogenesis checkpoint) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCall, 2004</xref>). To analyze if apoptosis occurs in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, we stained live ovaries with the vital dye acridine orange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arama and Steller, 2006</xref>). Flies fed a standard diet showed massive apoptosis occurring at S7/S8 cysts, and to a lesser extent in region-2/3 of the germarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); suggesting that apoptosis could be the reason for the depressed oviposition on standard media. On the other hand, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> flies fed a morinda diet showed strikingly few apoptotic cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), in line with the stimulatory effect of morinda in egg-production. Low food availability can trigger the mid-oogenesis checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Terashima and Bownes, 2004</xref>). Thus, we asked if the observed apoptosis in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> raised on standard diet was a consequence of starvation or aberrant feeding behaviour. In fact, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> adults raised on the standard diet showed slightly higher weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and also consumed more food than did flies raised on morinda diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Hence, we conclude that the halt in oogenesis observed in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> is not a consequence of starvation or aberrant feeding behaviour.</p><p>Oocyte-cyst progression is under tight maternal hormonal regulation: juvenile- and steroid hormones are mutually controlled by the biogenic amine dopamine (DA), ensuring normal oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruntenko and Rauschenbach, 2008</xref>). Interruption of DA during development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> results in small ovaries and poor egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neckameyer, 1996</xref>), both of which are features that characterise adult <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R'kha et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, genes involved in DA differentiation were shown differentially expressed in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> compared to the generalists species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the sister <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dworkin and Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wurmser et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, we wondered if <italic>D. sechellia</italic> suffers from a DA deficiency. Therefore, we first tested if the addition of monoamines was sufficient to rescue egg production by feeding <italic>D. sechellia</italic> standard diet supplemented with amines and amine precursors. Indeed, supplementing the standard diet with the DA precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (<sc>l</sc>-DOPA) significantly increased the number of eggs produced by <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas the addition of DA itself had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Likewise, adding the monoamine octopamine (OA), or its precursor tyramine (TA), did not affect egg production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <sc>l</sc>-DOPA supplementation did not change the total number of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> oocyte-cysts (p = 0.28103, one-way ANOVA). Instead, it drastically reduced apoptosis in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) increasing vitellogenesis significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas DA, TA and OA had no such effect. These results show that the administration of the DA precursor <sc>l</sc>-DOPA is sufficient to stimulate oocyte progression and egg production in <italic>D. sechellia.</italic><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03785.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Morinda <sc>l</sc>-DOPA is required to stimulate egg production.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Egg production (egg/female/day) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 6) (<bold>B</bold>) quantification of apoptosis (apoptotic cysts/ovary) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 6) and (<bold>C</bold>) rate of vitellogenesis (&gt;S8/&lt;S8) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 12) in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (14021–0248.25) flies fed a non-supplemented (−) standard diet (sd) or a standard diet supplemented with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (1 mg/ml, <sc>l</sc>-DOPA); dopamine (1 mg/ml, DA); tyramine (2 mg/ml, TA) or octopamine (2 mg/ml, OA); or a non- pretreated morinda diet (md) or a morinda diet pre-treated with catechol-O-methyltransferase (2.5 U per gram of fruit, md + COMT).

Indeed, we detected 180.4 ± 3.5 ng <sc>l</sc>-DOPA (mean ± s.e.m; <italic>N</italic> = 3) per gram of fruit pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in morinda extracts analysed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Notably, we did not detect DA, OA or TA in morinda. Unripe (150.99 ± 8 ng <sc>l</sc>-DOPA [mean ± s.e.m; <italic>N</italic> = 3] per gram of fruit) and overripe (147.47 ± 8 ng <sc>l</sc>-DOPA [mean ± s.e.m; <italic>N</italic> = 3] per gram of fruit) morinda fruits contained <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in equal amounts, what suggests that oxidisation, known to occur commonly in monoamines through atmospherical exposure, is prevented in morinda. The preservation of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA is likely due to the high carboxylic acid content—octanoic and hexanoic acids have been shown to inhibit diphenol oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2010</xref>)—and the ensuing low pH of the fruit (4.1 ± 0.1 [<italic>N</italic> = 7] and 3.6 ± 0.1 [<italic>N</italic> = 5] [mean ± s.e.m.], ripe and overripe morinda, respectively; for comparison, 5.7 ± 0.2 [mean ± s.e.m.], [<italic>N</italic> = 4], ripe banana; p = 0.0001; one-way ANOVA), known for its antioxidant properties. Banana is reported to contain up to 1 mg DA per gram of fresh weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanazawa and Sakakibara, 2000</xref>). Notably, DA in banana is synthesized directly from TA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deacon and Marsh, 1971</xref>) and not via synthesis of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA. Presumably, the absence of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in banana renders this non-host fruit unable to stimulate egg production in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Is the presence of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in morinda then necessary for the stimulatory effect on egg production? To address this question, we depleted levels of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in morinda by pre-incubating fruit pulp with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, 2.5 U/g morinda), an enzyme that catabolises <sc>l</sc>-DOPA into an unusable product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordonsmith et al., 1982</xref>). Treatment with COMT suppressed the anti-apoptotic effects of morinda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and hindered the fruit from stimulating vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and egg production in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), reducing the number of eggs to levels in a standard diet (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, we added α-methyl-DOPA (mDp, 0.4 mM), a non-hydrolysable <sc>l</sc>-DOPA analogue and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dopa decarboxylase that converts <sc>l</sc>-DOPA into DA, separately to the fruit. The presence of mDp in morinda strongly reduced egg production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); feeding a corresponding mDp-supplemented diet to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin did not have such an effect (not shown). Notably, mDp in the fruit did not hinder oogenesis; instead, eggs were retained in the ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This halt in ovulation was completely reversed one day after flies were moved to fresh medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and, remarkably, oviposition was significantly enhanced when morinda was offered as an oviposition substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that morinda contains <sc>l</sc>-DOPA and that its presence in the fruit pulp is both sufficient and necessary to stimulate egg production in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>.</p><p>Morinda, accordingly, provides <italic>D. sechellia</italic> with the DA precursor necessary for the progression of oogenesis. Although providing a critical chemical, the acidity of the fruit, which helps preserve <sc>l</sc>-DOPA by preventing oxidisation, creates a hostile environment for the eggs to develop in. How do flies ensure that the eggs survive in this toxic environment? An interesting observation provides one clue. Eggs of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> are characteristically large compared to those of sibling species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila ananassae</italic>, <italic>Drosophila erecta</italic>, <italic>Drosophila mojavensis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila persimilis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic>, <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila willistoni</italic> and <italic>Drosophila yakuba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markow et al., 2009</xref>). In accordance, we observed <italic>D. sechellia</italic> eggs to be 45% larger in size compared to eggs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), in a standard diet condition. Upon being fed a morinda diet, eggs of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> increased in volume twofold compared to eggs of conspecifics fed standard medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); the resulting eggs had an almost threefold larger volume than did <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin eggs in standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This effect could be replicated by supplementing standard diet with <sc>l</sc>-DOPA or, notably, DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, adding COMT or mDp to a morinda diet prevented the fruit from having any effect on the volume of eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results indicate that egg size is also under a dopaminergic control regime during egg development. The increased size may provide buffering capacity to the eggs, helping them to cope with the toxic environment of the host. Indeed, the hatching rate of eggs transferred onto a morinda-containing medium was significantly higher in the enlarged eggs of flies fed morinda than in the smaller eggs of individuals fed only standard medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The low number of ovarioles of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R'kha et al., 1997</xref>) thus seems to be a result of a trade-off between number and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), favouring the enlarged eggs of females fed morinda.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03785.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Morinda enhances early fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Volume (mm<sup>3</sup>(10<sup>−3</sup>)) of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (wtB) and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (14021–0248.25, sec) eggs produced by flies fed a standard diet (sd) or morinda diet (md) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 15) (<bold>A</bold>); <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (14021–0248.25) flies fed a non-supplemented (−) standard diet (sd), or supplemented with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (1 mg/ml, <sc>l</sc>-DOPA) or dopamine (1 mg/ml, DA) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 23) (<bold>B</bold>); <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (14021–0248.25) flies fed a non-pre-treated (−) morinda diet (md), or pre-treated with catechol-O-methyltransferase (2.5 U per gram of fruit, COMT) or α-methyl-DOPA (0.4 mM, mDp) (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 10) (<bold>C</bold>).

The whole-fly expression of TH-PLE was increased in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> relative to in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and Canton-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), as revealed by Western blots. Thus, <sc>l</sc>-DOPA impairment in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> seems not to result from a low expression of its synthesizing enzyme. To assess if the activity of TH-PLE was altered in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, we compared the ratios of product (<sc>l</sc>-DOPA and DA) to substrate (tyrosine) in whole-fly extracts. <italic>D. sechellia</italic> showed a 3.3-fold decrease in the <sc>l</sc>-DOPA/tyrosine ratio as compared to in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) with a 1.4-fold increase in tyrosine content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These phenotypes prompted us to investigate whether Catsup is impaired in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>. We cloned the ortholog of <italic>Catsup</italic> from <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, which revealed a 45 bp in-frame deletion of 15 amino acids in a predicted zinc-binding region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Donnell et al., 2002</xref>) and seven single amino acid exchanges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

CATSUP was expressed in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum- and golgi-like cisternae of the nurse cells of S8 oocyte cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), what results a suitable intracellular distribution for a protein with traffic nurse-to-oocyte function.

A recent study showed that the SSC require a not-yet identified secretory pathway to control the ovulation and downstream movement of the eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Spradling, 2013</xref>).

Zygotic <italic>ple</italic> expression starts at later stages of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lundell and Hirsh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pendleton et al., 2007</xref>), with early stages depending on maternal TH-PLE. Maximal survival of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R'Kha et al., 1991</xref>) matches the proportion of eggs hatching in the term of 2.5 hr after oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markow et al., 2009</xref>)—that is: laid at ∼22 hr of embryonic development—what coincides with the peak of DA synthesis during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wright, 1987</xref>). Thus, being ovoviviparous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markow et al., 2009</xref>) may benefit <italic>D. sechellia</italic> embryos with dietary maternal <sc>l</sc>-DOPA and, additionally, provide the eggs with a protective cuticle (secreted at a late stage of embryonic development) highly resistant to environmental hazards. In fact, susceptible siblings embryos resist contact with morinda at late developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R'Kha et al., 1991</xref>). While no <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<italic>N</italic> = 345) eggs or <italic>D. sechellia</italic> sister species <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<italic>N</italic> = 58) and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> (<italic>N</italic> = 226) eggs completely hatched in morinda pulp, 33% of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> eggs produced by flies carrying <italic>Catsup</italic><sup><italic>In270Del</italic></sup> allele DGRP- (<italic>N</italic> = 271) hatched to larva 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), some even reaching larva 2 and larva3. These results illustrate how a mutation that reduces female fertility can concomitantly contribute to increase fecundity in a novel niche.</p><p>How do <italic>D. sechellia</italic> adults cope with the toxic environment of morinda fruits to lay their eggs in the first place? In non-<italic>sechellia</italic> Drosophilids, morinda acids toxicity is mostly manifested as locomotion disorders followed by slowness in movement until complete immobilization and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Legal et al., 1992</xref>). These behavioral phenotypes resemble the neurotoxic effects described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> upon exposure to fungal-derived organic volatiles of similar chemical structure to morinda carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inamdar and Bennett, 2014</xref>), which have been portrayed as reducing DA in the flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inamdar et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we asked if incrementing DA could aid the adult flies in overcoming the behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids. To test this, we fed adult <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin a synthetic diet supplemented with increasingly amounts of DA and tested their survival upon exposure to morinda carboxylic acids. After a few minutes of experiencing a natural concentration mix of octanoic and hexanoic acids, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin flies fed a standard diet showed general restlessness and altered equilibrium with incorrect positioning of tarsi, followed by slowness in movement until complete immobilization. A 66% of females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and 53% of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) were completely immobilized after 120 min of exposure to the mix of acids. Dietary administration of DA declined the locomotion behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type Berlin flies (females and males) treated with 100 mg/ml DA reached a survival degree not significantly different from that of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). These results suggest that the endogenously increased DA levels in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) contribute to override the behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids.

It maps the mutation conferring preference for morinda fruit to mutations in catsup, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> catcholamine regulatory protein encoding gene, which affects dopamine synthesis as well as the presence of a dopamine precursor <sc>l</sc>-Dopa in morinda fruit. It further shows a role for Catsup in maternal secretory function.</p><p>The paper is on balance a very nice piece of work that is potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife.</italic> However, there are some experimental gaps in the paper, as well as additional experimental and/or informational details the need to be included to tighten and complete the study.</p><p>The essential revisions that we request are:</p><p>1) Please provide data to show that a morinda diet does not affect egg-laying in Drosophila melanogaster. Particularly as previous work shows that contact with the ripe fruit kills any member of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> complex with the exception of <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, which is attracted by and prefers it (Legal and Plawecki 1995).</p><p>2) Please provide DAPI visualization of the ovaries to either confirm or deny apoptosis as a possible culprit for the depressed oviposition in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> when on standard media. Alternatively, some other method of detecting apoptosis, like TUNEL or activated caspase staining could be used to determine whether an oogenesis checkpoint has been triggered. Subsequently, demonstrating that apoptosis is no longer present when the flies are raised on Morinda fruit is also necessary. This is required because stressors can cause egg chambers in the ovaries to be eliminated by apoptosis at oogenesis checkpoints in region-2/3 of the germarium or stage 7/8 egg chambers (the mid-oogenesis checkpoint) (Drummond-Barbosa 2001; McCall 2004), which could be a possible explanation for the deceased egg numbers.</p><p>3) Please test whether heteroallelic <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> fly lines carrying <italic>Catsup<sup>ln270del</sup></italic> and the null <italic>Catsup<sup>1</sup></italic> allele, show egg depression that can be rescued by feeding the flies <sc>l</sc>-DOPA (as with the <italic>D. sechellia</italic> experiments). This is a very important experiment that would complete the story.</p><p>4) The paper states that no <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type eggs hatched in Morinda pulp but 13.5% of DGRP-357 eggs do. Could this be a strain difference in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines? This issue could be addressed by testing a few other <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines or by genetic rescue.</p><p>5) At the end of the Results and Discussion please present a clear and complete description of the evolutionary scenario by which <italic>D. sechellia</italic> first became tolerant to and then dependent on morinda fruit. Even if the scenario includes some speculations, it is important to see the whole thing put together.</p><p>Minor comments to which we request a constructive response:</p><p>1) The authors state that some <italic>D. sechellia</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were raised on a Morinda diet (pulp from the fruit collected from the greenhouse). On its native islands, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> specializes on the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia (Louis and David 1986, Lachaise et al. 1998), which is native from the region of the Indian Ocean and is not present in Africa (Lecomte 1924, Jones 2005). How many generations was the stock raised on this media? If more than one, is it possible that you have forced selection pressures on the fly lines to be octanoic acid resistant? Additionally, are they allowed to only feed on ripe fruit, or rotten as well?</p><p>2) The Methods state that 3 different lines of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> were acquired from the species stock center. However, I cannot see which lines were used for what figures. Could you please clarify how many lines were tested, and what lines were used for the experiments? Was only one line tested, or was an outbred population bred? Having multiple lines to make the result generalizable is important. At least one additional <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> line would be preferred as well in order to make the overall claims of the paper more generalizable.</p><p>3) The authors state several times that genes involved in biogenic amine dopamine (DA) is “differentially expressed when compared to generalist Drosophila siblings” followed by two citations. I found the need to look at the citations, as the language of the sentence confused me. It could be referring to <italic>D. sechellia's</italic> relationship to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, or <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> (or some combination thereof). Please make this clear.</p><p>4) “We screened for genes that differ in expression between <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and its generalist sister species, <italic>D. simulans</italic>. We also screened for genes that are differentially expressed in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> when these flies chose their preferred host vs. when they were forced onto other food. <italic>D. sechellia</italic> increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism when on its host.”</p><p>Two peers are cited. Please provide values and the comparisons (species wise) from the papers cited here.</p><p>5) The authors state that fresh and overripe Morinda contains <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in equal amounts. Please show this data in supplement to confirm to readers that the state of the fruit being used (ripe/overripe) is not skewing the results.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> demonstrates that depleting levels of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in Morinda by using COMT hinders egg production stimulation. To further convey this synthetic alteration of the Morinda being the same as standardized food, please provide &gt;S8/&lt;S8 ratios as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> demonstrates that eggs of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> are larger in size when compared to those of sibling species. Please state what siblings are being compared to. Additionally, the eggs of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> fed Morinda are 3-fold larger than wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. It is unclear to me what media the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines are being fed in this experiment; banana food or standardized media? Given that the food substrate (and many other factors) is so important for these experiments, please explicitly write exactly what media each species is on, temperature, humidity, number of flies per vial/bottle, etc.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows a Western blot of total protein whole-fly extracts for TH-PLE, Catsup, and ∝-tubulin. To make the claims more generalizable, please provide one additional strain for both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic>. While it may be beyond the scope of the paper, it would be interesting to provide the other sister species on the Western blot as well (<italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. mauritiana</italic>).</p><p>9) Consider performing an LD50 assay with this DGRP line as this could be very useful to show that Catsup deficiencies could confer resistance to an otherwise toxic fruit, demonstrating multiple roles for this gene.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the accumulation of TH-PLE in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocytes using antibody staining. D-E shows Catsup expression in nurse cells of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. If possible, accompanying images of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and DGRP-357 ovaries should accompany the panels in this figure to further confirm Catsup expression changes.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that DA contributes to the behavioral resistance to Morinda, specifically to octanoic and hexanoic acid. Increased DA results in increased <italic>D. melanogaster resistance</italic>. I am having difficulty understanding how the experiment was performed. The Methods section does not provide any specifics of the apparatus used in the assay. Is it possible that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are simply further away from the food if there is DA present? This question assumes the assay was performed in a cylindrical tube. Was it performed on a Petri dish where distance of the fly from the food would not be an issue? Please clarify and comment.</p><p>12) In the Methods section, under Behavioural assay, the authors state they used a mix of 3:1 octanoic to hexanoic acid. <italic>M. citrifolia</italic> contains highly volatile compounds that confer toxicity (Legal 1994), with the two most abundant being octanoic acid (58%) and hexanoic acid (19.24%) (Farine 1996). Octanoic acid is the most toxic compound in the ripe fruit (Legal 1994), which D. sechellia has been able to overcome by the development of both larval and adult tolerance mechanisms (R'Kha 1991, Legal 1992, Amlou 1997, Amlou 1998, Jones 1998, Jones 2001, Jones 2004). Given these observations, the ratio provided was on par. Please cite these papers so that readers are aware of the proper use of concentrations.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> shows <italic>D. sechellia</italic> fed Morinda diet compared to 11 <italic>Drosophila</italic> siblings. More than one <italic>D. sechellia</italic> line should be tested if compared to multiple siblings. Additionally, stating what species the siblings are would be beneficial to the figure. When I looked up the reference (Markow 2009) the 11 species being referred to are:</p><p>a) <italic>D. ananassae</italic> (14024-0371.13), <italic>D. erecta</italic> (14021- 0224.01), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (14021-0231.36), <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> (15081-1352.22), <italic>D. persimilis</italic> (14011-0111.49), <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (14011-0121.94), D. sechellia (14021- 0248.25), <italic>D. simulans</italic> (14021-0251.195), <italic>D. virilis</italic> (15010-1051.87), <italic>D. willistoni</italic> (14030-0811.24), <italic>D. yakuba</italic> (14021-0261.01). All cultures were maintained at 24<sup>°</sup> C on a 12-h ⁄ 12-h light-dark cycle.</p><p>Earlier, the text uses the term “sibling species” only in reference to <italic>D. simulans</italic>, which is a sister to <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic>. This figure now uses the term for flies across the genus Drosophila. Please change the language to reflect the change in what flies are being discussed and add some text about why comparing to other species outside of the melanogaster subgroup is important. Additionally, please indicate which of the grey bars <italic>D. sechellia</italic> is from the Markow study.</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>: sensory bristles contain a histogram of sternopleural bristles of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type and <italic>D. sechellia</italic>. Please add in DGRP-357 to the histogram to draw the parallel between the two lines.</p><p>15) In the Methods section, under “Ovariole staining and immunofluorescence,” please define ON as overnight as it has not yet been defined in text.</p><p>16) The Materials and methods states that these experiments utilized three strain of <italic>D. sechellia</italic>. Were the Catsup gene sequences in all three of these strains? If so, do all three carry catsup alleles with a 45-bp deletion and the various non-synonymous mutations? If that is the case, it would suggest that these changes may have been present in the ancestor of present-day <italic>D. sechellia</italic> as it was evolving specialization on morinda. It is also possible that <italic>D. sechellia</italic> switched to morinda first as a breeding site, which then relaxed selection on Catsup, allowing it to accumulate the large deletion on non-synonymous mutations. It might be possible to examine details of molecular variation in and around Catsup to infer the age of the deletion, as well as to detect evidence of a recent selective sweep at this gene. If the alternative scenario I suggest (relaxed selection) had occurred, one would not expect to find evidence of a selective sweep.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03785.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Please provide data to show that a morinda diet does not affect egg-laying in Drosophila melanogaster.

For the purpose of this manuscript, we fed <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> a morinda diet for as long as each experiment required, which was not detrimental for the flies_ this fact has been clarified in the revised Materials and Methods and the citation suggested has been added.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that morinda does not significantly affect the relative production of eggs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild type Berlin compared to a standard diet. We have included the actual data of egg-production in a standard diet versus a morinda diet for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild type Berlin and for one additional <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> line (Canton-S) in a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1</xref>).

We found massive apoptosis occurring at stage S7/S8 cysts (mid-oogenesis checkpoint) and to a lesser extent in region-2/3 of the germarium, in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> fed a standard diet; confirming apoptosis as a possible culprit for the depressed oviposition on standard media. On the other hand, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> flies fed a morinda diet showed very few apoptotic cysts, in line with the stimulatory effect of morinda in egg-production. Corresponding images of the stained ovaries have been included in a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, we show that supplementation of a standard diet with <sc>l</sc>-DOPA is sufficient to reduce apoptosis in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> ovaries, while depleting morinda of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA by pre-treatment of the fruit with COMT prevents the anti-apoptotic effect of the morinda diet. We have quantified these effects and included the data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

This issue could be addressed by testing a few other</italic> D. melanogaster <italic>lines or by genetic rescue.</italic></p><p>To rule out strain differences in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> eggs on the ability to hatch in morinda fruit, we tested 3 further <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild type stains (Canton-S, Oregon-R and a wild line <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pferta, caught in a local winery); one additional <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> line carrying the <italic>Catsup<sup>In270Del</sup></italic> allele (DGRP-437) and two <italic>D. sechellia</italic> sister species <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic>.

A second event, further elevating DA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), would have redeemed adult <italic>D. sechellia</italic> from the toxic effects of morinda acids allowing them to oviposit in ripe fruits, benefiting from morinda stimulating effect on egg production and from the lack of siblings competition, rendering <italic>D. sechellia</italic> dependent on morinda.

On its native islands,</italic> D. sechellia <italic>specializes on the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia (Louis and David 1986, Lachaise et al. 1998), which is native from the region of the Indian Ocean and is not present in Africa (Lecomte 1924, Jones 2005). How many generations was the stock raised on this media? If more than one, is it possible that you have forced selection pressures on the fly lines to be octanoic acid resistant? Additionally, are they allowed to only feed on ripe fruit, or rotten as well?</italic></p><p><italic>D. sechellia</italic> flies used in this work were originally obtained from the Drosophila Species Stock Center (UC, San Diego) and kept as a stock in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> media. A subculture of this was used to establish a stock in morinda fruit; only ripe fruits were used; which was raised for more than 10 generations. To rule out a forced selection pressure on <italic>D. sechellia</italic> to be resistant to octanoic acid, we compared their survival in morinda fruit to that of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> flies from a new re-ordered stock of the same strain line (14021-0248.25).

However, I cannot see which lines were used for what figures. Could you please clarify how many lines were tested, and what lines were used for the experiments? Was only one line tested, or was an outbred population bred? Having multiple lines to make the result generalizable is important.
