Here, we demonstrate that a collision-detecting neuron can detect the spatial coherence of a simulated impending object, thereby carrying out a computation akin to object segmentation critical for proper escape behavior. At the cellular level, object segmentation relies on a precise selection of the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic inputs by dendritic membrane potential-activated channels. One channel type linked to dendritic computations in many neural systems, the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, HCN, plays a central role in this computation. Pharmacological block of HCN channels abolishes the neuron's spatial selectivity and impairs the generation of visually guided escape behaviors, making it directly relevant to survival. Additionally, our results suggest that the interaction of HCN and inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels within active dendrites produces neuronal and behavioral object specificity by discriminating between complex spatiotemporal synaptic activation patterns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whether you are a flying insect or a driver on a freeway, your survival will depend on avoiding collisions. Many species have nerve cells or neurons within their visual system that respond to objects headed towards them on a collision course. In locusts, for example, a neuron called the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) triggers an escape response upon detecting an impending collision. But how does it do this?</p><p>The answer may also help us understand how neurons process other complex inputs. This is because like most neurons, the LGMD contains thousands of branches called dendrites. The job of the dendrites is to receive input from other neurons and collect that input for processing. In the LGMD’s case, each piece of input reveals what is happening at a single point in the locust’s field of vision. The cell combines all the inputs and uses the end result to decide whether to trigger an escape response.</p><p>An object on a collision course will generate a specific sequence of images in the locust’s eye. These images will activate LGMD dendrites in a specific pattern. To test whether LGMD neurons use this pattern to detect approaching objects, Dewell and Gabbiani showed locusts two sets of movies. One set featured an object looming towards the insect on a collision course. But in the other set, the same movies had been scrambled. These movies thus activated LGMD dendrites in a different pattern than the movies showing looming objects. Both the LGMD neurons, and the locusts themselves, responded more to the non-scrambled movies. This suggests that they do use the pattern of activity in dendrites to detect impending collisions.</p><p>Blocking two types of ion channels in the membrane of the dendrites prevented the neurons from distinguishing between scrambled and non-scrambled movies. Both of these ion channels are also present in the dendrites in our own brains. This suggests that many neurons can detect the spatial pattern in which their dendrites become active. By revealing how neurons process complex visual inputs, the results of Dewell and Gabbiani could help improve algorithms for man-made collision avoidance systems. These could be used in self-driving cars, or in technology to help visually impaired people navigate independently.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Schistocerca americana</kwd><kwd>collision avoidance</kwd><kwd>looming</kwd><kwd>LGMD</kwd><kwd>DCMD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH065339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS-1120952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIS-1607518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Grant for Vision Research EY-002520–37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Active dendritic processing enables an individual neuron to discriminate the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs, increasing neural and behavioral selectivity for escaping an impending threat.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons within the brain receive information about the outside world through a continuous ever-changing stream of synaptic inputs. These inputs can arrive thousands of times a second spread out across tens or even hundreds of thousands of different synaptic locations. Ultimately, the primary task of a neuron is to filter out the irrelevant elements of this dynamic stream and extract from the noisy cascade features meaningful for the animal. While the importance of timing of synaptic inputs is well known, the role of the spatial pattern of dendritic inputs has received less attention. In fact, it is still an unsettled question whether neurons extract information embedded within the broader spatial patterns of ongoing synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grienberger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, recent investigations demonstrate spatial patterning of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gökçe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloss et al., 2018</xref>) and dendritic processes capable of discriminating between different such patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, local synaptic clustering produces supralinear summation which enhances the selectivity of visual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). Studies of clustering have focused on fast positive feedback, such as the dendritic spikes and NMDA receptors that amplify local patterns of synaptic inputs, thereby conferring directional selectivity to some retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>). Recent results also illustrate the functional role of fine scale synaptic patterning in many neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Druckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>), but whether neurons also discriminate between broad spatiotemporal patterns embedded across thousands of synaptic inputs remains largely unknown. As many neuron types receive an ongoing stream of tens of thousands of inputs spread across a dendritic arbor, the ability to discriminate between such synaptic patterns would markedly increase their computational power. Additionally, a neuron's computational task likely determines which aspects of the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic activities are most relevant and constrains the nonlinear dynamics of the membrane potential in its dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spruston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ujfalussy et al., 2015</xref>). To address these issues, we focus on large-scale processing of synaptic inputs and the dendritic computations required for visual object segmentation in the context of collision avoidance behaviors.</p><p>The spatiotemporal sequence of synaptic inputs relevant to collision avoidance is determined by the statistics of the approaching object. Objects approaching on a collision course or their simulation on a screen, called looming stimuli, produce a characteristic visual stimulus on the observer's retina, expanding coherently in all directions with increasing angular velocity. Discriminating this retinal pattern from that of optic flow or from that of an object approaching on a miss trajectory requires integrating information across many points in time and space. Among neurons capable of such discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Frost, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakagawa and Hongjian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Vries and Clandinin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klapoetke et al., 2017</xref>), the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) has been extensively studied: it is an identified neuron of the grasshopper optic lobe located three synapses away from photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Shea and Williams, 1974</xref>). The LGMD responds maximally to looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlotterer, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rind and Simmons, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatsopoulos et al., 1995</xref>) with a characteristic firing rate profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatsopoulos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabbiani et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that has been tightly linked to initiating escape behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>). This characteristic firing profile is maintained even when an approaching stimulus is embedded in a random motion background, suggesting that the LGMD may be able to effectively segment visual objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yakubowski et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the LGMD responds only weakly to a stimulus whose angular size increases linearly in time, corresponding to an object decelerating during approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatsopoulos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simmons and Rind, 1992</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LGMD responses and escape behavior are sharply tuned to the spatial coherence of looming stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LGMD 2-photon scan (top, left), eye close-up of <italic>Schistocerca americana</italic> (bottom, left), rostral, and lateral view of a LGMD reconstruction used for modeling (top and bottom right).

The third one, dendritic field A, receives excitatory inputs originating from each ommatidium (facet) on the ipsilateral compound eye in a precise retinotopic projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krapp and Gabbiani, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These excitatory synaptic inputs are segregated by ommatidia and arranged in columnar fashion over an entire visual hemifield, so the LGMD's dendritic arbor has access to the entire spatial visual pattern activated by an approaching stimulus. Like cortical neurons that often receive inputs from tens of thousands of synapses spread across their dendritic arbors, little is known on whether the LGMD detects the spatial patterning of its synaptic input. The precise retinotopy of field A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>) means that the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs is directly determined by that of the visual stimulus, offering the possibility to experimentally control the synaptic patterning in vivo by changing the spatial aspect of visual stimuli. Thus, we can examine both the LGMD’s ability to discriminate spatial patterns consisting of thousands of synaptic inputs and the dynamic membrane properties of its dendrites. Here, we study how the LGMD discriminates the spatial coherence of approaching objects, how hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation (HCN) channels within the retinotopic dendrites interact with other membrane channels to enhance this discrimination, and how this neural selectivity influences the animal's ability to effectively avoid approaching predators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tuning of the LGMD and escape behavior to stimulus coherence</title><p>We started with the question of whether the spatial pattern of approaching objects influences escape behavior. To control the stimulus pattern, as in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>), we generated stimuli equivalent to standard looming stimuli but pixelated at the spatial resolution of photoreceptors on the retina, called ‘coarse’ looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The LGMD receives similar synaptic excitation and responds equally for standard and coarse looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). We could then alter the coherence of these stimuli with minimal change to the temporal pattern of activation experienced by individual photoreceptors by adding a random spatial jitter to each ‘coarse pixel’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Spatial stimulus coherence was varied from random (0%) to perfectly coherent (100% = standard or coarse looming stimulus; see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Looming stimuli with full and reduced coherence were presented to unrestrained animals while recording the probability of escape jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Locusts showed a strong behavioral selectivity to spatial coherence; stimuli with less than 50% spatial coherence elicited no escape jumps, but jump probability increased rapidly with coherence above 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The firing rate of the LGMD was also highly sensitive to stimulus coherence, with sharply reduced spike count and peak spike rate at 0% coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, the spatial coherence of an approaching object determines both the LGMD's response and the animal's decision of whether to escape.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34238-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Looming stimulus with synchronized LGMD membrane potential.</title><p>At top is a standard looming stimulus with an <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v|</italic> value of 50 ms.

Previous experiments showed that the strength of excitatory inputs encodes the temporal characteristics of the approaching object by tracking local changes in luminance independent of their spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). Additionally, the spatial clustering of synaptic inputs that occurs with coherent stimuli reduced summation in simulations of passive LGMD dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peron et al., 2009</xref>), as further elaborated below. The LGMD's selectivity for the spatial characteristics of an approaching object are therefore likely determined by active processing within the dendrites of field A. No active conductances, however, have yet been characterized within these dendrites. Evidence suggests that neither the fast Na<sup>+</sup> nor Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that produce supralinear summation in other neurons are present there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>). Since in many cells HCN channels influence dendritic computations, and previous experiments suggested putative HCN channels within the LGMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabbiani and Krapp, 2006</xref>), we hypothesized that HCN channels within field A might be involved in discriminating the spatial coherence of approaching objects. Specifically, HCN channels narrow the membrane's temporal and spatial integration window to excitatory synaptic currents over an extended dendritic harbor. As approaching objects expand toward collision time, the closing of HCN channels could broaden the integration window and thus provide a slow positive feedback mechanism to tune a neuron to the visual stimuli associated with approaching objects.</p><p>To test for the presence of HCN channels, we used current and voltage steps, as well as application of known channel blockers and modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>), during visually guided recordings from each of LGMD's three dendritic fields and near the spike initiation zone (SIZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Hyperpolarization of field A produced a characteristic rectifying sag, which was abolished by the HCN channel blockers ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and Cs<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Applying step currents that generated similar peak hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Materials and methods), produced a larger, faster sag in field A than in either field B or C, or near the SIZ. To quantify these results across our sample population, we measured sag amplitude from the peak hyperpolarization elicited by these step currents and fitted single exponentials to the sag time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On average, sags recorded from field A without HCN channel block were significantly larger and faster than those recorded from other neuronal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>; compare Field A control, vs. trunk and Field B, C). Similarly, block of HCN channels by ZD7288 in field A removed these sags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>; compare Field A control vs. ZD7288). This shows a greater effect of HCN channels’ conductance (g<sub>H</sub>) in field A, consistent with HCN channels being localized there and the current passively propagating to the rest of the LGMD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HCN channels in dendritic field A are responsible for spatial coherence sensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image showing the LGMD stained in vivo with Alexa 594 and the recording electrode with tip at the green dot.

Their amplitude was thus used as a measure of electrotonic distance from the SIZ to the recording location. Recordings at different locations within the dendritic trunk and field A revealed an increase in sag with electrotonic distance from the SIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) suggesting a higher channel density distally in field A. To characterize the channel kinetics, field A dendrites were voltage clamped. As HCN channels are distinctive in their activation range and time course we were able to measure and fit their currents (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), revealing an activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) similar to that of HCN2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>). Next, we tested modulation of the HCN channels by cAMP. Application of cAMP shifted the half-activation potential (<italic>v<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) of g<sub>H</sub> from −77.6 ± 3.8 to −73.4 ± 2.2 mV (mean ±sd; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and slightly increased activation at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Both changes, however, were not different from controls (p=0.18 and p=0.076, respectively). These observations are in agreement with a recent report of a decrease in exogenous cAMP modulation of HCN channels in vivo post-developmentally, likely due to saturation of naturally occurring cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khurana et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, ZD7288 application unambiguously abolished resting g<sub>H</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether these HCN channels could be responsible for spatial discrimination, we presented visual stimuli before and after their pharmacological blockade. For standard looming stimuli, g<sub>H</sub> was excitatory with responses reduced by 61% after HCN blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Responses to localized luminance transients, however, were similar before and after blockade of g<sub>H</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Next, we quantified the responses to looming stimuli of varying coherence in control and after HCN blockade by computing the spike counts elicited over each entire trial. Since the LGMD did not exhibit any significant spontaneous activity, changes in spike counts were entirely caused by changes in the stimulus coherence. Under control conditions, there was a large increase in LGMD response with stimulus coherence which was reduced after ZD7288 blockade (42% for coarse looming stimuli; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). For each experiment, we defined coherence preference as the slope of the linear fit to the number of spikes fired by the LGMD as a function of coarse looming stimulus coherence. For every animal tested, the coherence preference was reduced after g<sub>H</sub> blockade, decreasing from a median of 0.24 to 0.06 spikes per percent coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>; similar results were observed for the peak firing rate, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). To compare this relationship across animals, we normalized responses to the control response to fully coherent coarse stimuli before averaging across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). LGMD responses consistently increased less with stimulus coherence after g<sub>H</sub> block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). After blockade, the mean response to all stimuli fell within ±1 sd of the mean control response to 0% coherence (p=0.10; KW). As explained below, this change in selectivity was reproduced by a biophysical model of the LGMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>, dashed lines). To ensure that these effects were intrinsic to the LGMD, we ascertained that blocking g<sub>H</sub> with intracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> application also reduced the coherence selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>; Materials and methods).</p><p>Next, we compared the jump probabilities at each coherence level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) with the g<sub>H</sub>-dependent increase in firing for that coherence level (difference between control and HCN block in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). This revealed a strong correlation between physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). Furthermore, responses to faster looming stimuli, which fail to produce escape behaviors before the projected time of collision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fotowat and Gabbiani, 2007</xref>), showed a smaller g<sub>H</sub>-dependent increase in firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Therefore, g<sub>H</sub> increased responses specifically to stimuli which evoke escape, suggesting that the g<sub>H</sub>-dependent enhancement produced the escape selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HCN channels mediate coherence tuning of escape behaviors</title><p>Having found that g<sub>H</sub>-dependent increase in firing is strongly correlated with jump probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), we sought a direct test of the hypothesis that g<sub>H</sub> within the LGMD played a role in the animals’ escape from approaching objects. So, we blocked g<sub>H</sub> in the LGMD in freely behaving animals (Materials and methods). As a control, we developed a chronic recording technique allowing us to monitor the descending LGMD output during escape behaviors before and after g<sub>H</sub> blockade.</p><p>Blocking g<sub>H</sub> in the LGMD reduced escape behavior by 53% for standard looming stimuli compared to saline injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left two dots). The coherence preference was also removed by blockade of g<sub>H</sub>: standard looming stimuli no longer produced a higher percentage of escape than reduced coherence stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red dots). That these behavioral changes were caused by g<sub>H</sub> blockade within the LGMD was further confirmed by examination of the LGMD's firing pattern. g<sub>H</sub> blockade by ZD7288 decreased responses to both standard looming stimuli and 86% coherent stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). The reduction in firing in the freely moving animals was less than that in the restrained preparation (36% and 60%, respectively), which might be due to an incomplete block of g<sub>H</sub> after stereotactic injection compared to visually guided puffing (see Materials and methods) or differences in arousal state. To test this, we used the stereotactic injection procedure in restrained animals and saw a 56% reduction in looming responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) suggesting the difference in firing rate change was more likely due to a difference in behavioral state. Our ability to produce a change in behavior of freely moving animals from blockade of g<sub>H</sub> was confirmed by simultaneous extracellular recordings revealing a LGMD firing rate change resembling that of intracellular drug application, verification that the surgical procedures did not reduce the response, and postmortem anatomical verification that drug application occurred within the region encompassing the LGMD’s dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.018</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Blocking HCN channels removed coherence preference of escape behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Jump probability for coherent looming stimuli decreased after injecting ZD7288 into the lobula, compared to saline injection (p=0.008, ASL).

HCN channels are not known to increase summation of spatially coherent inputs, and often g<sub>H</sub> has net inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poolos et al., 2002</xref>). To determine how HCN channels produced the selective enhancement of looming responses, we investigated the effects of g<sub>H</sub> on membrane excitability within field A. g<sub>H</sub> increased the resting membrane potential (RMP) by ~6 mV in field A, which would bring the neuron closer to spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Blockade also revealed g<sub>H</sub> to decrease input resistance by 50% and the membrane time constant (τ<sub>m</sub>) by 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), which should substantially reduce the temporal summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), as occurs in cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishra and Narayanan, 2015</xref>). To confirm this point, we injected currents yielding membrane depolarizations with the same time course as EPSPs to generate ‘simulated EPSPs’ (sEPSPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). After g<sub>H</sub> blockade, summation from the first to fifth sEPSP increased for all tested delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; the dashed lines are from the biophysical model described below). Additionally, the integrated sEPSPs normalized by the integrated current increased by 77% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

To test whether the effects of g<sub>H</sub> on coherent stimuli were primarily due to the shift in the RMP, we hyperpolarized the LGMD during visual stimuli to a potential like that achieved by HCN blockade (~6 mV, see above). However, lowering the RMP without the changes to input resistance and membrane time constant caused by g<sub>H</sub> blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) only produced a modest reduction in coherence preference, with responses to standard looming stimuli reduced by 20% vs. 61% after ZD7288 blockade (p=0.03, WRS; see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This reduction in coherence preference was less than that produced by blockade of either dendritic channel and was independent of stimulus coherence (p=0.36, KW; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result corroborates the idea that dynamic changes of the g<sub>H</sub> conductance occurring during looming stimulation and their effects on electrical compactness and membrane time constant play a central role in coherence selectivity.</p><p>To further confirm that the inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels were exerting a spatially dependent effect on synaptic integration, we measured subthreshold activity in dendritic field A before and after 4AP application while presenting looming stimuli with varying degrees of coherence. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (top), we measured during a given period of the visual stimulus (vertical green lines) the average membrane depolarization before and after application of 4AP (grey horizontal lines). During this period, a distinct group of coarse pixels were decreasing in luminance. As illustrated in the two bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, we measured the mean angular distance of each currently changing pixel from the nearest previously darkened pixel (red lines). A short distance example is depicted on the left and large one on the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. In the control condition (the top panels), the membrane potential was closer to the baseline for the larger angular distance (compare left and right black traces). This decrease in depolarization was attenuated after 4AP application (blue traces). Since mean angular distance increased on average with decreasing coherence, we could obtain a broad sample of distances by carrying out this analysis across trials and animals. This revealed that the membrane depolarization systematically decreased with increasing stimulus distance in the control condition, but this effect was abolished after 4AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We repeated this process for a total of six distinct time periods for each looming stimulus. Throughout stimulus expansion, the more dispersed excitatory inputs were, the less dendritic depolarization they produced in control conditions, a feature absent after 4AP application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are summarized across the six time periods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, by normalizing angular distance and membrane potential depolarization since their ranges vary over the stimulus time course. We further quantified the change in depolarization caused by currently changing coarse pixels as a function of their mean angular distance to fully darkened ones by computing the slope of the linear fits between these two quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Smaller slopes were observed in the earlier time windows when angular distances were larger and only a few coarse pixels were changing and, vice-versa, larger slopes were observed in later time windows when distances were smaller, but more pixels were changing their luminance. For each time window, 4AP increased the depolarization produced in field A by more distant stimuli with an average slope difference of 1.05 mV per degree of visual separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These experiments confirm that inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels selectively reduce excitation for the spatially dispersed inputs generated in dendritic field A by incoherent looming stimuli and thus contribute to the selectivity of the neuron to coherently expanding looming stimuli.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.033</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A 4AP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup>conductance reduces dendritic depolarization for spatially incoherent inputs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of the first of six time periods in which the mean membrane potential and mean angular distance were measured.

In the model, the inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channel activity was similar to the K<sub>D</sub> current that has been hypothesized to influence dendritic integration in pyramidal and Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Storm, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hounsgaard and Midtgaard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zagha et al., 2010</xref>). This similarity extended to its activity at rest, its influence on subthreshold integration within field A dendrites, its apparent slow inactivation, and its 4AP sensitivity. We thus call it K<sub>D-like</sub>.</p><p>During coherent looming stimuli, inputs continue to impinge on nearby dendritic segments for a prolonged period, spreading slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top). With spatially incoherent stimuli, inputs spread out over a much larger region of the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom). The dendritic branches receiving the concentrated inputs of a coherent loom depolarize more than the surrounding branches, while the spatially dispersed inputs of an incoherent loom produce a similar level of depolarization across the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>The prolonged depolarization generated by a coherent loom causes HCN channels to close (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, dashed black line) and the K<sub>D-like</sub> channels to inactivate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, solid black line). The deactivation of HCN channels leads to increased spatial compactness and summation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) providing a slow positive feedback while the faster negative feedback provided by K<sub>D-like</sub> decreases as it inactivates. During spatially incoherent stimuli, however, HCN channels close less and the K<sub>D-like</sub> channels across the arbor undergo less inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, gray lines). In control conditions, K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation is due to the resting depolarization from g<sub>H</sub> and activity-induced depolarization. After HCN blockade, the lower resting membrane potential reduces the baseline K<sub>D-like</sub> channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, red line) so that even with spatially coherent inputs the channels never reach the same level of inactivation. The K<sub>D-like</sub> channel activation was highest for control looming stimuli and lowest for incoherent looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) as it tracked the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, the overall conductance of the K<sub>D-like</sub> channels was lowest for coherent looming stimuli contributing to the higher response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Examination of the membrane currents generated by the channels reveals even larger differences. Toward the end of a looming stimulus, the dendrites approach the HCN channel reversal potential, and the net HCN current approaches zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, top). Conversely, the K<sup>+</sup> driving force increases during the stimulus approach. As a result, the K<sub>D-like</sub> channels that remain activatable produce a larger current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, bottom). For the coherent stimulus, this late depolarization occurs in the same dendritic region activated by the earlier inputs and since the nearby K<sub>D-like</sub> channels have already inactivated, it yields little increase in K<sup>+</sup> current, irrespective of g<sub>H</sub> block. The incoherent inputs, however, impinge onto branches where the channels have not already inactivated, yielding a much larger current.</p><p>In addition to these dendritic channels, the model also included low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>T</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Ca</sub>) near the SIZ that allowed the LGMD model to fire in bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabbiani and Krapp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>). In both experimental data and simulations, responses to spatially coherent stimuli generated more sustained, non-burst firing than transient burst firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). The model reproduced the trends in these data qualitatively rather than quantitatively (see Discussion). The decrease in bursting for coherent stimuli was also dependent on Ca<sub>T</sub> channel inactivation. Coherent stimuli produced a steady ramp up of membrane potential increasing Ca<sub>T</sub> inactivation, while incoherent stimuli produced more sudden depolarization, producing bursts. To investigate the role played in the smooth ramp up of activity during looming stimuli by dendritic K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation vs. SIZ Ca<sub>T</sub> inactivation and the concomitant suppression of bursting, we plotted the two inactivation variables as a function of stimulus coherence. During the last 2 s before collision, when most firing occurred, the average inactivation of both Ca<sub>T</sub> and K<sub>D-like</sub> channels increased with stimulus coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Yet, the slope of the best fit line for K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation vs. stimulus coherence was three times as steep as that of Ca<sub>T</sub> inactivation. This confirms the relative importance of K<sub>D-like</sub> in coherence selectivity but also shows that interactions of multiple channels underlie the coherence selectivity of the LGMD model.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the interactions of the channels involved in coherence selectivity during object approach. Dendritic field A receives retinotopic inputs across a compartmentalized arbor. The resting g<sub>H</sub> contributes to this compartmentalization by decreasing the electrical compactness and membrane time constant. In the model, the selectivity arises from fast negative feedback of K<sub>D-like</sub> activation embedded in the context of two slow positive feedbacks: one from K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation and the other from g<sub>H</sub> deactivation. Spatially incoherent visual stimuli generate spatially dispersed synaptic inputs that depolarize many branches, rapidly increasing negative feedback by activation of K<sub>D-like</sub>. This reduces its own slow inactivation and further depolarization generated by subsequent synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The spatially dispersed, transient excitation of incoherent stimuli generate transient depolarizations of the SIZ activating burst firing followed by K<sub>Ca</sub> activation that inhibits sustained spiking.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34238.043</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the effects of HCN channels on responses to looming stimuli.</title><p>Arrows indicate current flow, changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> or membrane potential, and the strongest interaction between channels, dendrite and SIZ, during looming stimulus detection. For all visual stimuli, excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) produce a fast activation of K<sub>D-like</sub>. In control conditions during coherent stimuli (left), the addition of g<sub>H</sub> on top of nAChR activation produces sustained depolarization which slowly inactivates K<sub>D-like</sub> channels within field A (green) and Ca<sub>T</sub> channels at the SIZ (red). This results in reduced K<sub>D-like</sub> and K<sub>Ca</sub> conductances and sustained high frequency firing. In control conditions during incoherent stimuli (middle), the increased dendritic area of nAChR activation increases the number of K<sub>D-like</sub> channels activated. The resulting increase in the hyperpolarizing K<sub>D-like</sub> conductance prevents the g<sub>H</sub>-dependent inactivation of K<sub>D-like</sub> channels, producing only transient depolarization. The transient depolarization initiates Ca<sub>T</sub> driven bursts and subsequent K<sub>Ca</sub> conductance activation. This prevents the sustained high-frequency firing necessary for initiating escape. After g<sub>H</sub> blockade (right), the resting membrane potential is reduced, increasing the activatable K<sub>D-like</sub> and Ca<sub>T</sub> channels. Without g<sub>H</sub>, depolarization cannot be sustained high enough to inactivate these channels leading to an increased K<sub>D-like</sub> and K<sub>Ca</sub> conductances and lower frequency firing which fails to produce escape behaviors.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-34238-fig8-v3"/></fig><p>For spatially coherent stimuli, in contrast, the synaptic inputs continue to excite the same dendritic branches for a prolonged period. This prolonged local activation eventually causes K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation and HCN deactivation, resulting in positive feedback by reducing K<sup>+</sup> current and increasing EPSP amplitude and summation. Additionally, the slow increase in depolarization propagates to the SIZ where it inactivates Ca<sub>T</sub> channels, reducing burst spiking and its subsequent negative feedback caused by K<sub>Ca</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of selectivity to spatial coherence for an ecologically important escape behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our results suggest that this spatial discrimination relies upon discrimination of the broad spatial statistics of synaptic inputs within the dendrites of a single neuron. To examine this issue, we characterized active conductances and studied how HCN and inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels produced selectivity for spatial coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Although our results suggest that spatial selectivity is in large part implemented within the LGMD’s dendritic arbor, they do not rule out additional presynaptic mechanisms. Furthermore, we blocked HCN channels in freely moving animals, demonstrating that the selectivity of escape behavior depends on HCN channels enhancing spatially coherent responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Our experimental data suggest that HCN channels produce a selective enhancement for inputs generated by spatially coherent approaching objects. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously described mechanisms by which ion channels could produce such spatial selectivity. While fast positive feedback from Na<sup>+</sup>channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or NMDA receptors can enhance the impact of clustered synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>) it remains unclear whether they could also provide a way to select for broad spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs. Based on biophysical modeling, we developed a plausible hypothesis explaining the underlying mechanisms, schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. These mechanisms involve competition between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing conductances within a compartmentalized dendritic arbor, regulation of membrane potential to control levels of K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation, and regulation of bursting.</p><p>The model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was the simplest that reproduced the wide range of our experimental data. Detecting the differences in spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs requires an electrotonically extended arbor. To test whether the dendritic morphology could be reduced without a loss of selectivity we compressed different dendritic regions into electrotonically equivalent cylinders. Despite containing the same conductances and the same passive properties as the full model, the simplified morphology markedly reduced the coherence selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Although the specific kinetics and distributions of several channels in the LGMD remain to be characterized, the model is well grounded (Material and methods). After extensive searches through parameter space we could not find other combinations of mechanisms that reproduced the experimental data as well. Simulations were conducted with altered kinetics of HCN closing and K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation, and both faster and slower kinetics reduced the coherence selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>Yet, the model did not reproduce quantitatively all our experimental results: for example, it underestimated the amount of transient firing at high coherence and, vice-versa, overestimated its sustained firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>, dashed lines). One likely reason is that details of the bursting mechanisms may be imperfectly tuned in the model, due to the absence of a second calcium-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>) or still uncharacterized properties of an M current (unpublished observations). Further confirmation of this will require future experimental tests of channel properties predicted by the model, including the precise location of HCN and K<sub>D-like</sub> channels within field A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), that K<sub>D-like</sub> and Ca<sub>T</sub> inactivate above −70 mV, and that K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivates slowly (in the range of 0.3–2 s).</p><p>HCN channels have long been known to influence dendritic integration in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magee, 1998</xref>), and K<sub>D</sub> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Storm, 1988</xref>). More recently, dendritic K<sup>+</sup> channels have been found to compartmentalize dendrites, and it has been suggested that spatiotemporal interactions between HCN and K<sup>+</sup> channels regulate neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harnett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harnett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishra and Narayanan, 2015</xref>). It is thus possible that selectivity for broad spatial synaptic input patterns arises in pyramidal neurons by mechanisms analogous to those described here. In thalamocortical neurons, HCN channels influence K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation, thereby regulating bursting and excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCormick and Pape, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCormick, 1991</xref>).

For extracellular DCMD recordings in freely moving animals, we developed a novel chronic implant technique, allowing the same animals to be recorded over many days, based on previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>). Grasshoppers were fixed ventral side up and a rectangular window was opened in their thorax. Air sacs were removed and the trachea were carefully separated to expose the ventral nerve cords. Two teflon-coated stainless steel wires 50 µm in diameter were cut to a length of ~4 cm and fashioned into hooks with the coating removed from the inside edge of the crook (supplier: California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA). The electrodes were implanted with the deinsulated region placed against the dorsomedial edge of the left nerve cord between the pro- and meso-thoracic ganglia. Slight tension was applied to the cord to maintain a fixed position against the wires, and the wires were set in place by waxing them to the left side of the thorax. The cuticle window was then closed and sealed with a wax-rosin mixture and Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN). A ground electrode made of the same wire as the hooks was placed outside on the thorax and embedded in the wax. All three wires were routed laterally and fixed to the dorsal pronotum using the wax-rosin mixture with just enough slack to allow normal pronotum movement. The ends of the wires were de-insulated and positioned pointing up to prevent the animal from reaching them. After the surgery, animals were allowed a day to recover, and survived for up to 7 months during which time the animals behaved normally.</p><p>To connect the electrode wires to the amplifier during an experiment, the animals were held in place with transparent surgical tape (Dukal Corp, Ronkonkoma, NY). The free ends of the implanted electrodes were each attached to polyurethane-coated hook-up wire with a pair of gold-plated miniature connectors (0508 and 3061, Mill-Max, Oyster Bay, NY; wire diameter: 160 µm or 34 AWG, Belden, St. Louis, MO). The hook-up wires were braided together and loosely suspended directly above the animal to allow unrestrained movement. Neither the implantation surgery nor the connection of implanted wires to the amplifier caused a significant reduction in escape behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>Visual stimuli presented during jump experiments were generated with custom software on a personal computer (PC) running the real-time operating system QNX 4 (QNX Software Systems), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabbiani et al., 1999</xref>). Identical visual stimuli for electrophysiological experiments were generated using Matlab and the PsychToolbox (PTB-3) on a PC running Windows XP. In both cases, a conventional cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor refreshed at 200 frames per second was used for stimulus display (LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea). Both monitors were calibrated to ensure linear, 6-bit resolution control over luminance levels. Visual stimuli were presented in blocks with each stimulus shown once per block and the order within the block randomized by the stimulus software for all experiments. For wide field stimuli presented to restrained animals, a 90–120 s delay was used between stimuli and grasshoppers were repeatedly brushed and exposed to light flashes and high frequency sounds to decrease habituation. Some animals still exhibited pronounced visual habituation (&gt;50% reduction in peak firing rate from that animal's average response to the stimulus), and these data were excluded from analysis. In escape behavior experiments, a delay of at least 5 min (and usually ~15 min) was used between stimuli to prevent habituation. The drug effects were long lasting, so in all cases the control data was collected before the drug condition. Stimuli were randomly interleaved, no fatigue was evident within experimental conditions, and the drug effects reported are stimulus specific, so habituation or fatigue cannot explain the coherence-dependent results described. It cannot be ruled out that the exact change in firing is unaffected by habituation or fatigue, however.</p><p>Looming stimuli consisted of dark squares simulating the approach of a solid object on a collision course with the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatsopoulos et al., 1995</xref>). Briefly, the instantaneous angular size, 2<italic>θ(t)</italic>, subtended at one eye by a square of radius, <italic>l</italic>, approaching the animal at constant speed, <italic>v</italic>, is fully characterized by the ratio, <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v</italic>|, since <italic>θ(t)</italic> = tan<sup>−1</sup> [<italic>l</italic>/(<italic>v t</italic>)].

The maximum 2<italic>θ</italic> values reached by the stimuli were either 136° or 80° for the freely behaving or restrained preparations, respectively, due to the differing distances of the eye to the screen.</p><p>‘Coarse’ looming stimuli were generated as in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). Briefly, the stimulation monitor was first pixelated with a spatial resolution approximating that of the locust eye (2–3° x 2–3°), referred to as ‘coarse’ pixels. Each coarse pixel’s luminance followed the same time course as that elicited by the edge of the simulated approaching object sweeping over its area. To alter the spatial coherence of these stimuli, a random two-dimensional Gaussian jitter with zero mean was added to each coarse pixel screen location. The jittered positions were rounded to the nearest available coarse pixel location on the screen to prevent any coarse pixels from overlapping. To control the amount of shifting and thus the resulting spatial coherence of the randomized stimulus, the standard deviation, σ, of the Gaussian was altered between 0° and a maximal angular value σ<sub>max</sub> determined by the procedure described in the next paragraph.</p><p>For a given Gaussian jitter σ, we determined the corresponding percent spatial coherence by averaging over 30 pseudo-random draws the minimal total angular distance that jittered coarse pixels had to be moved in each movie image to reconstitute the unaltered coarse looming stimulus. This distance was then normalized by the angular distance computed in the same way between a coarse loom and one with uniformly and independently drawn random spatial positions. Subtracting this normalized distance from one yields coherence values ranging from 100% when σ = 0% to 0% when σ reaches a value σ<sub>max</sub> for which the jittered stimulus is indistinguishable from a totally random one. The value of σ<sub>max</sub> was different for freely behaving (80°) and restrained preparations (40°), due to the different distance between the screen and animal and thus the different angular expanse of the stimulus (see above).</p><p>For localized light flashes, a 1° x 1° luminance increase was presented briefly (~1 s) on a black background in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Briefly, sharp-electrode LGMD intracellular recordings were carried out in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes using thin walled borosilicate glass pipettes (outer/inner diameter: 1.2/0.9 mm; WPI, Sarasota, FL). After amplification, intracellular signals were low-pass filtered (cutoff frequency: 10 kHz for V<sub>m</sub>, and 5 kHz for I<sub>m</sub>) and digitized at a sampling rate of at least 20 kHz.</p><p>We used a single electrode clamp amplifier capable of operating in discontinuous mode at high switching frequencies (typically ~25 kHz; SEC-10, NPI, Tamm, Germany). Responses to visual stimulation were measured in bridge mode, current injections were applied in discontinuous current clamp mode (DCC), and voltage-clamp recordings in discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp mode (dSEVC). All dSEVC electrodes had resistances &lt; 15 MΩ. Electrode resistance and capacitance were fully compensated in the bath immediately prior to tissue penetration and capacitance compensation was readjusted after entering the neuron. If capacitance could not be fully compensated the recording was not used. In addition to previously described methods, a fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide salt; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) was injected intracellularly and the cell was imaged with a CCD camera mounted to a stereomicroscope (GuppyPro F125B; Allied Vision Technologies, Exton, PA). This allowed subsequent visually guided positioning of the recording electrode. Within the LGMD, back-propagating action potentials (bAPs; measured from RMP to peak) decay as they spread into the dendrites. Data from dual recordings (unpublished) has revealed that the decay in bAPs is a better indicator of electrotonic distance than the path length, and it is also easier to reliably determine. So, we used bAP amplitude as the measure of electrotonic distance from the SIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>During voltage clamp recordings, the membrane potential and current were measured simultaneously to ensure the desired membrane potential was maintained at the electrode location. The LGMD neuron is not electrotonically compact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peron et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore the issue arises of how well its dendritic membrane potential is controlled through voltage-clamping at a single location ('space clamp'). The quality of the space clamp cannot be measured with a single electrode recording. In pyramidal neurons, the steady-state dendritic membrane potential is largely uncontrolled when voltage clamping originates at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>). In contrast, in Purkinje cells, which have a dendritic structure more closely resembling that of the LGMD, the steady-state dendritic membrane potential is well controlled from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth and Häusser, 2001</xref>). Simulations in NEURON (details below) were used to estimate the quality of the space clamp in the LGMD. For electrodes placed at the base of field A the average steady-state change in membrane potential within field A was 95% of the desired change (i.e. starting at rest, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>65</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> mV, a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> mV step to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>95</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> mV, yielded an average membrane potential across field A of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>65</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.95</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>93.5</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> mV).

We also carried out simulations as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth and Häusser (2001)</xref> to assess the impact of these findings on the characterization of g<sub>H</sub> activation and kinetics. The effects were found to be mild, suggesting that the activation curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> might be slightly less steep and the time constants in Figure 2G slightly higher than if they were measured with perfectly space-clamped dendrites.</p><p>For characterizing g<sub>H</sub>, 1–2 s hyperpolarizing current or voltage steps were injected in DCC or dSEVC mode, respectively, with 5 s between steps. Voltage clamp was needed to calculate the activation and time constant at a given membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>), while current clamp was used for all other experiments because it allowed for easier to hold, longer lasting recordings. Different step amplitudes were randomly interleaved and at least six trials per step amplitude per animal were acquired. For each recording, we used at least four step amplitudes, with values selected to cover the activation range of g<sub>H</sub>. Example recordings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. In most experiments, no holding current was applied between steps (held at the resting membrane potential), while in some experiments a positive holding current was applied (held near −50 mV) before hyperpolarizing steps and in other experiments a negative holding current was used (held near −115 mV) with depolarizing steps. Estimated activation curves (see below) were not different for recordings with different holding potentials, and the data were combined for analysis. Extracellular recordings were taken between the two hook electrodes on the nerve cord, differentially amplified and bandpass filtered from 100 to 5000 Hz (A-M Systems, model 1700, Carlsborg, WA). The amplitude of DCMD spikes was consistently the largest, allowing their identification with a simple threshold. DCMD spikes uniquely identify the LGMD neuron as they are in one-to-one correspondence with those of the LGMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Shea and Williams, 1974</xref>).</p><p>Experiments with hyperpolarizing current during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) were conducted by first staining the LGMD and then inserting an electrode near the base of field A. Within our LGMD model, the resting membrane current magnitude generated by HCN channels was ~2.5 nA. Experimentally, injecting –2.5 nA produced local hyperpolarization to ≦ −75 mV, which is as hyperpolarized as any LGMD neuron became after HCN blockade (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Visual stimuli of different coherences were presented either with zero current or –2.5 nA current injected from 20 s before stimulus onset through the end of the stimulus. Sets of single trials of each stimulus (randomized) were presented while alternating between 0 and –2.5 nA currents and continued until at least three trials of each stimulus were presented for both conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>Drugs were prepared in aqueous solution and mixed with physiological saline containing fast green (0.5%) to visually monitor the affected region. They were puffed using a pneumatic picopump (WPI, PV830, Sarasota, FL). For restrained experiments, injection pipettes had tip diameters of ~2 µm and were visually positioned with a micromanipulator against the posterior edge of the lobula, close enough that the ejected solution penetrated the optic lobe. Drugs were gradually applied while monitoring responses of the LGMD to visual inputs, and care was taken to prevent spread into presynaptic neuropils. Additionally, saline in the bath was exchanged immediately after puffing to prevent diffusion to other brain areas. We used drug concentrations of 10 mM for both ZD7288 and 4AP in the extracellular puff pipette. These concentrations were adjusted in pilot experiments to account for the low mobility of the drugs through the tissue in vivo, taking into account their approximate final concentration, as explained below.</p><p>Due to dilution of the drugs in the saline bath after puffing, the exact drug concentration at the level of the LGMD cannot be determined. However, our best estimate is ~200 µM for both ZD7288 and 4AP. This estimate comes from comparing the effect of the puffed drugs to those observed after bath application of the same drugs. For example, when bath applying ZD7288, the same level of blockade as from local puffing was achieved by adding 100 µl of 20 mM drug to ~5.5 ml of bath saline for a final concentration of ~350 µM. This concentration is an upper bound on the concentration at the level of the LGMD, since it lies ~150 µm deep within the optic lobe. For local puffing, less than 1 µl of drug was used, which would generate a final bath concentration well below 1 µM after exchanging the saline in the bath, as explained above.</p><p>For intracellular application, the drug concentrations in the pipette were 1–5 mM for ZD7288 and 5 mM for 4AP. The final concentration inside the LGMD cannot be determined but is likely considerably lower, due to the large volume of the cell and the submicron diameter of the pipette. In those experiments, the effects of the drugs were comparable to those observed with extracellular application.</p><p>Although it cannot be known whether intracellularly applied ZD7288 or 4AP diffused out from within the LGMD, this seems highly unlikely to have affected our results. For example, the effects of intracellular ZD7288 application on the LGMD's membrane properties were consistent from a minute to an hour after application, giving no evidence of a slow diffusion across tissue that may have affected presynaptic sites. Further, the membrane effects on the LGMD were the same whether excitatory synaptic inputs were blocked with mecamylamine or not. To further rule out the possibility that the effects of ZD7288 observed during visual stimulation were caused by diffusion to presynaptic sites after intracellular application, we conducted visual stimulation experiments in which the g<sub>H</sub> conductance was blocked intracellularly with Cs<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar effects were seen on visual responses compared to ZD7288 application, although Cs<sup>+</sup> was not as specific a blocker since there was also evidence of partial block of K<sup>+</sup> conductances. For these experiments, a concentration of 150 mM CsCl was used in the recording pipette. We also attempted to block intracellularly the inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductance by using 4-aminopyridine methiodide (4APMI) which is membrane impermeant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephens et al., 1994</xref>). 4APMI reacted strongly with the silver wire in the electrode forming AgI crystals, so a platinum wire was used for the experiments. Unfortunately, 4APMI which is larger than 4AP failed to block the inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductance even at recording pipette concentrations as high as 50 mM. Nonetheless, presynaptic effects are unlikely as we never observed increases in spontaneous EPSPs within the LGMD following 4AP application and the presynaptic neurons have no information about the overall spatial pattern of the stimulus. In all there were no indications of any nonspecific drug effects on presynaptic neurons that might have influenced visual responses.</p><p>To observe the effects of ZD7288 in freely moving animals, stereotaxic injections were made through a hole in the dorsal rim region of the right eye. The animal was restrained and the head was placed in a small clamp attached to a 3-axis micromanipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Head tilt was positioned manually by fixing the animal at the pronotum. After the head was precisely positioned, a ~ 0.5 mm hole was made through the dorsal end of the eye with a steel probe. A drop of saline solution was placed covering the hole to prevent drying or coagulation of the hemolymph. A glass pipette with a tip diameter of 1–2 µm and a taper length &gt;2 mm from shoulder to tip was positioned with a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) manual micromanipulator and lowered just above the eye. The ZD7288 solution (2 mM in saline with 1% fast green) was puffed into the saline drop covering the dorsal rim to determine the appropriate air pressure ejection level. The saline droplet was immediately removed and replaced to prevent spread of ZD7288 to photoreceptors. Next, the pipette was lowered through the eye along the dorsal rim of the optic lobe to the lobula (~1.5 mm) while enough positive pressure was maintained to prevent clogging. In control experiments, LGMD activity was measured before and after penetration of the pipette in the lobula to ensure that visual inputs were not damaged by the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Ejection volume was estimated from monitoring changes in the meniscus position of the saline within the visible region of the pipette. After pressure ejection of ZD7288, the pipette was removed and checked for clogs or breaks. The hole in the eye was sealed with a small amount of Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN), carefully ensuring that no glue spread onto the rest of the eye.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the experiment, the animal was euthanized and the head was dissected (~2 hr post injection). Fast green staining was used to confirm that the solution was injected into the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In initial experiments, bath application of ZD7288 was found to reduce visual responses as did application of ZD7288 directly to photoreceptors. When puffing ZD7288 within the lobula, however, even if the solution occasionally spread to the medulla or lamina, visual responses remained similar to those observed after intracellular application. This suggests that there are likely HCN channels within the photoreceptor layer, as is the case in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow and Wu, 2009</xref>), but that any HCN channels within the medulla and lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) do not influence LGMD inputs under our experimental conditions. Because ZD7288 was applied extracellularly, it may have affected other descending neurons whose processes are located in the immediate vicinity of the LGMD dendrites. This is, however, unlikely to have affected escape behaviors, since decrease in escape was tightly correlated with a reduction of LGMD firing rate determined in independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). In addition, earlier selective ablation experiments have shown that under our experimental conditions nearly all escape behaviors depend solely on LGMD firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Data analysis was carried out with custom MATLAB code (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Linear fits were based on Pearson's linear correlation coefficient, denoted by 'r' in figure legends, with corresponding p values testing significant differences from zero. Non-linear fits, including the activation curve and time constant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and all exponential fits described below were made with the Matlab function ‘lsqcurvefit’, which minimizes the least square error between the data and fitting function. Goodness of fit was denoted by R<sup>2</sup>, calculated as one minus the sum squared error of the fit divided by the sum square deviation from the mean of the data. For behavioral experiments and the comparison of membrane depolarization with stimulus angular distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), individual trials were used as independent sample points for statistical tests. In all other cases, individual trials were averaged and these trial averages were used for statistical tests.</p><p>The sag amplitude was measured as the difference in membrane potential between the peak hyperpolarization during a current step and the steady-state value at the end of the step. The sag time constant was calculated from fitting a single exponential to the membrane potential for the period starting 15 ms after peak hyperpolarization to the end of the current step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The hyperpolarizing step currents were also used for calculating membrane time constants.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, all values to steps within the range of −95 to −115 mV were pooled. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> interpolation of values at nearby potentials was used to estimate sag amplitude at −105 mV to have a single common value for all recordings. Statistical comparisons between sag measurements in different subcompartments of the LGMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) were carried out using a Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance (KW) corrected for multiple comparisons with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Procedure (KW-MC). To determine the correct statistical test for comparison, we used a Lillifors test of normality (alpha = 0.20) and comparison of equality of variance. Much of the data was non-normally distributed and variances increased after drug application so most comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRS) which does not assume normality or equality of variance. For displaying non-normal data, average values were given as median and variance was displayed as median average deviation (mad). Mean and standard deviation were used for normally distributed values, as indicated in figure legends. Before carrying out paired tests, we determined if the paired differences where normally distributed. The changes in slope reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref> were the only non-normal paired difference, so for this we used the non-parametric signed-rank test.

After statistics were conducted on unnormalized data, firing rates were normalized before averaging across animals to reduce the between animal variability in responses. This allowed for the clearest comparison of the role of stimulus coherence across conditions and with the biophysical model of the LGMD. Normalized firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) were calculated by dividing the response amplitude for each stimulus by that animal's maximal response amplitude under control conditions (insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). Dividing by the maximum response was chosen to show that 100% coherent stimuli generated the maximum response and to give an easy indication of the amount of change from a standard/fully coherent looming response. These individually normalized rates were then averaged across animals. The relative change in response due to a drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) was calculated by dividing the difference in response between control and drug conditions by the drug condition response. This produced percentages covering similar ranges, and so allowed for the best comparison and graphical illustration of their relative effects.</p><p>‘Sustained firing’ was defined as the longest period in which the instantaneous firing frequency remained above a 20 spk/s threshold. For each trial, the number of spikes within this longest period was considered the ‘sustained response’ and all spikes outside of this period were counted as the ‘transient response’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). These 'sustained' and 'transient' measures were used instead of 'burst' and 'non-burst' statistics based on interspike intervals because the LGMD can generate sustained high frequency firing with similar interspike intervals within and outside of bursts.</p><p>To compare changes in membrane potential and stimulus angular distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we identified newly changing coarse pixels in a specified stimulus frame from those that had begun to darken from their background luminance value in earlier frames (‘earlier changing’). We then computed the mean minimal distance of newly changing coarse pixels with respect to earlier changing ones. In parallel, changes in the membrane potential were averaged from 25 ms following the appearance of the newly changing coarse pixels until a new group of pixels began to darken. More precisely, we identified six time periods during the stimuli when the luminance of newly changing coarse pixels is decreasing for over 50 ms and they typically have mean angular distances larger than 1° from earlier changing ones. For these six different time periods during each trial, we calculated the linear correlation between these mean angular distances and membrane depolarizations, as explained above. Early in the stimulus presentation, there are fewer coarse pixels changing luminance and less resulting depolarization. To better illustrate the relationship between these variables, the angular distances and membrane potentials were normalized independently for each of the six time windows. The normalization consisted of subtracting the minimum control value and then dividing by the range for control data within each time window. The unnormalized data and example stimulus frames from all time periods are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To compare jump probabilities between saline- and ZD7288-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we computed 95% bootstrap confidence intervals of the population mean in each condition with the help of the built-in Matlab function ‘bootci’ (using the bias corrected and accelerated method). If there was no overlap of the 95% confidence intervals, the groups were considered significantly different. The reported p-values for these comparisons were the ‘achieved significance level’ (ASL) statistic for two-sample testing of equality of means with unequal variance (Algorithm 16.2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Efron and Tibshirani, 1993</xref> ).</p><p>Coherence selectivity was calculated as the slope of the relationship between stimulus coherence and spike count and is reported in units of spikes per percent coherence.

HCN channels had kinetics matching experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and were placed in dendritic field A with density increasing towards the distal dendritic endings. Inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>D-like</sub>) were also distributed throughout field A with density increasing toward distal endings. A slow non-inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channel (M) was distributed throughout the axon, the spike initiation zone (SIZ), and the main neurite connecting the dendritic subfields to the SIZ. Its peak density was at the SIZ. Additionally, low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>T</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Ca</sub>) channels were placed at the SIZ and on half of the neurite connecting the SIZ and the dendritic subfields, matching results from our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Effective modeling often relies on keeping things as simple as possible, so we initially tested a previous LGMD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones and Gabbiani, 2012</xref>) with additional HCN channels matching experimental kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) added to the dendrites. When this failed to reproduce any coherence selectivity, K<sub>D-like</sub> channels were added. Then we added a complex dendritic morphology, complex presynaptic transforms, and additional active conductances to the model. While a wide range of parameters of this more complex model reproduced responses to current injection data, only a narrow parameter regime was found that reproduced the roles of g<sub>H</sub> and K<sub>D-like</sub> in the spatial coherence preference. The resulting model and mechanistic explanation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 and 8</xref>), while quite complex, is still the simplest model that reproduced the wide range of LGMD responses tested.</p><p>To test the impact of the elaborate dendritic structure of field A on coherence selectivity, we simplified its electrotonic structure in successive steps using Rall’s law of electrotonically equivalent cylinders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rall, 1959</xref>). This was done by iterating through dendritic branches by selecting dendritic segments according to their electrotonic distance from the base of field A in steps of 0.04 times the dendritic space constant (λ). An equivalent compartment was created from the group of dendritic segments found at each successive electrotonic distance from the base of field A. For the least reduction (the 'six branch' case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), the grouping was limited to dendritic segments that shared a common connection with the base of field A. For further reduction, the group of selected compartments was expanded to segments with adjacent connections to the base of field A. The equivalent compartment size was set by Rall’s equivalent 3/2 diameter law. Each channel’s density was set to the surface area weighted mean of its density in the selected dendritic segments, and all synaptic inputs to these segments were transferred. Tests of channel kinetics were run using 10-fold changes to the time constant of HCN activation and K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation. For the 'fast' kinetics, the maximal HCN channel activation was set to τ<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> = 135 ms and the K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation to τ<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> = 105 ms. For the 'slow' kinetics, the maximal HCN channel activation was τ<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> = 13.5 s and the K<sub>D-like</sub> inactivation was τ<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> = 10.5 s. The values used for all other simulations in the manuscript were 1.35 s and 1.05 s, respectively.</p><p>Evaluation of how well this model informs about the actual neural processes requires some review of the experimental data to which it was constrained. The strength and timing of synaptic inputs was generated based on single facet stimulation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). Excitatory synaptic input locations were based on the retinotopy and synaptic overlap determined by functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peron et al., 2009</xref>). The time course of synaptic inputs was based on experiments stimulating individual facets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>) and the pattern of depolarization measured during the current experiments. The presence of standard Hodgkin-Huxley Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents was assumed, HCN and K<sub>D-like</sub> channels were based on the current work, the Ca<sub>T</sub> and K<sub>Ca</sub> channels were based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref> , the M current was based on our own currently unpublished findings. For each of these channels, conductance and kinetic parameters were adjusted to match experimental data with firing frequency vs. injected current curves and spike waveform used to tune fast Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, changes in input resistance and resting membrane potential after pharmacological blockade used to adjust HCN, K<sub>D-like</sub>, and M parameters, while Ca<sub>T</sub> and K<sub>Ca</sub> were adjusted to match intrinsic burst (currently unpublished) and spike frequency adaptation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>). Channel distributions were similarly grounded in experimental data, when available, and were manually fit to find working parameters.</p><p>To estimate space clamp quality (see Materials and methods: Electrophysiology), we used the Impedance object class in NEURON and measured the percent voltage attenuation from an electrode location to each compartment within field A of the model. The average attenuation was calculated by weighting each section by its surface area to calculate the average change of membrane potential within field A.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The full model and simulation code are available in the public repository ModelDB, accession number 195666.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Fred Rieke (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the paper described a very interesting result and were enthusiastic about the approach. We also agreed that the paper could be strengthened in several ways. Four specific points follow; these and other points are detailed in the individual reviews.</p><p>1) Utility of the model. The model presented is quite complex and does not lead to a clear intuitive insight into how the interaction between HCN and KD type channels gives rise to looming sensitivity. The paper would benefit from more intuition about what the key properties are (time course, voltage dependence, etc.) that control interactions between these channels and give rise to looming sensitivity.</p><p>2) Inclusion of &quot;standard&quot; looming stimuli in analysis. It was unclear whether the standard looming stimuli were included in the fits in Figure 2J and 4C. This point would appear to impact the fits considerably.</p><p>3) Statistical tests. The paper is lacking statistical tests in several places. This includes analysis of significance for key results (a partial list includes the cAMP results and the slopes of lines in Figure 2E – but generally this should be addressed throughout the paper).</p><p>4) Division between main and supplementary figures. Some key pieces of data show up only in the supplementary figures (e.g., the pharmacology in Supplementary Figure 1). Supplementary Figure 4 is also quite central to the paper. The paper would benefit from inclusion of any key results in the main figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the basis of sensitivity of looming sensitivity in grasshopper LGMD neurons. The breadth of the paper – from single cell conductances to behavior – is impressive and the paper provides a rare link between the mechanistic basis of dendritic computation, neural responses and behavior. The general significance of the work is set up nicely in the Introduction. There are several issues that should be strengthened.</p><p>Abstract: The Abstract creates the simple expectation that HCN channels are going to explain looming sensitivity. Only later in the paper is it clear that it is the interaction of HCN channels and a depolarization-activated K channel. It would help to make this clear from the start.</p><p>HCN channel block. The pharmacology in Supplementary Figure 1 is quite central to the paper. I think it should also be included as a main figure. It also at present is restricted to example cells, and needs some population analysis. Further it is not clear why some experiments were in current clamp and others in voltage clamp.</p><p>Statistical tests. There are a number of effects for which significance should be evaluated. Some examples are: (1) the cAMP results in Figure 2F; (2) the slopes of the black lines in Supplementary Figure 4; (3) the slope in Figure 2E.</p><p>Figure 4 relies heavily on Supplementary Figure 4. Further, Supplementary Figure 4 is quite confusing. I think this entire analysis needs to be described more clearly and more of it needs to be included in the main text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Dewell and Gabbiani examine molecular mechanisms underlying loom detection in the LGMD neuron in locust. The use a clever stimulus in which they can continuously modulate the coherence of a loom-like stimulus to investigate how different channels affect the coherence tuning of the LGMD response. First, they show that LGMD neurons show a sag under hyperpolarization that is cAMP-modulated and is eliminated by an antagonist to HCN channels. Using this antagonist, they show various properties of LGMD responses that depend on HCN channels, but show that these properties alone do not account for the coherence tuning of the neurons. This antagonist also reduces the jump rate for fully coherent stimuli. They use a second antagonist to show that potassium channels are also involved in coherence tuning, but show somewhat opposing effects to the HCN channels. Finally, the authors conclude with a realistic model of LGMD firing, including many channels and compartments, and show that after tuning parameters, they reproduce some of their data with this model, importantly reproducing the primary effects of the HCN and potassium channels on the loom coherence tuning curves.</p><p>The coherence knob on the loom stimuli is clever and a useful way to interrogate these mechanisms, and I found the pharmacology and measurements all mostly convincing and well-presented, with a few small points enumerated below. My major concern was with the modeling. I've read through these sections three or four times now, and it's still not clear to me what is going on. Some of this speaks to presentation, and I think this could be improved. But one question is: what is the purpose of the model? A detailed model with thousands of compartments and many fitted parameters can be used to determine whether you're missing any crucial components in principle, by asking whether the sophisticated model can reproduce results with verisimilitude? But such models typically won't give an intuition for what's going on. I want a model that gives me intuition about the biophysical processes involved. In the supplement, the authors say that this is the simplest model that reproduces the results, but surely there must be a toy model with fewer and more simply arranged spatial compartments that would give intuition for some specific coherence results, even if it didn't reproduce things exactly. In part, Figure 7 gave me pause because this coherence/incoherence is necessarily a spatiotemporal integration issue, as the authors emphasize in the introduction, but the schematic has a single spatial compartment. To really get what's going on, we need at least two compartments. Or a one-dimensional chain of compartments with an edge sweeping across, which could show currents/activations/voltages at different time-points during the coherent vs. incoherent edge? I'd really like to have a better intuition for what is happening, and what timescales matter for the HCN activity and its inactivation of the KD-like channels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Dewell and Gabbiani use a novel visual 'looming' stimuli of varying spatial coherence. With the aid of pharmacological intervention, the authors explore mechanisms underlying response characteristics of looming neurons (and escape behaviors) in the grasshopper. Here they provide evidence that spatiotemporal patterning on the LGMD neuron's dendrites induced by looming stimuli, elicit responses via HCN and other channel dynamics. Whether and how neurons use broad spatial components of the dendritic input statistics to compute information (rather than via presynaptic mechanisms) is an important question in the neurosciences of interest to a general audience.</p><p>1) I have an important question with respect to data analysis. In the critical Figure 2J, the authors chose to include a standard loom in addition to a 100% coherence loom (effectively two data points at 100%), though the reasoning for this is not provided. Does the line of best fit (red) include the standard loom ('star') data point at 100% coherence? If so, why would this 'standard loom' stimulus composed of very different frequency components be added to this analysis? The primary hypothesis of this manuscript depends on the slope of this line to increasing coherence (coherence preference) and this selectivity looks to be largely affected by the presence of this additional, confounding data (standard vs. 100% coarse).</p><p>What is the coherence preference for ZD7288 with this point removed and is it still significantly different than control (Figure 2K)? If not, why not? If the slopes of these lines are not significantly different, then the parsimonious explanation for the data set is that the ZD7288 is causing something akin to the hyperpolarizing injection of current (Supplementary Figure 3D). Testing for a significant difference between the coherence preference for ZDZ7288 (without standard loom) with that obtained for the.-2.5nA current injection would make the author's point more convincing. In fact for ease of comparison, coherence preferences for all conditions (control, ZD7288, 4AP, Cs+, -2.5dc) could be presented in a single figure (with error bars and tests for significance). The authors may then like to develop hypotheses with respect to response differences in standard loom compared to 100% coherence coarse loom induced by HCN blockade.</p><p>Note that a similar 'extra' data point seems to also be having a very large impact on the 4AP result (Figure 4C).</p><p>Additionally, as the primary interpretation is from the slope rather than the overall strength of these lines of best fit (Figure 2J), the reader should be provided (a) the analysis window used for spike count (b) the y-intercept (0% coherence) relationship to any spontaneous activity and (c) why a single control data point was used as the normalization (% max). To further complicate matters, the individual data underlying Figure 2J presented in Supplementary Figure 3A strangely shows a weighted line (with data points) for one single example, rather than the average. It is in fact this Supplementary Figure 3A (the non-highly derived) that makes the authors point much more convincing, with most red lines looking flat – however the authors should again separate standard vs. 100% coarse loom to be fully validated.</p><p>For their main hypothesis to be supported, I believe the authors should start again with Figure 2J and 2K.

These waveforms are also different with the extracellular applications.</p><p>How do these differences in time course affect further analysis?

We also agreed that the paper could be strengthened in several ways. Four specific points follow; these and other points are detailed in the individual reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their criticism. We have strived to address them as comprehensively as possible and believe that the manuscript has been improved as a result. We provide immediately below a brief summary of the changes for the four specific points, with more details in response to the individual reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Utility of the model. The model presented is quite complex and does not lead to a clear intuitive insight into how the interaction between HCN and KD type channels gives rise to looming sensitivity. The paper would benefit from more intuition about what the key properties are (time course, voltage dependence, etc.) that control interactions between these channels and give rise to looming sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out additional simulations, rewritten the modeling section and modified the corresponding figures to improve the presentation of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Inclusion of &quot;standard&quot; looming stimuli in analysis. It was unclear whether the standard looming stimuli were included in the fits in Figure 2J and 4C. This point would appear to impact the fits considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>The “standard” looming stimuli were included in the fits. We had not thought of this caveat. After repeating the analysis excluding the “standard” looming stimuli we find that the results are nearly unchanged. The revised manuscript excludes the “standard” looming stimuli from all fits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical tests. The paper is lacking statistical tests in several places. This includes analysis of significance for key results (a partial list includes the cAMP results and the slopes of lines in Figure 2E – but generally this should be addressed throughout the paper).</p></disp-quote><p>We went systematically over the results and added statistical test as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Division between main and supplementary figures. Some key pieces of data show up only in the supplementary figures (e.g. the pharmacology in Supplementary Figure 1). Supplementary Figure 4 is also quite central to the paper. The paper would benefit from inclusion of any key results in the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the main figures to include additional key results as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes the basis of sensitivity of looming sensitivity in grasshopper LGMD neurons. The breadth of the paper – from single cell conductances to behavior – is impressive and the paper provides a rare link between the mechanistic basis of dendritic computation, neural responses and behavior. The general significance of the work is set up nicely in the Introduction. There are several issues that should be strengthened.</p><p>Abstract: The Abstract creates the simple expectation that HCN channels are going to explain looming sensitivity. Only later in the paper is it clear that it is the interaction of HCN channels and a depolarization-activated K channel. It would help to make this clear from the start.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added a reference to inactivating K channels in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>HCN channel block. The pharmacology in Supplementary Figure 1 is quite central to the paper. I think it should also be included as a main figure. It also at present is restricted to example cells, and needs some population analysis. Further it is not clear why some experiments were in current clamp and others in voltage clamp.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a panel to Figure 2 (new panel B) illustrating the sag and the effect of ZD7288 on it. In addition, we added population averages summarizing the effect of ZD7288 on sag amplitude and time constant to Figure 2D and E. Cs+ population data has been added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Current clamp was used whenever possible because it is technically easier to implement. Voltage clamp was used to measure the channel kinetics illustrated in Figure 2G and H. A statement to this effect was added to the Materials and methods (subsection “Electrophysiology”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical tests. There are a number of effects for which significance should be evaluated. Some examples are: (1) the cAMP results in Figure 2F; (2) the slopes of the black lines in Supplementary Figure 4; (3) the slope in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical tests have been added throughout, following the indications of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 relies heavily on Supplementary Figure 4. Further, Supplementary Figure 4 is quite confusing. I think this entire analysis needs to be described more clearly and more of it needs to be included in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have moved several panels of the Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to the main text. In addition, we have added new illustrations of the data analysis procedure and an expanded description (subsection “K<sup>+</sup> channels complement HCN channels in generating coherence tuning”, last paragraph) to the clarify the results. The old Figure 4 has thus been converted into two new figures in the revised manuscript, Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The coherence knob on the loom stimuli is clever and a useful way to interrogate these mechanisms, and I found the pharmacology and measurements all mostly convincing and well-presented, with a few small points enumerated below. My major concern was with the modeling. I've read through these sections three or four times now, and it's still not clear to me what is going on. Some of this speaks to presentation, and I think this could be improved. But one question is: what is the purpose of the model? A detailed model with thousands of compartments and many fitted parameters can be used to determine whether you're missing any crucial components in principle, by asking whether the sophisticated model can reproduce results with verisimilitude? But such models typically won't give an intuition for what's going on. I want a model that gives me intuition about the biophysical processes involved. In the supplement, the authors say that this is the simplest model that reproduces the results, but surely there must be a toy model with fewer and more simply arranged spatial compartments that would give intuition for some specific coherence results, even if it didn't reproduce things exactly. In part, Figure 7 gave me pause because this coherence/incoherence is necessarily a spatiotemporal integration issue, as the authors emphasize in the introduction, but the schematic has a single spatial compartment. To really get what's going on, we need at least two compartments. Or a one-dimensional chain of compartments with an edge sweeping across, which could show currents/activations/voltages at different time-points during the coherent vs. incoherent edge? I'd really like to have a better intuition for what is happening, and what timescales matter for the HCN activity and its inactivation of the KD-like channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have comprehensively restructured the modeling section so as give a better intuition of the main components of the model and the role they play. We hope that the main ingredients of the model and how it works will now be clear.</p><p>Initially, we started with much simpler models than the one presented here in the hope of finding a compact explanation to the phenomenon. However, these models never worked properly. It is only when we added an extended dendritic tree with a corresponding large number of synaptic inputs distributed over it that we could reproduce the experimental results. This is due to the fact that the extended dendritic tree allows sufficient compartmentalization for the spatially different synaptic inputs generated by coherent and incoherent stimuli to have distinct effects on the local activation and inactivation of the H and K<sub>D-like</sub>conductances. It is possible that a simplified model explaining the phenomena exists, but we have not yet been able to design one. Simply collapsing the electrotonic structure of the model and localizing synaptic inputs in a few compartments fails, see the newly added Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We think the task of designing a simplified model attempting to reproduce the results is better left for future work.</p><p>It was not our intention in Figure 8 (previously Figure 7) to suggest that the channel schematics we used are confined to single dendritic compartments. On the contrary, it has to occur over the extended spatial dendritic tree. We have modified the figure to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) I have an important question with respect to data analysis. In the critical Figure 2J, the authors chose to include a standard loom in addition to a 100% coherence loom (effectively two data points at 100%), though the reasoning for this is not provided. Does the line of best fit (red) include the standard loom ('star') data point at 100% coherence? If so, why would this 'standard loom' stimulus composed of very different frequency components be added to this analysis? The primary hypothesis of this manuscript depends on the slope of this line to increasing coherence (coherence preference) and this selectivity looks to be largely affected by the presence of this additional, confounding data (standard vs. 100% coarse).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not think about this potential caveat and thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We have thus reanalyzed the data excluding the standard looms and all the results hold without any changes. The results reported in the revised manuscript omit the standard looming data from their analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the coherence preference for ZD7288 with this point removed and is it still significantly different than control (Figure 2K)? If not, why not? If the slopes of these lines are not significantly different, then the parsimonious explanation for the data set is that the ZD7288 is causing something akin to the hyperpolarizing injection of current (Supplementary Figure 3D). Testing for a significant difference between the coherence preference for ZDZ7288 (without standard loom) with that obtained for the.-2.5nA current injection would make the author's point more convincing. In fact for ease of comparison, coherence preferences for all conditions (control, ZD7288, 4AP, Cs+, -2.5dc) could be presented in a single figure (with error bars and tests for significance). The authors may then like to develop hypotheses with respect to response differences in standard loom compared to 100% coherence coarse loom induced by HCN blockade.</p></disp-quote><p>The coherence preference is unchanged when the standard loom data is removed. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have plotted changes for the main pharmacological manipulations together in Figure 5D to illustrate the different effect that each manipulation has on firing rate changes as a function of stimulus coherence. We would like to emphasize that we never found any substantial difference between the responses to coarse and standard looming stimuli, either in this paper or in an earlier one where they were extensively studied as well, but in a different context (Jones and Gabbiani, 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note that a similar 'extra' data point seems to also be having a very large impact on the 4AP result (Figure 4C).</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the change in standard loom response after ZD7288, as 4AP had nearly identical effects on coarse and standard loom. We have now excluded the standard looming data points from the analysis of changes for both drugs (Figure 5D of the revised manuscript) and this produced no change in the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, as the primary interpretation is from the slope rather than the overall strength of these lines of best fit (Figure 2J), the reader should be provided (a) the analysis window used for spike count (b) the y-intercept (0% coherence) relationship to any spontaneous activity and (c) why a single control data point was used as the normalization (% max). To further complicate matters, the individual data underlying Figure 2J presented in Supplementary Figure 3A strangely shows a weighted line (with data points) for one single example, rather than the average. It is in fact this Supplementary Figure 3A (the non-highly derived) that makes the authors point much more convincing, with most red lines looking flat – however the authors should again separate standard vs. 100% coarse loom to be fully validated.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point and the following one, we have added Supplementary Figure 3 of the previous manuscript to Figure 2 of the revised manuscript. It is now Figure 2K.</p><p>In the experiments reported in Figure 2K-M (previously Supplementary Figure 3 and Figure 2J, K), the answer to the questions raised above are as follows.</p><p>a) We computed the spike count over the entire trial (no post experiment analysis window selection was ever carried out).</p><p>b) There was no spontaneous activity of the LGMD.</p><p>c) A single point was used for normalization to allow easy comparison of experimental and model data relative to coherent loom responses</p><p>We have added a sentence in the revised manuscript explaining those points (subsection “HCN channels in dendritic field A are implicated in coherence tuning”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>To address point (c), in addition to adding Supplementary Figure 3 to the main text, we have plotted the mean data and carried out statistical significance tests for the slopes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For their main hypothesis to be supported, I believe the authors should start again with Figure 2J and 2K. Calculating the mean, spike counts (from Supplementary Figure 3A), without including the standard zoom. If a normalizing factor must be used, one less dependent on a single value would be better (e.g. mean across all coherences).</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the suggested data analysis, thank you. Results are reported in Figure 2K and legend. We kept the normalization to the coherent looming response in Figure 2M, since the new Figure 2K addresses the point and this allows a direct comparison with the model data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following, the rest of the manuscript flows very well, delving further into proposed mechanisms underlying this preference. This includes solid proposals of interactions between HCN and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, and robust modeling efforts.</p><p>2) Figure 2I reveals interesting time courses of control and ZD7288 that are not discussed in further depth. With intracellular application of ZD7288 the spiking activity (red dashed line) ends earlier than control. This is not simply a gain scaling, as response onset initially builds with the same time course as the control. These waveforms are also different with the extracellular applications.</p><p>How do these differences in time course affect further analysis? That is, what is the time window considered for calculating spike count? Do the model simulations explain any of these interesting temporal dynamics? Furthermore, if peak spike rates were used instead, would the calculated coherence preference across conditions exhibit similar traits?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not dwell in the differences in firing rate time course, although we agree that there may be interesting points to be characterized there in future work. We note, however, that some of the differences between the raw spiking traces and the firing rates are due to smoothing with the Gaussian window, and that noise would have to be factored into the data analysis to see if the differences in extracellular responses are significant. In any case, these differences do not affect the results because we did not select a time window to analyze spiking, but rather used the spikes elicited over the entire trial (see above). We do not know if the model can explain the dynamics differences although this is again something we will consider in future work. As for the peak spike rates, as illustrated in Figure 1G, peak rate indeed decreases with coherence. We have now also added plots to Figure 2—figure supplement 2 showing that calculating coherence preference from the peak spike rates yields very similar results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear in the main text when individual trials (across animals) are considered as independent samples for the statistical tests. Or if and when such replicates are averaged into a single sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although data in Figure 2K is presented as median and the authors applied a paired t-test (similarly in other tests).

I presume the solutions could not be washed out, therefore all these results are with controls first, followed by treatments. Although the authors cannot get around this difficulty, it should be described clearly so that readers can consider confounding factors such as animal fatigue and neuronal habituation on such responses.</p></disp-quote><p>The within condition variability across animals in Figure 2L (previously 2k) was not normal, which is why the median and mad where chosen to illustrate population averages. The change caused by ZD7288 application, however, was normally distributed. Which is why the paired t-test was used. Note, however, that the corresponding non-parametric test yielded the same results (p = 0.002; signed-rank test). We have modified the Materials and methods section to make this clear (subsection “Data analysis and statistics”, sixth paragraph). We have also updated the Materials and methods section (subsection “Visual stimuli”, first paragraph) to address the ordering of drug conditions and the possible fatigue confound.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a revision of an interesting paper on dendritic computation in a visually-sensitive neuron in grasshopper.
