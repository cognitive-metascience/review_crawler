migration, cell extrusion and wound healing. The acto-myosin cytoskeleton acts as a major force-generator during the de novo formation and remodeling of AJ. Here, we investigated the role of non-muscle myosin II isoforms (NMIIA and NMIIB) in epithelial junction assembly. NMIIA and NMIIB differentially regulate biogenesis of AJ through association with distinct actin networks. Analysis of junction dynamics, actin organization, and mechanical forces of control and knockdown cells for myosins revealed that NMIIA provides the mechanical tugging force necessary for cell-cell junction reinforcement and maintenance. NMIIB is involved in E-cadherin clustering, maintenance of a branched actin layer connecting E-cadherin complexes and perijunctional actin fibres leading to the building-up of anisotropic stress. These data reveal unanticipated complementary functions of NMIIA and NMIIB in the biogenesis and integrity of AJ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>adherens junctions</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoG-617233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladoux</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE13-0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mège</surname><given-names>René-Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mège</surname><given-names>René-Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Ladoux</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR‐11‐LABX‐0071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mège</surname><given-names>René-Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Ladoux</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladoux</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE13-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladoux</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe Labellisée</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mège</surname><given-names>René-Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Défi Mechanobiology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mège</surname><given-names>René-Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myosin isoforms exhibit different functions in the formation of <italic>adherens</italic> junctions and the transmission of mechanical forces.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue integrity and plasticity rely on cell-cell adhesion and cell contractility. The formation, remodeling and disassembly of cell-cell adhesions are fundamental events accompanying all stages of morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and healing. AJ mediated by E-cadherin/catenin complexes are key elements of epithelial cell-cell adhesions and the first ones to assemble upon contact initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takeichi, 2014</xref>).

During de novo cell-cell contact formation, initial contact between facing lamellipodia induces immediate clustering of cadherin molecules by trans- and cis-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yap et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mège et al., 2006</xref>).

NMII is essential for epithelial tissue architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salomon et al., 2017</xref>), epithelial tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>), tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tamada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begnaud et al., 2016</xref>) and cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>). NMII protects junctions from disassembly during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weng and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>) and provides the mechanical tugging force necessary for AJ reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). In endothelial cells, NMII is recruited early in filopodia-mediated bridge bundles and its activity is required for accumulation of VE-cadherin in nascent AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoelzle and Svitkina, 2012</xref>). In epithelial cells, NMII favors local concentration of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shewan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>) and it is enriched at the edges of elongating junctions where it drives contact expansion in response to RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krendel and Bonder, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, NMII heavy chains exist as three different isoforms: NMIIA, NMIIB and NMIIC encoded by <italic>MYH9</italic>, <italic>MYH10</italic> and <italic>MYH14</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conti and Adelstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). NMIIA and NMIIB are widely expressed whereas NMIIC is not detected in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). Despite structural similarities, NMIIA and NMIIB isoforms have been assigned both redundant and specific functions depending on cell types and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach and Hammer, 2015</xref>). NMIIA and NMIIB exhibit different ATPase activities and actin-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kovács et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billington et al., 2013</xref>), in addition to their specific C-terminal tails that confer them unique functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sandquist and Means, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Juanes-Garcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Kumar, 2015</xref>). These two isoforms can exist as activated monomers in cells, but they can also co-assemble as homotypic and heterotypic filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shutova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beach et al., 2014</xref>). NMIIA and NMIIB play both unique and overlapping roles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skoglund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haque et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ridge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tullio et al., 1997</xref>). In cells migrating on 2D surfaces, NMIIA localizes at the cell front, limits lamellipodial protrusive activity and reduces 2D cell migration speed by regulating focal adhesions dynamics and traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betapudi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorrisch et al., 2013</xref>).

In 3D, NMIIA favors cell displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betapudi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorrisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shih and Yamada, 2010</xref>) while NMIIB drives nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). NMIIB also plays a determinant role in durotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raab et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the roles of NMII isoforms in cell motility on ECM have been extensively studied, very little is known on their respective functions in AJs organization. Yap and collaborators have reported that NMIIA and NMIIB both localize at apical junction complexes of polarized MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>). Upon specific isoform expression silencing, they further proposed that NMIIA may favor the accumulation of E-cadherin in the AJ belt while NMIIB may stabilize the associated perijunctional actin ring, reinforce junctions and prevent them from disruptive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). Ozawa reported using CRISPR-Cas9 gene invalidation that NMIIA was required to assemble junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozawa, 2018</xref>). Svitkina and collaborators reported an association of NMIIA with contractile actin bundle running parallel to linear AJ in endothelial cells, but failed to precisely localize NMIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Efimova and Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Here we further explore the functions of NMII isoforms in epithelial AJ biogenesis using an in vitro system based on chemically-switchable micro-patterns, whereby we can control the time and location of a new contact forming between two single cells on a matrix-coated surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro system for the study of early cell-cell contacts</title><p>In order to study early AJ biogenesis, pairs of GFP-E-cadherin expressing MDCK cells were plated on arrays of 5 µm-distant fibronectin-coated micro-patterns surrounded by switchable cytorepulsive surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Dongen et al., 2013</xref>). After complete spreading, the confinement imposed by the micro-patterns was released by addition of an RGD-motif containing modified peptide that switched the surface surrounding patterns from a cytorepulsive to an adhesive surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Junction biogenesis was monitored by confocal spinning disk microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Within 2 hr, cells extended lamellipodia in random directions and approximately 50% of the pairs of cells contacted within 12 hr. The junction extended reaching a plateau at 40–45 µm length in around 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,e</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>), GFP-E-cadherin accumulated at the edges of the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

NMIIA has been reported to be by large the major isoform of NMII expressed in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). However, immunostainings revealed that the three isoforms, NMIIA, NMIIB and NMIIC could be detected in MDCK cells. NMIIA and NMIIC fully co-localized to similar structures, which was not the case for NMIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). For these reasons, we decided to focus on NMIIA and NMIIB isoforms. Expression of each isoform was silenced in GFP-E-cadherin MDCK cells by stable transfection of specific ShRNA encoding plasmids, leading to an inhibition of expression of around 60–70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The analysis of cell-cell contact formation in cell doublets by live-imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) revealed that NMIIB knock-down (NMIIB KD) cells formed and extended intercellular junctions very similar to control (Ctrl) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>). In contrast, almost half of NMIIA knock-down (NMIIA KD) cell doublets were unable to sustain contacts more than 3 hr, and when they did so, these contacts remained shorter than for Ctrl or NMIIB KD cell doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>), similar to what was observed in Y27-treated cell doublets. NMIIB KD doublets, despite their ability to maintain cell-cell contacts for longer times, formed twisted junctions that were significantly less straight than Ctrl and NMIIA KD cells and deviated significantly more from their initial orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h</xref>). These defects in NMIIB KD cells were already observed at early stages of junction biogenesis and were associated to the formation of large extensions of junctional membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, arrows). Together, these results show that both NMIIA and NMIIB are required for the biogenesis of stable AJs, albeit with different contributions; NMIIA favors temporal stability whereas NMIIB ensures the straightness and spatial stability of the junctions, which is in agreement with different contributions of NMIIA and NMIIB in mature junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46599.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NMIIA and NMIIB are both required for proper junction biogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Left panels: Representative immunoblots showing the isoform specific knockdown of NMIIA (<bold>a</bold>) and NMIIB (<bold>b</bold>) in NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD MDCK cells.

After one day of culture, NMIIB and NMIIA were differentially localized in sub-confluent cell clusters. NMIIA was associated to stress fibres and excluded from junctional membranes while NMIIB colocalized with E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts. After 3 days of culture, confluent MDCK cells started to develop an apico-basal polarization and the two isoforms associated to apically positioned <italic>zonulae adherens</italic>. However, even at these stages, only NMIIB colocalized with E-cadherin, while NMIIA was accumulated perijunctionnally as previously reported in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>). At the basal side, they were both associated to stress fibres. To confirm the differential localization of the two isoforms we analysed the distribution in transiently transfected MDCK cells of GFP-NMIIA and of mCherry-NMIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). mCherry-NMIIB accumulated at junctional membranes while GFP-NMIIA accumulated in perijunctional areas as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozawa (2018)</xref>. These differential distributions at the early stages of AJ formation were not specific to MDCK cells, and were observed as well in small clusters of Caco2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Considering recent findings showing a possible interaction between NMIIB and α-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vassilev et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that NMIIB could be recruited to the junction through α-catenin/E-cadherin complexes. Accordingly, in α-catenin KD MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamin et al., 2010</xref>), NMIIB was relocalized to NMIIA-enriched stress fibres and circumnuclear actin cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c,d</xref>), indicating that α-catenin is required for NMIIB junctional recruitment.</p><p>To better characterize the organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton at nascent AJs, co-stainings of NMIIA, NMIIB, F-actin and β−catenin performed on control MDCK cells were imaged using structured illumination microscopy (SIM).

Using SIM microscopy, we analyzed the organization of junctional actin cytoskeleton in NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD cells. NMIIA KD cells exhibited shorter actin bundles running parallel to the junction, while their juxtamembrane F-actin meshwork was comparable to the one of Ctrl cells, both in terms of morphology and cortactin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). In contrast, NMIIB KD cells presented a strongly enlarged area of junctional F-actin meshwork colocalizing with β−catenin that corresponded to overlapping membrane extensions stained with cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). In addition, while they retained some of the perijunctional actin bundles, we could observe numerous oblique actin bundles directed toward the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). These results show that NMIIA supports the organization of perijunctional actin bundles while NMIIB contributes to restrain the extent of the juxtamembrane F-actin meshwork that couples perijunctional bundles to the plasma membrane, thus restraining lamellipodial activity at the junction.</p><p>An Arp2/3-nucleated actin network at the <italic>zonula adherens</italic> has been shown to regulate junctional tension in epithelial monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verma et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, junctional tension has been shown to associate with the presence of α-catenin molecules under open conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a direct link between α−catenin and NMIIB has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vassilev et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that NMIIB recruitment, α-catenin molecular unfolding and regulation of branched actin polymerization could be tightly linked. Thus, we performed immunostainings with the α18 monoclonal antibody recognizing the open conformation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, the ratio of α18 on total α−catenin junctional staining was decreased by four times in NMIIB KD cells compared to Ctrl cells, while it was not affected in NMIIA KD cells. This suggests that junctional α-catenin molecules were significantly turned to the closed conformational state in NMIIB KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g–i</xref>). In contrast, the total α-catenin junctional levels were significantly reduced in NMIIA KD cells, as shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shewan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these results strengthen complementary contributions for NMIIB and NMIIA where NMIIB is the main isoform required for the organization of juxtamembrane actin cushion and NMIIA for organization of perijunctional contractile actin fibres.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NMIIA is required for the generation of forces at E-cadherin adhesions while NMIIB favors their transmission through F-actin anchoring</title><p>The formation of cell-cell junctions in cell doublets is concomitant with the formation of cell-matrix adhesions and the tugging force applied on cell-cell contacts must be compensated by traction of the cells on cell-matrix adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). To further understand the contributions of NMII isoforms in junction biogenesis, we thus experimentally decoupled these two adhesion systems. We first investigated the role of NMII isoforms in cell-matrix adhesion by seeding single Ctrl, NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD cells on fibronectin-coated glass. NMIIA KD cells spread 1.7 times more than Ctrl and NMIIB KD cells on fibronectin and their actin cytoskeleton was highly perturbed exhibiting a strong decrease in ventral stress fibres and cortical actin bundles together with an enlargement of their lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). NMIIA KD cells also formed significantly less focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,c</xref>). In contrast, NMIIB KD cells showed no defect in actin organization, cell spreading or focal adhesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Next, we measured by TFM the magnitude of traction forces applied by single cells on deformable fibronectin-coated 30 kPa PDMS gels. NMIIA KD cells exerted lower traction forces than Ctrl cells as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorrisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shutova et al., 2017</xref>). NMIIB KD cells, on the contrary, did not show any defect in traction force generation on this substratum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). These results, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorrisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sandquist et al., 2006</xref>), show that NMIIA is the isoform regulating cell spreading, cell adhesion, traction force generation and organization of contractile actin structures on fibronectin. In contrary MNIIB is not contributing at all to the cell-matrix adhesion, focal adhesion formation, actomyosin reorganization and traction forces on fibronectin.</p><p>To explore the contribution of NMII isoforms to E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion per se, we seeded single cells on E-cadherin-coated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). After 6 hr, Ctrl and NMIIA KD cells had spread similarly with mean areas of 1178 ± 40 µm² and 1031 ± 37 µm<sup>2</sup> respectively, while NMIIB KD cell spreading was significantly reduced (mean area = 515 ± 21 µm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a,c</xref>). Ctrl cells organized thick circumnuclear actin arcs, as well as radial actin fibres connected to peripheral β-catenin clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gavard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2017</xref>). NMIIA KD cells, while spreading as Ctrl cells on E-cadherin lacked the circumnuclear actin arcs and formed fewer large and small cadherin clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a,d</xref>). In particular they could not organize large clusters aligned along actin cables, as reported in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>). NMIIB KD cells kept the organization of circumnuclear actin arcs, but were depleted of radial actin bundles, did not form significant β-catenin clusters and failed to spread on E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a,c,d</xref>). Contrasting with data obtained in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>), these data indicated that NMIIB plays a major role in the clustering and stabilization of E-cadherin/catenin complexes that in turn promote cell spreading. Our findings also suggest that NMIIA is required for the formation of contractile actin fibres that apply traction forces on the cadherin adhesions. We thus measured the capacity of these cells to transmit forces through E-cadherin complexes by TFM, seeding them on E-cadherin-coated 15 kPa PDMS elastic gels. Compared to Ctrl cells, NMIIA KD cells exhibited very low forces on E-cadherin substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2e,f</xref>), confirming that NMIIA generates the forces transmitted to E-cadherin adhesions. NMIIB KD cells, that failed to cluster cadherin/catenin complexes, also generated lower traction forces than Ctrl cells, albeit to a lesser extent than NMIIA KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2e,f</xref>). Even though both NMII isoforms contribute to cell-generated forces on E-cadherin substratum, they have complementary contributions. NMIIA is required for the formation of stress fibres while NMIIB would rather regulate the transmission of force and the coupling of actin stress fibres to the cadherin-catenin complexes. Slight divergences on localizations and effects of silencing reported here compared to data obtained in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>) may relate to the reported changes in homo/heteropolymerization of NMIIA and NMIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shutova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beach et al., 2014</xref>) which could depend on relative levels of expression and/or maturation of contractile actin fibres.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NMIIA and NMIIB are required for proper organization of inter-cellular junctional stress</title><p>To directly determine how NMIIA and NMIIB contribute to traction force generation and transmission during AJ biogenesis, we mapped traction forces before and after cell-cell contact formation in cell doublets. Hotspots of traction forces were generated at the periphery of the doublet where lamellipodia arise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). As expected from the TFM data obtained with single cells seeded on fibronectin, NMIIA KD doublets, compared to Ctrl and NMIIB KD ones, exhibited lower traction forces both before and after cell-cell contact formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>). NMIIB KD doublets developed traction forces similar in magnitude to those developed by Ctrl ones, with however different patterns. Hotspots of forces frequently appeared in the junctional area in NMIIB KD doublets that were generally absent in Ctrl and NMIIA doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). We quantified these differences by analysing the spatial repartition of forces in the peripheral and central subdomains of the junction, and their orientation relative to main junction axis (parallel, F<sub>//</sub>, and perpendicular, F<sub>⊥</sub>, components). NMIIB KD doublets generated higher F<sub>⊥</sub> in the central part of the junction and lower values of F<sub>//</sub> with respect to Ctrl doublets in both the peripheral and the central part (albeit not significantly) of the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). As a consequence, the ratios of parallel/perpendicular forces in the central and peripheral part of the junction were lower in NMIIB KD doublets compared to Ctrl doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3c</xref>). The mechanical perturbation induced by knocking down NMIIB leads to a redistribution of transmitted forces in the junctional area at both cell-cell and cell-substrate interfaces. These results show that NMIIB plays an important role in the repartition of traction forces under the junction and that NMIIA is essential for the generation of traction forces in general. We next quantified the capacity of NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD cells to transmit forces across the junction. Following Newton’s laws, the net traction force exerted by an isolated doublet is zero, up to the measurement noise. Conversely, the net traction forces exerted by each of the two cells are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, compensating exactly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). We thus calculated the resultant vectorial sum of forces per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In all conditions, the resultant force per cell before contact was within the level of noise as expected for isolated cells and increased within 30 min after contact to reach a plateau, attesting the capacity of all three cell lines to transmit intercellular tugging forces across the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). However, in NMIIA KD cells, the resultant forces per cell at the plateau was significantly lower than in Ctrl and NMIIB KD cell doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), which is consistent with the inability of these cells to apply strong traction forces on fibronectin substratum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46599.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NMIIA and NMIIB are both required for establishment of proper inter-cellular stress.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heat map with vectorial field of traction forces (left panels) and ellipse representation of intra-cellular stress (right panel, the two axes represent the direction and magnitude of the principal components of the stress tensor, positive values in red, negative values in blue) of inter-cellular stress (right panels) in Ctrl, NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD cell pairs before, during and after contact on fibronectin-coated PDMS deformable substrate (30 KPa).

The in-plane stress is represented by a tensor with three independent components: two components of normal stress denoting either tension (positive values) or compression (negative values) along the corresponding directions, and one component of shear stress, except in the basis of the tensor’s principle directions, where there is no shear stress. The ellipse representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> shows that the stress is highly anisotropic, and the cells are mostly under tension except for regions of very small compression associated to high tension in the other direction. The NMIIA KD cells show lower tension, consistent with the lower amount of traction forces they exert. We focused on the normal stress within the region of cell-cell junction, as AJs provide a mechanical link that drives transmission of forces between cells and thus organize inter-cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saw et al., 2017</xref>).

Lower panels: proposed molecular organization of early junctions. Middle panels: distribution of intercellular stress. Ctrl cells establish stable and straight junctions maintained under an anisotropic intercellular stress preeminent parallel to the junction. NMIIB associates to- and organizes the junctional branched actin meshwork. NMIIA, which provides mechanical tugging force, sits on distant perijunctional actin bundles parallel to the junction. NMIIA KD cells fail to maintain stable cell-cell contacts exhibit shorter junctions, weak traction forces and weak intercellular stress. Perijunctional actin bundles are smaller and disorganized. NMIIB KD cells establish persistent but wavy junctions from which lamellipodial extensions and traction force hotspots arise. The junctional branched actin meshwork is disorganized which probably prevents α-catenin opening and induces the formation of lamellipodial extensions. The anchoring of perijunctional actin bundles to the junction is perturbed, despite the presence of NMIIA. There is, in these cells, no preferential orientation of intercellular stress.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46599-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our careful examination by SIM during junction biogenesis revealed precise patterns of NMII, actin and E-cadherin localization whereas other studies mostly focused on actin and NMII in mature junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smutny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2015</xref>). While NMIIA associated to actin bundles parallel to- and distant from the junction, NMIIB was sitting at junctional membranes in association with a juxtamembrane actin network, distinct from NMIIA-associated actin. The existence of two distinct actin networks at <italic>adherens</italic> junctions had already been observed in early junctions between hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krendel and Bonder, 1999</xref>) and in endothelial cells where VE-cadherin was shown to colocalize with Arp2/3 complex-positive actin networks in-between distal actin-NMII bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Efimova and Svitkina, 2018</xref>). The localization of NMIIA is reminiscent of what has been observed previously in linear AJ of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Efimova and Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Strikingly, we show here an unexpected association of NMIIB with a juxtamembrane actin cushion that links the junctional membrane to NMIIA-associated perijunctional contractile actin bundles. Our data support a role of NMIIB in linking adhesion complexes and perijunctional actin bundle and on restraining lamellipodial activity at the junction. We believe that these are properties common to the early stage of AJ formation in many cell types that then mature to elaborate <italic>zonulae adherens</italic> in epithelial cells where both actin organizations persist but become tightly packed to the junctional membrane. Interestingly, in the absence of α-catenin, the localization of NMIIB was not restricted any more to junctional membranes. Instead, NMIIB co-assembled with NMIIA on the same actin fibres, likely in heretotypic minifilaments, as observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach and Hammer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shutova et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that α-catenin is responsible for the junctional recruitment of NMIIB, as reinforced by a recent publication reporting NMIIB and α-catenin interaction in glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vassilev et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These distinct localization patterns at early junctions are correlated to differential contributions of NMIIA and NMIIB in junction biogenesis. Upon contact formation, NMIIA KD cells were unable to elongate the junction and to sustain long-lived cell-cell contacts. They also lacked the capacity to produce traction forces on E-cadherin-coated substrates. Our observations thus identify NMIIA as the major isoform responsible for the NMII-dependent mechanical tugging force required for junction growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). This was confirmed by traction force and stress analysis data revealing a decrease of the forces as well as a reduction of both parallel and perpendicular stresses at the junction for NMIIA KD cells. In contrast, NMIIB KD cells transmitted elevated tugging forces and maintained cell-cell contacts, but their junctions appeared enlarged and twisted with a lower parallel stress. These results are remarkable given that NMIIB was found to be expressed 100 times less than NMIIA in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). NMIIB was required for efficient E-cadherin clustering on E-cadherin substrates and for the connection of the contractile actin network to these clusters. NMIIB was required for the proper organization and spatial restriction of the juxtamembrane actin network and was also the main isoform responsible for the maintenance of α-catenin in an opened conformation. However, we observed a reduced junctional recruitment of α-catenin in NMIIA KD cells, suggesting also a contribution of NMIIA in α-catenin activation in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozawa, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given that E-cadherin complexes have been shown to biochemically interact with both Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kovacs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verma et al., 2012</xref>) and NMIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vassilev et al., 2017</xref>), one hypothesis could be that NMIIB and Arp2/3 are both recruited to E-cadherin/catenin complexes upon cell-cell contact initiation. NMIIB could thus serve as a cross-linker of the junctional actin network. Hence, the absence of NMIIB may keep α-catenin in a closed conformation and induce a local softening of AJs which in turn leads to increased junctional lamellipodial extension. It is also in agreement with a previous study showing that Arp2/3-nucleated actin network at the <italic>zonula adherens</italic> regulates junctional tension and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verma et al., 2012</xref>). NMIIB, by associating both with cadherin-catenin complexes and the branched actin, could somehow rigidify and regulate the thickness of this F-actin cushion sitting between the membrane and the contractile actin fibres associated to NMIIA. This could be achieved through the specific biochemical properties of NMIIB towards actin that provide it with the capacity to transmit tension within actin filaments at low energetic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Along this line, it is striking to note that we never observe in early AJ any sign of organization of NMIIB in minifilaments in the junctional area as observed for NMIIA in perijunctional actin bundles.</p><p>Inter-cellular stress is generated at cell-cell adhesions, although this remained poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we evaluated the amount and the orientation of intercellular stress generated during junction biogenesis. Within one hour of cell-cell contact, an anisotropic intercellular stress appeared at the junction, with a preferential orientation parallel to the junction, favoring the elongation and the stability of the nascent junction. Both isoforms were required for proper establishment and orientation of this intercellular stress. NMIIA silencing had a global impact on the amount of intercellular stress generated, which was not surprising given its role on traction force production both at cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions. On the other hand, NMIIB favored the production of a higher parallel intercellular stress, probably by driving the crosslinking and stiffening of the junctional actin network that couples the perijunctional contractile actin to the plasma membrane.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate here that both NMIIA and NMIIB contribute to the early steps of AJ biogenesis and are necessary for mechanical integrity of the junction, albeit implicated in very different aspects of adhesion complexes and actin pools organization. These findings open new avenues in the understanding of how distinct pools of actomyosin, associated to different myosin isoforms, build up and integrate mechanical forces to regulate adherens junction remodeling and intercellular stress in vertebrate cells in order to achieve large scale tissue remodeling during embryogenesis and tissue repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Canis familiaris, dog</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MDCK</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC CCL-34</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Caco-2</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC HTB-37</td><td valign="top">Kindly provided by S.Robine <break/>(Institut Cuire/CNRS, Paris)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NMIIA rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">909801</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF and 1/1000 for WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NMIIA mouse monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab55456</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF and 1/1000 for WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-NMIIB polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">909901</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF and 1/1000 for WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-β-catenin rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">C2206</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-β-catenin mouse monoclonal</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">610156</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">recombinant anti-paxillin rabbit monoclonal antibody</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Ab32084</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-GAPDH</td><td valign="top">ProteinTech</td><td valign="top">60004–1-Ig</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-Arp3</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A5979</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-E-cadherin</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">610181</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-α-catenin polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">C-2081</td><td valign="top">1/100 for IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rat anti-α18-catenin monoclonal</td><td valign="top">generously provided by A.

Immunocomplexes of interest were detected using Supersignal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate (ThermoFisher) and visualized with ChemiDoc chemoluminescence detection system (Biorad). Quantification of Western blots by densitometry was performed using the Gel analyzer plug in from Image J.

They were coated for 1 hr with 50 μg/mL human plasma fibronectin (Merck Millipore) diluted in PBS and washed three times with PBS.</p><p>The protocol for E-cadherin coating was inspired from a previous study by Lee and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the cleaned glass coverslips were silanized with 10% 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich) in 100% ethanol for 10 min at RT, washed once in 100% ethanol and dried at 80°C for 10 min. The surface was then functionalized by incubation for 1 hr with 2 mM EDC-HCl (Thermo Scientific)/5 mM NHS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 µg of recombinant human E-cadherin (R and D systems). Coverslips were then washed two times with PBS.</p><p>Cells were plated at very low density (typically 1 105 cells for a 32 mm diameter coverslip) on the coated coverslips in complete medium containing 10 μg/mL mitomycin C. After 1 hr incubation at 37°C, the preparations were washed twice with complete media and incubated 2–6 hr or overnight at 37°C before imaging or fixation, for cadherin coating and fibronectin coating, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Preparation of switchable micro-patterns and imaging</title><p>Micropatterns were made as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Dongen et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, air dried cleaned glass coverslips were activated with deep UV for 5 min, and coated for at least 1 hr with the repellent compound APP (0.1 mg/ml in HEPES 10 mM pH7.4). After three washes with deionized water, the coverslips were exposed to deep UV for 7 min through a chrome photomask. The coverslips were then washed with deionized water three times, coated with 50 μg/mL human plasma fibronectin for 1 hr and washed twice with deionized water and once with PBS. When indicated, the coating was done with a 2:1 ratio of non-coupled:Cy3-coupled fibronectin prepared with Cy3 Mono-Reactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare) as recommended by the manufacturer.</p><p>Cells were resuspended at 4.10² cells/mm² in medium containing 10 μg/mL mitomycin C and deposited on the patterned slide. After 1 hr of incubation at 37°C, cells were washed 3 times with fresh medium to remove mitomycin C and cells that remained in suspension. The cells that adhered on micro-patterns were left overnight in the incubator. The day after, confinement was released by addition of 20 μM BCN-RGD peptide diluted in DMEM media or, in case of live-imaging experiments, in Fluorobrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. For ROCK inhibition experiments, 50 μM Y-27632 was added at the same time as BCN-RGD. Samples were then immediately imaged under a microscope or left in the incubator for 20 more hours and fixed as described above. When indicated for live-imaging experiments, nuclei were stained before adding BCN-RGD peptide by incubating the preparations with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 34580 in the medium for 20 min at 37°C followed by two washes with fresh media.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>For live-microscopy experiments, the samples were placed in a chamber equilibrated at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Images were acquired with a Yokogawa-Andor CSU-W1 Spinning Disk confocal mounted on an inversed motorized Leica DMI8 microscope and equipped with a sCMOS Orca-Flash 4 V2+ camera (Hamamatsu) and a 63 X oil immersion objective or a 20 X dry objective, with multi-positioning and a resolution of 0.5–3 μm z-stacks. Alternatively, the samples were imaged with an Olympus IX81 wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with a Coolsnap HQ CCD camera and a 60X oil immersion objective or a 20 X dry objective. For some experiments, the Nikon Biostation IM-Q microscope was also used with 10X or 20X objective and multi-positioning.</p><p>For fixed samples, images were acquired with a Zeiss Apotome fluorescence microscope equipped with a 63 X oil immersion objective or with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with a 63 X oil immersion objective at a resolution of 0.3 μm z-stacks.</p><p>Image processing and analysis were done on Fiji software. Analysis of junction parameters (length, straightness and angle deviation) was done manually with Fiji software based on phase contrast and GFP-Ecadherin signal. Cell spreading, focal adhesions and α-catenin clustering were analyzed by thresholding the image and applying an ‘Analyze particles’ which gives the number of objects and its area. To calculate the ratio of α-cat to α18-cat intensities, the mean gray intensity value for the two channels were measured within the manually-defined junction. Tracking of single cells on fibronectin was done using the Manual Tracking plugin. For colocalization analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated using the Coloc2 Plugin from image J, on an ROI corresponding to the junction area. For relative intensiy profiles, a line was drawn on the ROI and the line scan was done using the plot profile plugin in image J, the values obtained were then normalized to the maximal intensity of each channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Traction force microscopy</title><p>Soft silicone elastomer substrates for TFM (Traction force microscopy) were prepared as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vedula et al., 2014</xref>). Cy 52–276 A and Cy 52–276 B silicone elastomer components (Dow corning) were mixed in a 5:5 (elastic modulus ∼15 kPa for E-cadherin-coating) or a 5:6 ratio (elastic modulus ∼30 kPa for fibronectin-coating). 0.08 g of elastomer was deposited on 32 mm glass coverslips and allowed to spread progressively. The substrate was silanized with 10% (3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma) in 100% ethanol for 10 min at RT, washed once in 100% ethanol and dried at 80°C for 10 min. The surface was coated for 10 min at RT with carboxylated red fluorescent beads (100 nm, Invitrogen) diluted at 2-3/1000 in deionized water. After washing with deionized water, the surface was finally functionalized with protein (fibronectin or E-cadherin) as described above. Seeded cells together with fluorescent beads were imaged either on an Olympus-CSU-W1 Spinning Disk confocal microscope with a 10 X dry objective and 3 μm z stacks or on an Olympus-IX81 wide field inverted fluorescence microscope with a 20 X dry objective for 2 to 24 hr, at a frequency of 1 frame every 10 min, at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of the acquisition, 100–200 μL of 10% SDS was added in the media to detach cells and image a reference frame. For force calculation, matPIV was used to analyse the displacement vectors of the beads, which were further translated into forces using the FTTC plugin in ImageJ. The vector quiver plots and heat map of magnitude force was plotted using Matlab. Mean (resp. resultant) forces exerted by cells and doublets were obtained by computing the average of the magnitude (resp. the vectorial sum) of traction forces within manually defined masks. For the analysis of tractions forces below cell-cell junctions, the junction masks and corresponding midline were first manually defined based on the E-cadherin-GFP pictures. Then, the midline was used to define the average orientation of the junction, and all force vectors within the junction mask were projected onto the directions parallel and perpendicular to this orientation. The mask was divided in four quarters along this mean orientation. The ‘junction centre parallel (resp. perpendicular) force’ is defined as the averaged absolute value of the parallel (resp. perpendicular) component of traction forces in the two central quarters of the mask, while the ‘junction periphery parallel (resp. perpendicular) force’ is the averaged absolute value of the parallel (resp. perpendicular) component of traction forces in the two outermost quarters.</p><p>T_(parallel/perpendicular)^(center/periphery)=⟨|T_(parallel/perpendicular) |⟩_(center/periphery)</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calculation of inter-cellular stress</title><p>Computing the junctional stress components σ = andσ⊥, respectively parallel and perpendicular to the cell junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), required both the determination of the cell junction location and the estimation of the inter-cellular stress tensor. The cell junction domain was defined as the overlap between two masks representing the area covered by each cell in the doublet. Given the stress tensor, the parallel and perpendicular stress components were obtained by rotation from the cartesian basis. As exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, we found in most cases that the cell junction domain was roughly straight: the mean orientation of the cell junction domain determined the rotation angle. We checked that following the cell junction contour did not significantly modify our estimates. Finally, each junctional stress component was spatially-averaged over the cell junction domain.</p><p>Intercellular stress was estimated by Bayesian inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nier et al., 2016</xref>), with a dimensionless regularization parameter Λ = 10<sup>5</sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris et al., 2014</xref> for details). The spatial domain for stress estimation was for each image the smallest rectangle encompassing the cell doublet. For simplicity, we implemented free stress boundary conditions on the straight boundaries of the rectangular domain, instead of following the cell doublet boundaries. As a consequence, the stress estimation was qualitative, but sufficed to evaluate differences between conditions. Note that height variations within the cell doublet were also neglected in the estimation of the 2D inter-cellular stress field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>SIM microscopy</title><p>Super-resolution structured-illumination microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope with a 63 X objective (Plan Apo 1.4NA oil immersion) and an additional optovar lens 1.6 X. Cells grown on 0.17 mm high-performance Zeiss coverslips were fixed and prepared for immunostaining, then with DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting media (Southern Biotech). Laser lines 488 nm, 561 nm and 641 nm were directed into the microscope, passing through a diffraction grating. For 3D SIM imaging, the diffraction grating was rotated along three directions (angles 120o) and translated (five lateral positions) throughout the acquisition. Typically, 20–30 slices of 110 nm were acquired for each cell corresponding to an imaging height of 2–3 μm. The fluorescence signal was detected with an EMCCD camera (iXon-885, Andor, 1004 × 1002, pixel size 8 μm, QE = 65%). Processed SIM images were aligned via an affine transformation matrix of predefined values obtained using 100 nm multicolor Tetraspeck fluorescent microspheres (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data display and statistics</title><p>Images were mounted using Photoshop and Illustrator.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dennis Discher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper explores the roles of non-muscle myosin isoforms in cell-cell junction formation. Similar studies using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout have been reported, but the direct assessment of the roles of NMIIA and B on tension anisotropy, as well as exploration of the roles of these isoforms on developing junctions, are significant contributions. Some of the results presented here contradict earlier studies, and the paper needs to carefully compare and discuss the present results to these earlier studies. In addition, there are several concerns that must be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures 3 and 4 show the localization of NMIIA and NMIIB at and near adherens junctions with regular confocal microscopy (Figure 3) and structured illumination microscopy (Figure 4). The two figures are inconsistent in that Figure 3 shows NMIIB only associated with the E-cad/β-catenin/membrane and absent from the perijunctional F-actin cables, whereas the SIM images clearly show NMIIB localized to both structures. The authors appear to go along with the results from Figure 3 and ignore the clear co-localization of NMIIB with NMIIA in F-actin cables on both sides of the cell-cell junction in their Results and Discussion. Given that much of the authors' model rests on results arising from the use of immunocytochemistry (which depends on the robustness of the two antibodies used here) to differentially localize myosin IIA and IIB, it is important to confirm them using either knock-in GFP labels, or else exogenous myosin constructs expressed at levels comparable to that of the native proteins. Do the SIM images in particular reproduce with GFP-NMIIB expressed at endogenous levels? These issues are especially important as the authors provide data that are qualitatively different from the Yap lab papers. Finally, quantification of the data in Figures 3-5 should be provided.</p><p>2) From the very widely distributed data in Figure 8D the authors conclude that in contrast to the anisotropic force distribution at junction of control cells NMIIB KD cells exhibit isotropic force distribution. This is based on the mean values for a very wide distribution. It would be more convincing if they compared each pair of measurements (perpendicular and parallel force) from the same junction and did the pairwise statistics. Also, it was not possible to discern tension and compression in Figure 8A as indicated in the text and the illustration to the right of the panels. Something appears to be missing here.</p><p>3) It is essential that the manuscript's results be placed in the context of prior studies. The authors should cite and discuss a paper by Ozawa 2018, which explicitly examines the contribution of myosin IIA to junctional stabilization in MDCK cells. In addition, the work by Smutny et al. (which is cited) shows that the formation of cadherin clusters on surfaces requires myosin IIA, not myosin IIB, in apparent contradiction with the present study. The authors should acknowledge and discuss this puzzling difference. More broadly, Smutny et al. conclude that &quot;[…] myosin IIB supports integrity of the apical actin ring to prevent fragmentation of the ZA, perhaps by reinforcing it to resist disruptive orthogonal forces.&quot; This presages a major outcome of the present study, and should be acknowledged. Finally, Gomez et al. examine the specific localization of myosin IIA and IIB in the context of epithelial cell-cell junctions in MCF7 cells (Gomez et al., 2015), and do not appear to observe the differential localization that the authors here report. This difference should likewise be acknowledged. Overall these differences, which could reflect the use of different cell lines, strongly imply that more caution should be employed in interpreting the present study</p><p>4) The authors claim that &quot;NMIIB supports junctional branched actin organization&quot; (Figure 5) is problematic in several ways. First of all, they provide no evidence that the cortical actin network associated with NMIIB is an arp2/3-dependent branched actin network. It is true that other publications showed arp2/3 localizes to junctions, but so do formins. The cortex is probably nucleated by a combination of nucleators, so the authors shouldn't refer to this juxtamembrane network as branched without any evidence. Second, in Figure 5A or elsewhere I don't see any evidence of a disappearing actin network between the control and NMIIB KD images. So, while it is true that NMIIB associates with membrane proximal actin there are no experimental data that support this claim. This claim needs to be discussed more carefully or dropped.</p><p>5) Figure 6 shows that single NMIIA KD cells barely generate any traction forces on ECM. Figure 8 shows the same with cell doublets. It isn't clear what is learned about the role of NMIIA in generating tension at cell-cell junctions from this experiment. In contrast, Figure 6 shows that the traction forces of NMIIB KD cells on ECM are the same as control. In doublets, Figure 8 shows that the overall traction forces are nearly the same as control, but they observe forces underneath the cell-cell junctions – something not observed in control. This suggests that the force transmission across the cell-cell junction is perturbed and that is why forces are felt at the cell-ECM interface. This should be considered as an explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Myosin II isoforms play distinct roles in adherens junction biogenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

None of these points require new experiments, but rather small modifications to the text. Please consider these carefully and modify accordingly.</p><p>1) The conclusion of the Introduction makes it sounds like this topic has not been investigated previously. A simple fix would be to change &quot;questioned the unexplored functions […]&quot; to &quot;further explore the functions […]&quot; or something similar.</p><p>2) In the subsection “NMIIA and NMIIB orchestrate junction biogenesis”, you need to add a sentence acknowledging that Smutny 2010 reported similar findings in mature junctions. Likewise, the phrase &quot;explored the possibility&quot; is misleading given that Smutny had found NMII isoform differences in regulating junctional actin, and this should be acknowledged.</p><p>3) There are some differences in the differential localization of the NMII isoforms with the Smutny 2010 and Gomez 2015 papers. It appears that some of this is due to your careful examination of NMIIb colocalized with cadherin, whereas the other papers seem to have looked only at actin. It would be helpful to consider this difference.</p><p>4) At first glance your results with α-catenin would seem to contradict those of the Ozawa 2018 paper. However, since you report a lowering of total α-catenin at junctions (subsection “NMIIA regulates the organization of perijunctional actin bundles while NMIIB regulates the organization of a juxtamembrane actin layer”, last paragraph), there is likely no real discrepancy. However, you should discuss this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46599.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures 3 and 4 show the localization of NMIIA and NMIIB at and near adherens junctions with regular confocal microscopy (Figure 3) and structured illumination microscopy (Figure 4).

Indeed, as noticed by the reviewers on SIM images (Figure 4), NMIIB is strongly accumulated at cell-cell contacts at the membrane, but it is also detectable on thick perijunctional F-actin cables, albeit with a lower intensity (see line scans Figure 4C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2D). There is however no inconsistency between Figure 3 and Figure 4, as the presence of perijunctional NMIIB is also seen by confocal microscopy (see Figure 3G Day1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). This is however quite variable from cell to cell. Another example of NMIIB distribution at cell-cell contacts, imaged by confocal microscopy, is provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Thus, the reviewers are right with the fact that our statement on the distribution of NMIIB was mostly centred on membrane-associated localization. We now scrutinized the whole manuscript to correct this and more accurately describe and interpret NMIIB localization at cell-cell contacts (modifications spread over the subsection “NMIIB preferentially localizes to a junctional actin pool distinct from perijunctional NMIIA-associated contractile fibres” and subsection “NMIIA regulates the organization of perijunctional actin bundles while NMIIB regulates the organization of a juxtamembrane actin layer”). This modulation of our message however does not jeopardize the conclusions of our work.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46599.034</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>NMIIB localizes to early AJs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative confocal images and zoom boxes of GFP-E-cadherin-expressing MDCK cell doublets fixed 20h after BCN-RGD addition and immuno-stained for NMIIB.

Our statements in our first draft were somehow unclear and were not referring to the most recent reports (Gomez 2015 and Ozawa 2018). Our data are fully consistent with these two papers reporting a junctional localization of NMIIB and a perijunctional localization of NMIIA. Our data are now discussed at the light of these three papers (subsection “NMIIB preferentially localizes to a junctional actin pool distinct from perijunctional NMIIA-associated contractile fibres”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, quantification of the data in Figures 3-5 should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative analysis of the colocalization of NMIIA or NMIIB toward E-cadherin stainings has been performed for Figure 3A, B, F, G, Figure 4A, B and Figure 5B).

As advised, we have now performed pairwise statistical t tests in Figure 6D to compare parallel and perpendicular stress from the same junction at the same time point in Ctrl, NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD doublets. The results remain unchanged, showing a preferentially parallel anisotropic stress in Ctrl junctions while the stress appears isotropic in NMIIA KD and NMIIB KD junctions. Pairwise statistical t tests were also applied in Figure 6—figure supplement 3B to compare parallel and perpendicular forces at the center and periphery of the junction in Ctrl and NMIIB KD doublets. Moreover, data from additional experiments were added to all the panels of TFM experiments on fibronectin (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and Figure 6—figure supplement 3). These new data did not modify the results and even decreased, in some conditions, the p value obtained initially with statistical tests, which makes our results even more convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it was not possible to discern tension and compression in Figure 8A as indicated in the text and the illustration to the right of the panels.

However, our analysis is much more complete with the analysis of cell spreading, actin organisation and traction force measurement, which have may allowed us to detect more subtle effects. Concerning NMIIA silencing, comparing closely Figure 4B in Smutny and our data Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, we can notice a similar alteration of macrocluster formation (cadherin adhesions) and a milder effect on smaller cadherin puncta in both studies. Thus, these apparent divergences are restricted to NMIIB silencing. This may be driven by changes in levels of homo/heterodimerization of NMIIA and NMIIB as discussed now in the subsection “NMIIA is required for the generation of forces at E-cadherin adhesions while NMIIB favours their transmission through F-actin anchoring”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More broadly, Smutny et al. conclude that &quot;[…] myosin IIB supports integrity of the apical actin ring to prevent fragmentation of the ZA, perhaps by reinforcing it to resist disruptive orthogonal forces.&quot; This presages a major outcome of the present study, and should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We somehow diverge from Smutny et al. interpretations in that we clearly show here that NMIIA is a structural element that assembles actin fiber bundles parallel to the junction that will likely give rise to the apical actin ring observed by Smutny in more polarised cells. We see an effect of NMIIB silencing on the coupling of this actin ring to adhesion complex that may lead to its observed disorganization (Figure 5A, Figure 7) but not its disappearance. Thus NMIIB-mediated coupling may indeed reinforce junctions and prevent them from disruptive forces. This is consistent with our data of TFM on cells seeded non E-cadherin (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This prediction on the outcome of the present study is now acknowledged (Introduction, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, Gomez et al. examine the specific localization of myosin IIA and IIB in the context of epithelial cell-cell junctions in MCF7 cells (Gomez et al., 2015), and do not appear to observe the differential localization that the authors here report.

Moreover, our study focuses on early steps of junction formation, which differs from the 3 other studies performed in polarized cells.

Our data allow to say “NMIIB junctional staining colocalizing with β-catenin was associated with a 200 nm to 1 µm thick fuzzy F-actin network (Figure 4A, B), that also contained both Arp2/3 and cortactin (Figure 5B, C), two known molecular markers of branched actin meshwork.” See also changes in text in the Results section and Figure 5 title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, in Figure 5A or elsewhere I don't see any evidence of a disappearing actin network between the control and NMIIB KD images.

The juxtamembrane actin networks does not disappear in the absence of NMIIB, it is disorganized, basically enlarged as shown in Figure 5B-F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A.

This goes with the decreased FA and stress fibres observed both in NMIIA KD single cells and doublets. In addition, these cells could not apply traction forces on E-cadherin substrates. Thus in NMIIA KD doublets, the decrease in intercellular stress can be explained by the impossibility of each cell to apply forces on the substratum as well as on cell-cell contacts due to a lack of organisation of the major contractile apparatus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast, Figure 6 shows that the traction forces of NMIIB KD cells on ECM are the same as control.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed the case, in agreement with the reported absence of effect of NMIIB silencing on cell spreading and traction on the ECM (Betapudi, Licate and Egelhoff, 2006; Cai et al., 2006; Jorrisch, Shih and Yamada 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In doublets, Figure 8 shows that the overall traction forces are nearly the same as control, but they observe forces underneath the cell-cell junctions – something not observed in control.

Traction forces exerted at the free edges of each cell is then balanced by shared forces transmitted at cell-substrate and cell-cell interfaces in NMIIB KD cells.
