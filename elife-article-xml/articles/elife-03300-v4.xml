We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the ≈10<sup>4</sup> amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the protein's structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinin's evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenza's antigenic evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03300.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03300.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03300.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza is a major threat to human health largely because the flu virus evolves rapidly to escape recognition by the immune system. These ongoing changes also explain why flu vaccines become less effective over time and need to be reformulated every year.</p><p>Hemagglutinin is a protein on the surface of the flu virus that helps the virus bind to and infect host cells. The surface proteins of most viruses are recognized by the immune system, and influenza hemagglutinin is no exception. However, hemagglutinin is unusual in that it evolves exceptionally rapidly to avoid being recognized by the immune system. This raises an important question: what is it about the influenza hemagglutinin protein that allows it to change so readily?</p><p>Thyagarajan and Bloom address this question by making mutant copies of the gene that encodes the hemagglutinin protein. There are over 10,000 ways in which the protein can be mutated, and Thyagarajan and Bloom managed to make the vast majority of the possible changes. The mutated genes were then re-introduced into the virus, and the mutant viruses were allowed to replicate in cells for several generations.</p><p>Thyagarajan and Bloom sequenced the viruses that had replicated—which meant that the mutant copies of the hemagglutinin protein in these viruses still worked—and looked to see where in the protein the changes had occurred. Those regions that rarely changed included the part of the protein that binds to host cells, whereas other regions—especially those that are recognized by the immune system—were much more likely to contain mutations. Thyagarajan and Bloom then went on to show that not all influenza proteins share hemaglutinin's capacity to change the regions targeted by the immune system, suggesting that this capacity is possibly a unique feature of this protein.</p><p>Thyagarajan and Bloom also suggest that this capacity to tolerate mutations in parts of proteins that are recognized by the immune system might be important for shaping a virus's ability to evolve to escape this recognition. Future work is now needed to see how tolerant to mutations other viral proteins are, and to reveal which properties of a protein determine its tolerance to mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03300.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03300.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic</kwd><kwd>evolvability</kwd><kwd>antigenic evolution</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep mutational scanning was used to comprehensively quantify the effects of mutations to influenza hemagglutinin and shows that the virus possesses a high inherent mutational tolerance at key antigenic sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemic influenza poses an annual threat to human health largely because the virus rapidly evolves to escape the immunity elicited by previous infections or vaccinations. The most potent form of anti-influenza immunity is antibodies targeting the virus’s hemagglutinin (HA) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). The virus evades these antibodies primarily by accumulating amino-acid substitutions in HA's antigenic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, HA undergoes this rapid evolution while retaining the ability to fold to a highly conserved structure that performs two functions essential for viral replication: receptor binding and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiley and Skehel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell et al., 2004</xref>). HA is therefore highly ‘antigenically evolvable’ in the sense that it can accommodate rapid antigenic change without compromising its structural and functional properties.</p><p>Two factors that undoubtedly contribute to HA's rapid antigenic evolution are influenza's high mutation rate and the strong selection that immunity exerts on the virus. However, it is unclear whether these factors are sufficient to fully explain HA's antigenic evolution. For instance, while some other error-prone viruses (such as HIV and hepatitis C) also exhibit rapid antigenic evolution of their surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2012</xref>), other viruses with comparable mutation rates (such as measles) show little propensity for antigenic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheshberadaran et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duffy et al., 2008</xref>), despite the fact that evasion of immunity would presumably confer a selective benefit. A variety of explanations ranging in scale from ecological to molecular can be posited to account for these differences in rates of antigenic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lipsitch and O’Hagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heaton et al., 2013</xref>). One hypothesis is that HA has a high inherent tolerance for mutations in its antigenic sites, thereby conferring on influenza the evolutionary capacity to escape from anti-HA antibodies with relative ease.</p><p>Testing this hypothesis requires quantifying the inherent mutational tolerance of each site in HA. This cannot be done simply by examining variability among naturally occurring viruses, since the evolution of influenza in nature is shaped by a combination of inherent mutational tolerance and external immune selection. For example, the rapid evolution of HA's antigenic sites in nature could reflect the fact that these sites are especially tolerant of mutations, or it could be purely a consequence of strong immune selection. Traditional experimental approaches using site-directed mutagenesis or serial viral passage are also inadequate to quantify inherent mutational tolerance—while such experimental techniques have been used to determine the effect of specific mutations on HA, they cannot feasibly be applied to all possible individual amino-acid mutations. Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heaton et al. (2013)</xref> used transposon mutagenesis to show that HA is tolerant to the random insertion of five to six amino-acid sequences at several locations in the protein. However, the relevance of this tolerance to insertional mutations is unclear, since HA's actual antigenic evolution involves almost entirely point substitutions, with only a very low rate of insertions and deletions.</p><p>Here we use the new high-throughput experimental technique of deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) to comprehensively quantify the tolerance of HA to amino-acid mutations. Specifically, we create mutant libraries of the HA gene from the H1N1 strain A/WSN/1933 (WSN) that contain virtually all of the ≈4 × 10<sup>4</sup> possible individual codon mutations, and therefore virtually all of the ≈10<sup>4</sup> possible amino-acid mutations. We use these mutant libraries to generate pools of mutant influenza viruses, which we estimate incorporate at least 85% of the possible HA codon mutations and 97% of the possible amino-acid mutations. We then passage these viruses to select for functional variants, and use Illumina deep sequencing to determine the frequency of each HA mutation before and after this selection for viral growth. Since these experiments measure the impact of mutations in the absence of immune selection, they enable us to quantify HA's inherent preference for each amino acid at each site in the protein. We show that these quantitative measurements are consistent with existing knowledge about HA structure and function, and can be used to create an evolutionary model that describes HA's natural evolution far better than existing models of sequence evolution. Finally, we use our results to show that HA's antigenic sites are disproportionately tolerant of mutations, suggesting that a high inherent tolerance for mutations at key positions targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza's antigenic evolvability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strategy for deep mutational scanning of HA</title><p>Our strategy for deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) of HA is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We wanted to assess the impact of all possible amino-acid mutations. Most mutagenesis techniques operate at the nucleotide level, and so frequently introduce single-nucleotide codon changes (e.g., GGA → cGA) but only very rarely introduce multi-nucleotide codon changes (e.g., GGA → cat). However, several PCR-based techniques have recently been developed to introduce random codon mutations into full-length genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Firnberg and Ostermeier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>).

Briefly, this process involves transfecting cells with the HA plasmid mutant library along with plasmids encoding the other seven genes from the WSN strain of influenza. Although the cells were transfected with a very large diversity of HA plasmids, we were uncertain what fraction of the genes encoded on these plasmids would actually be productively packaged into a virus. In an attempt to maximize the diversity in the viral pools, the mutant viruses were generated by transfecting several dozen wells of cells. The logic behind this scheme was to maintain substantial diversity even if only a subset of viral mutants stochastically predominated in each individual well of cells. A different replicate virus pool was generated for each of the three HA plasmid mutant libraries.</p><p>The mutant viruses generated for each replicate were passaged at a relatively low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to reduce the probability of co-infection, thereby creating a link between viral genotype and phenotype. This genotype-phenotype link is essential to ensure that the sequenced HA gene matches the protein on the surface of the virus. Our previous work with NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2014</xref>) indicates that one low MOI passage is sufficient to create a strong genotype-phenotype link, since that previous work found that the results obtained after one viral passage were extremely similar to the results obtained after two viral passages. In order to maintain a diversity of over two-million infectious viral particles, we performed the passaging in a total of 2.4 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Deep sequencing reveals purifying selection against many mutations</title><p>We used Illumina sequencing to quantify the frequencies of mutations before and after selection for viral growth.

For the <bold>DNA</bold> and <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples, the HA gene was amplified directly from the plasmids by PCR. For the <bold>virus</bold> and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples, the HA gene was first reverse-transcribed from viral RNA and was then amplified by PCR. In all cases, template quantification was performed prior to PCR to ensure that &gt;10<sup>6</sup> initial HA molecules were used as templates for subsequent amplification.</p><p>In order to reduce the sequencing error rate, the HA molecules were fragmented to roughly 50 nucleotide fragments using Illumina's transposon-based Nextera kit, and then sequenced with overlapping paired-end reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We only called codon identities for which both paired reads concur—this strategy substantially increases the sequencing fidelity, since it is rare for the same sequencing error to occur in both reads. For each sample, we obtained in excess of 10<sup>7</sup> overlapping paired-end reads that could be aligned to HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the read depth varied somewhat along the primary sequence, presumably due to known weak biases in the insertion sites for the Nextera transposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adey et al., 2010</xref>). However, these biases were fairly mild, and so we obtained well over 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> unique paired reads for nearly all HA codons.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the frequency of mutations in each sample as quantified by deep sequencing.

The <bold>virus</bold> samples created from the unmutated plasmid show only a slightly higher frequency of mutations, indicating that reverse-transcription and viral replication introduce only a small number of additional mutations. As expected, the <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples derived from the plasmid mutant libraries show a high rate of one-, two-, and three-nucleotide mutations, as all three types of mutations were introduced during the codon mutagenesis. The <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples derived from the mutant virus pools exhibit a mutation rate that is substantially lower than that of the <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples. Most of the reduction in mutation frequency in the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples is due to decreased frequencies of nonsynonymous and stop-codon mutations; synonymous mutations are only slightly depressed in frequency. As stop-codon and nonsynonymous mutations are much more likely than synonymous mutations to substantially impair viral fitness, these results are consistent with purifying selection purging deleterious mutations during viral growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03300.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The per-codon frequencies of mutations in the samples.</title><p>The samples are named as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with the experimental replicate indicated with the numeric label.

While there is a low but non-zero rate of errors (from sequencing, PCR, or reverse-transcription) that lead to single-nucleotide codon changes (as judged by the <bold>DNA</bold> and <bold>virus</bold> samples), errors that lead to multi-nucleotide codon changes are negligible because it is extremely rare for a single codon to experience two errors. We similarly expect that any <italic>do novo</italic> mutations or reversions that arise during viral growth should be limited to single-nucleotide changes given the short duration of viral passage in our experiments. The fact that our mutant libraries were constructed at the codon rather than the nucleotide level means that the vast majority (54 of 63) possible mutations to each codon involve multiple nucleotide changes, and so the sequencing results for these mutations can be analyzed essentially at face value, without having to worry about confounding errors. For the remaining (9 of 63) possible mutations that only involve a single-nucleotide codon change, we have attempted to statistically correct for the error rates estimated from our controls as described in the ‘Materials and methods’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Most mutations are sampled by the experiments</title><p>It is important to assess the completeness with which the experiments sampled all possible HA mutations.

The most straightforward way to assess these issues is to quantify the number of times that each possible multi-nucleotide codon mutation is observed in the <bold>mutDNA</bold> and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples.

Because many of the HAs in our libraries contain several mutations, these preferences do not simply correspond to the fitness effect of each individual mutation to the WSN HA—rather, they represent the average effect of each mutation in a collection of closely related HA mutants. Mutations to amino acids with high preferences are favored by selection, while mutations to amino acids with low preferences are disfavored. The amino-acid preferences are inferred from the deep sequencing data using a Bayesian statistical framework in which the observed counts are treated as draws from multinomial distributions with unknown parameters representing the initial mutagenesis rate, the various error rates, and selection as represented by the preferences (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the amino-acid preferences for the entire HA gene inferred from the combined data from all three biological replicates.

There is a very high correlation between the preferences inferred from these two repeats, indicating that technical variation has only a very minor influence on the final inferred amino-acid preferences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref> show the correlation among the three different biological replicates. Although the biological replicates are substantially correlated, there is also clear variation. Most of this variation is attributable to amino acids which in one replicate are inferred to have preferences near the a priori expectation of 0.05 (there are 20 amino acids, which in the absence of data are all initially assumed to have an equal preference of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), but in another replicate are inferred to have a much higher or lower preference. Such variation arises because the mutant viruses for each biological replicate only sample about 50% of the possible codon mutations (see previous section), meaning that there is little data for some mutations in any given replicate. Fortunately, combining the three biological replicates greatly increases the coverage of possible mutations (see previous section). Therefore, inferences made from the combined data (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) should be substantially more accurate than inferences from any of the individual replicates. This idea is supported by the results below, which quantify the extent to which the inferred preferences accurately describe natural HA evolution.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03300.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Correlations among the amino-acid preferences inferred using data from the individual biological replicates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The preferences from two technical repeats of the sample preparation and deep sequencing of biological replicate #1 are highly correlated.

In contrast, the evolution of HA in nature is shaped by a combination of HA's inherent mutational tolerance and external selection pressures. Specifically, the evolution of HA in humans is strongly driven by selection for mutations that alter antigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that such antigenic mutations fix at high frequency implies some degree of mutational tolerance at antigenic sites, since no mutations would fix if these sites were under absolute structural or functional constraint. However, it is not possible to tell from natural sequences alone whether antigenic sites are unusually mutationally tolerant compared to the rest of HA, or whether their rapid evolution is solely because they are under strong external immune selection.</p><p>To address this issue, we used the results of the deep mutational scanning to compare the inherent mutational tolerance of antigenic sites to the rest of the HA protein. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> mapped the antigenic sites of the H1 HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), which is closely related to the WSN HA used in our experiments. We therefore defined the ‘Caton et al. antigenic sites’ as the WSN residues homologous to those mapped by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> with the exclusion of a single site that has gained glycosylation in the WSN HA relative to the PR8 HA (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). One possible concern is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> mapped antigenic sites largely by selecting monoclonal-antibody escape mutants, and so these sites might be biased towards being more mutationally tolerant. We therefore also made a broader classification of ‘antigenic sites and contacting residues’ consisting of the Caton et al. antigenic sites <italic>plus</italic> all surface-exposed residues in contact with these sites (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). This broader classification includes all residues in regions of the HA surface targeted by antibodies, and so should not be biased by whether sites are amenable to the selection of monoclonal-antibody escape mutants. We hypothesized that both sets of antigenic sites would have unusually high mutational tolerance.</p><p>For comparison, we used two classifications of receptor-binding residues (‘Materials and methods’). The first classification consists of residues that have important roles in receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 1998</xref>) <italic>and</italic> are conserved in H1 HAs; these residues are mostly deep in the binding pocket. The second classification consists of all residues that contact the sialic-acid receptor in the crystal structure, regardless of their level of conservation. We hypothesized that the core set of conserved receptor-binding residues would have unusually low mutational tolerance, but that the set of all receptor-binding residues would have typical levels of mutational tolerance since influenza routinely escapes from antibodies that target the periphery of the receptor-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The positions of the Caton et al. antigenic sites and the conserved receptor-binding residues in the primary sequence are indicated by the top overlay bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Visual inspection suggests that the conserved receptor-binding residues are indeed relatively intolerant of mutations (have a strong preference for one specific amino acid), whereas the Caton et al. antigenic sites are relatively tolerant of mutations (have roughly equivalent preferences for many amino acids).</p><p>For a more quantitative analysis, we computed a site entropy from the inferred amino-acid preferences—larger site entropies indicate a higher inherent tolerance for mutations.

To correct for this fact, we computed the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) for all residues in the HA crystal structure.

This figure shows that sites with higher RSA are more mutationally tolerant as expected.

Is this antigenic evolvability an exceptional feature of HA, or is it commonly shared by other viral proteins? Ideally one would compare HA to the major surface antigens of other viruses with high (e.g., HIV) and low (e.g., measles) rates of antigenic evolution—but unfortunately comparable data sets for these other viruses are not yet available. Therefore, we instead compared the antigenic evolvability of HA to that of influenza nucleoprotein (NP), a protein for which we have recently performed a similar deep mutational scanning experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The adaptive immune system targets NP via cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valkenburg et al., 2011</xref>). Although the selection exerted by these CTLs is believed to be weaker than the antibody-mediated selection on HA’s antigenic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2011</xref>), influenza does benefit from mutations in NP that promote escape from CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkhoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valkenburg et al., 2013</xref>). However, whereas HA rapidly evolves to escape from antibodies, NP does not appear to have any special propensity for rapid evolution of the epitopes targeted by CTLs. Instead, mutations in NP's CTL epitopes are often deleterious and require secondary permissive or compensatory mutations to fix without a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkhoff et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gong et al., 2013</xref>).

In this delineation, less than a quarter of NP’s sites participate in multiple CTL epitopes. We used the results of our previous deep mutational scanning of NP to compare the inherent mutational tolerance of sites that participate in multiple CTL epitopes to all other sites in NP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>, the NP sites involved in multiple CTL epitopes have an inherent mutational tolerance that is indistinguishable from other sites in the protein. Therefore, NP does not possess any special inherent mutational tolerance in its CTL epitopes. This finding implies that a high level of antigenic evolvability is not a general feature of all viral proteins, but is instead at least somewhat unique to HA.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03300.023</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>The inherent mutational tolerance of NP's CTL epitopes is indistinguishable from that of non-epitope sites in NP.</title><p>The plot shows the site entropy vs relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of NP residues that participate in multiple CTL epitopes (red triangles) and all other NP residues in the crystal structure (blue circles).

The evolutionary patterns observed in natural sequences are shaped by a combination of inherent mutational tolerance and external pressures such as immune selection, and the analysis of such sequences is further confounded by the fact that influenza is not at evolutionary equilibrium.</p><p>Here we have quantified the inherent mutational tolerance of influenza HA by using deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) to simultaneously assess the impact on viral growth of the vast majority of the ≈10<sup>4</sup> possible amino-acid mutations to influenza HA. The information obtained from the deep mutational scanning is consistent with existing knowledge about the effects of mutations on HA function and structure. For instance, the deep mutational scanning shows strong selection for specific amino acids known to play important roles in HA's receptor-binding activity, fusion activity, and proteolytic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stech et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, at the sites of known temperature-sensitive mutations to HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakajima et al., 1986</xref>), the deep mutational scanning identifies the more stabilizing amino-acid as more favorable. Broader trends from the deep mutational scanning are also in agreement with current thinking about mutational effects. For example, the deep mutational scanning finds that there is strong purifying selection against stop-codon mutations and many nonsynonymous mutations, but that there is only weak selection against synonymous mutations. All of these results suggest that the deep mutational scanning faithfully captures both the specific and general effects of mutations on HA.</p><p>The comprehensive information generated by the deep mutational scanning can be used to create quantitative evolutionary models for analyzing HA sequence phylogenies. Here we have shown that an evolutionary model constructed from our deep mutational scanning data describes the evolution of human and swine H1 HAs far better than existing state-of-the-art models for sequence evolution. We anticipate that separating HA's inherent mutational tolerance from external selection should also eventually allow the external selection pressures to be studied in greater detail. For example, one might imagine that sites in HA that exhibit evolutionary patterns that deviate from the quantitative model created from our deep mutational scanning are likely to be under external selection. Future work that augments deep mutational scanning with specific experimentally defined selection pressures (such as antibodies against HA) could aid in further elucidation of the forces that shape influenza evolution. It also may be possible to utilize high-throughput experimental data on mutational effects to better estimate the fitness of naturally occurring strains in a way that aids in prediction of the year-to-year strain dynamics of influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Łuksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The deep mutational scanning also enabled us to assess the extent to which HA's inherent mutational tolerance contributes to influenza’s antigenic evolvability. It remains a mystery why error-prone RNA viruses differ so widely in their capacity for evolutionary escape from immunity, with some (e.g., influenza and HIV) undergoing rapid antigenic evolution while others (e.g., measles) show little antigenic change on relevant timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lipsitch and O’Hagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heaton et al., 2013</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the antigenic sites in HA are unusually tolerant to mutations, implying that inherent evolutionary plasticity at sites targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza's rapid antigenic evolution. This high mutational tolerance at antigenic sites could itself be a property that influenza has evolved to aid in its antigenic escape—or it might simply be an unfortunate coincidence that the immune system focuses on especially plastic portions of HA. In either case, it is intriguing to speculate whether a high inherent mutational tolerance in antigenic sites is also a feature of other antigenically variable RNA viruses. Application of the deep mutational scanning approach used here to additional viruses should provide a means to address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Availability of data and computer code</title><p>Illumina sequencing data are available at the SRA, accession SRP040983 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP040983">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP040983</ext-link>).

Briefly, all full-length H1 HAs from these hosts were downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2008</xref>).

No constraint is placed on whether or not these residues are conserved in natural sequences. The residues that fall into this classification are (in sequential numbering of the WSN HA): 108, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 158, 166, 168, 196, 198, 199, 203, 207, 238, 239, and 241.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al.

Specifically, these are any residues listed in the third table of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> with the following exceptions: residue 182 (H3 numbering) is not considered for the reason explained on page 421 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref>, residue 273 (H3 numbering) is not considered for the reason explained on page 422 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref>, and residue 129 (H3 numbering) is not considered because it has gained a glycosylation site in the WSN HA that is not present in the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) HA and mutation of this WSN glycosylation site can strongly affect viral growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deom et al., 1986</xref>). Overall, this gives the following set of antigenic residues, listed by sequential numbering of the WSN HA with the H3 number in parentheses: 171 (158), 173 (160), 175 (162), 176 (163), 178 (165), 179 (166), 180 (167), 169 (156), 172 (159), 205 (192), 206 (193), 209 (196), 211 (198), 182 (169), 186 (173), 220 (207), 253 (240), 153 (140), 156 (143), 158 (145), 237 (224), 238 (225), 87 (78), 88 (79), 90 (81), 91 (82), 92 (83), and 135 (122).</p><p>A second classification is done that includes the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al.

The rationale for this second classification is that the mapping by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al.

They also judge the set of experiments important and of high quality. Finally, they recognize the novelty of combining the experimental results with an evolutionary model. This combination demonstrates that the site-specific amino acid preferences inferred from the experiments describe HA evolution more parsimoniously than traditional codon substitution models.</p><p>The reviewers provide however a number of comments whose clarification and further discussion would strengthen the arguments made in the manuscript and its eventual impact. These comments primarily concern the uncertainty and assumptions over the identity of antigenic sites and the relevant RBS residues for control purposes. It was felt that both these assumptions could be made more explicit and examined further in the ways suggested below, together with other major points.</p><p>1) The conclusions from this study are dependent on knowing which HA residues are physically located in antigenic sites. The authors use the classic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. 1982</xref> study to classify which HA residues are located in antigenic sites. This is a reasonable approach because the WSN/1933 virus used in the current study is antigenically similar to the PR8/1934 used in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. 1982</xref> study. The Caton et al. experiments defined antigenic sites by selecting viral escape mutants in the presence of saturating amounts of individual monoclonal antibodies. Based on the Caton et al. experimental approach, viruses that possess mutations at HA residues that severely compromise viral fitness are never selected-essentially, Caton et al. defined the antigenic sites by isolating mutant viruses that were capable of growing. With this in mind, it is perhaps not surprising that these same HA residues are tolerant of mutations in the current study.</p><p>When the Caton et al. escape mutants are mapped onto the 1RVX structure, there are clusters of mutations that correspond to each antigenic site. Within each cluster, there are a few HA residues that appear to be in the cluster (thus likely in the antibody binding site) but these residues never appeared in the Caton et al. viral mutant escape experiments. It has been assumed that this is the case because either (a) there was a limited number of mutant viruses screened by Caton et al. or (b) that these residues within the antigenic site were detrimental to viral fitness.</p><p>The authors should consider making an HA structure analogous to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, with entropy color labeling for all surface residues. This type of analysis will demonstrate if tolerability is limited to those residues identified in selection assays (assays that only identify residues capable of tolerating mutations) or also found in adjacent residues that are likely located in antibody binding sites but were not identified in the original antigenic mapping studies. It might be helpful to show surface on the structure for this type of analyses.</p><p>Another partial solution is to examine antigenic sites previously defined by other means (such as epitopes defined by crystal structures).</p><p>This is not a critical flaw but should be considered either in the discussion or by completing additional analyses as described above.</p><p>2) It is not clear that the residues most essential for function must be the most conserved ones. We know that naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies can target the RBS (Whittle et al., PNAS, 2011). There is also variation in receptor type within hosts and between species.</p><p>The main text justifies using conserved RBS as a control because these sites are expected to be strongly conserved, and the RBS is defined to exclude non-conserved RBS-associated sites. One could also argue that high mutational tolerance in the RBS could be adaptive to facilitate escape in nearby epitopes;it would be really interesting if this were the case, with the control being some non-immunogenic area near the stalk. The simplest solution may be to show that the results are unchanged when the non-conserved RBS sites are included, assuming this is the case. If it is not, it would help to know which sites the conserved RBS correspond to on the HA structure. (One would hope they're deep-in-the-pocket).</p><p>3) The paper addresses the mutational tolerance and antigenic evolvability of HA. Relative to what? Are these metrics different for other influenza proteins? Other viral glycopropteins? A cursory analysis of the HA site preference data vs. NP site preference (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom 2014</xref>, bioRxiv, currently in review in MBE?) would further support this claim.</p><p>4) “Big data” mutagenesis scans must sacrifice something in their broad scope; for example, quantitative as opposed to binary fitness measurements, intragenic epistasis (e.g. interactions among substitutions within HA as will occur in this experimental set-up), pool drop out bottlenecks. The authors already address many of these. It would be good to acknowledge them as shortcomings or areas for follow up work, and to discuss the recent publication by Wu et al. of a similar scanning mutagenesis that does report fitness values (Wu et al., High throughput profiling of influenza A virus hemagglutinin gene at the single-nucleotide resolution, Scientific Reports 2013).</p><p>Unlike the paper by Wu et al., however, the present manuscript places the mutational data within an evolutionary framework, which is something generally missing in most such studies. This novelty of the current manuscript could be drawn out more. In addition, both this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref> present a snapshot of the (mostly) single-mutation neighbors from a single point (the sequence of WSN33 HA) in the fitness landscape. Both find that viable paths occur disproportionately at antigenic sites. The fact that these rules, when extrapolated over the phylogeny, greatly improve the fit implies that epistasis is in some ways less pervasive than we think and may not be such a huge obstacle to evolution. Most substitutions appear to be concentrated among a permissive network of sites.</p><p>5) The following aspects of the experiments should be clarified/discussed: (a) The possibility of reversion between the plasmid pool and the passaged virus is not accounted for. Granted the wild type control shows that there is low background mutation, but a weakly functional mutant could revert. (b) During transfection, one would expect that there may be viruses produced from cells expressing two different HA genes. How would such chimeric viruses confound the results in a single passage experiment? (c) Similarly to #2, wouldn't there also be viruses in which the HA on the surface has a given amino acid sequence, while the packaged genomic segments code for a different one? Multiple passages would ferret these out. (d) How were HA molecules sheared and why are there biases in sequence fragmentation? (e) Are more exposed HA residues generally more tolerant to mutations? The authors address this by correcting for relative solvent accessibility, but this description is difficult to follow. The importance of relevant solvent accessibility (RSA) is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, but the RSA result is not stated clearly in the main text.

These comments primarily concern the uncertainty and assumptions over the identity of antigenic sites and the relevant RBS residues for control purposes. It was felt that both these assumptions could be made more explicit and examined further in the ways suggested below, together with other major points</italic>.</p><p>Thank you to the editors and reviewers for their very careful review of our manuscript. The critiques were very helpful, and we believe that the revisions that we have made in response have substantially improved the manuscript. Specifically:</p><p>We have included a second expanded definition of antigenic sites to show that the essential finding that HA has high antigenic evolvability is robust to the method used to classify the antigenic sites (see Response 2 below).</p><p>We have clarified that not all receptor-binding site residues have low inherent mutational tolerance – this is only true of conserved residues deep in the pocket. We now include separate classifications for conserved and all receptor-binding residues (see Response 3 below).</p><p>The suggestion to include a comparison to other viral proteins is very helpful; as suggested by the reviewers, we now compare to NP to show that high antigenic evolvability is a property of HA but not NP (see Response 4 below).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have included a comparison to the results of the Wu <italic>et al.</italic> study that was published while our study was in review. This comparison shows that the results of the studies are correlated, but also explains why our study provides substantially more information, and also comments on issues related to these types of high-throughput studies (see Response 5 below).</p><p><italic>1) The conclusions from this study are dependent on knowing which HA residues are physically located in antigenic sites. The authors use the classic</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><italic>Caton et al. 1982</italic></xref> <italic>study to classify which HA residues are located in antigenic sites. This is a reasonable approach because the WSN/1933 virus used in the current study is antigenically similar to the PR8/1934 used in the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><italic>Caton et al. 1982</italic></xref> <italic>study. The Caton et al. experiments defined antigenic sites by selecting viral escape mutants in the presence of saturating amounts of individual monoclonal antibodies. Based on the Caton et al. experimental approach, viruses that possess mutations at HA residues that severely compromise viral fitness are never selected-essentially, Caton et al. defined the antigenic sites by isolating mutant viruses that were capable of growing. With this in mind, it is perhaps not surprising that these same HA residues are tolerant of mutations in the current study</italic>.</p><p><italic>When the Caton et al. escape mutants are mapped onto the 1RVX structure, there are clusters of mutations that correspond to each antigenic site. Within each cluster, there are a few HA residues that appear to be in the cluster (thus likely in the antibody binding site) but these residues never appeared in the Caton et al. viral mutant escape experiments. It has been assumed that this is the case because either (a) there was a limited number of mutant viruses screened by Caton et al. or (b) that these residues within the antigenic site were detrimental to viral fitness</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors should consider making an HA structure analogous to the one shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>, with entropy color labeling for all surface residues. This type of analysis will demonstrate if tolerability is limited to those residues identified in selection assays (assays that only identify residues capable of tolerating mutations) or also found in adjacent residues that are likely located in antibody binding sites but were not identified in the original antigenic mapping studies. It might be helpful to show surface on the structure for this type of analyses</italic>.</p><p><italic>Another partial solution is to examine antigenic sites previously defined by other means (such as epitopes defined by crystal structures)</italic>.</p><p><italic>This is not a critical flaw but should be considered either in the discussion or by completing additional analyses as described above</italic>.</p><p>This is a very astute comment. Essentially, the reviewers are noting that Caton <italic>et al.</italic> defined the antigenic sites largely by mapping monoclonal-antibody escape mutants. The Caton <italic>et al.</italic> study therefore may have had a bias towards mapping sites that were tolerant to mutations, potentially confounding our interpretation.</p><p>To address this concern, we have added a second expanded classification of antigenic sites which includes the specific antigenic sites mapped by Caton <italic>et al.</italic> plus all surface-exposed residues that are in contact with these antigenic sites. This second classification should alleviate the concern about any bias in the Caton <italic>et al.</italic> mapping, because even if only some residues in a cluster had mutations selected by Caton <italic>et al.</italic>, our expanded structural classification will also include all other residues in the same physical cluster.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now perform the analysis for both the original Caton <italic>et al.</italic> classification and this second expanded classification. The results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>. These results show that the antigenic sites have significantly higher inherent mutational tolerance regardless of whether we use the original Caton <italic>et al.</italic> classification or the new expanded structural classification.</p><p>In addition, we have followed the reviewers’ recommendation and included an entropy-colored surface-rendered structure of HA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> as well as individual structures showing just the antigenic sites. This new image is panel A of the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. We think this image visually supports the statistical analyses showing that the expanded classification of antigenic sites has higher inherent mutational tolerance.</p><p>Finally, we have substantially revised the text in the section entitled “The inherent evolvability of antigenic sites on HA” to explain the point made by this reviewer comment and how we have addressed it. We refer the reviewers to the revised manuscript for the full text, but here is the most relevant portion:</p><p>One possible concern is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> mapped antigenic sites largely by selecting monoclonal-antibody escape mutants, and so these sites might be biased towards being more mutationally tolerant. We therefore also made a broader classification of ‘antigenic sites and contacting residues’ consisting of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> antigenic sites plus all surface-exposed residues in contact with these sites (see Methods for details). This broader classification includes all residues in regions of the HA surface targeted by antibodies, and so should not be biased by whether sites are amenable to the selection of monoclonal-antibody escape mutants. We hypothesized that both sets of anti-genic sites would have unusually high mutational tolerance.</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear that the residues most essential for function must be the most conserved ones. We know that naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies can target the RBS (Whittle et al.,</italic> <italic>PNAS, 2011</italic><italic>). There is also variation in receptor type within hosts and between species</italic>.</p><p><italic>The main text justifies using conserved RBS as a control because these sites are expected to be strongly conserved, and the RBS is defined to exclude non-conserved RBS-associated sites. One could also argue that high mutational tolerance in the RBS could be adaptive to facilitate escape in nearby epitopes; it would be really interesting if this were the case, with the control being some non-immunogenic area near the stalk. The simplest solution may be to show that the results are unchanged when the non-conserved RBS sites are included, assuming this is the case. If it is not, it would help to know which sites the conserved RBS correspond to on the HA structure. (One would hope they're deep-in-the-pocket)</italic>.</p><p>This is another very astute comment. In the original version, we chose conserved receptor-binding residues as a control group for the antigenic sites because we wanted residues that we expected to be under strong constraint. However, as the reviewers point out, this could give the incorrect impression that all receptor-binding residues are highly con-served. In fact, a handful of “deep in the pocket” residues are highly conserved, but many other residues on the periphery of the receptor binding pocket are relatively amenable to change.</p><p>To address this comment, we now define two groups of receptor binding residues: the conserved ones (mostly deep in the pocket) and the set of all residues that contact the receptor. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> we analyze both of these groups separately, and discuss the results in the revised section “The inherent evolvability of antigenic sites on HA.” We refer the reviewers to the revised section and figure/table for full details, here we summarize the main findings by quoting from the most relevant portions of the revised section:</p><p>“For comparison to the antigenic sites, we used two classifications of receptor-binding residues (see Methods). The first classification consists of residues that have important roles in receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al, 1998</xref>) and are conserved in H1 HAs; these residues are mostly deep in the binding pocket. The second classification consists of all residues that contact the sialic-acid receptor in the crystal structure, regardless of their level of conservation. We hypothesized that the core set of conserved receptor-binding residues would have unusually low mutational tolerance, but that the set of all receptor-binding residues would have typical levels of mutational tolerance since influenza routinely escapes from antibodies that target the periphery of the receptor-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koel et al, 2013</xref>)...”</p><p>We then describe results that validate this hypothesis, and conclude:</p><p>“These results also show that while a core group of conserved residues deep in the receptor-binding pocket have unusually low mutational tolerance, the bulk of residues that contact the receptor are not under exceptional constraint. This fact probably explains why HA is able to escape from antibodies targeting the periphery of the receptor-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koel et al, 2013</xref>), and why only rare antibodies that penetrate deep into this pocket are broadly neutralizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Whittle et al, 2011</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) The paper addresses the mutational tolerance and antigenic evolvability of HA. Relative to what? Are these metrics different for other influenza proteins? Other viral glycopropteins? A cursory analysis of the HA site preference data vs. NP site preference (in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Bloom 2014</italic></xref><italic>, bioRxiv, currently in review in MBE?) would further support this claim</italic>.</p><p>This was an extremely helpful suggestion, and we believe that the changes that we have made in response have substantially strengthened the manuscript. Specifically, we now compare our results for HA to our previous results for influenza NP (which are now published in Molecular Biology and Evolution) in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>. We also include a new section in the Results (“HA’s antigenic evolvability is not shared by all influenza proteins”).</p><p><italic>4) “Big data” mutagenesis scans must sacrifice something in their broad scope; for example, quantitative as opposed to binary fitness measurements, intragenic epistasis (e.g. interactions among substitutions within HA as will occur in this experimental set-up), pool drop out bottlenecks. The authors already address many of these. It would be good to acknowledge them as shortcomings or areas for follow up work, and to discuss the recent publication by Wu et al. of a similar scanning mutagenesis that does report fitness values (Wu et al., High throughput profiling of influenza A virus hemagglutinin gene at the single-nucleotide resolution,</italic> <italic>Scientific Reports 2013</italic><italic>)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Unlike the paper by Wu et al., however, the present manuscript places the mutational data within an evolutionary framework, which is something generally missing in most such studies. This novelty of the current manuscript could be drawn out more. In addition, both this paper and</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58"><italic>Wu et al. (2014)</italic></xref> <italic>present a snapshot of the (mostly) single-mutation neighbors from a single point (the sequence of WSN33 HA) in the fitness landscape. Both find that viable paths occur disproportionately at antigenic sites. The fact that these rules, when extrapolated over the phylogeny, greatly improve the fit implies that epistasis is in some ways less pervasive than we think and may not be such a huge obstacle to evolution. Most substitutions appear to be concentrated among a permissive network of sites</italic>.</p><p>These are all very good comments. We have tried to be as transparent as possible about the shortcomings as well as the strengths of the high-throughput approach that we have used. For instance, we dedicate an entire figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to transparently showing the correlations between our replicates, and honestly discuss how this figure shows that although the experiment is definitely extracting reproducibly meaningful information, it is also subject to a large amount of noise as judged by the variation among replicates. We discuss how bottlenecks and other experimental problems could contribute to this.</p><p>As the reviewers point out, while our manuscript was under review, Wu <italic>et al.</italic> reported a somewhat similar high-throughput study of influenza HA. The study by Wu <italic>et al.</italic> is clearly very valuable. However, we believe that our study contains some advantages: for instance, we survey all amino-acid mutations while Wu <italic>et al.</italic> survey only about 20% of them, we provide full raw data for experimental replicates and controls for possible sources of error while Wu <italic>et al.</italic> do not, and we perform substantially more quantitative analyses of our data including in connection to natural evolution.</p><p>To help address the points that the reviewers have made, we now include a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and a new section in the Results that compares our study with that of Wu <italic>et al</italic>. We also use this new section to highlight some of the limitations of “big data” studies that the reviewers noted in their comments. Below we quote the full text of this new section, and put in bold the parts that specifically address the limitations noted by the reviewers.</p><p>As our paper was under review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref> published the results of using a similar strategy to examine the effects of mutations to the WSN HA. In their study, the HA gene was mutated at the nucleotide level, so their experiments surveyed only amino-acid mutations accessible by single-nucleotide codon changes. As a result, they provide data on the effects of only about 20% of the 19 564 = 10716 amino-acid mutations examined in our study. Despite this limitation, their study provides a large dataset of mutational effects to which we can compare our results.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> compares the mutational effects determined in our study to those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref>. There is a highly significant correlation between the results of the two studies; but the inferred mutational effects are certainly not identical. Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref> do not provide the data for replicates of their experiment, we are unable to assess whether the variability between the two different studies exceeds the variability between experimental replicates within each study. So one can imagine both biologically interesting and uninteresting explanations for the imperfect correlation between the results of the two studies. The interesting explanation is that differences in experimental methodology could lead to different selection pressures on specific mutations: for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref> use A549 cells while we use MDCK-SIAT1 cells, and perhaps the impact of certain mutations is dependent on the cell line. The uninteresting explanation is that the imperfect correlation is simply due to noise in the experimental measurements. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two explanations. This difficulty in pinpointing reasons for inter-study variation highlights a limitation of the high-throughput experimental methodology employed by ourselves and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al. (2014)</xref>: while such experiments provide a wealth of data, numerous factors can create noise in these data (sequencing errors, population bottlenecks, epistasis among mutations, etc.). Realizing the full potential of such studies will therefore require extensive experimental controls and biological replicates to quantify errors and noise to enable comparisons across data sets.</p><p>Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows that there is a highly significant correlation between the results of these two high-throughput studies, despite differences in experimental methodology and unquantified sources of experimental noise. This fact suggests that both studies capture fundamental constraints on HA’s mutational tolerance. In the remaining sections, we apply the more comprehensive data generated by our study to address questions about HA’s natural evolution and antigenic evolvability.</p><p>However, beyond the text quoted above and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we are unable to analyze the data of Wu et al. to with respect to the other questions about inherent mutational tolerance and viral evolution that we address in our manuscript. The reason is that Wu et al. only measure the fitness effects of an average of 4 of the possible 19 amino-acid mutations at each site, and this incomplete information is not sufficient to either assess inherent mutational tolerance or construct phylogenetic evolutionary models.</p><p><italic>5) The following aspects of the experiments should be clarified/discussed: (a) The possibility of reversion between the plasmid pool and the passaged virus is not accounted for. Granted the wild type control shows that there is low background mutation, but a weakly functional mutant could revert. (b) During transfection, one would expect that there may be viruses produced from cells expressing two different HA genes. How would such chimeric viruses confound the results in a single passage experiment? (c) Similarly to #2, wouldn't there also be viruses in which the HA on the surface has a given amino acid sequence, while the packaged genomic segments code for a different one? Multiple passages would ferret these out. (d) How were HA molecules sheared and why are there biases in sequence fragmentation? (e) Are more exposed HA residues generally more tolerant to mutations? The authors address this by correcting for relative solvent accessibility, but this description is difficult to follow. The importance of relevant solvent accessibility (RSA) is shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>, but the RSA result is not stated clearly in the main text. Can the authors simplify or clarify this part</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers ask in point (a) above about the possibility of reversions. We suspect that reversions are very rare, since the virus is only passaged once which should give a relatively small opportunity for such mutations to arise. But we acknowledge that none of our controls directly measure the rate of reversions. Our sequencing of the wildtype virus shows that mutations overall are rare, but it is possible that reversions are more common. However, a key advantage of our approach is that reversions would only affect a small fraction of our mutations – because we introduce mutations at the codon level, most (54 of 63) of the possible mutations involve multiple nucleotide changes. We deem it extremely unlikely that a single codon would revert two nucleotides during a single viral passage. To address this issue, we have revised the text.</p><p>The reviewers ask in points (b) and (c) above about chimeric viruses that express multiple HA proteins, and about viruses that lack a genotype-to-phenotype link because they possess different HA genes and proteins. We agree that this is a potential concern – however, the problem should be fixed during the low multiplicity of infection (MOI) passaging of the virus. In the current manuscript, we only perform one such passage – so the reviewers ask if it might not be desirable to also perform multiple passages to make sure the genotype-phenotype link is strong. This is a great suggestion, but in fact, in our previous work with NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2014</xref>) we did just that. Specifically, in that work, we sequenced NP after both one and two passages, and found that the results after just one passage were essentially indistinguishable from the results after two passages (see the fifth figure of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/12/molbev.msu173">http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/12/molbev.msu173</ext-link>). One reason that a single low-MOI passage is su?cient may be that there is probably substantial selection that also occurs during viral rescue in co-cultures prior to the first low-MOI passage. In any case, based on our previous NP work, we judge that one low-MOI passage is sufficient to ensure a strong genotype-phenotype link for influenza genes, and so for this reason we only performed one low-MOI passage in the current work (there are good reasons for wanting to keep the number of passages as low as possible, primarily to avoid problems like the reversion one mentioned in the reviewers’ previous comment).</p><p>To clarify this point, we have revised the manuscript (section starting “The mutant viruses generated for each replicate were passaged at a relatively low multiplicity of infection”).</p><p>The reviewers ask in point (d) how the HA molecules were fragmented. The fragmentation was done using the Illumina Nextera kit, which is widely used in the preparation of Illumina sequencing libraries. The fragmentation bias almost certainly arises due to weak sequence preferences of the transposon that mediates the fragmentation in the Nextera kit. It is known that this transposon has weak biases for certain sequences; for instance, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/12/r119">http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/12/r119</ext-link>. However, as should be clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> these biases are fairly mild, and lead to at most a five-fold variation in coverage at different sites.</p><p>To clarify this issue, we have revised the manuscript (section starting “In order to reduce the sequencing error rate”).</p><p>The reviewers ask in point (e) whether residues with higher relative solvent accessibility (RSA) are generally more tolerant to mutations. The answer is yes as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, but as the reviewers point out this result was not clearly stated in the main text. We have revised the text to make this point more clearly.</p><p><italic>6) The conclusions would be further strengthened if there was some way to ’predict‘ retrospectively where HA would go next based on the model. It would be interesting to discuss this possibility along the lines of what Luksza and Lassig published in Nature this year (Nature 507:57-61)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers ask if it might be possible to predict the evolution of influenza using data from our deep mutational scanning. In particular, they mention the work of Luksza and Lassig (2014), who develop a fitness model that enables improved forecasting about which of a variety of closely related existing strains of epidemic influenza are likely to predominate in future years. We do see some ways in which our data might synergize with their approach. For instance, a key component of their model (see Equation 2 of their paper) is assigning a “mutational load” to non-antigenic mutations. One could imagine that deep mutational scanning might enable more accurate assignment of the “mutational load” caused by specific mutations, although it remains unproven whether this would actually work.</p><p>For now, we mention this possibility with the following sentence in the Discussion:</p><p>“It also may be possible to utilize high-throughput experimental data on mutational effects to better estimate the fitness of naturally occurring strains in a way that aids in prediction of the year-to-year strain dynamics of influenza (Luksza and Lassig, 2014).”</p><p>We have also provided links in the manuscript to our complete raw data and source code as well as detailed documentation of our computational analysis pipeline. We hope that this transparent availability of all our raw data will help facilitate the work of others who wish to develop approaches for viral forecasting. However, we are currently unable to offer any sort of effective predictive model ourselves, and believe that prediction of viral evolution remains a daunting problem.</p></body></sub-article></article>
