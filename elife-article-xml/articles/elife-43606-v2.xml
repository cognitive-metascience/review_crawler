accelerated when species experience strong reductions in population size. Adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation in populations, or balancing selection, might counteract this process. To understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity, we document genomic variability after two parallel species-wide bottlenecks in the genus <italic>Capsella</italic>. We find that ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci, and that the same collection of alleles has been maintained in different lineages that have been separated for several million years. By reconstructing the evolution of the disease-related locus <italic>MLO2b</italic>, we find that divergence between ancient haplotypes can be obscured by referenced based re-sequencing methods, and that trans-specific alleles can encode substantially diverged protein sequences. Our data point to long-term balancing selection as an important factor shaping the genetics of immune systems in plants and as the predominant driver of genomic variability after a population bottleneck.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43606.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Capsella rubella</italic> is a small plant that is found in southern and western Europe. This plant is young in evolutionary terms: it is thought to have emerged less than 200,000 years ago from a small group of plants belonging to an older species known as <italic>Capsella grandiflora</italic>.</p><p>Individuals of the same species may carry alternative versions of the same genes – known as alleles – and the total number of alleles present in a population is referred to as genetic diversity. When a few individuals form a new species, the gene pool and the genetic diversity in the new species is initially much lower than in the ancestral species, which may make the new species less robust to fluctuations in the environment. For example, alternative versions of a gene might be preferable in hot or cold climates, and loss of one of these versions would limit the species’ ability to survive in both climates.</p><p>A mechanism known as balancing selection can maintain various alleles in a species, even if the population is very small. However, it was not clear how common long-lasting balancing selection was after a species had split. To address this question, Koenig et al. assembled collections of wild <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> plants and sequenced their genomes in search of alleles that were shared between individuals of the two species.</p><p>The analysis found not just a few, but thousands of examples where the same genetic differences had been maintained in both <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>. Some of these allele pairs were also shared with individuals of a third species of <italic>Capsella</italic> that had split from <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> over a million years ago. The shared alleles did not occur randomly in the genome; genes involved in immune responses were far more likely to be targets of balancing selection than other types of genes.</p><p>These findings indicate that there is strong balancing selection to maintain different alleles of immunity genes in wild populations of plants, and that some of this diversity can be maintained over hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. The strategy developed by Koenig et al. may help to identify new versions of immunity genes from wild relatives of crop plants that could be used to combat crop diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>balancing selection</kwd><kwd>selfing</kwd><kwd>bottleneck</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>disease resistance</kwd><kwd>NB-LRR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IMMUNEMESIS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000783/2010-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koenig</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 2897/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retention of genetic diversity at immune-related loci drives the pattern of genetic variation in selfing <italic>Capsella</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Balancing selection describes the suite of adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation for longer than expected by random chance. It can have many causes, including heterozygous advantage, negative frequency-dependent selection, and environmental heterogeneity in space and time. The unifying characteristic of these situations is that the turnover of alleles is slowed, resulting in increased diversity at linked sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charlesworth, 2006</xref>). In principle, it should be simple to detect the resulting footprints of increased coalescence times surrounding balanced sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tellier et al., 2014</xref>), and many candidates have been identified using diverse methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>). However, balanced alleles will be stochastically lost over long time spans, suggesting that most balanced polymorphism is short lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The strongest evidence for balancing selection comes from systems in which alleles are maintained in lineages that are reproductively isolated and that have separated millions of years ago, resulting in trans-specific alleles with diagnostic trans-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (tsSNPs). A few, well known genes fit this paradigm: the self-incompatibility loci of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vekemans and Slatkin, 1994</xref>), mating-type loci of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 1998</xref>), and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and ABO blood group loci in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McConnell et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mayer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lawlor et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Watkins et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ségurel et al., 2012</xref>). Additional candidates have been proposed by comparing genome sequences from populations of humans and chimpanzees, and from populations of multiple <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species. These efforts have revealed six loci in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leffler et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>) and up to 129 loci, that were identified by at least two shared SNPs each, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Novikova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bechsgaard et al., 2017</xref>), as potential targets of long-term balancing selection and/or introgression. In both systems, genes involved in host–pathogen interactions were enriched, which in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is consistent with previous findings that several disease resistance loci appear to be under balancing selection in this species, based on the analysis of individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huard-Chauveau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botella, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caicedo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stahl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rose et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Todesco et al., 2010</xref>). However, even with the ability to conduct whole-genome scans for balancing selection in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the total number of examples with robust evidence across species remains small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>).</p><p>One explanation for this paucity of evidence for pervasive and stable balancing selection is that cases of long-term maintenance of alleles are rare. However, there are good reasons to believe that many studies lacked the power to detect the expected effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DeGiorgio et al., 2014</xref>). If one requires that alleles have been maintained in species separated by millions of years, then only targets of outstandingly strong selective pressures that remain the same over many millennia can be identified. Furthermore, recombination between deeply coalescing alleles will typically reduce the size of the genomic footprint to very short sequence stretches, thus limiting the opportunity for distinguishing old alleles from recurrent mutations.</p><p>We hypothesised that self-fertilizing species provide increased sensitivity to detect balancing selection based on two observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiuf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wright et al., 2008</xref>). First, self fertilisation greatly reduces the effective rate of recombination, thus potentially expanding the footprint of balancing selection. In addition, the transition to self fertilisation is generally associated with dramatic genome-wide reductions in polymorphism, potentially making it easier to detect outlier loci that retain variation from the outcrossing, more polymorphic ancestor. In this study we sought to assess how strongly selection acts to maintain genetic diversity in the context of repeated transitions to self fertilisation in the flowering plant genus <italic>Capsella</italic>. Like many plant lineages, the ancestral state of <italic>Capsella</italic> is outcrossing (found in the extant diploid species <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>), but selfing has evolved independently in two diploid species, <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. orientalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2018</xref>). The genomes of both species exhibit the drastic loss of genetic diversity typical for many selfers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">St Onge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Slotte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandvain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Slotte et al., 2012</xref>). In the younger species, <italic>C. rubella</italic>, loss of genetic diversity was initially thought to have occurred uniformly throughout the entire genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2009</xref>), but subsequent reports already hinted at some loci having increased diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandvain et al., 2013</xref>), motivating the present study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43606.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polymorphism discovery in <italic>Capsella</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the relationships between <italic>Capsella</italic> species.

Previous studies had hinted at unequal retention of <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> alleles across the <italic>C. rubella</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandvain et al., 2013</xref>), leading us to analyse this phenomenon systematically by comparing the genomes of 50 <italic>C. rubella</italic> and 13 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> accessions from throughout each species’ range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Because the calling of trans-specific SNPs (tsSNPs) is particularly sensitive to mismapping errors in repetitive sequences, we applied a set of stringent filters, resulting in 74% of the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference genome remaining accessible to base calling in both species, with almost half (47%) of the masked sites in the repeat rich pericentromeric regions. After filtering, there were 5,784,607 SNPs and 883,837 indels. Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent analyses were performed using SNPs. Of these, only 27,852 were fixed between the two species, whereas 824,540 were found in both species (ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs), consistent with the expected sharing of variation between the two species. In addition, 4,291,959 SNPs segregated only in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (species-specific SNPs; ss<sub>Cg</sub>SNPs), and 640,256 only in <italic>C. rubella</italic> (ss<sub>Cr</sub>SNPs). Sample rarefaction by subsampling our sequenced accessions indicated that common ss<sub>Cr</sub>SNP and ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNP discovery was near saturation in our experiment, though additional sampling will continue to uncover rare alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of selfing are easily seen as a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity in <italic>C. rubella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), consistent with the previously suggested genetic bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). As expected from a predominantly selfing species, SNPs segregating in <italic>C. rubella</italic> were much less likely to be heterozygous than those segregating in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, though evidence for occasional outcrossing in <italic>C. rubella</italic> is observed in the form of a variable number of heterozygous calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Selfing is also expected to reduce the effective rate of recombination between segregating polymorphisms.

A study of genetic variation in bottlenecked populations of the Catalina fox found this exact pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, there may be selective maintenance of diversity in specific regions of the genome due to balanced polymorphisms, with contrasting activities of the different alleles. To explore this latter possibility, we tested whether the likelihood of allele sharing was dependent on annotated function of the affected genes. We found that ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs were strongly biased towards genes involved in plant biotic interactions, including defense and immune responses, and also toward pollen-pistil interactions, though less strongly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Of particular concern is that sequencing reads derived from paralogs not found in the reference, but present in some accessions, could be mismapped against the reference, leading to false positive ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs calls. We therefore examined whether ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs showed more evidence of such errors than other SNPs. Mismapping should increase coverage and reduce concordance (the fraction of reads supporting a particular call) at a site. That the distributions of these two metrics were nearly identical at ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs and ssSNP sites indicates, however, that mismapping is unlikely to have affected our SNP calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mismapping is also expected to cause pseudo-heterozygous calls, due to reads from different positions in the focal genome being mapped to the same target in the reference genome. However, ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs were not more likely to be found in the heterozygous state as compared to ssSNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we asked whether the signal of increased ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs density extended into sequences adjacent to NLRs and is detectable even when masking the NLR clusters themselves. For this purpose, we collapsed NLR genes within 10 kb of one another into a single region, and calculated ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs rates and genetic diversity as a function of distance from these collapsed regions, ignoring SNPs within the focal cluster. We found that elevated ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs sharing and genetic diversity extended over 100 kb from NLR genes. Thus, increased sharing is not an artefact of the internal structure of NLR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).</p><p>Increased retention of genetic diversity near immunity loci suggests that these genes might be the targets of balancing selection in either <italic>C. rubella</italic>, <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, or both species. However, neutral processes including random introgression and stochastic allele fixation can give rise to uneven distributions of genetic variation across the genome after genetic bottlenecks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). We sought to identify regions that showed a pattern of allele sharing that was unlikely to have occured neutrally, as indicated by low values of the fixation index F<sub>st</sub>, which quantifies genetic differentiation between populations. We compared the observed values of F<sub>st</sub> between <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> to a distribution calculated from simulated sequences under our previously inferred neutral demographic model, which included gene flow between <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>. We simulated one million 20 kb DNA segments, or just over 7,000 <italic>C. rubella</italic> genome equivalents, under the neutral model and calculated the expected distribution of F<sub>st</sub> values. Using this distribution, we assigned the probability of observing the F<sub>st</sub> value for each non-overlapping 20 kb window throughout the genome. After Bonferroni correction and joining of adjacent significant segments, we identified 21 genomic regions that we designated as candidate targets of balancing selection (<italic>Bal</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). <italic>Bal</italic> regions showed several classical indications of balancing selection including substantially higher Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> and within-<italic>C. Rubella</italic> genetic diversity relative to the remainder of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>; p&lt;&lt;0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test for both statistics). ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs in <italic>Bal</italic> regions were also less likely to have been lost during colonisation of Western Europe than ss<sub>Cr</sub>SNPs or ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs in other parts of the genome, and allele frequencies in <italic>Bal</italic> regions showed elevated correlation across populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Like tsSNPs in general, <italic>Bal</italic> regions did not show evidence for increased heterozygosity that might indicate increased error rates in SNP calling (Median Observed - Expected Heterozygosity in 20 kb windows was −0.021 inside of <italic>Bal</italic> regions, and −0.020 outside of these regions).</p><p>Estimates of F<sub>st</sub> were reduced in large segments surrounding NLR and other immune gene candidate clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), consistent with allele sharing being the result of linkage to a nearby balanced polymorphism. Of the 21 candidate regions, nine overlapped with clusters of NLR genes, and five with clusters of RLK/RLP or CRK genes, two classes of genes with broad roles in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zipfel, 2008</xref>). Many of the specific regions we identified in <italic>Capsella</italic> have been directly demonstrated to function in disease resistance in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McDowell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McDowell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goritschnig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holub, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gassmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>RPP1</italic> and <italic>RPP8</italic> have been previously suggested as candidate targets of balancing selection, and trans-specific polymorphism has been reported at the <italic>RPP8</italic> locus in the genus <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). It should be noted, however, that these genes are often members of larger linked NLR gene superclusters, with some of the regions our approach identified being sizeable and thus making it difficult to pinpoint a single focal gene. Indeed the strong signal found in these regions could result from multiple linked balanced sites. Furthermore, the strongest signals of balancing selection are mostly derived from linked sites, rather than the clusters themselves, because confident SNP calling is very difficult, if not impossible, with short reads in the most complex genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>It is formally possible that the unusual pattern of diversity that we observe near <italic>Bal</italic> loci could result from historical balancing selection in the outcrossing ancestor <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> rather than ongoing selection in the selfing <italic>C. rubella</italic>. Population genetic indices such as F<sub>st</sub>, nucleotide diversity pi, Tajima’s D, and allele sharing are not fully independent, and elevated diversity in the <italic>C. rubella</italic> founding population, driven by historical balancing selection, could also generate the observed patterns. Genetic diversity was only modestly elevated in these regions in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (p&lt;&lt;0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and Tajima’s <italic>D</italic> was not significantly different from other windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that this is not very likely. If balancing selection is acting at these loci in the outcrosser, it is clear that its genomic footprint is small, perhaps due to the rapid decay of LD in this species relative to the selfing <italic>C. rubella</italic>. Still, it is possible that even a small elevation of genetic diversity in <italic>Bal</italic> regions in the founding populations might have considerable impact on subsequent <italic>C. rubella</italic> diversity. We approximated this situation using our simulated genetic data. We subsetted simulations by the level of genetic diversity in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, choosing the top 1% of simulated values. Even in the case of elevated founder diversity in these data, the observed F<sub>st</sub> values in <italic>Bal</italic> regions remain exceptionally unlikely (p&lt;0.0001). These observations point to ongoing balancing selection within <italic>C. rubella</italic> maintaining diversity in <italic>Bal</italic> regions.</p><p>Adaptive retention of <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> diversity in <italic>Bal</italic> regions could be explained by two non-exclusive models. Allelic variation might have been present in the <italic>C. rubella</italic> founding population and maintained by balancing selection until the present. Alternatively, beneficial alleles may have been introgressed from <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> after the evolution of selfing, and retained by balancing selection. We searched for evidence of recent ancestry between the two species in <italic>Bal</italic> regions. A larger fraction of <italic>Bal</italic> region sequence was found to be IBD when compared to the genome-wide average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with elevated retention of introgressed alleles in these regions. Shared segments in <italic>Bal</italic> regions were on average shorter than those found in other parts of the genome, suggesting that they are older and have been subjected to longer periods of recombination since the introgression event (median within 3,503 bp, median outside 6,661 bp, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, p=1e-54), although we cannot exclude the influence of differing patterns of recombination in these regions as a contributing factor to this observation.</p><p>Elevated IBD rates in <italic>Bal</italic> regions might result from gene flow between the species in either direction, and our previous results suggested that most modern gene flow occurs through introgression of <italic>C. rubella</italic> alleles into <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>. We explored the geographic pattern of IBD between <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> in <italic>Bal</italic> regions to determine whether it differs from that of the genome-wide pattern. Within the East population, IBD decayed as a function of distance from the <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> range in a manner comparable to the observed genome-wide pattern, albeit with a more shallow slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to the genome-wide pattern, high levels of IBD were observed between <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and West population accessions. Thus, we find evidence for neutral gene flow throughout the genome, perhaps dominated by <italic>C. rubella</italic> to <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> introgression, as indicated by our demographic simulations. However, allele sharing appears to be older in <italic>Bal</italic> regions and introgressed alleles have been retained for longer periods even after colonisation of Western Europe. This latter observation is consistent with the hypothesis that alleles were introgressed prior to the most recent range expansions in <italic>C. rubella</italic>, and that variation was subsequently maintained by selection in <italic>Bal</italic> regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Balancing selection over millions of years</title><p>Although evidence for balancing selection at immunity-related loci in <italic>C. rubella</italic> is much stronger than in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, it is difficult to completely exclude the effect of founder diversity at these loci on the observed patterns. We therefore sought to validate our findings in a related species that has been separated from <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic> for a long time. The genus <italic>Capsella</italic> offers a unique opportunity to test the longevity of balancing selection, because selfing has evolved independently in <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, which diverged from <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic> more than one million years ago and whose modern range no longer overlaps with the two other species, preventing ongoing introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hurka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>). We expected the evolution of selfing to have generated a similar bottleneck as in <italic>C. rubella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2018</xref>), and we therefore resequenced 16 <italic>C. orientalis</italic> genomes, to test whether there is evidence of balancing selection at similar types of loci.</p><p>After alignment, SNP calling, and filtering, we identified a mere 71,454 segregating SNPs in <italic>C. orientalis</italic>. This is a surprisingly small amount of variation, corresponding to an almost 50-fold reduction in diversity relative to the outcrossing <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Using our divergence and diversity measures, we estimated that <italic>C. orientalis</italic> diverged from <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> over 1.8 million generations ago (calculated as in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandvain et al., 2013</xref>). The combination of long divergence times and low variability in <italic>C. orientalis</italic> makes it unlikely that alleles will have been maintained by random chance. Using estimates of N<sub>e</sub> from nucleotide diversity at four-fold degenerate sites (<italic>C. orientalis</italic> [14,643] and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> [694,643]), the divergence time above, and the genome assembly size of 134.8 Mb, the probability of finding a single tsSNP is &lt;4×10<sup>−19</sup> using the methodology of Leffler and colleagues and Wiuf and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leffler et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiuf et al., 2004</xref>), which assumes constant population size. It was therefore surprising that 8,408 <italic>C. orientalis</italic> variants were shared with either <italic>C. rubella</italic> or <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (ts<sub>2-way</sub>SNPs), and 3992 with both (ts<sub>3-way</sub>SNPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).

We therefore also used an additional set of more stringent filters to identify high confidence ts<sub>3-way</sub>SNPs (ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs; see Materials and methods). Importantly, we required ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs to be in LD with at least one other ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNP in all three species (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.2 in the same phase), to provide evidence that they represented the same ancestral haplotype. The aim was to improve the likelihood that such SNPs were true examples of identity by descent. Furthermore, we generated a draft assembly of the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> genome using Pacific Biosciences SMRT cell technology, and re-called ts<sub>3-way</sub>SNP sites. We identified 812 high quality transpecific SNPs segregating in all three species (ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs). The distributions of coverage and concordance values in this dataset were similar between ts<sub>3-way</sub>SNP sites and other <italic>C. orientalis</italic> sites, further supporting their authenticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As discussed earlier, the presence of trans-specific polymorphism in diverged species could be driven by stable balancing selection or it could result from gene flow between the species.

Modern gene flow between the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic>/<italic>C. grandiflora</italic> lineages is therefore unlikely, but it is possible that the ranges of these species overlapped in the past. If alleles have been maintained since the split between the lineages, then the divergence between maintained alleles should meet or exceed the divergence between the species. On the other hand, if ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs are the result of recent gene flow between the lineages, then divergence between species near these SNPs should be reduced compared to the genome-wide average divergence. We examined diversity and divergence at neutral (four-fold degenerate) sites surrounding ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In all three species, diversity was high directly adjacent to ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs, close to average levels for genome-wide divergence between the two <italic>Capsella</italic> lineages. This footprint of elevated diversity is much more discernible in the two selfing species than in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>. No obvious reduction in divergence was observed near ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We conclude that ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs correspond predominantly to long-term maintained alleles that diverged on ancient time scales and that they are not the result of recent introgression.</p><p>The finding of tsSNPs shared between two independent lineages, <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>/<italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, for over a million generations in spite of strong geographic barriers suggests that they are targets of stable long-term balancing selection. If this selection pressure remains constant across species, ancient alleles are expected to evolve towards similar equilibrium intermediate frequencies. In comparison to ts<sub>2-way</sub>SNPs, the minor alleles at ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNP sites are closer to intermediate frequencies in all three species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs segregate at more similar allele frequencies in <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> than other two-way tsSNPs, as measured by F<sub>st</sub> median values: 0.03 for ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs and 0.16 for ts<sub>2-way</sub>SNPs, p&lt;&lt;0.001 Mann-Whitney test) and correlation of derived allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). These results suggest a conserved equilibrium maintained since the isolation of <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> over 10,000 generations ago. Derived allele frequencies for ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs are not correlated between the two ancient <italic>Capsella</italic> lineages (Spearman’s rho −0.08 <italic>C. orientalis</italic> to <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and −0.04 to <italic>C. rubella</italic>).

Our previously identified balanced regions strongly predicted the genomic distribution of ts<sub>3-way</sub>SNPs; 50% of ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs fell into these regions, even though they encompass fewer than 10% of ts<sub>CgCr</sub>SNPs and fewer than 3% of all SNPs, resulting in an even more skewed and uneven distribution of genetic diversity along the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). At least one ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNP was found in each of 10 of the 21 original candidate regions under balanced selection. Six of these corresponded to NLR clusters, two to RLK/RLP clusters, and one to a TIR-X cluster. Only one region did not contain a clear immunity candidate, with the caveat that this conclusion is based on the single annotated <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Slotte et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, even in a situation where a recent genetic bottleneck has wiped out almost all genetic diversity, there is very strong selection to maintain allelic diversity at specific immunity-related loci, consistent with these alleles having persisted already for very long evolutionary times.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Insights into balancing selection from de novo assembly of <italic>MLO2</italic></title><p>The balanced regions we identified contained very old tsSNPs, yet as mentioned, the immunity genes themselves are often not accessible to variant discovery based on mapping short reads to a single reference genome.

The <italic>C. rubella MLO2</italic> locus has experienced a tandem duplication, resulting in two genes, <italic>MLO2a</italic> and <italic>MLO2b</italic>. Although both homologs are sufficiently diverged to be accessible to unambiguous read mapping, all six ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs were in <italic>MLO2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). In <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, the ts<sub>3-wayhq</sub>SNPs were arranged in five different haplotypes, which we collapsed into three related haplogroups, A, B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The reference haplogroup A was most frequent in both species.</p><p>Because several known targets of balancing selection in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are the result of structural variation, or lesions larger than 1 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mauricio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stahl et al., 1999</xref>), we examined coverage patterns around the <italic>MLO2</italic> locus to identify potential linked indels. We found that haplogroup B in both <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. orientalis</italic> exhibited similar patterns of low read coverage at the 5’ end of <italic>MLO2b</italic>, suggesting a possible indel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To examine the exact sequence of each allele, we took advantage of the homozygous nature of sequence data from these two selfing species and performed local de novo assembly of the <italic>MLO2</italic> locus from read pairs mapping to this region. We were able to reconstruct the locus for 15 <italic>C. orientalis</italic> samples (13 haplogroup A and two haplogroup B) and 43 <italic>C. rubella</italic> samples (34 A, 2 B, and 7 C). Surprisingly, a comparison of the different haplotypes revealed that the pattern of low coverage observed for haplogroup B was not due to structural variation, but instead to extremely high divergence from the reference haplogroup A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Divergence between alleles within species was greater than 0.15 differences per bp, over three times higher than the genome-wide divergence between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). This highly diverged region had therefore been originally inaccessible to reference-based read mapping in haplogroup B samples. De novo assembly allowed us to identify a total of 204 additional tsSNPs, nearly all of which mapped to the 5’ end of <italic>MLO2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neighbour-joining trees revealed the expected clustering of samples by species in regions adjacent to <italic>MLO2b</italic>, but clear clustering by haplogroup within the 5’ region, a pattern that is reproduced in phylogenetic analysis of the entire CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, divergence within haplogroup across species was greater than, or similar to genome-wide averages for both A and B, demonstrating that recent introgression did not give rise to allele sharing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The high nucleotide divergence between haplogroups A and B translates into numerous amino acid differences in the N terminal half of the encoded proteins. In a 157 amino acid stretch, 31 amino acid differences are found in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), with an indel polymorphism accounting for another seven amino acid differences. The large number of differences between the two haplogroups makes it difficult to point to any specific change as the target of balancing selection, but it seems likely that the two alleles differ functionally, perhaps reinforced by additional differences in the promoter. In summary, the nucleotide divergence in this region suggests that the <italic>MLO2b</italic> haplogroups are much older than the split between the two species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While balancing selection has long been recognised as an important evolutionary force, its relevance as a major factor shaping genomic variation has remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charlesworth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiuf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asthana et al., 2005</xref>). We have taken advantage of unique demographic situations in two <italic>Capsella</italic> lineages to demonstrate not only that there is pervasive balancing selection at immunity-related loci in this genus, but also that the same alleles are maintained in species that are likely experiencing quite different pathogen pressures. We expect that balancing selection plays a similar role in other taxa, but that its effects are masked by a background of higher neutral genetic diversity and more frequent recombination between balanced sites and linked variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiuf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charlesworth, 2006</xref>). In addition, the detection of long-term balancing selection is further compounded by very old alleles being less accessible to short read re-sequencing, the dominant mode of variant discovery today. In the two selfing <italic>Capsella</italic> species, the footprints of balancing selection extend for tens of kilobases, greatly impacting diversity of many other genes. While this makes it more difficult to pinpoint the actual selected variants, it greatly improves statistical power to identify regions under balancing selection. This is reminiscent of genome-wide association studies, where extended LD improves statistical power to detect causal regions of the genome but reduces the ability to identify the specific causal variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The nature of balancing selection acting on the regions we have identified remains to be clarified. Stable balancing selection in self fertilising species is unlikely to derive from heterozygous advantage, pointing to negative frequency-dependent selection or fluctuating selection from variable pathogen pressures as possible factors. While the mode of selection cannot be determined from these static data, the strong signal that we observe in highly selfing lineages points to environmental heterogeneity or negative frequency dependent selection over heterozygote advantage. Based on the enrichment of immunity-related genes, it appears that biotic factors are the dominant drivers of long-term maintenance of polymorphism. This observation is consistent with a large body of work on intraspecific variation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The signal of balancing selection has been observed for specific pairs of disease resistance alleles in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stahl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mauricio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakker, 2006</xref>), and in the case of the resistance gene <italic>RPS5</italic>, alternative alleles have been shown to affect fitness in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karasov et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible, or perhaps even likely, that the signal of balancing selection is amplified by the fact that immunity-related loci occur in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyers, 2003</xref>) and that our strongest signal is the result of simultaneous selection on several genes in these regions in a situation analogous to the MHC in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hedrick, 1998</xref>). Thus, biotic factors might not be quite as important as our analyses make them appear. On the other hand, it is also possible that the clustering of disease resistance genes itself is a product of selection, if selection was more effective when acting on groups of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1975</xref>), or if evolution under a balanced regime was deleterious at other types of loci. Even if we accept that biotic factors predominate, the nature of the potential trade-offs that prevent individual alleles from becoming fixed is still a mystery, but it might involve conflicts between growth and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coley et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herms and Mattson, 1992</xref>), beneficial and harmful microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Walters and Heil, 2007</xref>), or defense against different types of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kliebenstein and Rowe, 2008</xref>). What is clear is that the trade-offs must be stable over very long periods of evolution.</p><p>Our findings suggest a model in which the success of self fertilising populations may be buoyed by gene flow from outcrossing relatives in a situation analogous to evolutionary rescue strategies in conservation biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Whiteley et al., 2015</xref>). This model is a variation on the theme of adaptive introgressions, which have recently emerged as a major evolutionary force in a wide range of taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whitney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castric et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dasmahapatra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henning and Meyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hedrick, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Racimo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castric et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dasmahapatra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whitney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hedrick, 2013</xref>). The unique feature of self-fertilisation in comparison to these examples is that the amplified effects of linked selection and genetic drift lead to a steady loss of genetic variation over time. Constant replenishment via adaptive introgression from an outcrossing relative counters the loss of diversity at immunity-related loci, thereby preventing decreased fitness in competition with pathogens. Whether this model generally applies will require independent study of other lineages of related self-fertilising and outcrossing populations at various stages of speciation.</p><p>Finally, we note that maintenance of ancient variants is most easily detectable in a background of low variation. Therefore, it could potentially be used to rapidly identify loci with meaningful functional variation. Typically, agricultural breeding panels seek to maximise surveyed diversity, but our results indicate that identification of useful immunity-related polymorphism with genomic data might be facilitated in otherwise homogeneous wild populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and DNA extraction</title><p>Seeds were stratified for two weeks at 4°C and germinated in controlled environment chambers.

We simultaneously considered information from all samples within a species to make base pair calls. If no variant was called in any sample then the site was treated as reference. Individual sample calls were made if four reads supported the reference base, the computed quality was above 24, and at least 80% of reads supported a reference call. A site was excluded if more than 30% of the samples from that species did not meet these criteria.</p><p>If at least one sample reported a difference from the reference in the raw consensus, then variant (indel or SNP) or reference calls were considered. The SNP calling parameters were slightly different for the two selfing species as compared to the outcrossing <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> because variants should only rarely be found in the heterozygous state in the former (and the frequency of heterozygous calls in a selfing species is a powerful filter to detect problems with mismapped reads). The general approach was to require at least one high quality variant call at a site and then to call genotypes in other samples with slightly reduced stringency. If no variant call met the more stringent threshold, then the site was reconsidered using the above reference criteria. Finally, the calls from each of the three species were combined into a master matrix. If a position was not called biallelic or invariant across the compared species, then it was not considered.

Equivalent sites were considered if they were present in alignments at least 500 bp long and contained only one <italic>C. orientalis</italic> and one <italic>C. rubella</italic> sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Local <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and analysis of <italic>MLO2</italic></title><p>To reconstruct alleles from the <italic>MLO2</italic> locus, we used an iterative assembly approach. Reads were first mapped to the entire reference genome using bwa (v.0.7.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) using the bwa-mem alignment algorithm for each sample. Reads that mapped to the <italic>MLO2</italic> locus were then extracted and assembled de novo using SPAdes (v.3.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nurk et al., 2013</xref>). Assemblies were filtered to be longer than 2,000 bp with a coverage greater than 5, and then used to create an index for a second round of read mapping. Reads that mapped to the assembly without mismatches were collected together with their mates (regardless of the mate’s mapping quality), and were again de novo assembled. This process was iterated six times until scaffolds covering both coding regions were achieved. Format conversions and file handling made use of the software samtools (v.0.1.19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and bamutil (v.1.0.13).</p><p>Assemblies were filtered for appropriate length, and aligned using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>). Alignments were visualised using AliView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Larsson, 2014</xref>), and manually edited where appropriate. The protein encoded by <italic>MLO2b</italic> annotated in the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference was truncated relative to <italic>A. thaliana MLO2</italic>. We aligned the genomic and coding regions from both species and found that the premature stop in <italic>MLO2b</italic> is likely due to a mis-annotated splice junction. The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> junction is conserved in <italic>C. rubella</italic> and alternative annotations on phytozome identify the <italic>A. thaliana</italic>-like splice variant. We therefore used the full-length version derived from manual alignments for our analysis. The phylogeny of <italic>Capsella MLO2</italic> CDS sequences was produced using the optim.pml command from the R package phangorn using Jukes-Cantor distances. 1000 bootstrap iterations were run to estimate support for nodes in the tree. To determine where amino acid substitutions had occurred, we aligned the proteins encoded by each allele against the barley <italic>mlo</italic> protein and annotated domains (UniProtKB P3766).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Draft assembly of the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> genome</title><p>The draft genome from the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> accession 2007–03 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) was assembled from long reads generated by PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing. Long reads were assembled with Falcon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chin et al., 2016</xref>) (version 0.5.4, max_diff = 150, max_cov = 150, min_cov = 2). The resulting primary contig set was iteratively polished with Quiver again using long reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chin et al., 2013</xref>) (version 2.0.0) and with Pilon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walker et al., 2014</xref>) (version 1.16) using short reads from a single Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free library. The draft genome of <italic>C. orientalis</italic> comprises 135 Mb distributed over 423 gap-free contigs and covers 60% of the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference with non-ambiguous 1-to-1 whole genome alignments. Its completeness is comparable to that of the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christa Lanz for expert assistance with Illumina sequencing.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity in <italic>Capsella</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see from the detailed comments provided below, the reviewers found the findings quite interesting, but raised a number of important concerns that will require both additional analyses and extensive rewriting of the manuscript.</p><p>Since additional analyses are needed, and the authors may want to collect more data to respond to the concern about possible artifacts in <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, it may not be feasible for the revisions to be completed within two months. We leave it to the discretion of the authors whether they think this timeline is feasible, or would prefer to work on revisions at more length and resubmit the manuscript to be considered anew.</p><p>In terms of the analysis, the three main points are that:</p><p>1) The data for <italic>C. orientalis</italic> seems a bit troubling, and should probably be further inspected for possible artifacts.</p><p>2) The hypothesis that balancing selection is currently acting in C. rubella needs to be better supported. In particular, the authors need to exclude the possibility that the observed signatures persisted since the ancestral species. It will also be important for the authors to more clearly explain whether they believe that the high variability is driven by introgression (adaptive or not), ongoing balancing selection (and of what kind…) or both.</p><p>3) The analysis would be more interpretable if more of the highlighted regions were investigated individually, rather than always treating all tsSNPs jointly.</p><p>In terms of the writing, all reviewers agreed that the paper is unrelated to the origin of sex or mating system evolution, and that these topics are not always discussed accurately. The discussions of these points should be removed. All reviewers also felt that a number of claims were too strong, and relevant literature is missing.</p><p>We hope you will find these comments useful in revising your manuscript, should you choose to do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The idea of looking for balanced polymorphisms in selfers, in which the footprints are frozen by the lower effective recombination rate, is really nice, and I was convinced by the findings that increased diversity and other signs of balancing selection were enriched for host-pathogen genes.</p><p>Less clear to me is when/where the balancing selection is occurring. There are at least three possibilities:</p><p>1) The hypothesis the authors privilege: long-term balancing selection is ongoing in the selfers as well as the outcrossing species.</p><p>2) Balancing selection occurred only in the ancestor of the two selfers, increasing the probability that more than one lineage was retained in the selfer. In a parenthetical comment, they dismiss this possibility for orientalis based on a calculation from Wiuf et al., 2004. They need to spell out their assumptions about Ne etc… in doing so. More importantly, they also need to calculate a similar quantity for rubella. Otherwise, a number of statements in the manuscript seemed overstated (e.g., the last sentence of the Abstract).</p><p>3) Balancing selection is operating in the outcrosser and variation was introduced into the selfer by introgression. They entertain this possibility for rubella in the Discussion section. They label it as &quot;adaptive introgression&quot; but it seems to me that it could just as well be neutral, if introgression is more likely to introduce a different haplotype due to balancing selection in the outcrosser.</p><p>In this regard, I note that it is not correct that (1) and (3) cannot be distinguished, as they predict different genealogies. Given that the selfers are mostly homozygous at these positions, can they build trees for e.g., 100 regions, and see whether they support (1) or (3)? If not, they should at least explore diversity and divergence levels around the tsSNPs.</p><p>More generally, I was confused by what specific models the authors had in mind at a number of points in the manuscript. Because they focus on selfers, their study design seems aimed at picking up balancing selection due to fluctuating selection pressures not heterozygote advantage. Moreover, they repeatedly state that they are looking for a form of selection that favors rare types. Why then expect a positive Tajima's D (subsection “A high density of tsSNPs around immunity-related loci”)? I think a discussion of the mode of balancing selection they expect to detect is missing.</p><p>The frequency spectrum for orientalis in Figure 5A seems quite odd. And the observation about the low interchromosomal LD among ts3_SNPs is likewise disconcerting. The explanation the authors provide seems highly unlikely, unless there is rampant epistasis among ts SNPs. If there were, shouldn't the authors also expect to see large footprints of balancing selection in the outcrossers (because haplotypes, not just SNPs, would be retained)?</p><p>The Red Queen hypothesis is used to refer to a dizzying array of hypotheses, from the evolution of sex (Introduction) to selection for new combinations of alleles (subsection “Balancing selection over ancient time scales”) to selection for rare alleles (Introduction) to balancing selection (Discussion section), in ways that are often inaccurate. In particular, the Red Queen hypothesis is neither necessary nor sufficient for the maintenance of genetic variation. As Aurelien Tellier and others have shown, it is actually very unlikely that genetic variation would be maintained over long time periods due to simple models of host-pathogen coevolution, especially in small populations (see Tellier et al., 2014 Evolution, for example). This literature should be discussed, especially since the authors are finding so many putative examples.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I was very disappointed by this manuscript, as the results are presented so as to appear more exciting than they really are, and parts of the study appear to reflect a lack of understanding. In the first category, I would mention text in the Introduction about the evolution of sex, with which the study does not even remotely deal. In the second category of lack of understanding and/or knowledge of the field and of results already established, I highlight the discussion of outcrossing, which does not mention inbreeding depression, which is surely a factor that ought to be mentioned – I think that it is incorrect to predict that in general outcrossing will be most favored by natural selection when the selective landscape changes frequently, and to imply that pathogen pressure is probably important in maintaining outcrossing. Moreover, the conclusion that balancing selection still operates in the selfers to maintain variation seems unjustified, as other possibilities are not excluded, and the same applies to the conclusion stated at the end of the Abstract that &quot;population longevity in the face of pathogen attack depends on the persistence of ancient genetic variation&quot;.</p><p>The results may support the much more limited, but still interesting, conclusion that genes involved in defences against pathogens are enriched for cases of balancing selection, in line with the many previously published findings that this class of gene functions shows this kind of behaviour. It is far from clear that there is an &quot;advantage of an expanded footprint of balancing selection after a genetic bottleneck&quot;, as the Abstract claims. It is correct that low diversity in a selfer might allow rare high diversity loci to be detected, but selfers that evolved recently from an outcrossing population have the disadvantage that one cannot disentangle selection prior to the selfing state being established from selection more recently, to say nothing of the effect of a bottleneck in increasing the variance of LD and other quantities that might be estimated.</p><p>Details of these major concerns are too long for your word limit, so I have emailed them to the editorial office in a separate file, to be passed on to the authors.</p><p>My recommendation would be to revise the manuscript extensively to show clearly the evidence for those conclusions that are well supported, and relate them to what is already known.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to detect evidence and identify targets of balancing selection by genome-wide search of polymorphisms shared by three Caspella species, two of which experienced genetic bottleneck and transition to self-fertilization independently. The authors resequenced 50 C. rubella, 13 C. grandiflora and 16 C. orientalis accessions and identified millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). With this dataset, they first characterized the demographic history of these species and, unlike a previous study, detected evidence of gene flow between (eastern) C. rubella and C. grandiflora. Then, they detected evidence of balancing selection enriched in immunity-related genes by focusing on shared polymorphisms between species. 21 genomic regions are highlighted as strong candidates of targets under balancing selection, many of which contain immunity genes with known functions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p><p>This study does a reasonably good job in excluding factors other than ancestral variation that could lead to shared polymorphisms, so the conclusions are convincing to me. I also enjoy reading this manuscript, as it generates several new insights: (1) it substantially increases the number of trans-species polymorphisms that are potentially maintained by balancing selection in plants, providing candidates for follow-up functional studies; (2) it strongly suggests that frequency-dependent selection is a common mechanism underlying ancient balancing selection (as compared to heterozygote advantage); (3) the case of MLO2 underscores the technical difficulty of detecting divergent haplogroups shared between species by short-read sequencing methods.</p><p>That said, I have several questions and comments that should be considered before publication:</p><p>1) The shared IBD segments and genome-wide D-statistic suggested past and ongoing gene flow between sympatric C. rubella and C. grandiflora. Are there shared IBD segments and significant D-statistic values for the regions with strong evidence of balancing selection? The presence of introgression does not change the conclusion that most tsSNPs are retained ancestral variation, as long as western C. rubella and C. grandiflora still share the polymorphisms, but I am wondering if some of the sharing by eastern C. rubella and C. grandiflora could be attributed to recent gene flow.</p><p>2) To exclude the possibility of spurious tsSNPs due to cryptic paralogs, the authors compared the coverage and read concordance. Although the overall distribution of the two metrics looks similar for tsSNPs and ssSNPs, it is not clear whether there could be a few regions with excess coverage or reduced concordance. It will be helpful to plot these two metrics along the chromosome coordinate for the regions with strong evidence for balancing selection.</p><p>Another way to rule out the concern of the cryptic paralogs is to compare the proportion of heterozygotes for tsSNPs and ssSNPs (controlling for allele frequency). If some of the tsSNPs are due to cryptic paralogs, the proportion of heterozygotes is expected to be higher than that for ssSNPs.</p><p>3) The presence of tsSNPs shared by all three species of Capsella provides strong evidence for balancing selection, but I am slightly concerned by the quality of the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> data because of a couple of puzzling patterns: (A) why is the allele frequency spectrum of ssSNPs in <italic>C. orientalis</italic> multi-modal? (B) Why is the average divergence between the two main Capsella lineages higher near sites adjacent to the three-way tsSNPs?</p><p>4) The interchromosomal LD for three-way tsSNPs is significantly lower than that of random polymorphisms in <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>. The authors speculated that this might be due to selection promoting new combinations of tsSNPs. However, I found this explanation implausible unless strong and prevalent epistasis is involved. Could the authors run simulations to show that the &quot;reshuffling&quot; hypothesis is able to explain the reduced LD and estimate how much epistasis is required to generate the observed pattern? In addition, why is the interchromosomal LD for three-way tsSNPs significantly higher for that of random polymorphisms in <italic>C. orientalis</italic>? Could this be due to technical issues?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity genes in <italic>Capsella</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues with the presentation and discussion that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Notably reviewer 2 made a number of useful suggestions of clarifications that would be helpful in understanding the analyses and results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is significantly improved. However, the writing is still rough in several places, and there are some other things that should be improved.</p><p>The Abstract suggests that the study aim is &quot;to understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity&quot;, meaning sequence diversity. In fact, however, the conclusions relate mainly to whether genes whose sequences suggest that they are involved in resistance to pathogens show footprints of balancing selection, as has been suggested many times, and for which there is some empirical evidence, including from analyses of diversity. This study is therefore an advance mainly in that such genes were not chosen for study and shown to have interesting diversity patterns, but instead they emerged from a genomic analysis for balancing selection, and specifically through analyzing shared polymorphisms.</p><p>The revised manuscript concludes that genes showing signals of potential balancing selection show an enrichment for genes involved in interactions with pathogens. I have two comments about this. First, are some of these genes located in clusters in physically small genome regions (as is commonly the case for plant NRR genes)? If so, could this over-estimate the fraction under balancing selection, because one gene is actually under balancing selection, and the others have correlated diversity patterns, due to close linkage? This would seem to be a particular concern for any clusters that are located in regions of low recombination, or low effective recombination rates (which could encompass considerable parts of the genomes of the selfing species studied).</p><p>It is far from clear that &quot;self-fertilizing species provide increased sensitivity to detect balancing selection&quot; (as claimed in the Introduction) and indeed the evidence is not compelling, though it is overall consistent with its having been detected in the selfing Capsella species studied. Moreover, only certain kinds of balancing selection could be detected in a selfer, notably situations involving frequency dependence (not heterozygote advantage). This claim should therefore not be made.</p><p>Second, the revised manuscript makes much clearer than before that the long-term balancing selection that may have been detected could potentially occur solely within the outcrossing species from which the selfing species evolved (in one case, apparently very recently). The signal within the selfing species might therefore not reflect ongoing selection in those species, but merely introgression of sequences bearing the footprints of the selection. The revised text marshalls the evidence on this question quite clearly. However, it is not mentioned that introgression by pollen flow into the selfing species is more likely than the reverse, following the long-established general rule for attempts to inter-cross two species when only one of them is self-incompatible: pollen of the self-compatible species often fails to work on pistils of the self-incompatible one, whereas the reciprocal pollination succeeds (as might be expected if selfing species' pistils have lost the ability to reject incompatible pollen). However, some recently evolved selfing species also reject pollen from their close self-incompatible relatives. A comment on the case in these Capsella species would be worth adding. In my opinion, the abstract should mention that tests for adaptive introgression suggest that this is not causing the signal(s) on which the conclusion of balancing selection in the selfers is based.</p><p>The first paragraph is poorly written and somewhat misleading, as it fails to mention that loss of alleles in situation with strong balancing selection occurs only in special cases. I think that the authors meaning is as follows. The term &quot;balancing selection&quot; describes several different adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation for longer than expected under genetic drift of neutral variants. It includes situations with heterozygous advantage, negative frequency-dependent selection (rare allele advantage), and environmental heterogeneity affecting fitnesses in space and time. In these situations, selection prevents loss of alleles from populations at the functional genes or sites. As this also results in increased diversity at closely linked neutral or weakly selected sites (Charlesworth, 2006), it should be possible to detect balancing selection from the resulting footprints of increased coalescence times at closely linked sites, and many candidate genes have been identified using diverse methodology (Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015). However, theoretical models predict that even strongly balanced functional alleles can be stochastically lost over long time periods, suggesting that balanced polymorphism could often be short lived [a reference is needed here], particularly when the functional alleles have low equilibrium frequencies, or fluctuate in frequency, with periods of low frequency, as may occur in the case of plant pathogen resistance genes where temporarily rare alleles may have advantages (Tellier et al., 2014). There is no need to repeat this reference in the Introduction. It would be better to make clear all along that this is a special case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved after extensive revisions. Removal of the discussion of evolution of sex makes the main story much clearer, and I appreciate the explicit discussion of different possible mechanisms underlying the shared polymorphisms (technical artifacts, recurrent mutations, maintenance of ancestral variation, introgression, etc). The evidence of trans-species polymorphisms in MLO2b is very compelling, and I am convinced that the high-quality three-way tsSNPs show evidence for long-term balancing selection and no evidence of recent gene flow.</p><p>However, I have a few questions about the analysis and hope the authors could add some details in the manuscript to improve clarity. I also feel the current abstract is too vague and lacks specifics of some key results. For instance, it is unclear which collection of variants the authors are referring to when saying &quot;ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci&quot; (ts_2waySNPs, Bal regions, ts_3waySNPs, or ts_3wayhqSNPs?). In addition, the gene name MLO2b should be specified in the second to the last sentence, as this is the only case the authors demonstrate trans-species sharing of haplotypes clearly. Please see below for my specific questions and comments.</p><p>1) The authors use the D statistic and IBD sharing to support their conclusion of ongoing gene flow between C. grandiflora and eastern C rubella, but some details of these analyses are unclear.</p><p>D-statistic calculation:</p><p>1) What exactly is the configuration for the ABBA-BABA test. For example, what species is used as the outgroup?</p><p>2) Why is the correlation between D statistic and distance evidence for ongoing gene flow (as claimed in subsection “<italic>Capsella rubella</italic> demography”)? Could this reflect past gene flow?</p><p>IBD detection:</p><p>1) What does the minimum segment length of 1kb translate into genetic distance? I am not familiar with recombination rates in plants, but such segments seem very short by standards in humans and thus very old. (The length threshold is only specified in legend of Figure 2, but I think it should also be included in the Materials and methods section.)</p><p>2) What is the distribution of detected IBD segment lengths?</p><p>3) Can the authors provide some estimates for the age of the IBD segments based on their lengths to support their conclusion of &quot;very recent co-ancestry&quot;?</p><p>2) Figure 4 is one of the key results showing enrichment in immunity-related genes, but it is unclear what each panel shows exactly, as some details or labels are missing.</p><p>1) Panel A: What does each dot mean? I guess each point represents a gene, but this is not clear from the text, figure or legend. What is the y-axis in each sub-panel? How is this number calculated?</p><p>2) Panels B: what do the thick line and the shaded area mean, respectively? Does the legend of panel C apply to panel B?</p><p>3) The authors use simulation data to argue against the possibility that the diversity patterns near Bal loci result from historical balancing selection in the ancestor population. Did the simulations include effects of balancing selection? If so, how is balancing selection simulated in practice? If balancing selection is not simulated, are the results based on neutral simulations sufficient to rule out the possibility of historical balancing selection?</p><p>4) MLO2b region</p><p>1) Why is the haplotype structure of MLO2b not discussed on C grandiflora? Since the tsSNPs are shared by C grandiflora, it seems the selection pressure is preserved in this species. Would the higher recombination rate in C grandiflora help narrow down the causal variant(s)?</p><p>2) How long are the shared haplotypes between C rubella and C orientalis? Is maintenance of such long haplotypes expected, given plausible split time and recombination rate, if there is no epistasis? It will be helpful to estimate this using the formula in Wiuf et al., 2004.</p><p>3) Based on Figure 3B, haplogroup C differs by only 1 SNP from the second haplotype in group B. Why is C classified as the separate haplogroup instead of a subtype of B?</p><p>4) In subsection “Insights into balancing selection from de novoassembly of <italic>MLO2”</italic>, the authors concluded that the shared haplotypes did not result from recent gene flow, because of similar within-haplotype divergence levels of A and B haplogroups. However, this evidence is insufficient: the authors need to demonstrate that the within-haplogroup divergence is at least as high as the genome-wide average (which seems to be the case by comparing Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to Figure 5D).</p><p>5) The reconstructed trees in Figure 6C are very small, and haplotypes need to be labeled in order to show the pattern of clustering by haplogroup.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43606.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since additional analyses are needed, and the authors may want to collect more data to respond to the concern about possible artifacts in C. orientalis, it may not be feasible for the revisions to be completed within two months.

The unusual appearance of the spectrum is the result of having 16 samples, and binning allele frequencies into 10 bins. Because we had differing numbers of individuals from each species, we chose to compare everything using the same binning, which happens to mathematically introduce an uneven spectrum as observed in the original Figure 5. We replotted these spectra using different bin sizes for each species and show that the uneven pattern is largely removed.</p><p>To further alleviate the reviewers’ concerns, we generated a draft genome assembly for one of our <italic>C. orientalis</italic> samples using an alternative sequencing technology and recalled variants at tsSNP sites in our <italic>C. orientalis samples</italic>. In the updated manuscript, only SNPs identified in both approaches were considered “high quality”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hypothesis that balancing selection is currently acting in C. rubella needs to be better supported.

Specifically, if immunity related genes are under balancing selection in the outcrosser, then a random sample of alleles during the <italic>C. rubella</italic> founding event might result in higher genetic variation in subsequent generations.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that these two possibilities are difficult to tease apart in the recent <italic>C. rubella / C. grandiflora</italic> speciation event. We based our original conclusion that balancing selection is operating in <italic>C. rubella</italic> based on the following arguments:</p><p>1) The allele frequencies in the proposed regions are far less diverged between <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic> then expected by random chance under an explicit demographic model which includes gene flow.</p><p>2) These regions show many classic indications of balancing selection in <italic>C. rubella</italic> including:</p><p>a) Increased allele frequency</p><p>b) Increased genetic diversity</p><p>c) Low Fst between subpopulations<sub>​</sub> </p><p>d) Elevated Tajima’s D</p><p>3) In <italic>C. grandiflora,</italic> genetic diversity is high throughout the genome, and balanced regions show only subtle deviation from the global pattern very near to the candidate targets. Therefore, a random sample of alleles anywhere in the genome would generate peaks of outstandingly high genetic diversity in <italic>C. rubella</italic>, yet we see that retention of variation is specifically elevated at immunity loci.</p><p>4) Though we identified tsSNPs throughout the genome, those tsSNPs found in our candidate regions were much more likely to be retained after population splits regardless of allele frequency.</p><p>5) In the much more diverged and much less diverse selfing lineage, <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, we observe the same pattern at many of the same loci. Though this is not direct evidence for balancing selection in <italic>C. rubella</italic> specifically, it is strong evidence that these loci are the targets of stable, long-term balancing selection in a selfing lineage. It is possible that, despite having been stable over millions of years of evolution previously, balancing selection ended within the last ~150,000 years in <italic>C. rubella</italic> specifically. We think that the more plausible explanation of the observed patterns is that variation is retained by ongoing selection in all three lineages.</p><p>In response to this concern we sought to strengthen our argument with two additional analyses. First, we examined whether elevated founder diversity might impact the likelihood of observing the pattern of Fst we used to identify outliers. We approximated the effect of balancing selection in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> alone by including only simulations that showed the highest level of diversity <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, and then explored whether our outlier <italic>C. rubella</italic> Fst values were more likely to occur. Even under this scenario of highfounder diversity, the observed values remain extremely unlikely. Second, we examined whether allele frequencies are correlated between <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic> and between subpopulations of <italic>C. rubella</italic> for tsSNPs inside and outside of balanced regions.</p><p>We find that although all these SNPs segregate in all of the populations assayed, SNPs within balanced regions are show a substantial increase in AFS correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will also be important for the authors to more clearly explain whether they believe that the high variability is driven by introgression (adaptive or not), ongoing balancing selection (and of what kind…) or both.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to discussion to make our thinking more clear on these issues. We do not think that adaptive introgression and maintenance by balancing selection are mutually exclusive hypotheses, as the later is not dependent on the source of an allele. In the case of a young species like <italic>C. rubella</italic> we think that gene flow has contributed to the modern pattern of variation, and that this variation is maintained for longer than expected by chance in regions near immunity related loci. For the older split, we find no evidence for recent introgression.</p><p>We further explored these ideas by looking for IBD regions inside and outside of balanced regions and find a pattern consistent with the above hypothesis.</p><p>With respect to the mechanism of balancing selection, we believe that definitive statements about this issue are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, however we have tried to make it clear that we think heterozygote advantage is unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The analysis would be more interpretable if more of the highlighted regions were investigated individually, rather than always treating all tsSNPs jointly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reported statistics individually for these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the writing, all reviewers agreed that the paper is unrelated to the origin of sex or mating system evolution, and that these topics are not always discussed accurately.

There are at least three possibilities:</p><p>1) The hypothesis the authors privilege: long-term balancing selection is ongoing in the selfers as well as the outcrossing species.</p><p>2) Balancing selection occurred only in the ancestor of the two selfers, increasing the probability that more than one lineage was retained in the selfer. In a parenthetical comment, they dismiss this possibility for orientalis based on a calculation from Wiuf et al., 2004. They need to spell out their assumptions about Ne etc… in doing so.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a comment on the Ne assumption for the <italic>C. orientalis</italic> calculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, they also need to calculate a similar quantity for rubella.

The C. grandiflora-C. orientalis calculation is conservative relative to the later. However, we have modified the Abstract extensively to account for the reviewer’s criticism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Balancing selection is operating in the outcrosser and variation was introduced into the selfer by introgression. They entertain this possibility for rubella in the Discussion section. They label it as &quot;adaptive introgression&quot; but it seems to me that it could just as well be neutral, if introgression is more likely to introduce a different haplotype due to balancing selection in the outcrosser.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer the reviewer to our response to the general comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this regard, I note that it is not correct that (1) and (3) cannot be distinguished, as they predict different genealogies. Given that the selfers are mostly homozygous at these positions, can they build trees for e.g., 100 regions, and see whether they support (1) or (3)? If not, they should at least explore diversity and divergence levels around the tsSNPs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this statement and have included additional analysis of IBS regions to address the reviewer’s comment, and we present trees as suggested in our analysis of <italic>MLO2</italic> where complete data on a single gene could be produced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, I was confused by what specific models the authors had in mind at a number of points in the manuscript. Because they focus on selfers, their study design seems aimed at picking up balancing selection due to fluctuating selection pressures not heterozygote advantage. Moreover, they repeatedly state that they are looking for a form of selection that favors rare types. Why then expect a positive Tajima's D (subsection “A high density of tsSNPs around immunity-related loci”)? I think a discussion of the mode of balancing selection they expect to detect is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have heavily modified our introduction and removed some of the references that the reviewer refers to. With respect to negative frequency dependent selection, though this selection favors rare alleles, it is expected to elevate Tajima’s D as observed for the classic S-locus case.

The explanation the authors provide seems highly unlikely, unless there is rampant epistasis among ts SNPs.

In particular, the Red Queen hypothesis is neither necessary nor sufficient for the maintenance of genetic variation. As Aurelien Tellier and others have shown, it is actually very unlikely that genetic variation would be maintained over long time periods due to simple models of host-pathogen coevolution, especially in small populations (see Tellier et al., 2014 Evolution, for example). This literature should be discussed, especially since the authors are finding so many putative examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the Red Queen references in our work.

In the second category of lack of understanding and/or knowledge of the field and of results already established, I highlight the discussion of outcrossing, which does not mention inbreeding depression, which is surely a factor that ought to be mentioned – I think that it is incorrect to predict that in general outcrossing will be most favored by natural selection when the selective landscape changes frequently, and to imply that pathogen pressure is probably important in maintaining outcrossing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all of this material from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the conclusion that balancing selection still operates in the selfers to maintain variation seems unjustified, as other possibilities are not excluded, and</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several additional analyses supporting our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>the same applies to the conclusion stated at the end of the Abstract that &quot;population longevity in the face of pathogen attack depends on the persistence of ancient genetic variation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Abstract and modified this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results may support the much more limited, but still interesting, conclusion that genes involved in defences against pathogens are enriched for cases of balancing selection, in line with the many previously published findings that this class of gene functions shows this kind of behaviour.

It is correct that low diversity in a selfer might allow rare high diversity loci to be detected, but selfers that evolved recently from an outcrossing population have the disadvantage that one cannot disentangle selection prior to the selfing state being established from selection more recently, to say nothing of the effect of a bottleneck in increasing the variance of LD and other quantities that might be estimated.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the general editorial comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details of these major concerns are too long for your word limit, so I have emailed them to the editorial office in a separate file, to be passed on to the authors.</p><p>My recommendation would be to revise the manuscript extensively to show clearly the evidence for those conclusions that are well supported, and relate them to what is already known.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This study does a reasonably good job in excluding factors other than ancestral variation that could lead to shared polymorphisms, so the conclusions are convincing to me. I also enjoy reading this manuscript, as it generates several new insights: (1) it substantially increases the number of trans-species polymorphisms that are potentially maintained by balancing selection in plants, providing candidates for follow-up functional studies; (2) it strongly suggests that frequency-dependent selection is a common mechanism underlying ancient balancing selection (as compared to heterozygote advantage); (3) the case of MLO2 underscores the technical difficulty of detecting divergent haplogroups shared between species by short-read sequencing methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ positive comments regarding the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That said, I have several questions and comments that should be considered before publication:</p><p>1) The shared IBD segments and genome-wide D-statistic suggested past and ongoing gene flow between sympatric C. rubella and C. grandiflora. Are there shared IBD segments and significant D-statistic values for the regions with strong evidence of balancing selection? The presence of introgression does not change the conclusion that most tsSNPs are retained ancestral variation, as long as western C. rubella and C. grandiflora still share the polymorphisms, but I am wondering if some of the sharing by eastern C. rubella and C. grandiflora could be attributed to recent gene flow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added analyses of IBD segments along the lines of the reviewers’ suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To exclude the possibility of spurious tsSNPs due to cryptic paralogs, the authors compared the coverage and read concordance. Although the overall distribution of the two metrics looks similar for tsSNPs and ssSNPs, it is not clear whether there could be a few regions with excess coverage or reduced concordance. It will be helpful to plot these two metrics along the chromosome coordinate for the regions with strong evidence for balancing selection. Another way to rule out the concern of the cryptic paralogs is to compare the proportion of heterozygotes for tsSNPs and ssSNPs (controlling for allele frequency). If some of the tsSNPs are due to cryptic paralogs, the proportion of heterozygotes is expected to be higher than that for ssSNPs.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided that this suggestion was the simplest way of addressing this concern and have provided it in the manuscript. We modified this approach a bit, we checked to see if the balanced regions that show signal of increased heterozygosity, rather than tsSNPs. We find no elevations of observed relative to expected heterozygosity in these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presence of tsSNPs shared by all three species of Capsella provides strong evidence for balancing selection, but I am slightly concerned by the quality of the C. orientalis data because of a couple of puzzling patterns: (A) why is the allele frequency spectrum of ssSNPs in C. orientalis multi-modal?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the discussion of this issue in the general comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Why is the average divergence between the two main Capsella lineages higher near sites adjacent to the three-way tsSNPs?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer means relative to the genome-wide average. In our manuscript, we hypothesize that these alleles have been segregating in <italic>Capsella</italic> since before the species split. Thus, on average, we expect divergence to be slightly elevated in tight linkage with the balanced SNP (since the exact same allele was not selected in each lineage, but just related alleles), and this is indeed what we see.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The interchromosomal LD for three-way tsSNPs is significantly lower than that of random polymorphisms in C. rubella and C. grandiflora. The authors speculated that this might be due to selection promoting new combinations of tsSNPs. However, I found this explanation implausible unless strong and prevalent epistasis is involved. Could the authors run simulations to show that the &quot;reshuffling&quot; hypothesis is able to explain the reduced LD and estimate how much epistasis is required to generate the observed pattern? In addition, why is the interchromosomal LD for three-way tsSNPs significantly higher for that of random polymorphisms in C. orientalis? Could this be due to technical issues?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this analysis from the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues with the presentation and discussion that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Notably reviewer 2 made a number of useful suggestions of clarifications that would be helpful in understanding the analyses and results.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The revised manuscript concludes that genes showing signals of potential balancing selection show an enrichment for genes involved in interactions with pathogens. I have two comments about this. First, are some of these genes located in clusters in physically small genome regions (as is commonly the case for plant NRR genes)? If so, could this over-estimate the fraction under balancing selection, because one gene is actually under balancing selection, and the others have correlated diversity patterns, due to close linkage? This would seem to be a particular concern for any clusters that are located in regions of low recombination, or low effective recombination rates (which could encompass considerable parts of the genomes of the selfing species studied).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments, as we noted in the discussion “It is possible, or perhaps even likely, that the signal of balancing selection is amplified by the fact that immunity-related loci occur in clusters (Meyers et al., 2003) and that our strongest signal is the result of simultaneous selection on several genes in these regions in a situation analogous to the MHC in animals (Hedrick, 1998). Thus, biotic factors might not be quite as important as our analyses make them appear.” We hope that the reviewer finds this recognition of the biases of gene clusters acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is far from clear that &quot;self-fertilizing species provide increased sensitivity to detect balancing selection&quot; (as claimed in the Introduction) and indeed the evidence is not compelling, though it is overall consistent with its having been detected in the selfing Capsella species studied. Moreover, only certain kinds of balancing selection could be detected in a selfer, notably situations involving frequency dependence (not heterozygote advantage). This claim should therefore not be made.</p></disp-quote><p>The beginning of the sentence actually reads “We hypothesized that self-fertilizing…”. We feel that we clearly state a hypothesis, not a conclusion. We hope we can leave it to the reader to decide whether this particular idea has merit, and indeed, we point out many of the caveats that the reviewer mentions throughout the manuscript. We think that our study does provide some evidence for this hypothesis, and we hope to learn if it is widely true from further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the revised manuscript makes much clearer than before that the long-term balancing selection that may have been detected could potentially occur solely within the outcrossing species from which the selfing species evolved (in one case, apparently very recently). The signal within the selfing species might therefore not reflect ongoing selection in those species, but merely introgression of sequences bearing the footprints of the selection. The revised text marshalls the evidence on this question quite clearly. However, it is not mentioned that introgression by pollen flow into the selfing species is more likely than the reverse, following the long-established general rule for attempts to inter-cross two species when only one of them is self-incompatible: pollen of the self-compatible species often fails to work on pistils of the self-incompatible one, whereas the reciprocal pollination succeeds (as might be expected if selfing species' pistils have lost the ability to reject incompatible pollen). However, some recently evolved selfing species also reject pollen from their close self-incompatible relatives. A comment on the case in these Capsella species would be worth adding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a comment on the direction of fertility and a reference that explores the hybrid compatibility of these species in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my opinion, the abstract should mention that tests for adaptive introgression suggest that this is not causing the signal(s) on which the conclusion of balancing selection in the selfers is based.</p></disp-quote><p>We preferred to leave this out of the abstract because it is entirely possible that adaptive introgression plays an important role during the early stages of divergence. It is true that recent gene flow between <italic>C. orientalis</italic> and the other species has not occurred (as stated in the text), but we thought that including a broader statement might confuse the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first paragraph is poorly written and somewhat misleading, as it fails to mention that loss of alleles in situation with strong balancing selection occurs only in special cases. I think that the authors meaning is as follows. The term &quot;balancing selection&quot; describes several different adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation for longer than expected under genetic drift of neutral variants. It includes situations with heterozygous advantage, negative frequency-dependent selection (rare allele advantage), and environmental heterogeneity affecting fitnesses in space and time. In these situations, selection prevents loss of alleles from populations at the functional genes or sites. As this also results in increased diversity at closely linked neutral or weakly selected sites (Charlesworth, 2006), it should be possible to detect balancing selection from the resulting footprints of increased coalescence times at closely linked sites, and many candidate genes have been identified using diverse methodology (Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015). However, theoretical models predict that even strongly balanced functional alleles can be stochastically lost over long time periods, suggesting that balanced polymorphism could often be short lived [a reference is needed here], particularly when the functional alleles have low equilibrium frequencies, or fluctuate in frequency, with periods of low frequency, as may occur in the case of plant pathogen resistance genes where temporarily rare alleles may have advantages (Tellier et al., 2014). There is no need to repeat this reference in the Introduction. It would be better to make clear all along that this is a special case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the use of the Tellier reference was unclear, as it does support the possibility of identifying balanced sites, the Fijarczyk review covers the broad consensus that balancing selection over long time scales is rare.

Even if we were to explicitly model balancing selection in these two species, it would be difficult if not impossible to consider all possible relevant scenarios. We try to illustrate this challenge throughout the manuscript. For example: “Although evidence for balancing selection at immunity-related loci in <italic>C. rubella</italic> is much stronger than in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, it is difficult to completely exclude the effect of founder diversity at these loci on the observed patterns.” This was exactly the reason we analyzed <italic>C. orientalis</italic> and found considerable additional evidence that the same regions were targets of balancing selection in a much older selfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) MLO2b region</p><p>1) Why is the haplotype structure of MLO2b not discussed on C grandiflora?

We can assemble high confidence haplotypes in the sellers because they have very low observed heterozygosity. Accurate haplotype assembly in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> might be possible with a larger sample size, and it is possible this data might narrow down causal variants. However, it is important to point out that the <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> haplotypes have had nearly identical amount of time to recombine since the split with <italic>C. orientalis</italic> (the shift to selfing in <italic>C. rubella</italic> is much more recent in comparison to the larger divergence).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How long are the shared haplotypes between C rubella and C orientalis? Is maintenance of such long haplotypes expected, given plausible split time and recombination rate, if there is no epistasis?

Intuitively, it does not seem probable that now recombination has occurred. Epistasis is a fantastic hypothesis, and one that would certainly be worth exploring in the future. Another possibility is that local variation in recombination rate, potentially further reduced by divergence, is involved. Using the Wiuf equation with an extremely rough estimate of recombination rate does not seem to distinguish these two possible causal factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on Figure 3B, haplogroup C differs by only 1 SNP from the second haplotype in group B. Why is C classified as the separate haplogroup instead of a subtype of B?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially separated haplogroup C because the internal four SNPs were in a different orientation then observed in haplogroup A and B, and this orientation was not found to be transpecific. We admit that this was somewhat arbitrary. As it turns out, examination of the assembled sequences indicates that this was the correct decision, this haplogroup was found only in <italic>C. rubella</italic> and is quite diverged from A or B. However, only A and B were clearly transpecific. Because we did not find C in both species, we did not include it in the coverage analysis.</p><p>To improve the clarity of the relationships between haplogroups, we have included C in the phylogeny in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In subsection “Insights into balancing selection from de novo assembly of MLO2”, the authors concluded that the shared haplotypes did not result from recent gene flow, because of similar within-haplotype divergence levels of A and B haplogroups. However, this evidence is insufficient: the authors need to demonstrate that the within-haplogroup divergence is at least as high as the genome-wide average (which seems to be the case by comparing Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to Figure 5D).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to reflect this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reconstructed trees in Figure 6C are very small, and haplotypes need to be labeled in order to show the pattern of clustering by haplogroup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the small trees in Figure 6 make it difficult to clearly show all of the haplotype relationships.
