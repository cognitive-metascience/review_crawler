Despite the clinical benefit of propranolol therapy in hemangioma, the mechanistic understanding of what drives this outcome is limited. Here, we report successful treatment of pericardial edema with propranolol in a patient with Hypotrichosis-Lymphedema-Telangiectasia and Renal (HLTRS) syndrome, caused by a mutation in <italic>SOX18</italic>. Using a mouse pre-clinical model of HLTRS, we show that propranolol treatment rescues its corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype. Dissection of the molecular mechanism identified the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer as a small molecule inhibitor of the SOX18 transcription factor, independent of any anti-adrenergic effect. Lastly, in a patient-derived in vitro model of infantile hemangioma and pre-clinical model of HLTRS we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the R(+) enantiomer. Our work emphasizes the importance of SOX18 etiological role in vascular neoplasms, and suggests R(+)-propranolol repurposing to numerous indications ranging from vascular diseases to metastatic cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>rare disease</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>hemangioma</kwd><kwd>propranolol enantiomer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP 1111169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francois</surname><given-names>Mathias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL096384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bischoff</surname><given-names>Joyce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1107643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francois</surname><given-names>Mathias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer as an inhibitor of the SOX18 transcription factor activity breaks open potential of drug repurposing in vascular diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human mutations in the <italic>SOX18</italic> gene give rise to Hypotrichosis-Lymphedema-Telangiectasia and Renal syndrome (HLTRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irrthum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moalem et al., 2015</xref>). Most disease-causing <italic>SOX18</italic> mutations lead to a premature truncation at the C-terminus due to an early stop codon, producing defective protein products that act in a dominant negative fashion. The mutated SOX18 protein can still bind to chromatin but fails to recruit its protein partner(s) to transactivate target genes, and thereby disrupts the endogenous function of SOX18. Further, the dominant-negative mutant prevents other SOX transcription factors to act redundantly and rescue the molecular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosking et al., 2009</xref>). From birth to adolescence HLTRS patients develop symptoms such as lymphedema and abnormalities to hair and nails for which very limited effective treatment options exist. Patients suffering from HLTRS display a certain level of variability in their phenotypic characteristics with distinct clinical manifestations (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 2018</xref>) that likely depend on the specific type of <italic>SOX18</italic> mutation and how it interferes with SOX18 transcriptional regulation.</p><p>A recent report of an HLTRS patient described symptoms so mild that the initial diagnosis failed to identify this syndrome, mostly due to the absence of lymphedema up until late adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wünnemann et al., 2016</xref>). Eventually, the patient was subjected to whole-exome sequencing, which led to the discovery of a premature stop-codon in <italic>SOX18</italic>, p.Q161*; with such a mutation the patient would be expected to present a severe phenotype. A search for a potential cause of the milder course of the syndrome in this patient revealed that she had been treated with high doses propranolol since a young age due to a significant dilation of the thoracic artery causing a high blood pressure. The milder phenotype observed in this HLTRS patient coincident with the course of the propranolol treatment raised the possibility that this drug has a SOX18-dependent molecular mode of action in addition to its β-blocking activity.</p><p>The main indications for propranolol therapy are hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, migraine and essential tremor. Sensitivity to propranolol does not always correlate with the expression levels of the β-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Powe et al., 2010</xref>). Propranolol use in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy revealed its beneficial effects in infantile hemangioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Léauté-Labrèze et al., 2008</xref>), raising the possibility that β-adrenergic receptor signaling, and thus by inference, propranolol, modulates VEGF levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ozeki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lavine et al., 2013</xref>). Conclusive proof of such a mode of action is still lacking. Further, this drug is a racemic mixture with R(+) and S(-) enantiomers in equal proportions. The S(-) form displays most of the anti-β-adrenergic activity, whereas the R(+) enantiomer is carried over during drug synthesis. This makes the mode of action of propranolol even more elusive since therapeutic outcomes may result from a combination of effects from the two enantiomers.</p><p>In this study, we report an additional case of HLTRS successfully treated with propranolol and describe a R(+) enantiomer-specific mode of action that acts through interference of SOX18 transcriptional activity and thereby functions as an anti-angiogenic agent whereas the S(-) enantiomer does not. This finding paves the way for new therapeutic applications using SOX18 transcription factor as a molecular target in the context of vascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Based on the observation that a previous case of HLTRS may have benefited from a long-term exposure to propranolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wünnemann et al., 2016</xref>), we considered propranolol therapy for another HLTRS patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastaki et al., 2016</xref>) in an attempt to mitigate the severity of his symptoms. The patient was diagnosed with HLTRS at 11 months of age, after presenting with alopecia, edema and telangiectasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastaki et al., 2016</xref>). Exome sequencing revealed that this patient had a truncation mutation in <italic>SOX18</italic> (SOX18 c.492_505dup). In September 2015, at 17 months of age, he developed progressive pericardial effusion over 3 weeks, which required pericardiocentesis. Fluid analysis showed transudate. Two weeks after the procedure, pericardial effusion re-accumulated progressively over 6 weeks, despite strong anti-inflammatory regimens including 3 weeks of oral ibuprofen and 10 days of oral prednisone. Past clinical experience in HLTRS suggested the progression of this pericardial effusion was intractable. The effusion was large enough to cause hemodynamic compromise and to necessitate another pericardiocentesis. After obtaining parental consent, oral propranolol was introduced and increased gradually every 2–3 weeks from 0.8 mg/kg/day in three divided doses to reach a maximum of 4.1 mg/kg/day, as tolerated clinically (pulmonary wheezing). We observed spontaneous and rapid resolution of the pericardial effusion after reaching a dose threshold of 3 mg/kg/day. Bronchial side effects limited the maximal dosing in this patient to 4 mg/kg/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The positive outcome in this second HLTRS patient harboring SOX18 mutation suggested propranolol might act via an alternative pathway than the well characterized β-adrenergic receptor blockade.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43026.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Propranolol treatment alleviates pericardial effusion severity in HLTRS patient and mediates β-adrenergic independent effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 17 months old HLTRS patient was treated with propranolol, starting at 0.8 mg/kg/day in three divided doses and increasing gradually every 2–3 weeks to maximum of 4.1 mg/kg/day (red curve).

Survival of primary placentally-derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC) was measured in presence of increasing concentrations (5–500 μM) of propranolol and specific β1 (Atenolol) and β2 (ICI 118,551) adrenergic-receptor blockers. Results showed that pharmacological inhibition of specific β-adrenergic receptors did not replicate the marked effect propranolol had in the ECFC survival assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To further explore β-adrenergic independent effects of propranolol we knocked down <italic>ADRB2</italic> in a propranolol-sensitive angiosarcoma cell line (ISO-HAS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These results show that the anti-survival and sensitization to chemotherapy activities of propranolol are independent of β-adrenergic receptor expression. Of note, <italic>ADRB1</italic> is expressed at low levels in the angiosarcoma cell line (not shown) but is expressed at higher levels in the SHEP neuroblastoma cell line, where its expression can be reduced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when using a non-endothelial cell type (SHEP neuroblastoma cell line) whereby knock-down of <italic>ADRB1</italic> and <italic>ADRB2</italic> alone or in combination did not affect the ability of propranolol to block the proliferative response and its ability to enhance response to chemo-therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><p>The observation that adrenergic receptors are not required for the cellular response to propranolol combined with the clinical benefit of propranolol treatment in the context of HLTRS suggests that this FDA approved drug may act by directly modulating <italic>SOX18</italic> protein activity .</p><p>Although SOX18 is involved in a variety of patho-physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olbromski et al., 2018</xref>), HLTRS is a rare and severe vascular disorder.

This mouse mutant is considered a murine counterpart of human HLTRS syndrome since it displays the same range of cardio-vascular and hair follicle defects and exhibits the same type of dominant-negative mutation in the <italic>Sox18</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pennisi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Downes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">François et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Villani et al., 2017</xref>).

Because of early postnatal onset of HLTRS defects (between postnatal day (P)8–22), oral treatment with propranolol (25 mg/kg/day), or vehicle PBS, was initiated at P8 and continued daily through to P28. Both wild type and mutant littermates were subjected to identical treatment schemes in order to safeguard consistent maternal feeding and grooming.</p><p>Treatment with propranolol (21 days) did not affect the gross morphological appearance of either wild type or <italic>RaOp</italic> pups, nor did it significantly affect the weight of the <italic>RaOp</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, n = 5–10 mice per group).

SOX18 homodimer and SOX18/RaOp (Q161*) heterodimer formation was measured in absence or presence of propranolol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Propranolol showed a mild efficacy at disrupting SOX18 homodimer and was able to interfere more effectively with the assembly of the non functional SOX18/RaOp protein complex. An effector of the NOTCH signaling pathway (RBPJ) was recently shown to act as a SOX18 protein partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Overman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontaine et al., 2017</xref>).

When using Sm4 as a reference, propranolol was equally effective at disrupting SOX18/RBPJ PPI however not as effective at blocking SOX18 homodimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the same molecular mode of action of propranolol accounts for both the rescue of dominant-negative SOX18 loss of function by disruption of the non-functional SOX18/RaOp (Q161*) complex, and the disruption of functional SOX18 wild type PPIs, namely SOX18/RBPJ and SOX18/SOX18 dimers. In the context of the Ragged heterozygous mutation dominant negative mutation, the rescue process corresponds to the inhibition by propranolol of an inhibitor (RaOp) which in turn results to the partial restoration of the SOX18 wild type active form.</p><p>This novel mode of action of propranolol, independent of its anti-adrenergic effects, prompted us to examine its mechanism of action in infantile hemangiomas, the most common vascular tumor in infancy.

Using this differentiation assay as a read-out, we next evaluated the capacity of propranolol to inhibit the differentiation of HemSCs isolated from four infantile hemangioma patients. The pharmacologic treatments of HemSC included: propranolol, Sm4 (SOX18 small molecule inhibitor), aspirin (a negative control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Overman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontaine et al., 2017</xref>]) compared to vehicle control. Of note, SOX18 has been shown to directly up-regulate <italic>Notch1</italic> transcription via an intronic enhancer during arterial specification in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>), hence transcriptional output of this target gene indirectly reflects <italic>SOX18</italic> activity. Propranolol significantly decreased VEGF-B induced expression of all five endothelial markers in HemSC to levels also achieved by Sm4 as compared to controls (see <italic>p</italic>-values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Propranolol exists as a 1:1 mixture of the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers. The S(-) form displays potent anti-β-adrenergic activity whereas the R(+) enantiomer presents strongly reduced antagonist activity towards β2 adrenergic receptors on peripheral arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoschitzky et al., 1995</xref>). To test whether HemSC were affected by propranolol in a stereoselective manner, we assessed VEGF-B-induced HemSC to HemEC differentiation from two infantile hemangioma in the presence of separated enantiomers.</p><p>The R(+) enantiomer recapitulated propranolol and Sm4-induced inhibition on all markers, whereas the S(-) enantiomer showed only weak or no inhibition on hemangioma markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These results are consistent with a SOX18-dependent, β-adrenergic receptor independent blockade of hemangioma endothelial differentiation, which strongly suggests that blockade of SOX18 activity is the main mode of action of propranolol in this setting. Further, analysis of VEGF-R2 expression and phosphorylation levels in ECFC and HemSC to EC differentiation assay ruled out that the propranolol racemic mixture, the R(+) enantiomer or Sm4 interfere with the VEGF signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>).</p><p>As a final demonstration of the therapeutic utility of the R(+) enantiomer we performed a corneal neo-vascularisation rescue assay using the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> mutant mouse model. In this in vivo setting both propranolol and the R(+) enantiomer prevented aberrant vessel growth in the corneal tissue of the heterozygous mutant animals. Of note the S(-) enantiomer was also active at disrupting corneal vessel outgrowth, suggesting that conformational changes that occur in the SOX18 mutated protein may attenuate the discrepancy in enantiomeric activities previously observed in the hemangioma endothelial differentiation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate whether propranolol treatment might improve the morphogenesis defects of other vascular beds, we analysed the patterning of the lymphatic vasculature in the ear skin tissue of the adult <italic>RaOp</italic> animals. As previously reported the <italic>RaOp</italic> mouse presented with a highly disorganized lymphatic vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">François et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, top graph). In the skin, neither the propranolol racemic mixture nor its enantiomers rescued the lymphatic vascular phenotype caused by the <italic>RaOp</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>); this is most likely due to the post-natal timing of the treatment: lymphatic vascular defects are acquired in the <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant during the initial steps of embryonic lymphangiogenesis (early to mid-organogenesis), which precedes the drug treatment window.</p><p>In summary, we suggest the R(+) enantiomer of propranolol is a potent selective inhibitor of SOX18 activity and it is sufficient to achieve the effects of propranolol racemic mixture in the context of infantile hemangioma and other SOX18-dependent vascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite being the front line therapy for infantile hemangioma, approximately 20% of the patient population fails to respond to propranolol treatment and/or experience tumor regrowth when the medication is discontinued too early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagazgoitia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). Our finding opens up new treatment options using enantiopure R(+) propranolol instead of the racemic mixture. This could potentially allow a dose adjustment to achieve optimal benefit for the patients while mitigating adverse events that may result from long-term propranolol treatment, particularly in the refractory population of patients that currently do not respond to the highest dose of propranolol. In addition, the side effects associated with long-term exposure to propranolol could be greatly reduced if β-adrenergic receptors blockage would be minimized.</p><p>This discovery is of broad interest because propranolol, comprised of 2 enantiomers, has been used clinically for decades. Clinical trials of the R(+) versus the S(-) form have been performed and deemed safe with full toxicology data available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stensrud and Sjaastad, 1976</xref>). Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that propranolol therapy results in an accumulation of the S(-) enantiomer following drug metabolism, which could be problematic if one is interested in the activity of the R(+) form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mehvar and Brocks, 2001</xref>). Indeed toxicology studies further suggest that propranolol in its racemic form is more toxic than either enantiomer alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoschitzky et al., 1992</xref>). This study presents indirect evidence that in a HLTRS patient treated with propranolol, SOX18 wild type function is at least partly restored. The observation that the S(-) enantiomer also has the capability to rescue the corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype in a pre-clinical model of HTLRS suggests that the effects of propranolol as a racemic mixture are likely to be a combination of the blockade of beta-adrenergic receptor activity and SOX18 RaOp mutant protein inhibition. Of importance, in the hemangioma HemSC-EC differentiation assay the R(+) enantiomer was as efficient as propranolol and more efficient than the S (-) enantiomer at blocking this differentiation process. This may suggest that the SOX18 wild type protein blockade displays some enantio-selectivity, whereas conformational changes in the SOX18/RaOp complex caused by the RaOp mutation sensitize the dominant-negative protein complex to both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers.</p><p>The studies in human patients with HLTRS and the murine <italic>RaOP</italic> model suggest that there may be critical time windows in which treatment with R(+) propranolol would be most efficient as an anti-angiogenic compound via a blockade of SOX18 transcriptional activity.</p><p>The low number of patients with HLTRS – less than 10 documented survivors have been reported – makes it difficult to establish genotype-phenotype relationships in greater detail. In contrast, the unambiguous phenotypic rescue by propranolol racemic mixture in two human patients and by the R(+) enantiomer in the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> mouse model is strongly supported by our in vitro mechanistic results. Our findings outline that the R(+) enantiomer is a SOX18 small molecule inhibitor with weak anti-beta adrenergic activity whereas the S(-) molecule is both a beta-blocker and a weak SOX18 inhibitor which introduces variability in net efficacy of propranolol treatment.</p><p>The strong monogenic effect of human SOX18 mutations and their rescue with propranolol allowed us to identify its mode of action.

They also demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer in a patient-derived in vitro model of infantile hemangioma. The hypothesis tested in the study is intriguing and might be clinically relevant with potential therapeutic implications for pathologies involving SOX18 mutations and/or aberrant vascular growth, such as infantile hemangioma. Therefore, I would like to support the publication of this work after addressing the following points.</p><p>1) The authors suggest that the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer directly inhibits the transcriptional activity of SOX18 and thereby functions as an anti-angiogenic agent. However, the authors also demonstrate that propranolol restores SOX18 functionality in a dose-dependent manner, which is demonstrated by Vcam1 (SOX18 target) promoter luciferase assay (Figure 2B). This particular aspect seems counterintuitive. Considering that SOX18 mutations in hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia and renal syndrome (HLTRS) act in a dominant-negative manner by impairing SOX18 function, please clearly address whether and how the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer restores or inhibits SOX18 function.</p><p>2) Could the authors check the protein expression of SOX18 in infantile hemangioma tissue samples or in cell populations derived from infantile hemangioma before and/or after treatment with propranolol to test its beneficial effect in these circumstances?</p><p>3) The authors demonstrated that the propranolol treatment in a patient with HLTRS dramatically improved pericardial effusion (Figure 1A-B). This change might have resulted secondarily from the process caused by SOX18 mutation (possibly including lymphedema, and/or renal syndrome), as the primary pericardial effusion itself is a relatively rare disease entity (Imazio et al., Nature Review Cardiology, 2009). Does the HLTRS patient have improvements in symptoms other than pericardial effusion, which might be directly related to HLTRS (e.g. telangiectasia, lymphedema) after propranolol treatment rather than pericardial effusion alone? Furthermore, if the mechanism of action of propranolol in the patient with SOX18 mutation is independent of anti-β-adrenergic activity as the authors suggested, how was the heart function of the patient, including tamponade physiology, improved? Is there any direct or indirect evidence to suggest that SOX18 function is restored or at least altered with propranolol treatment in this patient? These issues might need to be discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that propranolol inhibits SOX18 activity during VEGF-B-induced differentiation of hemangioma-derived stem cells (HemSC) into the hemangioma endothelial cells (HemECs). Could the authors verify that there is no change in SOX18 activity with β-adrenergic agonist treatment to support their claim that the effect of propranolol on SOX18 is independent of a β-adrenergic mechanism?</p><p>5) Does propranolol rescue only the aberrant vessel growth in Sox18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mouse cornea? Or also in other tissues such as skin, as the hypotrichosis and infantile hemangioma usually involves and grows on the skin surface.</p><p>6) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, the authors demonstrate the lymphatic vessel outgrowth (Neuropillin-2 and Prox1) in corneal whole-mount staining of Sox18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mice. This data is not mentioned in the main text although it is demonstrated in the supplemental figure and its legend. Why do the cornea lymphatic vessels outgrow in Sox18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mice?</p><p>7) Does the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer modulate VEGFR2 levels or its phosphorylation upon VEGF-A stimulation? This should be easily testable as the authors already have the cell lines, and this might partly explain and support the regression of infantile hemangioma by propranolol treatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I have read the manuscript from Overman et al. with great interest. It is very interesting to get an insight into how some of these genetic defects can possibly be overcome using various forms of drugs. Overall, I think this manuscript represents a solid piece of work and I do not have any major comments except that it would be nice if the discussion had been a bit more comprehensive. For example, the authors mention that the propranolol increased the mean weight of the wild type mice, but not of the <italic>RaOp</italic> mice. Why is that?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The key message of this study is that the block of Sox18 is a main 'mechanism of action' of propranolol in treating HLTRS and infantile hemangioma. Several experiments support this conclusion, but insufficiently.</p><p>1) Abnormal SOX18 protein derived from mutation in a patient can affect downstream broadly. Thus, it is difficult to judge targets of propranolol in a HLTRS patient. The <italic>RaOp</italic> mouse model has same issue, too.</p><p>2) Although both HLTRS and RaOp have mutations in Sox18, phenotypes focused in this study are different: pericardial edema in HLTRS and corneal angiogenesis in RaOp. They seem to be far away for comparison. In addition, the dose of propranolol for a HLTLS patient was 4 mg/kg/day while that for <italic>RaOp</italic> mice was 25 mg/kg/day (with an increasing potential of non-selective effects).</p><p>3) Use of the R(+) enantiomer of propranolol was suggested to preclude β-adrenergic-dependent blocking activity. However, the R(+) enantiomer was not used in the assessment of corneal neo-vascularisation.</p><p>4) Similarly, differentiation of hemangioma stem cells into endothelial cells relies on many factors including all SoxF members but not Sox18 alone. Downregulated genes by propranolol are representative endothelial markers rather than Sox18 targets (Figure 3C). Altogether, there may be a possibility that propranolol plays a role in a Sox18-independent manner. Additional experiments using other non-selective β-adrenergic blockers such as carvedilol may support the conclusions.</p><p>5) Some in vitro experiments appear to lack a physiologic link to in vivo and patient data.</p><p>– There was no link to Sox18 function in cell assays shown in Figures 1C and ID.</p><p>– The cell systems used in Figures 2B and 2C may be different from lymphatic or hemangioma cells.</p><p>– In the present manuscript, only numbers are presented without additional help on ALPHAScreen assay and it is very difficult to figure out how reliable the data of protein-protein interactions in the bar graph are.</p><p>– Sox18 protein increased luciferase activity by two-fold in the assay in Figure 2B. This extent of enhanced activity, in general, is not enough to prove binding of transcription factors to their target regions, raising a concern whether the Vcam-1 promoter region used in Figure 2B is a convincing target region of Sox18 in this context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43026.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We encourage the authors to do additional experiments to address the comments raised by reviewer 1 (comments 4, 5 and 7) and reviewer 3 (comment 2).

In the context of a transcription-based assay (Figure 2B) SOX18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant protein is a potent repressor of SOX18 activity (even up to a 30wt/1RaOp ratio), this causes the loss of Vcam1 transactivation (Figure 2B). SOX18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant protein acts by “poisoning functional SOX18 protein complexes” by forming SOX18-RaOp dimers.

This result is expected because both inhibitors block HemSC-EC differentiation (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and therefore decrease the total number of mature ECs. We normalised the data relative to a pan-endothelial cell marker such as CD31 (Panel B), to account for the bias introduced by the lack of endothelial cells differentiation.

With the current amount of scientific evidence we cannot conclude that in HLTRS the effects are mediated via a partial restoration of SOX18 function only.

In four biological replicates with HemSC isolated from three different infantile hemangioma specimens, we did not detect a significant increase in VE-cadherin, NOTCH1 or SOX18 in isoproterenol-treated cells compared to DMSO (vehicle)-treated cells. Propranolol caused a significant decreased in VE-cadherin, NOTCH1 and SOX18 transcripts; p values &lt;0.05 (consistent with Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.)

Why do the cornea lymphatic vessels outgrow in Sox18 RaOp mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The molecular mechanism that underpins vascular outgrowth in the cornea for both blood and lymphatic vessels remains unclear. Since most causes of corneal neo-vascularisation (CNV) are indeed VEGF-dependent, and some are successfully treated with anti-VEGF based therapies, we decided to focus on the potential contribution of augmented VEGF signalling to the invasion of blood vessel into the <italic>Sox18<sup>RaOp</sup></italic> corneas. In the context of CNV, <italic>Flt1</italic> is of particular interest, as the balance of distinct isoforms of this protein has been shown to be of key importance in maintaining corneal avascularity (Ambati et al., 2006). The pro- or anti-angiogenic activity of FLT1 is highly dependent on the particular splice variant that is produced (Kearney et al., 2004, Ferrara et al., 2003, Claesson-Welsh, 2016). The shorter isoform sFLT is released into the extracellular matrix to sequester endogenous pro-angiogenic VEGF-A, preventing the activation of FLT1 and VEGFR2 receptors and any downstream cellular response. Deficiency of sFLT in the cornea has been shown to be causative for CNV (Ambati et al., 2006). Further, we have recently shown that FLT1 is a potential direct target gene of SOX18 dimer complex (Moustaqil et al., NAR 2018). This observation prompted us to investigate FLT1 expression levels in the <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant mouse.</p><p>In order to identify whether VEGF pathway is dysregulated in the tissue of the mutant animals we have performed qPCR analysis for VEGF receptors and soluble receptors on the whole cornea of wild type and mutant animals at different time points (8weeks, P12weeks, P16weeks). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>. To distinguish between the different splice variants that give rise to either the full length FLT1 receptors or soluble FLT1 (sFLT1), we designed primers to specifically amplify the following regions:</p><p>‘<italic>Flt1 (extra)’</italic>, extracellular domain that is present in both full length FLT1 and sFLT1;</p><p>‘<italic>Flt1 (intra)’</italic>, intracellular domain that is only present in full length FLT1;</p><p>‘<italic>sFlt1’</italic>, unique 3’end of exon 12 and 3’UTR only present on the <italic>sFlt1</italic> transcript</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Whole corneas were harvested from 8, 12 and 16 week old mice and prepared for qRT-PCR analysis.</title><p>Gene transcripts for <italic>Pecam, Flt1, Vegfr2</italic> and <italic>Foxc</italic> were normalized to either housekeeper gene Rpl13 (top row) or vascular gene Pecam (bottom row) to normalize for total amount of endothelial cells (EC). <italic>SOX18<sup>RaOp</sup></italic> mice at 8 weeks of age had increased levels of <italic>Pecam</italic>, indicating an increase in ECs, and increased levels of the transcripts corresponding to the extracellular domain of the Flt1 receptor (<italic>Flt1</italic>-extra), the intracellular domain (<italic>Flt1</italic>-inra) and the exclusively soluble variant of <italic>Flt1 (sFlt1</italic>). * P-value ≤ 0.05, Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test.

At this stage, the amount of total <italic>Flt1 (Flt1</italic> extra) in the <italic>Sox18<sup>RaOp</sup></italic> corneas was 4.6 fold higher than in the wild type (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). This is partly explained by the fact that these corneas are covered in blood vessels, and the increased amount of endothelial cells contributes to the induction of <italic>Flt1</italic> over the whole tissue. However, the increase in <italic>Pecam</italic> transcript levels – representing the increase in endothelial cells – is much lower than that of <italic>Flt</italic> (2 fold). In order to compensate for the increase in endothelial cells, we normalized the <italic>Flt1</italic> transcript levels to <italic>Pecam</italic> levels, which makes it evident that total <italic>Flt1</italic> increased disproportionality to the amount endothelial cells (2.0 fold, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Although total <italic>Flt1</italic> is upregulated in the corneas of <italic>SOX18<sup>RaOp</sup></italic> mice, <italic>sFlt1</italic> levels are unchanged regardless of the amount of vascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the ratio between the amounts of full length FLT1 and sFLT1 in the cornea shifted in favour of the full-length isoform. Transcript levels for <italic>Vegfr2</italic> were not significantly different between wild types and mutants at 8 weeks. Since FLT1, VEGFR2 and sFLT1 all compete for the same pool of VEGF-A, the shift in <italic>Flt1</italic> isoforms could explain the corneal phenotype. However, whether exactly this is causative for the penetration of vessels into the cornea of <italic>Sox18<sup>RaOp</sup></italic> mice, and whether SOX18 is directly involved in regulating the balance between <italic>Flt1/sFlt1</italic>, is uncertain at this stage.</p><p>Of note FOXC1 levels remains unchanged; we tested for this gene expression level since loss of this transcription factor function has been shown to cause corneal neo-vascularisation (Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome) (Mears et al. Am j Hum Genet 1998)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Does the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer modulate VEGFR2 levels or its phosphorylation upon VEGF-A stimulation? This should be easily testable as the authors already have the cell lines, and this might partly explain and support the regression of infantile hemangioma by propranolol treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this question with three experiments.</p><p>In panel A, normal human ECFCs were pre-treated for 1 hour with propranolol, R+ enantiomer or S-enantiomer (each tested at 5μM) and then stimulated for 5 minutes with VEGF-A. Cells were lysed and analysed for phosphorylated VEGFR2 and total VEGFR2 by Western blotting. The drug treatments had no effect on levels of VEGFR2 or levels of VEGF-A-stimulated phosphorylation. The same results were seen when drug pre-treatment was carried out for 16 hours (not shown).</p><p>In Panel B, HemSC were induced to undergo endothelial differentiation with VEGF-B for 5 days, then pre-treated with propranolol, R+ enantiomer or S-enantiomer for 1 hour and next stimulated with VEGF-A for 5 minutes. Western blotting for VEGFR2 shows the drug treatments had no effect on VEGFR2 levels; the same results were seen with HemSC isolated from two different IH.</p><p>In Panel C, the same experiment was performed and VEGFR2 was immunoprecipitated to increase detection of phosphorylated VEGFR2. Drug pre-treatment had no effect on phosphor-VEGFR2 levels. The lack of VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is consistent with previous reports wherein VEGFR2 is primarily intracellular in HemSC (Khan et al., 2008) and is constitutively phosphorylated in HemEC (Jinnin et al., Nat Med 2008). In summary, we did not observe any changes to VEGFR2 protein levels or its phosphorylation upon R-enantiomer, propranolol or S-enantiomer treatment. This is now shown in the manuscript as Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I have read the manuscript from Overman et al. with great interest. It is very interesting to get an insight into how some of these genetic defects can possibly be overcome using various forms of drugs. Overall, I think this manuscript represents a solid piece of work and I do not have any major comments except that it would be nice if the discussion had been a bit more comprehensive. For example, the authors mention that the propranolol increased the mean weight of the wild type mice, but not of the RaOp mice. Why is that?</p></disp-quote><p>One of the phenotypes of the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> mutant is a complete lack of sub-cutaneous fat (Francois et al unpublished). The absence of adipose tissue makes it impossible for adipocytes to respond to a beta-adrenergic treatment.</p><p>It is for this particular reason that we think the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> is not gaining weight under propranolol treatment. The adipose tissue phenotype, currently under investigation, is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The key message of this study is that the block of Sox18 is a main 'mechanism of action' of propranolol in treating HLTRS and infantile hemangioma. Several experiments support this conclusion, but insufficiently.</p><p>1) Abnormal SOX18 protein derived from mutation in a patient can affect downstream broadly. Thus, it is difficult to judge targets of propranolol in a HLTRS patient. The RaOp mouse model has same issue, too.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern is directed to the in vivo data analysis of propranolol treatment. On the other hand, our data from in vitro and cellular assays shows strongly that propranolol mode of action is mediated via a SOX18-dependent mechanism.</p><p>The recent description of the molecular function of the SOX18 homodimer in the context of endothelial cell differentiation (Moustaqil et al. NAR 2018) is an important piece of information. Here we show that the <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant protein has the capability to recruit SOX18 wild type protein and therefore interfere with the endothelial specific signature of SOX18 wild type homodimer.</p><p>Further, in this study we show that use of specific β adrenergic blockers or loss of β-adrenergic receptors does not affect ECFC or cancer cell line survival. As a final demonstration of a role of SOX18-mediated mode of action in vivo we now show that treatment with the R-enantiomer of propranolol (low to no anti-β adrenergic activity) is able to rescue the corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although both HLTRS and RaOp have mutations in Sox18, phenotypes focused in this study are different: pericardial edema in HLTRS and corneal angiogenesis in RaOp. They seem to be far away for comparison. In addition, the dose of propranolol for a HLTLS patient was 4 mg/kg/day while that for RaOp mice was 25 mg/kg/day (with an increasing potential of non-selective effects).</p></disp-quote><p>The point of using the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> mouse model experiment is to show on target engagement by rescuing a phenotype which relies on the activity of the SOX18 mutant protein. We agree that the readout in human is different, but in this particular case the decision to pharmacologically manage a new HLTRS case with propranolol was guided by the results obtained from pre-clinical data. This provided a therapeutic option where none was available before.</p><p>The choice of the dosage was originally guided by our experience in vivo in mice using Sm4 (SOX18 small molecule inhibitor) which we have shown is a potent anti-metastatic compound at 25mg/kg/day in pre-clinical model of breast cancer (Overman et al eLife 2017).</p><p>Of note we have shown efficacy of Sm4 at lower concentration in a dose dependent manner (from 5 to 50mg/Kg/day, unpublished data). This suggests that the patient treated with low dose of propranolol (4mg/Kg/day) has received a dose of small molecule inhibitor that is able to block SOX18 activity.</p><p>In the <italic>Ragged Opossum</italic> in vivo experiment we aimed at a maximum tolerated dose to get the best rescuing effect possible in turn translating into an obvious phenotypic rescue. The concentration scouting is a great suggestion but is not necessary as all in vitro data show concentration dependence and that the main goal of the rescuing approach is to show selective on-target engagement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Use of the R(+) enantiomer of propranolol was suggested to preclude β-adrenergic-dependent blocking activity. However, the R(+) enantiomer was not used in the assessment of corneal neo-vascularisation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now assessed the effect of the R(+) enantiomer in vivo in a rescue experiment of the corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype in the <italic>Ragged Opossum (RaOp</italic>) mouse model. These results are now included in the manuscript as a supplemental figure to Figure 3.</p><p>In short, the R(+) enantiomer has the ability to rescue the corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype of the <italic>RaOp</italic> heterozygous mouse. Further, we have also tested the S(-) enantiomer in the same model system. Interestingly it seems that this compound has the potential to rescue the phenotype albeit to a lesser extent. This results suggests that both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers have the capability to inhibit the SOX18 <italic>RaOp</italic> mutant protein activity. This is most likely by disturbing the SOX18/SOX18RaOp or the RBPJ/SOX18RaOp protein-protein interactions as shown by our in vitro assays. Of importance, in the hemangioma hemSC-EC differentiation assay the R(+) enantiomer was as efficient as propranolol in halting this differentiation process, whereas the S(-) enantiomer showed a weak inhibitory response, suggesting an enantiomer selective blockade of the SOX18 wild type protein mediated by the R(+) enantiomer.</p><p>Because of the weak activity of the S(-)enantiomer, we have revised the title of our manuscript to reflect accurately the key finding of this study: <italic>“R-propranolol is a small molecule inhibitor of the SOX18 transcription factor in a rare vascular syndrome and hemangioma.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, differentiation of hemangioma stem cells into endothelial cells relies on many factors including all SoxF members but not Sox18 alone. Downregulated genes by propranolol are representative endothelial markers rather than Sox18 targets (Figure 3C). Altogether, there may be a possibility that propranolol plays a role in a Sox18-independent manner. Additional experiments using other non-selective β-adrenergic blockers such as carvedilol may support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test additional non-selective β-adrenergic blockers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some in vitro experiments appear to lack a physiologic link to in vivo and patient data.</p><p>– There was no link to Sox18 function in cell assays shown in Figures 1C and ID.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of experiments shown in Figure 1C and 1D is to show that propranolol acts has a mode of action which is at least in part independent to β-adrenergic receptors.
