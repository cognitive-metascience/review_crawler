In accordance, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-null mice die at mid-gestation with failed development of multiple mesenchymal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soriano, 1997</xref>). Conditional inactivation of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in the lung mesenchyme at a later time during embryogenesis led to simplified alveoli, suggesting that it is essential for septal ridge formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGowan and McCoy, 2014</xref>). In the adult lungs, <italic>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup></italic> cells have been described to be in close proximity to alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), and are implicated as niche for AEC2s by way of supporting their proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies further defined the <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells as niche for the subset of AEC2s that are especially primed as progenitors in repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nabhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zepp et al., 2017</xref>). Aberrant PDGFRA activity have been linked to a large number of diseases, including adult diseases such as fibrosis and cancer, and pediatric diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nannini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olson and Soriano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Popova et al., 2014</xref>). These data support that <italic>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup></italic> cells and PDGFRA function in these cells are of key importance in the development, homeostasis and pathogenesis of the mesenchyme.</p><p>In the lungs, the term ‘myofibroblasts’ has been used to define alveolar cells that express smooth muscle markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, encoded by <italic>Actin alpha two</italic> or <italic>Acta2</italic> gene), or smooth muscle 22a (SM22a, encoded by <italic>Transgelin</italic> or <italic>Tagln</italic> gene). While lung myofibroblasts most commonly referred to cells in patients with adult diseases such as fibrosis, smooth muscle marker-positive alveolar cells are also found in patients with prematurity related neonatal diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Moreover, they are found in normal lungs during maturation. In normal mouse lungs, myofibroblasts are mostly found in the neonatal period, between postnatal day (P) three and P13, in the first phase of alveologenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGowan et al., 2008</xref>). After P14, a-SMA and SM22a expression in the alveolar region is drastically reduced to near baseline levels, continuing into the adult. Thus, in the normal lung, the term ‘myofibroblasts’ refers to the population of cells that are transiently expressing a-SMA+ and SM22a+ during the process of alveologenesis when secondary septae or crests form. For this reason, they have also been referred to as secondary crest myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>). However, in pathological settings, such as in BPD and neonatal hyperoxia mouse model of BPD, smooth muscle markers continue to be detected in the alveolar region, indicating persistence of myofibroblasts. In the adult lung fibrosis and bleomycin mouse model of fibrosis, smooth muscle markers return in the alveolar region, either from re-expression of these markers in cells that used to express them, or from de novo expression in cells that were never myofibroblasts. The cellular relationship as well as molecular similarities among these three types of myofibroblasts have not been defined. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamic nature of normal myofibroblasts may inform how we can convert fibrotic myofibroblasts into non-fibrotic lung mesenchymal cells.</p><p>In the normal lungs during alveologenesis, using a BAC transgenic <italic>Pdgfra-creERT2</italic> line in lineage tracing, it was reported that <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells give rise to both myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts, with a slight bias towards more lipofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntokou et al., 2015</xref>). At this early postnatal stage, myofibroblasts are found to underline nascent septal ridges, suggesting that they may be important for septae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>). They also deposit extracellular matrix, such as elastin, which provides the lungs with its elasticity and tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Toshima et al., 2004</xref>). In comparison, lipofibroblasts are characterized by their lipid-filled vesicles, and expression of markers such as Perilipin 2 (PLIN2, also known as ADRP). In addition to <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells, it has also been shown that <italic>Tbx4</italic> and <italic>FGF10</italic> expressing cells of the distal lung can give rise to lipofibroblasts during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El Agha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In the adult lungs, using the BAC transgenic <italic>Pdgfra-creERT2</italic> line, it was shown that lineaged cells do contribute to fibrotic myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zepp et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, other cell lineages, for example, <italic>Adrp</italic>-expressing lipofibroblasts can also contribute to fibrotic myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Agha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we addressed the relationship between <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells and the three types of myofibroblasts by generating a novel <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin mouse line using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This line faithfully labeled <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells. In normal development, we found that <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells give rise primarily to alveolar myofibroblasts and very few lipofibroblasts, counter to previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntokou et al., 2015</xref>). In the two models of lung diseases, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells showed substantial contribution to myofibroblasts in the bleomycin model of fibrosis, but not in the hyperoxia model of BPD. These findings demonstrate that the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells have distinct lineage potential in different settings, and make distinct contribution to the three types of myofibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient generation of the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin line using CRISPR/Cas9</title><p>To generate <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> line, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and designed a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting a site in the first intron of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>. This is the same insertion site as in the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> line, which is frequently used as a reporter of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamilton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGowan and McCoy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGowan and McCoy, 2015</xref>). We chose to generate an rtTA knockin line rather than a creERT2 knockin line for two reasons. First, rtTA is activated by doxycycline which does not induce the frequent abortion observed with prenatal administration of tamoxifen that is needed to induce creERT2. Second, rtTA can be used to turn on/off transgene expression dynamically, while creERT2 acts through DNA re-arrangements that are not reversible. A double-stranded donor plasmid was generated that contains a splicing acceptor (SA), rtTA and triple polyadenylation sequence (3 PA), with ~1.5 kb homologous arms on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Coinjection of CAS9 protein, gRNA and donor plasmid yielded 23 pups. Among them, two had the identical correct rtTA insertion through homologous recombination. Initial characterization indicated that the two lines behaved similarly. Thus, we used one of the two lines for all following experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36865.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knock-in mouse line using CRISPR/Cas9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic overview of the strategy for generating the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knock-in allele.

Doxycycline (dox) administration started at embryonic day (E) 9.5 and continued on to postnatal day (P) 7, the peak of alveologenesis, when the activity was analyzed.

This observation raised the question of whether the loss of myofibroblast markers is due to myofibroblast cell death or their downregulation of smooth muscle characteristics. Since <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells give rise primarily to myofibroblasts as demonstrated above, we asked whether the tdTomato+ cells simply disappeared, or survived but turned off SM22a expression.

Using the novel knockin <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> line, we were able to precisely capture <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression and rigorously interrogate the in vivo lineage of these cells. Our findings using this line revealed that these cells show distinct potential in giving rise to the different types of myofibroblasts through development and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36865.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model illustrating the lineage potential of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells in development and pathogenesis.</title><p>In normal development (black notes), <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells give rise primarily to myofibroblasts, and minimally to lipofibroblasts and endothelial cells.

This differs from the results from a recent lineage tracing study using a <italic>Pdgfra-CreERT2</italic> BAC transgenic line, which showed that lineaged cells gave rise to more lipofibroblasts than myofibroblasts at the same stage (P7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntokou et al., 2015</xref>). The difference of the results may be due to differences in the cell populations that are captured by the knock-in line versus the transgenic line. Despite being a BAC transgenic line, it may not recapitulate endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression because it may be missing some required remote regulatory sequences, or it may be influenced by enhancers near the random transgenic insertion site. Conversely, the difference could be due to that our <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin line is missing one copy of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and thereby deficient in some aspects of lineage contribution. However, there is no notable phenotype in the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> heterozygotes to indicate haploinsufficiency. In addition, conditional <italic>Pdgfra</italic> loss-of-function mutants show decreased myofibroblasts and maintenance of lipofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGowan and McCoy, 2014</xref>). Thus, if there is any undetected happloinsufficiency in our <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin line, the prediction would be a lower lineage contribution to myofibroblasts compared to the BAC transgenic line, opposite to the data shown. Interestingly, ~4% of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells give rise to pulmonary endothelial cells in prenatal tracing but not in postnatal tracing. This is consistent with previous result showing that lung endothelial cells can be labeled by <italic>Tbx4-rtTA</italic> lineage tracing in the early stages but not late stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Using our knockin line, lineage tracing into the early adult at P40 showed that <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells persist. However, they no longer express myofibroblast markers, since a vast majority of lung mesenchymal cells has turned down myofibroblast and lipofibroblast marker expression. Short of the identification of a differentiation marker that distinguished them from others, it appears that the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells may have de-differentiated to a non-descriptive, resting mesenchymal cell state. This dynamic change of cellular characteristics is distinct from the behavior of epithelial cells, where differentiated cells rarely de-differentiate unless following severe injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our scRNAseq data are consistent with lineage tracing data, and further add to the resolution of sub-populations within <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells. At P7, a majority of the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells expressed myofibroblast markers while a minority expressed lipofibroblast marker. Cluster 1, with higher density of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells, are more enriched for myofibroblast markers. In comparison, cluster 2, with lower density of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells, are more enriched for lipofibroblast markers. This result is consistent with prior finding from the McGowan group showing that the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-high cells have myofibroblast characteristics, while the Pdgfra-low cells have lipofibroblast characteristics. Comparing P15 to P7, the cluster with cell proliferation signature disappeared and the expression of myofibroblast markers are much reduced, consistent with prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kimani et al., 2009</xref>). One cluster that persisted at both stages is enriched for matrix-associated genes. It remains to be determined how this population compares to the previously described matrix-fibroblasts from the adult lung, as distinct matrix markers are displayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless, it is of interest that during the two phases of alveologenesis as represented by P7 and P15, there remains a small <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ subpopulation that shows enriched matrix gene expression.</p><p>Data from the fibrosis model indicate that the adult <italic>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, while having lost their myofibroblast marker expression, are still capable of becoming myofibroblasts by turning on SM22a expression under injury. They also retained the ability to proliferate, which led to population expansion after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zepp et al., 2017</xref>). These <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells are not the only source of pathological myofibroblasts in fibrosis. For example, a recent study showed that <italic>Plin2</italic>-lineaged lipofibroblasts can also give rise to a-SMA+ cells in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Agha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the fibrosis model, in the neonatal hyperoxia model of BPD, our data showed that the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells do not contribute significantly to myofibroblasts. This is unexpected as neonatal hyperoxia treatment occurred at the early postnatal stage when the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells normally contribute to myofibroblasts. Our findings showed that under hyperoxia, however, a majority of lineaged cells were lost, presumably through cell death, thereby unable to contribute to myofibroblasts. Yet, other cells differentiate into myofibroblasts. The result that lipofibroblasts were reduced in number, coupled with in vitro data that hyperoxia can drive cultured lung mesenchymal cells to preferentially adopt myofibroblast fate instead of lipofibroblast fate, raised the possibility that the lipofibroblasts may transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts in the neonatal hyperoxia model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rehan and Torday, 2003</xref>). This possibility remains to be tested through lineage tracing of lipofibroblasts. Recently, a <italic>Plin2</italic> (<italic>Adrp</italic>)<italic><sup>creERT2</sup></italic> line was generated to label lipofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Agha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ntokou et al., 2017</xref>). However, it also labels a number of other cell types in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Agha et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, generation of a genetic tool that specifically labels lipofibroblasts will be critical to address the potential of these cells in development and injury.</p><p>Considering the three types of myofibroblasts in lung: the normal secondary crest myofibroblasts, adult fibrotic myofibroblasts, and BPD myofibroblasts, our data substantiate the notion that not all myofibroblasts are created equal. In terms of their origins, they have different contributions from <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells. Furthermore, our data support that the smooth muscle marker positive state may be a transient characteristic rather than a stable cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This transient nature is not only a feature in development, but it also occurs in disease settings. For example, in fibrosis model, it has been shown that a-SMA+ cells can revert to lipofibroblasts, which contributes to resolution of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Agha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A number of recent studies have used transcriptome, lineage tracing and epithelium-mesenchyme organoid approaches to determine the complexity of the lung mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lechner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zepp et al., 2017</xref>). For examples, genes that are WNT reporters such as <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Lgr6</italic>, and <italic>Axin2</italic>, or HH reporter such as <italic>Gli1</italic> have been used to lineage trace cell fate in the mesenchyme in both baseline as well as in injury settings. A next challenge is to compare the different lineaged populations to define the similarities and differences, and be able to comprehensively illustrate the complexity of the mesenchyme.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>REAGENT or <break/>RESOURCE</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(mouse)</td><td><italic>tetO-GFP,</italic> <break/>mix background</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>016836</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(mouse)</td><td><italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> <break/>, mix background</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>007669</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(mouse)</td><td><italic>tetO-Cre,</italic> <break/>B6 background</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>006234</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(mouse)</td><td><italic>Rosa-tdTomato,</italic> <break/>B6 background</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>007914</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(mouse)</td><td><italic>Rosa-Dta,</italic> <break/>mix background</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>006331</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Elastin</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab21600, <break/>1:500</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>SM22a</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab14106, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>ADRP</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab52356, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>ERG</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab92513, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>ICAM2</td><td>BD</td><td>553325, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Ki67</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab15580, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>a-SMA</td><td>Sigma</td><td>F3777, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti <break/>rabbit FITC</td><td>Jackson Immuno <break/>Research Laboratories</td><td>111-095-144, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti <break/>rabbit Cy3</td><td>Jackson Immuno <break/>Research Laboratories</td><td>111-165-144, <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti <break/>rat FITC</td><td>Jackson Immuno <break/>Research Laboratories</td><td>112-095-003 <break/>1:200</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>To generate <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin mouse strain, 5’-GAGACAGTAATTGAGGATCCTGG-3’ was designed to target a PAM site in the first intron of the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> gene.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Pdgfra</italic> Marks a Cellular Lineage with Dynamic Contributions to Myofibroblasts in Lung Maturation and Injury Response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your work carefully describes the generation and initial characterization of a new <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> mouse line which you have used to assess lineage relationships in the developing and adult mouse lung. All three reviewers felt that your study had merit but noted important weakness that required additional experimental clarification. Three major issues were noted by the reviewers: 1) a better characterization of the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> mouse line as it pertains to fidelity of endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression during lung development and in the adult is required and should include quantification of the number of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expressing cells at the stages examined; 2) the relationship between <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expressing cells, as noted by the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> mouse line, and other mesenchymal populations including SM22a expressing myofibroblasts and ADRP expressing fibroblasts is important to define with additional experimentation; and 3) the need to use additional markers for myofibroblasts beyond SM22a given the variable definition of this cell type. Additional review points should also be addressed as noted.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This report describes the generation of a new <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> line which the authors have used to perform cell lineage tracing experiments in mice. The <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> mice appear to mark a similar (although not proven) subset of cells that the <italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> knockin mice do. During development, <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> mice mark a significant proportion of lung mesenchyme and depletion of <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells during alveologenesis causes an emphysema like phenotype. Hyperoxia injury causes a decrease in the number of embryonically <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> lineage traced cells. Conversely, bleomycin induced injury in adult animals labels a significant number of <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells that become myofibroblasts.</p><p>The paper is well written and the generation of this new animal model is an important contribution to the field. However, there are a number of questions regarding the lineage tracing studies and their interpretation:</p><p>1) Since this is the first report of this new mouse model, additional characterization of its fidelity is warranted at each of the induction timepoints. The co-expression of the rtTA/GFP from this allele needs to be looked at more carefully including FACS analysis and additional immunohistochemistry to verify what% of total <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> and other cell types it marks.</p><p>2) The lineage tracing studies are interesting but not well defined. For instance, the labeling of <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells at E9.5 could simply mark almost all lung mesenchyme/fibroblasts. If this is the case, then the interpretation of data in Figures 2 and 5 are somewhat unclear. The authors should provide an index at all of the times of dox induction (i.e. E9.5, P3, adult etc.) of what% of the total lung mesenchyme this allele marks. A comparison to a pan-mesoderm or mesenchyme marker would be helpful i.e. vimentin or something similar.</p><p>3) In light of point 2 above, what do the authors make of the fact that SM22a and ADRP appear to mark the majority of alveolar mesenchyme at P7 (Figure 2)? In particular, ADRP seems to mark a lot of cells that are <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>. A better characterization of what these cells are is warranted.</p><p>4) The data in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 are interesting in that they show a significant number of <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells that proliferate in response to bleomycin injury. Are these the myofibroblasts or are they what appear to be a large number of SM22-/<italic>Pdgfra+</italic> lineage traced cells?</p><p>5) The IHC data shown in Figure 5 appear to show that SM22+ cells at day 14 are unlikely to be derived from <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>lineage. Is this due to early vs late contribution to bleomycin triggered myofibroblasts?</p><p>6) The cell ablation experiment in Figure 3 suggests that the loss of <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>derived early postnatal myofibroblasts results in alveolar simplification. While the authors note that AT2 cell numbers are reduced, the percentage to total lung cells is unchanged. It is unclear how the latter conclusion was made or whether total cell number or epithelial cells specifically, were altered.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Here the authors investigate the lineage potential of <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>expressing cells in the developing lung and the contribution of this lineage to lung injury-repair in different well-established models. By generating and analyzing a novel <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-cre</italic> knockin reporter mouse, they report that <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>expressing cells give rise largely to myofibroblasts with only modest generation of lipofibroblasts in the lung mesenchyme. Moreover, by using these mice to induce DTA-expression and ablate myofibroblasts postnatally, or to injure the adult lung with bleomycin, the authors demonstrate the key role of <italic>Pdgfra-</italic>lineage in alveolar formation and in mediating the fibrotic response, respectively. Lastly, they report no contribution of this lineage to the persistent myofibroblast population seen in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.</p><p>This interesting and succinct paper provides both confirmatory and new insights about the fate of lineage-derived <italic>Pdgra+</italic> cells in different settings. The study is carefully done and relies on a more accurate knockin mouse model to investigate the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> lineage, which challenges some of the results previously reported using a BAC transgenic line.</p><p>Given the novelty of this mouse model and its potential importance to address relevant questions in the field, the details about the characterization of this line are relatively brief and sometimes missing. For example, they use two different regimens of Dox administration (IP and dox-containing food) but do not comment on the rationale and whether there were differences in labeling efficiency. What was the frequency of dox-independent labeling in these mice? Is labeling present in smooth muscle elsewhere in airways or large vessels? As a knockin line, <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-cre</italic> mice are haploinsufficient for <italic>Pdgfra</italic>. The authors should provide evidence or comment whether this may have influenced any of the results reported here, including the differences in labeling from that reported in the BAC transgene line.</p><p>The surprising and apparently paradoxical high number of myofibroblasts <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineage labeled negative in the BPD-hyperoxia model is one of the most interesting observations in the paper. The conclusion that this may have been accounted for by lipofibroblasts transdifferentiating into myofibroblasts should be explored in this model by lineage-labeling lipofibroblasts (ADRP or other relevant cre line). This will strengthen their conclusion and will offer further support to their <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-cre</italic> mouse model.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Li et al. describes the generation of a new line of mice in which rtTA is placed under the regulatory control of the endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> promoter. This new line was validated by comparing specificity of Dox-dependent <italic>tetO-GFP</italic> expression with expression of a GFP reporter in lungs of <italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice. Authors go on to show that <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineage cells of the embryonic lung transiently generate SM22a-immunoreactive cells in the perinatal period which then contribute to lipofibroblasts, that ablation of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells in the perinatal period leads to alveolar simplification and that <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineage cells differentially contribute to SM22a-immunoreactive cells in models of neonatal hyperoxia and adult bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Strengths of this study are the demonstration of a valuable new genetic tool to investigate the biology of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells of the lung and application of this tool to study the dynamics of lung mesoderm during development and perinatal lung maturation. A concern with this study is the broad classification of SM22a+ cells of the developing, perinatal and adult lung as myofibroblasts. Lineage tracing of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells is performed at various times of embryonic or postnatal lung maturation which complicates interpretation of data since <italic>Pdgfra</italic> is dynamically expressed within mesenchymal cells during these stages of lung development/maturation.</p><p>Specific concerns include:</p><p>1) The conclusion that &quot;.hitherto unappreciated complexity in the behavior of the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged cells&quot; seems overstated. Previous studies by this group and others demonstrate that the molecular phenotype of lung mesoderm is dynamically regulated during development.</p><p>2) Results subsection “Lineage tracing revealed that Pdgfra cells give rise primarily to normal alveolar myofibroblasts”: “[…] demonstrate that in the early postnatal lung, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineage cells give rise primarily to myofibroblasts, with minor contributions to lipofibroblasts and endothelial cells.” This statement is a little misleading in that it implies that myofibroblast and lipofibroblast populations are distinct and fixed. In reality, as shown previously by this group (Branchfield et al., 2016) and nicely demonstrated in this study, these populations are dynamic and are either interchangeable or their relative populations change through &quot;pruning&quot; during early postnatal lung maturation. The authors provide evidence supporting the notion that these populations are interchangeable based upon long-term retention of lineage-labeled cells. A concern with these experiments is that all conclusions are made using immunofluorescence analysis to evaluate fibroblast phenotype in histologic sections, using a very limited repertoire of markers (SM22a). This study would be greatly improved by addition of single cell transcriptomics to determine the precise molecular phenotype of lineage-labeled cells and how this changes with postnatal lung maturation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36865.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Since this is the first report of this new mouse model, additional characterization of its fidelity is warranted at each of the induction timepoints.

Data from flow revealed that the percentages of GFP+ cells in total lung cells are not statistically different in <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-GFP</italic> lungs as compared to <italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> lungs (Figure 1D, E). Also, out of total PDGFRa+ cells as labeled by anti-CD140a (PDGFRa)-PE antibody in flow, 78.62% ± 5.71% were GFP+ in <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-GFP</italic> lungs, indicative of the efficiency of rtTA activation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The lineage tracing studies are interesting but not well defined.

We tried vimentin antibody as a pan-mesenchymal marker, but it did not give distinct mesenchymal staining in our hands. Nevertheless, it is easy to distinguish mesenchyme from epithelium at E12.5. We found that labeling at E9.5 does not label all mesenchymal cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, B’). A similar density of labeling is observed in E12.5 <italic>Pdgfra<sup>GFP</sup></italic> lungs, suggesting that incomplete labeling is a feature of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression in a subset of mesenchymal cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, C’). The conclusion that <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells represents a subset of the lung mesenchymal cells is also supported by data from multiple other groups that have studied this cell population at various time points (Endale et al., 2017; Ntokou et al., 2015; Zepp et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In light of point 2 above, what do the authors make of the fact that SM22a and ADRP appear to mark the majority of alveolar mesenchyme at P7 (Figure 2)?

A better characterization of what these cells are is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, based on our data and prior published data from other labs, SM22a+ cells and ADRP+ cells are the two major cell types in the alveolar mesenchyme at P7. Our data showed that at P7, a majority of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells are myofibroblasts, rather than lipofibroblasts. For ADRP+ lipofibroblasts, previous reports showed that <italic>Tbx4</italic> lineage and <italic>Fgf10</italic> expressing cells contribute to lipofibroblasts (El Agha et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013). A more detailed reference to these data are added to the Introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 are interesting in that they show a significant number of Pdgfra+ cells that proliferate in response to bleomycin injury. Are these the myofibroblasts or are they what appear to be a large number of SM22-/Pdgfra+ lineage traced cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on Zepp et al. (2017), it was shown that in the bleomycin model, SMA+ myofibroblasts do express Ki67, a proliferation marker. This suggests that proliferating cells can simultaneously have myofibroblast characteristics following injury. In our <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-lineaged lungs, as labeling was carried out prior to injury when the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cells are SM22-, we deduce that the <italic>Pdgra</italic>+ proliferating cells originated from SM22- cells. We clarified this in Results in subsection “PDGFRa-lineaged cells contribute to pathological myofibroblasts in the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis” and in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The IHC data shown in Figure 5 appear to show that SM22+ cells at day 14 are unlikely to be derived from Pdgfra-lineage. Is this due to early vs late contribution to bleomycin triggered myofibroblasts?</p></disp-quote><p>We added arrowheads in Figure 5G to highlight that at D14, a portion of the SM22+ cells are derived from the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> lineage. Quantification indicated that ~26% of SM22+ cells are from the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ (Figure 5O). This number increased to ~45% at D21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The cell ablation experiment in Figure 3 suggests that the loss of Pdgfra-derived early postnatal myofibroblasts results in alveolar simplification. While the authors note that AT2 cell numbers are reduced, the percentage to total lung cells is unchanged. It is unclear how the latter conclusion was made or whether total cell number or epithelial cells specifically, were altered.</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage was calculated by SPC+ AT2 cells in total lung cells base on DAPI staining. Total cell numbers were decreased per area as the lung is simplified. These numbers were added to revised Figure 4 (formerly Figure 3) source files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Given the novelty of this mouse model and its potential importance to address relevant questions in the field, the details about the characterization of this line are relatively brief and sometimes missing.

For postnatal lineage tracing, we chose dox injection followed by dox food because it showed a much higher efficiency compared to dox containing food only, presumably because the pups do not get to the dox food themselves and the dox transfer through the milk from the dam is not efficient. This rationale is added to Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the frequency of dox-independent labeling in these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Very little leaky labeling without dox, and this result is added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is labeling present in smooth muscle elsewhere in airways or large vessels?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe labeling in the airway or vascular smooth muscles.

However, there is no notable phenotype in the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> heterozygotes to indicate haploinsufficiency. In addition, conditional <italic>Pdgfra</italic> loss-of-function mutants show decreased myofibroblasts and maintenance of lipofibroblasts (McGowan and McCoy, 2014). Thus, if there is any undetected haploinsufficiency, we would expect that using our <italic>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></italic> knockin line, there should be fewer myofibroblasts labeled compared to the BAC transgenic line, opposite to what the data show.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The surprising and apparently paradoxical high number of myofibroblasts Pdgfra-lineage labeled negative in the BPD-hyperoxia model is one of the most interesting observations in the paper.

There is a published cre line, <italic>Plin2 (Adrp</italic>)<sup>creERT2</sup> (El Agha et al., 2016; Ntokou et al., 2017). However, it is not specific for lipofibroblasts, and labels a number of other cell types in the lung (El Agha et al., 2016). Thus, we currently do not have the tool to specifically trace the lipofibroblast lineage. We added in Discussion that a high priority next-step is to identify markers that are specific for lipofibroblasts, and use them to generate mouse tools for lineage tracing and address the potential of lipofibroblasts in development and injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Li et al. describes the generation of a new line of mice in which rtTA is placed under the regulatory control of the endogenous Pdgfra promoter.

Authors go on to show that Pdgfra-lineage cells of the embryonic lung transiently generate SM22a-immunoreactive cells in the perinatal period which then contribute to lipofibroblasts, that ablation of Pdgfra-expressing cells in the perinatal period leads to alveolar simplification and that Pdgfra-lineage cells differentially contribute to SM22a-immunoreactive cells in models of neonatal hyperoxia and adult bleomycin-induced fibrosis.

We added in the Introduction a more specific definition of myofibobroblasts in the normal lung. Findings from our prior study (Branchfield et al., 2016) indicated that a-SMA and SM22a expression is absent in the distal mesenchyme in the prenatal lung. Their expression increases and peaks during the first phase of alveologenesis (P3-14), and then subsides to a low level afterwards and into adulthood. Thus, the term myofibroblasts in the normal lung only refers to the a-SMA+ and SM22a+ cells during alveologenesis when secondary septae/crests are added. Some have also referred to these cells as secondary crest myofibroblasts which is a more distinct term.</p><p>We performed lineage tracing at both prenatal (E9.5) and postnatal (P0) stages, and analyzed data at E12.5, P7 and P40 to best depict the dynamic nature of the <italic>Pdgfra</italic>+ cell population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific concerns include:</p><p>1) The conclusion that &quot;.hitherto unappreciated complexity in the behavior of the Pdgfra-lineaged cells&quot; seems overstated.

We have also added analysis with a-SMA staining which substantiated the findings with SM22a (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-F). By using <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-based lineage tracing in the normal lung starting at both prenatal and postnatal time points, we have observed labeling primarily in secondary crest myofibroblasts. The lineaged cells are not lost past alveologenesis due to pruning as suggested. They stay in the lung mesenchyme and simply turn down their SMA and SM22 expression. They do not interchange into lipofibroblast cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
