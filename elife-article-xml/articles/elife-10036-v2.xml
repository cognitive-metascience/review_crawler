However, the differentiation steps between epicardial cells and caSMCs are unknown as are the final maturation signals at coronary arteries. Here, we use clonal analysis and lineage tracing to show that caSMCs derive from pericytes, mural cells associated with microvessels, and that these cells are present in adults. During development following the onset of blood flow, pericytes at arterial remodeling sites upregulate Notch3 while endothelial cells express Jagged-1. Deletion of Notch3 disrupts caSMC differentiation. Our data support a model wherein epicardial-derived pericytes populate the entire coronary microvasculature, but differentiate into caSMCs at arterial remodeling zones in response to Notch signaling. Our data are the first demonstration that pericytes are progenitors for smooth muscle, and their presence in adult hearts reveals a new potential cell type for targeting during cardiovascular disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10036.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10036.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10036.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is a complex organ composed of several different cell types. Muscle cells of walls of the heart contract to pump blood around the body. These muscle cells are themselves supplied with blood from the coronary arteries that penetrate deep into this muscle tissue. The lining of the coronary arteries is made of endothelial cells, while smooth muscle cells (or SMCs for short) surround the arteries and provide support. The SMCs can also contract to increase or decrease blood flow to the heart, depending on the heart rate.</p><p>Endothelial cells and SMCs of the coronary arteries physically interact but develop from different precursor cells. The coronary artery SMCs are derived from cells that comprise the outer layer of the heart (called the epicardium) and move inwards during embryonic development. However, it was not clear exactly what kind of cells these precursor cells are, or which molecular signals trigger their conversion into SMCs.</p><p>Volz et al. have studied cardiac development in mice and used fluorescent labels to observed individual cells of the epicardium as they divided and moved. This revealed that when epicardial cells developed into the coronary artery SMCs, there was always an intermediate cell type that wrapped around the developing blood vessels. Upon further investigation, Volz et al. found that these cells were so-called pericytes, which otherwise support small blood vessels throughout the body. Furthermore, the pericytes that did not develop into SMCs remained near the coronary arteries and were still present in adult hearts. Lastly, experiments showed that a protein called Notch-3 is expressed on pericytes and interacts with another protein called Jagged-1 on endothelial cells to prompt the conversion of pericytes into SMCs.</p><p>Since heart development is similar in mice and humans, these findings may have implications for future therapies of coronary artery disease, the most common cause of death worldwide. Currently there are no methods to trigger the formation of new coronary arteries after injury or blockage, but knowledge of the pericyte precursors and the signaling pathways that turn them into SMCs could eventually lead to new treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10036.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10036.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cardiovascular development</kwd><kwd>vascular smooth muscle</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4R00HL10579303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Red-Horse</surname><given-names>Kristy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL099999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Irving</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL099995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riordan</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RT2-02060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Irving</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle scholars program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Red-Horse</surname><given-names>Kristy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Progenitor cells for the muscle layer around the coronary arteries have been identified revealing a key step in how the embryo forms these important blood vessels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, but there is currently no effective method to regenerate new coronary arteries (CA) in diseased or injured hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rubanyi, 2013</xref>). This is likely due to our limited understanding of CA progenitor cells and the signaling pathways that activate their differentiation. CAs are the vessels that supply blood to ventricular heart muscle and are composed of an inner endothelial cell lining wrapped by a smooth muscle covering. Coronary artery smooth muscle cells (caSMC) are particularly important due to their role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. However, caSMC development, both normally during embryogenesis and ectopically during coronary artery disease, is a poorly understood process.</p><p>CaSMC development occurs during arterialization of immature coronary plexus vessels. In the murine heart, coronary endothelial cells derived primarily from the sinus venosus and endocardial cells that sprout onto the heart to form an early vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kattan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). A subset of the plexus vessels differentiates into arteries once the network attaches to the aorta and begins receiving blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hood et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peeters et al., 1997</xref>). Although ultimately adjacent to CA endothelial cells, the source of caSMCs is different. These cells arise from the mesothelial covering of the heart called the epicardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikawa and Gourdie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). In rodents, caSMCs reside deep within the myocardium while epicardial cells are located on the outermost layer of the heart. During embryonic development, many epicardial cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate into the deeper layers of the myocardium to form the stromal cells of the heart, including cardiac fibroblasts and caSMCs. Inhibition of epicardial migration from the surface by deletion of Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor β (PDGFRβ) diminishes caSMC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellgren, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). However, the migrating epicardial-derived cell type fated to become caSMCs has not been discovered, and the mechanisms that trigger this intermediate progenitor to differentiate into caSMCs are unknown.</p><p>Smooth muscle within other internal organs, including vascular smooth muscle, also arises from an outer mesothelial covering. Lineage tracing Mesothelin (Msln)-positive mesothelial cells and their prospective isolation and transplantation has shown that many of the abdominal and thoracic organs derive their smooth muscle and fibroblasts from the surface serosa layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinkevich et al., 2012</xref>).. Mesothelial to vascular smooth muscle differentiation occurred almost exclusively during developmental and early postnatal stages, but, similar to the heart, the cellular pathway bridging the surface to internal arteries has not been identified. Epicardial mesothelium of the heart also has a developmental restriction. Most migrating caSMC progenitors leave the heart surface before embryonic day 12.5 and are no longer able to migrate into the adult heart, either normally or following myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). However, since this time point is long before caSMCs appear, it is unclear what cell type resides in the heart to eventually receive signals to become new smooth muscle around forming arteries and whether this cell type persists in the adult. The discovery of such an intermediate progenitor could identify a cell type that could aid collateral artery formation during disease.</p><p>Here, we find that cells resembling vascular pericytes (PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>−</sup>SMα<sup>−</sup>PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>, wrapping microvessels, embedded within a basement membrane) are intermediate progenitors for smooth muscle in the developing heart. Pericytes are mural cells that wrap microvascular blood vessels and regulate their development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappellari et al., 2013</xref>). Pericytes share features with smooth muscle cells including close apposition to the vessel and some molecular markers, but differ in their contractile protein expression, cell shape, location on capillaries instead of large vessels, and discontinuous covering of the endothelium. Since their identification in 1873 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rouget, 1873</xref>), biologists have wondered whether pericytes and smooth muscle differentiate into each other, but direct evidence has been lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappellari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Majesky, 2011</xref>). We provide evidence that pericytes lining the coronary vascular plexus respond to Notch3 signaling at arterial remodeling zones to become mature caSMCs during embryonic development. We also observed caSMC related pericytes in the adult heart presenting the possibility that the Notch3 pathway could be manipulated in these cells to participate in CA regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CaSMC development</title><p>To identify where an epicardial-derived caSMC progenitor would be found, we determined where caSMCs first appear. CA development was followed using confocal imaging of intact mouse hearts immunostained for vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) and smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), one of the most specific markers for mature smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seidelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Hearts are shown on the right lateral side to most effectively display developing CAs. Development of CAs begins with the invasion of VE-cadherin<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells that form an immature coronary vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kattan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>), which is initially devoid of blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’”</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). At embryonic day (e) 13.5, the plexus vessels attach to the aorta and begin to receive blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). Subsequently, vascular remodeling, or fusion and enlargement of plexus vessels, is observed directly downstream of the aortic attachment site where future arteries will form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). SM-MHC protein expression was first observed at e14.5 in plexus vessels that had begun to remodel into arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’”</xref>). At e14.5 smooth muscle coverage was patchy and consisted of cells with both low and high SM-MHC (SM-MHC<sup>low</sup> or SM-MHC<sup>high</sup>) protein expression (fluorescence measured from single confocal z-planes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B”’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As this initial remodeling zone transitioned into recognizable arterial vessels at e15.5, caSMC coverage increased and most cells were SM-MHC<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C”’</xref>). Remodeling zones with patchy SM-MHC<sup>low</sup> cells were now just distal to the more mature vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C”’</xref>). These distal remodeling zones eventually transformed into mature vessels in the next developmental stage at e16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D”’</xref>). These data identify when and where SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> caSMCs differentiate within the context of the whole heart at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10036.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Coronary artery smooth muscle differentiation is initiated early during vascular remodeling. </title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Whole mount confocal images of the developing right coronary artery at embryonic (<bold>e</bold>) days 13 (<bold>A–A’’’</bold>), 14.5 (<bold>B–B’’’</bold>), 15.5 (<bold>C–C’’’</bold>), and 16.5 (<bold>D–D’’’</bold>) immunostained with VE-cadherin (blue) and SM-MHC (red).

Measuring the distance between SM-MHC<sup>low</sup> cells and the epicardium revealed that they were not on the surface of the heart, but on average 50 µm deep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, a putative intermediate progenitor would need to migrate through approximately 7 cell layers between the epicardium and nascent CAs where they first express the mature smooth muscle cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Clonal analysis of epicardial-derived cells</title><p>Because most caSMCs derive from the epicardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikawa and Gourdie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez-Pomares et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), we aimed to find the epicardial-derived progenitor that eventually differentiates into caSMCs. Epicardial-driven Cre-expressing mice for lineage tracing exist; however, these constructs label all the other epicardial-derived stromal cells in the heart in addition to caSMCs. We needed to study the smooth muscle lineage in isolation, which is done most accurately using clonal level labeling where single cells and all their progeny are genetically marked with a fluorescent tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham and Meilhac, 2011</xref>). Our approach was to identify caSMC progenitors by analyzing fluorescently labeled sister cells within clonal clusters that also contain caSMCs. To produce clones, epicardial cells were sparsely labeled using T-box 18 (Tbx18)-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008b</xref>) coupled with the Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) Cre reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zong et al., 2005</xref>). Tbx18-Cre was selected because, in control experiments with other Cre reporters, recombination was induced in the large majority of epicardial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The MADM system fluorescently labels Cre-expressing cells through a rare interchromosomal recombination event such that, when coupled with Tbx18-Cre, hearts contained isolated clusters of fluorescently labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We analyzed tightly associated clusters (at least 100 µm from any other labeled cell) that contained epicardium, caSMCs, and other clonally related cells, the latter of which could be the progenitor population.</p><p>Initial experiments analyzing Tbx18-Cre, MADM clones based on cellular morphology and location revealed that clones containing epicardial cells and caSMCs always contained sister cells with long, thread-like processes that wrapped around coronary vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was in contrast to sister cells from clones that were adjacent to, but did not incorporate into, the caSMC layer, which were mostly located in the space between vessels instead of wrapping around them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The morphology of the caSMC-associated sister cells was characteristic of vascular pericytes, which are mural cells that tightly associate with small blood vessels and regulate their development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate the presence of pericytes in caSMC clones, we validated the use of a set of markers that would allow us to identify pericytes and caSMCs in the developing heart. These were then used to analyze an additional set of clones.

CaSMCs were positive for SM-MHC and PDGFRβ and were around mature and developing arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, PDGFRβ perivascular cells around microvessels were SM-MHC negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also analyzed the expression of two additional smooth muscle markers, Smooth Muscle Alpha Actin (SMα and Calponin 1 (CNN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Majesky, 2011</xref>). Aside from a low level in some cardiomyocytes, SMα immunolabeling was only in larger, more proximal CAs, and not in PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells around plexus capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) or in SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> cells in smaller vessels and remodeling zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, in the coronary system, SMα appeared to be induced later than SM-MHC since its expression domain was less extensive and only in more mature arteries. CNN1 was highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, but did not appear in intervening PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Around large coronary arteries a subset of caSMCs expressed CNN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Cells that surrounded plexus capillaries and were positive for PDGFRβ, but negative for SM-MHC, SMα, and CNN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), displayed a morphology similar to vascular pericytes with long processes that wrap the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells around microvessels could be cardiac pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>), we further characterized this population. Whole mount immunohistochemistry showed that PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells surrounding plexus capillaries in the free walls of the developing heart ventricles were always closely apposed to endothelial cells in contrast to PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, which were dispersed between the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells were also embedded within a Collagen IV-containing basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). These are critical attributes for pericyte identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). They also all expressed the pericyte markers NG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and Notch3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) (quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells were observed on the earliest coronary sprouts when the vessels first migrate directly beneath the epicardium and surrounded the entire plexus endothelium as it developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Later, at the arterial remodeling zone where caSMCs first differentiate, 98 ± % of PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells were Tbx18-Cre lineage labeled consistent with most arising from the epicardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). In addition, PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells were the most numerous Tbx18-Cre traced cell type in this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The remaining 28% were predominately fibroblasts as defined by their expression of PDGFRα and variable proximity to the vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). At time points after arteries are formed, much of the coronary smooth muscle was also lineage labeled with Tbx18-Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) in line with other studies showing an epicardial origin for these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). The epicardium is not thought to give rise to cells of the hematopoietic lineage, and, accordingly, PDGFRβ cells did not overlap with CD45 staining (data not shown). It must be noted that although eight criteria (PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>−</sup>SMα<sup>−</sup>PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>, wrapping microvessels, embedded within basement membrane) suggested that PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells are pericytes, we cannot exclude the possibility that the discovery of different markers will reveal this population to be a mix of pericytes and pericyte-like cells with different functions. However, based on current knowledge, the above described cell type will be referred to as pericytes below. In summary, given their marker expression, localization within the tissue, and cellular morphology, we defined PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells to be cardiac pericytes of the developing coronary vasculature. We also show that they are the most common epicardially-derived cell type at the arterial remodeling zone making them a prime candidate for caSMC progenitors.</p><p>To evaluate the likely clonality of the observed fluorescently labeled cell clusters, we mathematically modeled the process of clone formation using realistic parameters estimated from the imaging data of the e13.5 developing heart (see details in Materials and methods). In brief, we simulated the process of clone formation as a three dimensional Poisson process and estimated the underlying rate of clone generation that best fit the observed experimental data of ~∼3.3 fluorescently labeled clusters per half heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For the estimated clone generation rate, we then calculated the fraction of simulated clusters that were truly clonal (not comprised of more than one overlapping clones) to evaluate the likelihood that the observed clusters are indeed clonal. This analysis revealed that ∼82% of the observed clusters were likely to derive from a single labeling event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This same clonality rate was maintained when considered for hearts having a range of 1–6 clusters each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was the range observed in our e13.5 data set (mean value of 3.3 ± 1.6). We repeated the entire modeling process with different settings for the discrimination distance that defines clonal clusters (see details in Materials and methods) confirming the robustness of the estimated clonality rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations provide evidence that greater than 80% of the observed clusters were truly clonal.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10036.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Coronary artery smooth muscle cells and pericytes are clonally related. </title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Simulation-Based Analysis of Clonality as outlined in Materials and methods.

Strikingly, adult Tbx18-Cre, MADM hearts frequently contained tightly packed clusters of lineage labeled cells consisting of pericytes and caSMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>-adult) (n = 20). Pericytes at this stage exhibited even longer, thinner processes that tracked along the vessels for greater than 5–10 times the length of their cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>-adult and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The fact that these cells were not dispersed, even five weeks after labeling, shows that pericytes and caSMCs do not migrate significantly once their positions are established during development. In addition, our analysis indicates that pericytes around capillaries that are clonally related to caSMCs remain and function as cardiac pericytes in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Within established adult clones, the ratio between the number of pericytes and caSMCs was comparable to ratios calculated for total mural cells from three different regions of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This is the expected result if the epicardial to pericyte pathway is a prominent source of caSMCs. In total, our clonal analysis suggests that epicardial-derived pericytes surround the entire coronary plexus during embryonic development, but that these cells differentiate into caSMCs if located around vessels that enlarge to become arteries during remodeling. These pericytes also surround capillaries in the adult heart and could potentially become new caSMC if arterial remodeling were induced at this stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lineage tracing pericytes in the developing heart</title><p>The above described composition and arrangement of epicardial-derived clones suggests that pericytes differentiate into caSMCs. However, direct lineage tracing of pericytes is required to confirm this sequence of events. NG2 and Notch3 are well-established pericyte markers in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kofler et al., 2011</xref>). In the myocardium of the developing ventricle free walls, NG2- and Notch3-positive cells on the microvasculature always expressed PDGFRβ and wrapped vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>), which identified them as cardiac pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). NG2 and Notch3 also completely overlapped (n = 185 cells counted, data not shown). To test if pericytes differentiate into smooth muscle, we performed lineage tracing using two independent mouse lines, NG2-CreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) and Notch3-CreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fre et al., 2011</xref>). In embryos containing either the NG2-CreER or Notch3-CreER allele coupled with the fluorescent Cre reporter gene Rosa<sup>tdtomato</sup>, pericytes, but not caSMCs, were labeled by injecting tamoxifen at either e10.5 or e11.5. This restricts Cre activity to a time point after pericytes had formed but before caSMCs appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). If caSMCs arise from pericytes, this strategy should result in lineage labeled caSMCs, i.e. tdtomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>These lineage tracing experiments resulted in labeled caSMCs with both Cre drivers. Importantly, no labeling was detected in the absence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and data not shown). Quantifying the proportion of lineage labeled pericytes in the compact myocardium indicated that Cre recombination efficiency in PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup> perivascular cells (pericytes) was 21% and 38% with NG2-CreER and Notch3-CreER, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). SM-MHC<sup>+</sup> caSMCs also expressed the tdtomato lineage label in both NG2-CreER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>) and Notch3-CreER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>) strains. Similar percentages of labeling were seen in pericytes and caSMC (quantified in the compact myocardium) consistent with low recombination efficiencies in pericytes accounting for the incomplete caSMC tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, our analysis does not exclude the possibility of an additional source, particularly in regions not analyzed, i.e. the ventricular septum. One potential confounding factor is that both transgenes exhibited sporadic labeling in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozerdem et al., 2001</xref>), which was more rare in Notch3-CreER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,G</xref>). However, control experiments using Myh6-CreER showed that cardiomyocyte lineage tracing never labeled caSMCs (data not shown). Finally, NG2 and Notch3 were expressed in PDGFRβ perivascular cells that were characterized as cardiac pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but, as stated above, we cannot exclude the possibility that these experiments traced pericyte-like SMC progenitors sharing attributes with traditional pericytes, specifically PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>−</sup>SMα<sup>−</sup>PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>, wrapping microvessels, and embedded within the basement membrane. In summary, lineage tracing data from two independent Cre lines support a model where pericytes differentiate into caSMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pericytes in PDGFRβ-deficient hearts</title><p>To gain further evidence that pericytes were caSMC progenitors, we analyzed mutants with deficient caSMC layers and asked if this phenotype was correlated with defects in pericytes at the arterial maturation zone.

Given that Jagged-1 has previously been identified as a shear stress-induced molecule in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCormick et al., 2001</xref>), we investigated whether it could be regulated by blood flow in the heart. Coronary vessels are initially unperfused, but begin to receive blood flow after they attach to the aorta at e13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). This time point correlated with the onset of robust Jagged-1 expression in endothelial cells of vessels directly downstream of the attachment site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–WT</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analyzed a model of delayed CA stem attachment to the aorta, Isl1 heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2008a</xref>), which postpones the initiation of blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). Immunostaining Isl1 mutant hearts revealed that Jagged-1 was only upregulated in arterial remodeling zones of e13.5 hearts that had formed CA stems on the aorta to receive blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Isl1 mutant hearts also failed to upregulate Notch3 in pericytes suggesting that this change also requires signals downstream of blood flow (n = 9, data not shown).

Previous identification of the epicardial-derived caSMC progenitor had been hampered by the fact that multiple developmental pathways occur downstream of epicardial differentiation. We have overcome this hurdle by using clonal analysis to label differentiation steps downstream of a single epicardial cell. This single cell tracing analyzes whether cells are clonally related eliminating one caveat of population level Cre labeling experiments where a mistake in the cell types expressing Cre can produce misleading results. Our clonal analysis of epicardial-derived cells identified cells with the molecular marker and morphological profile of vascular pericytes as being lineage related to caSMCs. The temporal presence and position of pericytes in epicardial-derived clones suggested that pericytes were the intermediate differentiation step between the epicardium and smooth muscle. This sequence of events was confirmed by direct pericyte lineage tracing using two independent pericyte Cre lines. In addition, pericytes were the most numerous epicardial-derived cell type at the CA remodeling zone where they wrapped developing arteries, a location that would allow them to respond to arterial maturation signals. Thus, we used complimentary lineage analysis experiments consisting of clonal and population-based tracing to show that pericytes (or pericyte-like cells) travel along blood vessels as they enter the myocardium and function as progenitors for caSMCs.</p><p>Since pericytes wrap all small coronary vessels, we explored the signals that trigger their differentiation into caSMCs specifically at CA remodeling zones. We found that upon attachment to the aorta and establishment of blood flow, coronary endothelial cells downstream of the attachment site, which presumably receive the strongest blood flow, induce Jagged-1. Jagged-1 was not robustly expressed in a model of delayed aortic attachment and delayed initiation of blood flow. The Jagged-1 ligand Notch3 was upregulated in pericytes at the arterial remodeling zone, and caSMCs failed to differentiate in Notch3-null hearts. A delay in smooth muscle differentiation in the absence of Notch3 and Jagged-1 has been observed in other organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">High et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manderfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang and Proweller, 2011</xref>), however nothing is known about their roles in caSMC differentiation. Furthermore, due to the previous lack of knowledge of the lineage relationship between pericytes and smooth muscle cells, we are the first to show the importance of Notch3 signaling in stimulating the pericyte to smooth muscle transition. Jagged-1 and Notch signaling has been reported to be upregulated by sheer stress in vitro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCormick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Theodoris et al., 2015</xref>), and we provide evidence that this occurs in vivo following coronary plexus attachment to the aorta. Together, our data support a working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) where epicardial cells differentiate into Notch3<sup>low</sup> pericytes that cover the entire coronary plexus as it populates the myocardium. Then, the pericytes located on plexus vessels that receive blood flow-induced Jagged-1 upregulate Notch3 and differentiate into caSMCs. Thus, blood flow initiation is correlated with molecular changes that mark the site of arterial development in the coronary vascular plexus and may stimulate vessel remodeling and pericyte differentiation into smooth muscle.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10036.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model and summary.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Different parts of the hypothesized epicardial to caSMC pathway were dissected using the indicated experiments.

In addition, progression down the caSMC lineage occurs early in development, mostly between e10.5 and 12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). We show that endothelial cells migrating directly beneath the epicardium at this time point acquire pericytes and pericytes within caSMC containing clones are usually located near the heart’s surface as well as deeper layers. Thus, migrating coronary vessels could trigger adjacent epicardial cells to differentiate into pericytes at the surface and support their movement into the myocardium along with invading endothelial cells. Then, the subset of these pericytes that traveled to arterializing vessels receives signals to become caSMCs. Clones also generally segregated between those containing pericytes/caSMCs and those with other cell types not positive for our cell type specific markers, likely fibroblasts, the latter of which did not integrate into the smooth muscle layer even when directly adjacent to the artery. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that two different epicardial derived pathways diverge at the surface of the heart where the pericyte/caSMC lineage travels along vessels as they invade the myocardium to provide the different mural cells of the coronary vasculature.</p><p>Analyzing pericyte-caSMC clones in adults showed that caSMC related pericytes persist after development is complete. Labeled cells in the adult heart were found in surprisingly tight clusters. This suggests that embryonic pericytes within caSMC clones were not merely an intermediate cell type that is depleted during development, but that cells not differentiating remain and function as cardiac pericytes throughout life. The tight clustering in adult hearts also indicate that pericytes travel very little along a vessel once they establish their location during development, at least in this organ. Thus, the embryonic heart appears to have developed an efficient method of distributing smooth muscle progenitors, cells that our data suggests maintain their cell-type specific function as pericytes at vessels that do not receive arterial blood flow and differentiation signals.</p><p>Studies in the adult heart and other adult tissues report that perivascular cells are a heterogeneous population with mesenchymal stem cell properties that can contribute to tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kramann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dulauroy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stallcup, 2013</xref>). Because a large number of caSMCs arise from the epicardium, we characterized epicardial-derived cells at the coronary artery remodeling zone. These were found to be almost exclusively either PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>Notch3<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>-</sup> (pericytes) or PDGFRβ<sup>-</sup>Notch3<sup>-</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> (fibroblasts) suggesting less heterogeneity in the epicardial-derived cellular compartment at this age. This could be due to development being an early and protected stage in the animal’s life or that the cellular milieu is more complex in the adult when immunity is active. Additional complexity is likely induced in tissue injury models. Although lineage tracing shows that pericytes are a large source, our data does not exclude other pathways to caSMC development. In fact, developmental studies have show that an unidentified compensatory progenitor can provide caSMC if the epicardium is inhibited, although this source predisposes the arteries to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless, the description of pericytes as progenitors and their presence in the adult identifies the possibility that they could be utilized to produce new caSMCs during CA regeneration. Identifying the cellular pathway between the epicardium and smooth muscle is therefore important, particularly since it is known that epicardial cells do not enter the adult heart, even after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Our data showing that pericytes are coronary artery smooth muscle progenitors and that they persist in the adult present the possibility that pericytes could be targeted without relying on the original progenitors (epicardial cells) being transported to form new collateral arteries.</p><p>Future experiments will investigate whether diverted arterial blood flow following coronary artery stenosis and/or blockage induces Notch signaling and differentiation of pericytes into caSMCs as part of the process that forms collateral vessels. If so, it will be important to ascertain whether collateral formation can be made more efficient by stimulating Notch activity. Our data suggest a similar pericyte to smooth muscle pathway in the kidney. However, it will be important to investigate whether smooth muscle in all mesothelial covered abdominal and thoracic organs and other tissues pass through a similar pericyte intermediate as it differentiates into organ-specific smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinkevich et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

For adults, 50 µm cryosectioning was performed and the sections were stained with the staining protocol as described above. Clusters of labeled cells were considered clonal if they were clearly distinct and at least 100 µm away from other labeled cells. For e13.5, e15.5 and adult clones a total of 12, 13 and 7 caSMC clones were quantified, respectively. Cell identities were assigned by the immunostaining criteria described in the main text and assessed by two individual researchers in the laboratory.

The surface area of the heart was approximated as that of a sphere with a radius of 315 µm, yielding a value of 1,246,898 square µm (A = 4πr<sup>2</sup>). We then modeled regions representing each half of the heart as square tiles with an equivalent surface area (height x width = 623,449 µm<sup>2</sup>) and a depth of 97.5 µm, corresponding to the estimated distance from the epicardium to the endocardium. Groups of clonally related labeled cells were modeled as spheres with a radius of 54 µm, based on the average dimensions of the e13.5 clones. We then defined a discrimination cutoff of 50 µm (based on a conservative analysis of the maximum intra-clone distance between any labeled cell and its nearest neighbor within the same clone) as the minimum distance required between any cells from two different groups of clones such that those clones were considered to be distinct entities. Using these empirically determined parameters, we then performed simulations to estimate the underlying clone generation rate (and its corresponding clonality rate) that best fit the observed data as follows. First, we tested a range of suitable values (from 0.5 to 10.0) for the clone generation rate (m), which specifies the average number of clones that are stochastically generated in each simulated half heart. For any given value of the generation rate, we randomly simulated 10,000 half hearts, with the number of clones (X) assigned to each heart randomly determined according to the Poisson distribution (Prob (X = k) = e<sup>-m</sup> m<sup>k</sup> / k!). The centroids of each clone were then randomly assigned with uniform probability to locations within the volume of the simulated region, and any clones that were located closer than the allowed discrimination distance of each other were merged together to form a single ‘cluster’. Then, the mean number of observed ‘clusters’ (clusters may either consist of a single clone or a set of neighboring merged clones) was calculated as a function of the clone generation rate. The underlying clone generation rate that best matched the experimental data with an average of 3.3 clusters per region was then chosen as the estimated true generation rate, and its associated clonality rate, defined as the fraction of observed clusters that are comprised of individual clones, was computed from the results of 10,000 simulations. The calculated clonality rates represent the likelihood that any individual cluster of labeled cells is indeed clonal, based on the results of this simulation analysis. Finally, we repeated the entire modeling process with different settings for the discrimination distance, in order to assess the robustness of the estimated clonality rate to different values for this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of caSMC and pericyte numbers in adult hearts</title><p>Adult hearts (n = 3) were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for one hour at 4<sup>o</sup>C, washed in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 30 min.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Pericytes are progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and two of the three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. However, one of the reviewers raised substantial concerns about the lineage tracing specificity and the markers used to identify the two phenotypes. Although the other reviewers have only minor issues, relatively easy to address, it is important that in the revised version the concerns of the first reviewer are fully addressed.</p><p>We realise that this is a catch 22 situation, since &quot;really specific&quot; markers for pericytes do not exist, as correctly pointed out in the text; thus absence of a late marker (SMyHC) as only tool to distinguish caSMc from pericytes may be misleading. We strongly suggest that additional smooth muscle markers are used to distinguish immature caSMCs from pericytes. In general, the conclusions of the work should be toned down, outlining the complexity of the problem and how this work offers a possible answer, not the definitive one.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> The authors aim to identify the intermediate progenitor cell type between the epicardium and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Using clonal analysis of rare recombination events and genetic lineage tracking studies in mice, they propose that the intermediate progenitor is the pericyte. They also identify the role of PDGFRb and Notch3 for epicardium to pericyte and pericyte to caSMC transitions respectively. They then use lineage tracing and present a more limited dataset in which they propose that renal VSMC also originate from pericytes.</p><p>1) The major limitation in this paper is the use of non-specific markers for distinguishing pericyes from caSMCs. The authors use expression of NG2, PDGFRb and Notch3 to identify pericytes. However, each of these markers including NG2 can also be expressed by SMC (for example Murfee et al. Microcirculation; 2005: 151-160. doi: 10.1080/10739680590904955). Indeed a major challenge in the field of mural cells is the lack of genetic markers that unequivocally distinguish pericytes from smooth muscle cells as the authors own cited reference makes clear (Armulik et al. Dev Cell 2011). Given this constraint, it is difficult to be sure whether caSMC come from genuine pericytes or indeed whether the 'pericyte-like' cells actually represent an alternative SMC progenitor or immature SMCs. This is a major problem in the field and studies identifying unique pericyte markers are urgently required.</p><p>2) Given the lack of specificity of the markers employed, then the clonal analysis may simply suggest that caSMC and pericytes originate from a common progenitor. The later development of MYH11 expression could equally be due to the maturation of immature SMCs that were misinterpreted as being pericytes.</p><p>3) Another concern is that even if the NG2-CreER tracking was specific for pericytes (which this reviewer does not believe to be the case) then at least some of the MYH11+ cells do not have a NG2-derived origin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref> – a substantial number of MYH11+ SMCs are not labelled green with the NG2-CreER lineage tracer). A quantitative assessment of the proportion of MYH11+ cells from the NG2 lineage would clarify what proportionof caSMCs have at least a common origin with pericytes and to what extent there is an entirely independent pathway for caSMC development.</p><p>4) MYH11 is a specific but not sensitive marker for developing SMCs since immature SMC may not express this relatively late onset marker.

Although the other reviewers have only minor issues, relatively easy to address, it is important that in the revised version the concerns of the first reviewer are fully addressed. We realise that this is a catch 22 situation, since &quot;really specific&quot; markers for pericytes do not exist, as correctly pointed out in the text; thus absence of a late marker (SMyHC) as only tool to distinguish caSMc from pericytes may be misleading. We strongly suggest that additional smooth muscle markers are used to distinguish immature caSMCs from pericytes. In general, the conclusions of the work should be toned down, outlining the complexity of the problem and how this work offers a possible answer, not the definitive one.</italic> </p><p>To summarize the general changes requested above:</p><p>1) Additional SMC markers (Smooth muscle actin and Calponin) were used to further characterize pericytes and smooth muscle cells (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>, and K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Smooth muscle actin and Calponin were not expressed in what we had identified as pericytes in the first submission. These data add additional support that PDGFRβ+SM-MHC- cells located around microvessels are pericytes and not a separate population of immature smooth muscle progenitors. Interestingly, we found that SM-MHC (SMyHC) was not a late smooth muscle marker in the developing heart. It was the first of the three smooth muscle markers to be expressed in caSMCs being present in early remodeling arteries in addition to large, mature arteries, that latter of which also expressed Smooth muscle actin and Calponin.</p><p>2) Throughout the text, we added points and changed the wording to tone down conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The major limitation in this paper is the use of non-specific markers for distinguishing pericyes from caSMCs. The authors use expression of NG2, PDGFRb and Notch3 to identify pericytes. However, each of these markers including NG2 can also be expressed by SMC (for example Murfee et al. Microcirculation; 2005: 151-160. doi: 10.1080/10739680590904955). Indeed a major challenge in the field of mural cells is the lack of genetic markers that unequivocally distinguish pericytes from smooth muscle cells as the authors own cited reference makes clear (Armulik et al. Dev Cell 2011). Given this constraint, it is difficult to be sure whether caSMC come from genuine pericytes or indeed whether the 'pericyte-like' cells actually represent an alternative SMC progenitor or immature SMCs. This is a major problem in the field and studies identifying unique pericyte markers are urgently required.</italic> The perivascular cells in our study were termed pericytes because we found no evidence that a subset of these were distinct pericyte-like caSMC progenitors. The point that our studies cannot distinguish between a pericyte as we have defined it (Notch3<sup>+</sup>PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup>SMα–PDGFRα<sup>-</sup>, wrapping small blood vessels, and within the basement membrane) and a”pericyte-like” SMC progenitor with these exact same attributes is correct. However, by eight criteria (additional markers added in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>, and K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which includes a morphology and tissue localization that is not shared with SMCs, they appear to be pericytes. Given our extensive marker analysis, we believe our data supports the model that genuine pericytes are themselves SMC progenitors. Even if future research with additional markers showed that there is a “pericyte-like” SMC progenitor different from, but intermixed with, traditional pericytes, we believe our study would remain an important scientific advance in that it is the first to identify the cellular pathway from the epicardium to coronary artery. Specifically, epicardial derived pericytes or “pericyte-like” cells travel along blood vessels to find coronary arteries, which is critical information when searching for localized signals guiding caSMC development. We have added new text to address this point, including discussing that we cannot distinguish a “pericyte-like” progenitor from a traditional pericyte is they both display the following profile: Notch3<sup>+</sup>PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>NG2<sup>+</sup>SM-MHC<sup>-</sup>SMα–PDGFRα<sup>-</sup>, extended processes around small blood vessels, and exist within the basement membrane. Changes to the text have been made to the Introduction, Results, and Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Given the lack of specificity of the markers employed, then the clonal analysis may simply suggest that caSMC and pericytes originate from a common progenitor. The later development of MYH11 expression could equally be due to the maturation of immature SMCs that were misinterpreted as being pericytes.</italic> </p><p>We have used not only molecular markers, but morphological characteristics, i.e. wrapping small vessels and embedded within the basement membrane. By eight criteria the cells appear to be pericytes. Current studies in our laboratory are aimed at finding markers that distinguish cardiac pericytes and coronary smooth muscle. If further research allows us to distinguish a pericyte-like caSMC progenitor from pericytes, we will still have made an important discovery: that epicardial cells take a perivascular route to coronary arteries and that this progenitor looks very similar to pericytes by multiple criteria. Since we have found no evidence thus far that some of the perivascular cells are distinct pericyte-like caSMC progenitors, we believe it makes sense to identify the cells as pericytes.</p><p><italic>3) Another concern is that even if the NG2-CreER tracking was specific for pericytes (which this reviewer does not believe to be the case)…</italic> </p><p>To be as thorough as possible with the tools available, we used two lineage tracing reagents for this experiment (NG2-CreER and Notch3-CreER) and extensively analyzed NG2 and Notch3 expression in perivascular cells (see fourth paragraph of subsection “Clonal analysis of epicardial-derived cells “and revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). We concluded that these two reagents would provide good evidence that pericytes/pericyte-like cells give rise to caSMCs.</p><p><italic>…then at least some of the MYH11+ cells do not have a NG2-derived origin (see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D &amp; E</xref><italic>– a substantial number of MYH11+ SMCs are not labelled green with the NG2-CreER lineage tracer). A quantitative assessment of the proportion of MYH11+ cells from the NG2 lineage would clarify what proportionof caSMCs have at least a common origin with pericytes and to what extent there is an entirely independent pathway for caSMC development.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, lineage labeling was quantified in both pericytes and caSMCs by NG2-CreER and Notch3-CreER (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The percentage of traced cells was comparable between both cell types using both Cre lines. Since NG2 and Notch3 were expressed in all developing cardiac pericytes and, as shown in other systems, reporter gene recombination efficiency is usually not complete with CreERs, we concluded that the incomplete labeling of caSMCs is likely due to low recombination efficiency. An alternative, and not mutually exclusive, explanation is that an additional population contributes to caSMCs. Furthermore, the existence of an independent source of caSMCs does not diminish the importance of the pathway studied here. This data was added to revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) MYH11 is a specific but not sensitive marker for developing SMCs since immature SMC may not express this relatively late onset marker. Thus it is not clear whether in the absence of Notch3, caSMC do not develop at all or whether maturation is impaired. This is an important difference and needs to be clarified by labelling with other markers such as ACTA2 and CNN1 and cell counting.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern with a more extensive analysis of Notch3 mutants (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–G</xref>). We added PDGFRβ and SMα staining as well as cell counting and proliferation rates. To summarize, mural cell coverage, cell numbers, and proliferation rates were similar between WT, HET, and KO at microvessels and larger arteries. The distinction is in SM-MHC and SMα expression, which were both decreased in mutant hearts. We concluded that Notch3 is responsible for inducing the expression of contractile proteins, and therefore caSMC maturation.
