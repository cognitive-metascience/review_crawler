synaptic connections in GABAergic interneurons in the brain. Autapses in neocortical layers have not been systematically investigated, and their function in different mammalian species and specific interneuron types is poorly known. We investigated GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (pvBCs) in layer 2/3 (L2/3) in human neocortical tissue resected in deep-brain surgery, and in mice as control. Most pvBCs showed robust GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated self-innervation in both species, but autapses were rare in nonfast-spiking GABAergic interneurons. Light- and electron microscopy analyses revealed pvBC axons innervating their own soma and proximal dendrites. GABAergic self-inhibition conductance was similar in human and mouse pvBCs and comparable to that of synapses from pvBCs to other L2/3 neurons. Autaptic conductance prolonged somatic inhibition in pvBCs after a spike and inhibited repetitive firing. Perisomatic autaptic inhibition is common in both human and mouse pvBCs of supragranular neocortex, where they efficiently control discharge of the pvBCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>basket cells</kwd><kwd>immunocytochemistry</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp methodology</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>National Research Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Brain Research Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szegedi</surname><given-names>Viktor</given-names></name><name><surname>Paizs</surname><given-names>Melinda</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamsa</surname><given-names>Karri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>ERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INTERIMPACT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamas</surname><given-names>Gabor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szegedi</surname><given-names>Viktor</given-names></name><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Szeged</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Fund 4373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szegedi</surname><given-names>Viktor</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamsa</surname><given-names>Karri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eotvos Lorand Research Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamas</surname><given-names>Gabor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>National Research Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamas</surname><given-names>Gabor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>National Research Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OTKA K128863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Gábor</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamas</surname><given-names>Gabor</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamsa</surname><given-names>Karri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005881</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Human Capacities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20391-3/2018/FEKUSTRAT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamas</surname><given-names>Gabor</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamsa</surname><given-names>Karri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Abundant self-inhibitory synapses in the layer 2/3 of human neocortex strongly regulate the function of basket cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autapses are synapses made by a neuron onto itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deleuze et al., 2014</xref>).

Hence, how autaptic inhibitory circuits operate in the human brain compared to those in common experimental animals remains largely unknown.</p><p>A number of studies in rodents have demonstrated GABAergic autapses in neocortical deep layer fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (pvBCs) by showing physiological and pharmacological evidence for self-inhibition. In layer 5 of the infragranular neocortex, GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated self-inhibition prolongs the pvBC spiking interval during sustained high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci and Huguenard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manseau et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence for autapses also exists in the human epileptic infragranular neocortex, where high-frequency spike bursts are associated with autaptic GABA release from fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). However, the operation of autaptic self-inhibition in superficial neocortical layers is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>GABAergic inhibition at the perisomatic region efficiently controls spike output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feldmeyer et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, pvBCs are key players synchronizing neuronal network activity through their inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cobb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardin, 2018</xref>), and altered pvBC firing is often linked to pathological network activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dienel and Lewis, 2019</xref>).

We show that GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition is present in most pvBCs in both species and that perisomatic autaptic contacts in these interneurons suppress excitability and inhibit repetitive firing. Autapses are rare in nonfast-spiking GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that GABAergic interneuron autapses are a standard and cell type-specific microcircuit feature in the mammalian neocortex that mediates strong perisomatic self-inhibition of pvBCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We investigated autapses in 46 supragranular layer 2/3 (L2/3) pvBCs and 22 nonfast spiking interneurons (nonFSINs) in human neocortical tissue resected from frontal, temporal or occipital areas during deep brain surgery to obtain access to subcortical pathological targets (tumor, cyst, aneurysm or catheter implant). 39 basket cells were identified by their axon forming boutons around unlabeled L2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szegedi et al., 2017</xref>).

Because dense peroxidase products mostly obscured the observation of close appositions on the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>), we specifically looked for somatic autaptic junctions using electron microscopy in separate pvBCs. The analysis in two cells showing electrophysiological evidence for GABAergic autapses revealed pvBC biocytin-filled axon terminal boutons forming contacts to their own soma (1 and 4 contacts) and proximal dendrites (1 and 2 contacts), revealing postautaptic density in the neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bi–iii</xref>).</p><p>The autaptic response was readily blocked by GBZ (10 μM) (p&lt;0.001, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ci, ii</xref>) or gradually abolished by intracellular calcium-chelator BAPTA (20 mM), which suppresses action potential-dependent vesicle release (p&lt;0.001, n = 6) (Wilcoxon signed rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1di, ii</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacci et al., 2003</xref>).

Furthermore, studies on autapses in animal experiments have heavily focused on neurons in infragranular layers of the neocortex, while the function of autapses in the supragranular layers has remained unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci and Huguenard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connelly and Lees, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether robust autaptic self-inhibition is a general feature in the neocortex operating in various neocortical layers and different species (including human) or whether GABAergic self-inhibition is a specialization in deep neocortical interneurons. Our study shows that GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated self-inhibition is a regular feature of supragranular layer pvBCs in humans and mice. pvBC axon terminals self-innervate their soma and proximal dendrites, and electron microscopic investigation shows that these contacts form ‘autaptic densities’ in the interneurons. The regular occurrence of autapses in pvBCs in different species and different layers and areas of the neocortex, their robust inhibitory efficacy in pvBCs and their rare occurrence in nonFSINs show that self-inhibition is a common but cell type-specific microcircuit feature in the mammalian neocortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Robust perisomatic self-inhibition regulates pvBC excitability and firing in distinct cortical layers and in different mammalian species</title><p>Here, our results in the supragranular layer together with other studies in the infragranular layers show that autapses efficiently control excitability in pvBCs after spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci and Huguenard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connelly and Lees, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deleuze et al., 2019</xref>). Autapses are present in similar proportions and show comparable inhibitory efficacy in pvBCs of superficial and deep neocortical layers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci and Huguenard, 2006</xref>). In addition, our results here with human and mouse cells (together with earlier studies on rat neurons) confirm that autapses have similar occurrence and strength in pvBCs in rodent and human brain slices. Correspondingly, self-innervation is rare in human nonFSINs, similar to rodent nonFSINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). GABAergic self-inhibition conductance in human pvBCs is comparable to the synaptic inhibition these interneurons exert on neighboring layer 2/3 neurons.</p><p>Autaptic terminals on pvBC are heavily perisomatic, whereas nonFSINs, when autapses are found in them, self-innervate their own dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>) akin to synaptic contacts made by these interneurons to other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>). Information on the self-innervation subcellular target motifs as well as knowledge on autaptic inhibition occurrence and strength in identified neurons is essential for understanding the operation of autaptic microcircuits in individual neurons and in a neuronal network. Our results in human neocortex shed more light on this, but it is worth keeping in mind that the incidence of autaptic connectivity, and hence the strength of autaptic inhibition particularly in dendrites can be influenced by resected axons of brain slices.</p><p>In pvBCs, perisomatic GABAergic self-inhibition overlaps with much stronger AHP potassium conductance. However, the autaptic conductance onset delay and late peak time make GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated self-inhibition highly influential during AHP conductance decay. In this way, the autaptic activity strengthens somatic inhibitory conductance up to ~10 ms following a spike. We demonstrated this using a single-cell model as well as dynamic clamp experiments and showed that autaptic inhibition elongates the action potential interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci and Huguenard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connelly, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deleuze et al., 2019</xref>) through shunting inhibition in human pvBCs. GABAergic inhibition through shunting is particularly relevant in pvBCs since the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential in these cells is often close to the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verheugen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connelly and Lees, 2010</xref>). Overall, perisomatic self-innervation in human and mouse pvBCs reinforces self-inhibition after a spike. This process adjusts the pvBC firing interval and rhythmic inhibition from pvBCs to other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yilmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deleuze et al., 2019</xref>). However, autaptic self-innervation strength shows substantial variability between individual pvBCs, and therefore it is likely that autaptic GABAergic contacts undergo activity-dependent plasticity which regulates their strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffen and Maffei, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lourenço et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lourenço et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>pvBC features in humans and mice</title><p>Comparison of autapses or cell input resistance showed no difference between human and mouse pvBCs.

For the cells visualized in the figures, three-dimensional light microscopic reconstructions from one or two sections were carried out using the Neurolucida system with 100x objective (Olympus BX51, Olympus UPlanFI). Images were collapsed in the z-axis for illustration. The somatodendritic region in the 50 μm-thick section was studied for close appositions with filled axons traced back to the soma. Neurolucida explorer software was used to measure the distance of close appositions in dendrites to the soma in images visualized using the same computer software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Free-floating sections were washed three times in TBS-TX 0.3% (15 min) at 22–24°C and then moved to 20% blocking solution with horse serum in TBS-TX, 0.3% for parvalbumin (pv) staining and 10% blocking solution for vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) staining. For sections from tissue fixed with glutaraldehyde-containing solution, treatment with pepsin was applied to improve immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulyás et al., 2010</xref>). Similar treatment was applied prior to immunohistochemical reaction for ankyrin-G protein located in axon initial segment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The sections were treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin (catalog #S3002; Dako) in 0.2 M HCl with 0.1 M PB at 37°C for 6 min and then washed in 0.1 M PB. All sections were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 1% serum in TBS-TX 0.3% over three nights at 4°C, and placed in relevant fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies in 1% blocking serum in TBS-TX 0.3% overnight at 4°C. Sections were first washed in TBS-TX 0.3% (3 × 20 min) and later in 0.1 M PB (3 × 20 min) and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Lab, Inc).</p><p>The characterizations of antibodies used in humans; pv = (mouse anti-pv, 1:500, Swant, Switzerland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swant.com">www.swant.com</ext-link>, clone: 235). vGAT = (rabbit anti-vgat, 1:500, Synaptic Systems, Germany, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sysy.com">www.sysy.com</ext-link>, AB_887871).

The labeling of neurons by biocytin and immunoreactions was evaluated using first epifluorescence (Leica DM 5000 B) and then laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM880). Both pv and vGAT immunoreactions were studied in axon.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alberto Bacci (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Szegedi and colleagues describe the presence of self-inhibitory autaptic connections in supragranular layers of the human neocortex. The authors used healthy live resected neocortical tissue obtained from patients requiring deep brain surgery. Previously, the existence of autaptic contacts in neocortical interneurons was anatomically demonstrated in cats, and described to be functional in fast-spiking interneurons of rodents and humans. Despite these previous demonstrations that autaptic transmission was strong and common in PV cells of deep neocortical layers it is unknown whether it is similarly pervasive with equivalent functional effects on excitability in superficial neocortex, especially in humans.</p><p>This manuscript reports data of very high quality, as a result of a technical tour de force: the authors recorded from many interneurons of resected human neocortex, performed immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, multiple patch clamp recordings and dynamic clamp. By combining electron microscopy and electrophysiology, this paper elegantly demonstrates the existence of functional autaptic inhibition in PV basket cells of the human superficial neocortex.

We have now made cell identification results and criteria clearer to a reader. Therefore, we have added a new supplementary figure, Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We have performed more immunohistochemical analyses for the cells, and we also include firing frequency accommodation information for cells where it was tested. Thus, our update to clarify cell type identification comprises:</p><p>a) New Figure 1—figure supplement 1 clarifies cell type identification and explains how it is based on the anatomical analysis of recorded neuron’s visualised axon and the cell’s action potential inward current kinetics. Basket cells form basket-like structures around L2/3 cell somata. New Figure 1—figure supplement 1 illustrates this. Thirty-nine of 46 fast-spiking cells tested specifically for autapses were successfully visualised and anatomically confirmed as basket cells. However, because seven fast-spiking cells in the data set remain unsuccessfully visualized (and we do not have anatomical data from these cells to confirm their cell type identity), we have reformulated the first paragraph in Results section as follows: “39 basket cells were identified by their axon forming boutons around unlabeled L2/3 neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) (Szegedi et al., 2017). Seven unsuccessfully visualized fast-spiking interneurons were included as putative pvBCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).” In addition, 21 of 22 nonFSINs (showing slow axon potential inward current component) were successfully visualised and anatomically identified as non-basket cell interneurons (see also Szegedi et al., 2016; 2017).</p><p>b) Histograms in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 show the action potential inward current width (acw) separately for all identified basket cells and putative basket cells (including those studied for synaptic transmission) as well as in nonFSINs of this study. The “acw”-value of basket cells and nonFSINs does not overlap (P = 0.0001, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In addition, the unsuccessfully visualized fast-spiking cells show acw-value similar to pvBC. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1 we suggest it is more likely that these neurons are basket cells than axo-axonic cells (AACs), since our supplementary data indicate (in line with an earlier animal study) that AACs do not have autapses (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>c) We have performed new immunohistochemical tests and analyses for all cells which in the original manuscript version were reported as “pv non-conclusive” or “pv not tested”. As the updated Supplementary file 1 shows now, the pv immuno re-testing concerns 16 fast-spiking basket cells in the actual data set (studied for autapses) and 9 fast-spiking basket cells in the supplementary material (cells studied for synapses).</p><p>Importantly, these slices were initially fixed using glutaraldehyde-containing fixative and unfortunately, this compromises immunoreactions. As we report in Materials and methods, glutaraldehyde (gluAH) in fixation solution is required for high quality electron microscopy (EM) investigation. In the revised manuscript, we have used brief protein degradation pre-treatment with pepsin in these slices. The protocol has been used earlier to improve immunoreactions in gluAH-fixed rodent brain slices (we have clarified this point now in Materials and methods with a reference to Gulyás et al., 2010). The protocol helped us to confirm 11 of the 25 cells as pv+. Yet, sections for 14 pepsin pre-treated cells still failed to generate successful pv immunoreaction although we had two attempts using pepsin treatment. Those cells still remain “pv non conclusive” in the updated Supplementary file 1.</p><p>d) We have now visualised 21 of 22 non-FSIN of this study to anatomically analyse their axon and somatodendritic structure (visualization of one nonFSIN was unsuccessful). In addition, we have systematically applied immunoreaction for pv in these cells although many of these slices were fixed with gluAH-containing solution. Only pv- cells were found in the nonFSINs. The results are now shown in the updated Supplementary file 1.</p><p>e) We have also added action potential firing pattern analysis in all cells where firing response to a depolarizing step (500 ms) was taken at the end of the experiment (please see Supplementary file 1). The firing frequency data does not systematically show the ultimate maximal firing frequency of the cell. However, it demonstrates high-frequency firing capacity and small firing frequency accommodation of cells with narrow “acw”. This is important because it clearly discriminates our cells from another human interneuron cell type with a relatively fast spike waveform: a rosehip cell. Yet, unlike pv+ cells the rosehip interneurons show low firing frequency and stuttering spiking pattern (Boldog et al., 2018, cited in the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Correlation between AHP and membrane leak conductances. This is specifically discussed at the end of the Discussion, yet the raw data are not shown in the paper; instead, only the mean data are briefly mentioned (p 7).

New analyses and figures include 13 of 14 human pvBCs as well as all 11 mouse pvBCs. Both analyses show mean ± sem or median and quartiles (depending on whether the peak amplitude and the decay time constant data show parametric distribution or not). We have excluded one human pvBC in the G<sub>aut</sub> kinetics plot and simulation experiment because its small autaptic current does not allow a confident setting of decay tau. We have explained this in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Traces in Figure 3B are obscure. One might infer that the hyperpolarizing portion of the trace is the AHP, however no spike is shown. Did the modeled neuron generate a spike?</p></disp-quote><p>Spike outward current (i.e. K<sup>+</sup> current component responsible for the action potential afterhyperpolarization) but not the inward current component is simulated. Reason for this is that the inward current, whose generation is responsible for both G<sub>ahp</sub> and G<sub>aut</sub> with specific delay, precedes these conductances, and our interest in this study is in post-spike time window at time points where a second spike could be generated in the cell (as we later on demonstrate in Figure 5). In human fast-spiking pvBCs this means an inter-spike interval of 3 ms or longer as can be seen in data now presented in the Supplementary file 1 ‘firing accommodation’ column (some human pvBCs fire at 370 Hz and many at 300 Hz).</p><p>In the simulation experiments the spike inward current timing is in a central role as we now clarify in the Results; its measured peak establishes “0-time point” for G<sub>ahp</sub> and G<sub>aut</sub> conductance values. The measured delay to the action potential inward current peak is used for G<sub>ahp</sub> and G<sub>aut</sub> onset and peak times. We report these values in the manuscript Results section and in the Supplementary file 2. In addition, we have now indicated the spike inward current peak as “0-time point” in traces showing individual basket cell membrane potential in the simulation experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Wouldn't the AHP kinetics depend on the spike waveform? In that case, wouldn't the actual spike generate a shunting component, which might also affect membrane excitability during the AHP and autaptic transmission?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that action current outward component (net outward current) onset and rise phase can include some Na<sup>+</sup> ‘inward current’ conductance. Yet, the AHP outward current peak and any time point after it (particularly post-spike time points with at least 3 ms delay from action potential inward current peak we focus on) are unlikely affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors write: &quot;In all simulations, the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential was set at the membrane potential of EPSP onset (Supplementary file 2).&quot; I could not understand this sentence. Did the authors change E<sub>GABA-A</sub> depending on when the EPSP was induced? In any case, Supplementary file 2 does not report anything related to reversal potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this was presented vaguely in the original manuscript version and we apologize for it. We have rewritten the entire paragraph on the simulation experiments. We explain now more clearly the details how GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential and other parameters were set. In addition, we have updated the Supplementary file 2 with E<sub>GABA-A</sub> values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4: why are conductance (grey) traces shown as negative waveforms? The same is shown in Figure 5Ai.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected both in Figure 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write that they elicit spikes using depolarizing steps of 50 ms. If this is not an typo 50 ms would be too long to isolate autaptic responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that 50 ms depolarizing step is longer than what is required to study a time-locked autaptic response by spike. Yet, we see that holding a cell at specific depolarizing potential for 50 ms is not harmful either for autapse recording. As a matter of fact, a 25 ms or longer step helps when we determine autaptic current or I<sub>ahp</sub> decay time constant. Yet, reason why we have used such a long step here is that we wanted to regularly monitor possible network activity up to 50 ms after a FSIN spike; previous studies have shown that the unitary spike in some human L2/3 interneurons can initiate local network activity time-locked to interneuron spike (Molnar et al., 2008; Komlosi et al., 2012, both cited in the manuscript). To monitor this we used 50 ms depolarizing step so that in case such activity is generated, the voltage clamp step recovery wouldn’t contaminate synaptic currents possibly occurring during the (up to 50 ms long) activity. However, we did not detect such ‘complex event’ activity evoked by any of our pvBCs or nonFSINs, and because we think that the finding is not relevant here we haven’t reported it and therefore also specific reasoning for the depolarizing step being 50 ms was missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the same point, there is insufficient presentation of the actual protocol implemented to induce autaptic responses in FS interneurons while minimizing current distortions induced by capacitive transients and the large unclamped action currents.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added in Materials and methods the following sentences to clarify the autapse recording protocol: “We set the depolarizing current moderately stronger than rheobase current aiming to initiate single action potential or two action potentials with long inter-spike interval. Autaptic current or potential was always studied for the first action potential generated by the step.” When it comes to autapse current distortion by a voltage clamping step due to the cell fast capacitance charging, or by the action potential escape current inward component, we clarify it now in the Materials and methods that “spike-evoked autaptic outward current was uncovered by subtracting response to the depolarizing step in gabazine (average of 6 after wash-in of GBZ, 10 μM) from baseline responses.The subtraction of the responses reveals gabazine-sensitive autaptic current reliably, since the cell ‘fast capacitance’ charging current, as well as the action potential escape inward current remain stable as far as the resistance between pipette and the cell soma stays relatively unchanged. For this reason the voltage clamp experiments recording the baseline and GBZ wash-in are fairly short in this study (because during long recordings the access resistance is more likely to change).”</p><p>Finally, although we cannot claim that a single voltage clamp recording system could fully encage full kinetic feature of the autaptic and the AHP conductance rise phase or peak conductance, we can confirm that during the voltage clamp recordings the cell membrane potential did not change indicating that the gain in voltage clamp system has been sufficient to clamp the somatic membrane potential during the events. Therefore we can argue that G<sub>ahp</sub> and G<sub>aut</sub> values calculated from the current components represent fairly realistic conductance values in the soma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did not understand what 'Vcl=43 mV' means in panel Aii of Figure 2—figure supplement 1. I assume this is not the reversal potential for GABA-mediated responses, but rather the holding potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize this was not clarified well in the original manuscript version.

Our results in human neocortex shed more light on this, but it is worth keeping in mind that the incidence of autaptic connectivity, and hence the strength of autaptic inhibition particularly in dendrites can be influenced by resected axons of brain slices”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide some indications on the actual health of their slices.</p></disp-quote><p>We now report the resting membrane potential (E<sub>m</sub>) for all neurons as an indicator of health of cells (and slices).
