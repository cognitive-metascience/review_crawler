sister cell type divergence are not well understood. Here, we study a canonical pair of sister cell types, retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, to identify the key <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory features that distinguish them. By comparing open chromatin maps and transcriptomic profiles, we found that while photoreceptor and bipolar cells have divergent transcriptomes, they share remarkably similar <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammars, marked by enrichment of K50 homeodomain binding sites. However, cell class-specific enhancers are distinguished by enrichment of E-box motifs in bipolar cells, and Q50 homeodomain motifs in photoreceptors. We show that converting K50 motifs to Q50 motifs represses reporter expression in bipolar cells, while photoreceptor expression is maintained. These findings suggest that partitioning of Q50 motifs within cell type-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements was a critical step in the evolutionary divergence of the bipolar transcriptome from that of photoreceptors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48216.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans see the world through a light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina, which is made up of three layers that each contain specific cell types. The layers form a circuit, with light-sensing photoreceptor cells in the outermost layer connected to bipolar cells in the middle layer, which connect to the brain via specialized cells in the innermost layer. Photoreceptors and bipolar cells share similar characteristics and are thought to be ‘sister cells’ which evolved from a common ancestral cell type. However, it is not well understood how these two cells types diverged during evolution.</p><p>Every cell type has a specific role, which is largely determined by the set of genes that it switches on or off. Specialized regions of DNA, called enhancers, determine whether a gene is turned on or off in a particular cell type. In each cell, DNA strands are bundled together with proteins into a coiled structure known as chromatin. In some cells, a particular enhancer may be ‘shut down’ and rendered inactive on account of being tightly packed within chromatin. Whilst in other cells, the same enhancer may be ‘open’ and ready for action. For a given cell type, which genes are turned on is determined, in part, by which enhancers are open.</p><p>One way to distinguish between cells is by examining how their chromatin is packaged to see which enhancers are open. Researchers have previously characterized the chromatin structure of photoreceptor cells, but the structure of chromatin in bipolar cells, and how it compares to that of photoreceptors, remained unknown. Now, Murphy et al. have examined the chromatin profile of bipolar cells from the mouse retina in order to gain a better understanding of how these two cell types may be evolutionarily related.</p><p>The analysis revealed that although bipolar and photoreceptor cells switch on different sets of genes, the enhancers open in each cell type are very similar. Despite this similarity, Murphy et al. were able to detect subtle differences in short sequences of DNA, known as motifs, present in bipolar and photoreceptor enhancers. Further experiments showed that one of these motifs may be responsible for turning photoreceptor genes off in bipolar cells. This motif therefore appears to play a critical role in distinguishing photoreceptors from bipolar cells.</p><p>This comparison of photoreceptor and bipolar cells has provided a possible mechanism whereby photoreceptor and bipolar cells diverged in evolution from a single common ancestral cell type. This insight may help explain how complex organisms with many cell types may have evolved from a single-cell ancestor long ago.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>bipolar cell</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory element</kwd><kwd>sister cell type</kwd><kwd>ATAC-seq</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32EY029571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EY013360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY025196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbo</surname><given-names>Joseph C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY026672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbo</surname><given-names>Joseph C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbo</surname><given-names>Joseph C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While photoreceptor and bipolar cells exhibit very similar <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammars, subtle differences in homeodomain motif enrichment represent a key distinction driving the divergence in their transcriptomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex tissues require the coordinated activity of a wide array of specialized cell types. It has been proposed that cellular diversity arises in the course of evolution through a ‘division of labor’ process, in which a multifunctional ancestral cell type gives rise to descendant cell types with divergent and novel functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arendt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>). Such descendants are often referred to as ‘sister’ cell types, and typically share a range of morphological, functional, and transcriptional features while at the same time displaying key differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>). A canonical example of sister cell types are mammalian retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells (BCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamb, 2013</xref>). In a typical vertebrate retina, photoreceptors synapse onto bipolar cells, which, in turn, synapse onto retinal ganglion cells that send their axons to the brain. Bipolar cells therefore constitute the central interneuronal cell class in the vertebrate retina. In mice, an array of 15 distinct bipolar cell types, broadly categorized as ON and OFF based on their response to light onset/offset, serve as a scaffold upon which the complex information-processing circuitry of the retina is built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Euler et al., 2014</xref>). In this paper, we refer to photoreceptors and bipolar cells as cell ‘classes’, since they each comprise multiple distinct cell types.</p><p>During retinal development, photoreceptors and bipolar cells arise from the same population of OTX2-expressing progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koike et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>), share a similar elongate morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamb, 2013</xref>), and possess the molecular machinery required for ribbon synapse formation, a structure not found in any other retinal cell class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">tom Dieck and Brandstätter, 2006</xref>). In some vertebrate species, a subset of bipolar cells exhibit additional photoreceptor-like features, including localization of their cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer and the presence of an inner segment-like structure known as Landolt’s club, which extends from the dendrite to the outer limiting membrane and contains a 9+0 cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tauchi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Locket, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quesada and Génis-Gálvez, 1985</xref>). These ‘transitional’ cell types point to the evolutionary origin of bipolar cells from photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamb, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Both shared and divergent features of sister cell types are mediated by the transcriptional regulatory networks that govern gene expression in each cell type. In vertebrates, photoreceptors and bipolar cells express the paired-type homeodomain (HD) TFs CRX and OTX2, which are master regulators of gene expression in both cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Omori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hennig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbo et al., 2010</xref>). A third paired-type HD TF, VSX2, is expressed specifically in bipolar cells and is required for bipolar fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livne-Bar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 1994</xref>). Paired-type homeodomains recognize a core ‘TAAT’ motif, with additional specificity conferred by amino acids in positions 47, 50, and 54 of the homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Treisman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noyes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2008</xref>) In particular, a lysine at position 50 (K50, as found in CRX and OTX2) favors recognition of TAAT<underline>CC</underline>, whereas a glutamine (Q50, as found in VSX2) favors recognition of TAAT<underline>T<sup>A</sup>/<sub>G</sub></underline>. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in the HD toggles the TF’s binding preference for the nucleotides 3’ of the TAAT core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Treisman et al., 1989</xref>). Various bHLH TFs, which recognize E-box motifs (CANNTG), also play important roles in photoreceptor and bipolar cell gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tomita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akagi et al., 2004</xref>). For example, NEUROD1 is required for photoreceptor survival, and BHLHE22 and BHLHE23 are required for development of OFF cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bramblett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pennesi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our lab has previously shown that the <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements (CREs; i.e., enhancers and promoters) of mouse rods and cones are strongly enriched for K50 HD motifs as well as moderately enriched for Q50 HD and E-box motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we recently used a massively parallel reporter assay to analyze the activity of thousands of photoreceptor enhancers identified by CRX ChIP-seq and found that both K50 HD and E-box motifs are positively correlated with enhancer activity in photoreceptors while Q50 HD motifs have a weakly negative correlation with enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, studies of individual reporters have shown that Q50 HD motifs mediate weak activation of expression via RAX, and that RAX can either enhance or suppress the transactivation activity of CRX, depending upon RAX expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, Q50 HD motifs appear to have both positive and negative effects of photoreceptor enhancer activity, depending on context. In contrast, Q50 motifs in bipolar cells appear to be strongly repressive when bound by VSX2, which has been proposed to inhibit the expression of photoreceptor genes in bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livne-Bar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorval et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 2008</xref>). The opposing effects on transcriptional activity mediated by K50 and Q50 motifs suggest that even subtle changes in HD binding sites may mediate major differences in gene expression. Indeed, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that single base pair substitutions that interconvert Q50 and K50 half-sites within dimeric motifs are sufficient to switch the specificity of opsin expression within photoreceptor sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rister et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Photoreceptors and bipolar cells offer an attractive model system in which to examine the mechanisms of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence in evolution and development, but the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape of bipolar cells is currently unknown. To elucidate the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar of bipolar cells we isolated specific bipolar cell populations from mouse retina and obtained profiles of open chromatin and gene expression. By comparing these datasets to matching data from mouse rod and cone photoreceptors we identified differential enrichment of Q50 motifs in photoreceptor-specific enhancers and a corresponding enrichment of E-boxes in bipolar-specific enhancers. We propose that the differential partitioning of Q50 motifs in photoreceptor and bipolar enhancers was a key evolutionary innovation contributing to transcriptomic divergence between the two cell classes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibit divergent transcriptional profiles</title><p>To obtain cell class-specific transcriptome profiles of mouse bipolar cells, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify bipolar cell populations from adult mice.

We subjected OFF bipolar cells to a second round of sorting to maximize purity from the adjacent weakly fluorescent photoreceptor population. Purity of bipolar cell populations was confirmed by RT-qPCR which showed enrichment of ON- and OFF-specific genes in the appropriate populations and depletion of markers for other retinal cell classes as compared to whole retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Next, we compared the list of differentially expressed genes to a database of mouse TFs (AnimalTFDB3.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), which revealed that 394 of the differentially expressed genes encode putative transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These include TFs known to be responsible for controlling gene expression in rods (<italic>Nrl, Nr2e3, Neurod1</italic>), cones (<italic>Thrb</italic>), bipolar cells (<italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Neurod4</italic>), or both cell classes (<italic>Crx</italic>). Nearly one-third (176) of differentially expressed TFs are members of the zinc finger (ZF) family, many of which are more highly expressed in rods compared to bipolar cells but not in blue cone compared to bipolar cells. Conversely, of the top 10% differentially expressed TFs, the majority (25 of 35) are more highly expressed in bipolar cells compared to either rods or cones, and of these, most (16 of 25) are classified as HD, ZF or bHLH. Thus, the transcriptomes of bipolar cells and photoreceptors are significantly divergent, despite various functional and morphological similarities between the two cell classes.</p><p>In contrast, comparison of the transcriptomes of ON and OFF bipolar cells identified only 680 genes that were differentially expressed by at least two-fold (317 ON- and 363 OFF-enriched at FDR &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This figure is less than half of the number of differentially expressed genes identified between rods and blue cones (1,471), indicating that the transcriptomes of the two categories of bipolar cells are quite similar.</p><p>Of note, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al. (2016)</xref>, described single-cell expression profiles for bipolar cell types using Drop-seq. To compare our results with this study, we pooled data from Shekhar et al. across inferred cell types to generate ‘pseudo-bulk’ ON, OFF, and pan bipolar cell gene expression profiles. We found that expression estimates from bulk and pooled pseudo-bulk single-cell RNA-seq are well correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients range from 0.82 to 0.85, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Similarly, pairwise comparisons showed that bulk ON, OFF, and pan bipolar cell populations were most strongly correlated with their pseudo-bulk counterparts, suggesting that the two approaches yield similar cell type-specific expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Shekhar et al. also identified an ON bipolar cell type (BC5D) that expresses low levels of <italic>Grm6</italic> and could thus have been incorrectly sorted into our OFF population. To evaluate this possibility, we examined RNA-seq data for <italic>Lrrtm1</italic>, a gene specific to BC5D bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). We observed low read counts for <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> in both ON and OFF bipolar populations, suggesting that BC5D cells were not sorted into either group. To investigate further, we repeated the FACS experiments, this time also collecting cells exhibiting fluorescence levels in between those of the ON and OFF populations (termed YFP-low). We found that the YFP-low population expressed both the ON BC marker <italic>Isl1</italic> and the BC5D marker <italic>Lrrtm1</italic>, while the ON and OFF populations did not express <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that low levels of <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP expression caused BC5D cells to be excluded from both the ON and OFF bipolar populations. Given the rarity of BC5D cells, which constituted 2.3% of cells identified as bipolar cells by Shekhar et al., we believe their absence does not materially impact our analysis.</p><p>To gain insight into gene expression among individual bipolar cell types, we compared the list of genes differentially expressed between ON and OFF bipolar cells with the data of Shekhar et al. Overall, we found a strong correlation between the results of bulk ON and OFF bipolar cell expression profiling and single-cell transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Additionally, 50 of the 680 differentially expressed genes found in our bulk analysis were not present in the Drop-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These 50 genes are generally expressed at low levels, even in the cell population in which they are enriched.

This finding was unexpected given that rod photoreceptors constitute ~ 80% of all cells in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>) and indicates that the open chromatin profile of a complex tissue is not necessarily dominated by the most abundant cell type. This is in line with our previous comparison of genome-wide patterns of chromatin accessibility in rods, cones and whole retina, which showed that more than half of the whole retina peaks did not overlap with photoreceptor peaks, suggesting that they derive from non-photoreceptor retinal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). This finding may be a consequence of the distinctive pattern of global chromatin closure that we previously described in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We next set out to examine patterns of chromatin accessibility within the retinal cell types in greater detail. We combined TSS-distal ATAC-seq peaks from bipolar cells and photoreceptors with DNase-seq peaks from whole retina to create a list of 99,684 retinal open chromatin regions. Clustering these regions based on chromatin accessibility across retinal and non-retinal cell types offers a broad view of cell class- and cell type-specific regions of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found a large subset of bipolar-enriched peaks, many of which were also accessible in whole retina and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, green box). Conversely, a smaller subset of peaks showed selective accessibility in photoreceptors, with lower levels of accessibility in bipolar cells, and even less in other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red box). While pan BCs and ON-BCs showed nearly identical open chromatin profiles, OFF-BC open chromatin patterns were somewhat divergent, with slightly more accessibility in the photoreceptor-enriched subset (red box) and less in the bipolar-enriched subset (green box) compared to ON-BC. Overall, the sum of photoreceptor and bipolar cell ATAC-seq peaks accounted for 83 percent of whole-retina DNase-seq peaks, with the remainder presumably deriving from other inner retinal cell classes. These data suggest that relatively few regions of open chromatin are truly photoreceptor-specific, and that regions enriched in bipolar cells are more likely to be accessible in other tissues, particularly in brain. For instance, compared to photoreceptors, a greater proportion of bipolar cell peaks corresponded to DNase-seq peaks in brain (47% vs 37%). Finally, direct comparison of ATAC-seq peaks from photoreceptor and bipolar cells identified 55,402 differentially accessible regions (FDR &lt; 0.05), 75% of which are more accessible in bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>While we observed significant differences in global chromatin accessibility between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, the open chromatin profiles of ON and OFF bipolar cells were largely similar, consistent with the high degree of similarity between their transcriptomes. Specifically, only 4263 peaks were differentially accessible between ON and OFF bipolar cells. Of note, 79% (3359) of these differential peaks were more accessible in ON bipolar cells. When examining loci surrounding genes expressed in both ON and OFF bipolar cells, we found that ON and OFF subclasses typically had similar open chromatin profiles (e.g., <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, some ON- or OFF-specific genes exhibit cell subclass-specific patterns of chromatin accessibility (e.g., <italic>Isl1</italic> and <italic>Esam</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). We found an overall correlation between accessibility and associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) but did not see this pattern at all gene loci (e.g., <italic>Grik1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Photoreceptor and bipolar cells employ closely related yet distinct <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammars</title><p>Having compared global accessibility between photoreceptor and bipolar cells, we next sought to compare them in terms of ‘<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar’, which we define as the number, affinity, spacing and orientation of TF binding sites within the open chromatin regions of a given cell type or class. To begin, we assessed all 319 TF binding site motifs from the HOMER database for enrichment within bipolar cell open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). The most highly enriched motifs within enhancers corresponded to CTCF, K50 HD, E-box, nuclear receptor, and MADS box motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). All of these motifs were previously shown to be among the most enriched motifs in photoreceptor ATAC-seq peaks as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>). The similarity in the patterns of TF binding site enrichment between photoreceptors and bipolar cells can be better understood in the context of known patterns of TF expression in these cell classes. Specifically, the K50 HD TFs OTX2 and CRX are master regulators of gene expression programs in photoreceptor and bipolar cells. Likewise, bHLH TFs (which recognize E-box motifs) play roles in fate specification and maintenance of both photoreceptor and bipolar cell gene expression programs, as described in the Introduction. Finally, enrichment of ZF motifs recognized by CTCF in both cell classes is in line with reports that CTCF motifs often lie in ubiquitously accessible chromatin regions, where CTCF recruitment is thought to mediate interactions between promoters and enhancers, among other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Splinter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Song et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the overall similarity between the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammars of bipolar cells and photoreceptors, there are notable quantitative differences in motif enrichment between the two cell classes. To systematically identify these differences, we compared the proportion of peaks containing each of the 319 motifs between pan-bipolar cells and each photoreceptor cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The most differentially enriched motifs corresponded to those with the highest enrichment in each cell class and are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Although both photoreceptors and bipolar cells showed marked enrichment for K50 HD motifs, these motifs were more enriched in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Conversely, E-box motifs were more enriched in bipolar cells than photoreceptors. The most striking difference in TF binding site enrichment between the two cell classes was the enrichment of both monomeric and dimeric Q50 HD motifs in photoreceptor open chromatin regions and their lack of enrichment in bipolar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The most well-characterized Q50 HD TF expressed in photoreceptors is RAX, which is required for cone gene expression and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irie et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, bipolar cells express multiple Q50 HD TFs (VSX2, VSX1, ISL1, LXH3, LHX4, AND SEBOX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). VSX2 is required for bipolar cell development and is expressed in all mouse bipolar cell types throughout development and into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livne-Bar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 1994</xref>). The paradoxical absence of Q50 HD motif enrichment in bipolar open chromatin regions despite the presence of multiple Q50 HD TFs in this cell class may be explained by the observation that VSX2 acts as a repressor of photoreceptor CREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorval et al., 2006</xref>). The lack of Q50 motif enrichment in bipolar cells could be due to selective repression of photoreceptor-specific open chromatin regions by VSX2, which, in turn, prevents ectopic expression of photoreceptor genes in bipolar cells, a possibility that we will return to in the final section of the Results.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48216.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Patterns of TF binding site enrichment across retinal cell classes.</title><p>Motif enrichment patterns identified in bipolar and photoreceptor ATAC-seq datasets as well as in DNase-seq datasets from adult mouse whole retina, brain, heart, and liver.

For this analysis we compared a combined list of enhancer regions from rod and cones to that of bipolar cells. As expected, motif pairs enriched in specific peak sets tended to include motifs that showed the highest individual enrichment in the same cell type. Likewise, differentially enriched motif pairs included one or more differentially enriched motifs, such as K50 and Q50 HD motifs in photoreceptors and bHLH motifs in bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Of note, while we identified specific motif pairs enriched in each cell type, the frequencies of these pairs are consistent with an independent model (i.e., the number of occurrences of motif pairs is approximately what would be expected given the number of occurrences of each individual motif and assuming a random distribution of motifs across peaks). As with chromatin accessibility, enrichment of motif pairs is highly similar between ON and OFF bipolar cells, with nominally differentially enriched pairs showing similar proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, to investigate preferences in spacing and orientation between pairs of motifs, we plotted the density of highly enriched motifs (those depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) centered on regions flanking K50 and Q50 HD motifs in each peak set. As described previously for photoreceptors, spacing and orientation preferences in bipolar open chromatin regions were minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>).

To this end, we assigned each of the 55,402 regions identified as differentially accessible between photoreceptor and bipolar cells to a candidate target gene based on proximity to the nearest transcription start site and compared mean RNA-seq expression values for the assigned genes. As described in previous studies, we observed a modest correlation between enhancer accessibility and gene expression, and a more robust correlation between promoter accessibility and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pastor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampuja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of global chromatin accessibility suggested that many of the differentially accessible peaks were also open in other tissues, especially those enriched in bipolar cells compared to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To gain a better understanding of the cell type-specific open chromatin regions that drive gene expression differences between these two cell classes, we refined our analysis to exclude peaks shared with non-retinal cell types. We identified 8435 enhancer regions which are accessible either in photoreceptors or bipolar cells, but not accessible in brain, liver or splenic B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This set includes 1291 regions that are open in both photoreceptors and bipolar cells, and 7144 regions that are differentially accessible between the two cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that ~ 46% (3,270) of the differentially accessible peaks were more open in bipolar cells. Thus, most of the bipolar cell-enriched regions identified in the previous section were also accessible in one or more non-retinal tissues. As with the enhancer regions from the unfiltered list, assigning genes to this more retina-specific set of differentially accessible regions also shows a correlation between accessibility and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To visualize this association and identify the peaks that underly it, we plotted all 8435 peaks according to fold-change differences in accessibility and gene expression between bipolar cells and rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and between bipolar cells and blue cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We found that photoreceptors and bipolar cells differ in the expression of thousands of genes and yet have very similar <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammars. The key <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences that distinguish the two cell classes are the preferential enrichment of Q50 HD motifs in open chromatin regions associated with photoreceptor-specific gene expression and a corresponding enrichment of E-box motifs in chromatin associated with bipolar-specific expression. The cellular features and transcriptional mechanisms shared by photoreceptors and bipolar cells have prompted speculation that these two sister cell types arose from a single ancestral photoreceptor cell type via a process of progressive cellular divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamb, 2013</xref>). We propose that the elimination of Q50 motifs from bipolar-specific CREs likely played a key role in differentiating the bipolar transcriptome from that of photoreceptors during early stages of vertebrate retinal evolution. Alternatively, given the multiplicity of K50 HD binding sites within both photoreceptor and bipolar cell regulatory elements, a subset of photoreceptor-specific elements may have emerged through the simple conversion of K50 (TAATCC) to Q50 (TAATT<sup>A</sup>/<sub>G</sub>) sites. Prior studies of individual photoreceptor CREs showed a role for the Q50 HD TF, VSX2, in selectively repressing photoreceptor genes in bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Livne-Bar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorval et al., 2006</xref>). Our results generalize this conclusion, suggesting that VSX2 plays a genome-wide role in silencing photoreceptor gene expression in bipolar cells. A similar role for VSX2 has recently been described in the spinal cord, where closely related progenitor cells give rise to either motor neurons or V2a interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clovis et al., 2016</xref>). VSX2 promotes V2a identity by directly repressing the motor neuron gene expression program and by competing for Q50 sites at motor neuron enhancers. Thus, in both retina and spinal cord, expression of VSX2 promotes interneuron fate at the expense of the alternative neuronal (photoreceptor or motor neuron) cell type. These parallels suggest that transcriptional repression by cell type-specific TFs such as VSX2 represent a common mechanism for differentiating the gene expression programs of two closely related cell types.</p><p>In addition to differential enrichment of Q50 sites, we also observed enrichment of E-box motifs in regions associated with bipolar-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The lack of corresponding enrichment in regions associated with photoreceptor-specific expression suggests that bHLH TFs also play an important role in distinguishing the gene expression programs of photoreceptor and bipolar cells. It is important to note that this finding does not contradict known roles for bHLH TFs in photoreceptors, as E-box motifs are also enriched within the complete set of photoreceptor ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), as well as in the subset that exhibits shared accessibility with bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The role of bHLH TFs in establishing the cellular identity of both classes is further demonstrated by multiple loss-of-function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tomita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bramblett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pennesi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the differences between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, ON and OFF bipolar cell populations displayed striking similarities in their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape and gene expression profiles. In a paper that appeared after our profiling studies had been performed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al. (2016)</xref> documented the single-cell expression profiles of individual bipolar cell types and showed that the transcriptomes of ON and OFF cone bipolar cells are more similar to each other than to that of rod bipolar cells (RBCs). This finding implies that the ON bipolar population analyzed in the present study represents a grouping of distinct bipolar cell types (RBC and cone ON BC), which should be separated for a more informative comparison. Despite this drawback, our analysis indicates that there are relatively few differences in chromatin accessibility between bipolar cell types. We estimate that RBCs constitute nearly 60% of the cells in our ON population (RBCs compose 56% of ON bipolar cells identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>, and ~ 57% of those identified as ON BCs by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wässle et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, much of the signal in our ON bipolar RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data likely derives from RBCs. It remains to be determined whether open chromatin profiling of individual bipolar subtypes will reveal additional differences in their epigenomic landscapes beyond those reported here.</p><p>We found an imperfect correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene expression in bipolar cells. For example, ATAC-seq peaks upstream of <italic>Grik1</italic> are open in ON bipolar cells despite an absence of <italic>Grik1</italic> expression in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We observed similar instances of discordance between chromatin accessibility and gene expression in our previous analysis of rod and cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>), and other groups have documented this discrepancy in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Starks et al., 2019</xref>). Presumably, transcriptional activity in these instances requires expression of additional cell type-specific factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>), perhaps most clearly demonstrated in developmental contexts, wherein accessibility is frequently established prior to the onset of transciption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Support for the idea that bipolar cells diverged from photoreceptors via progressive partitioning of cellular function is provided by the existence of cell types in the retinas of non-mammalian vertebrates with features intermediate between those of mammalian photoreceptors and bipolar cells. In some turtle species ~ 30% of the cell bodies in the photoreceptor layer (the outer nuclear layer) belong to bipolar cells, not photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tauchi, 1990</xref>). These so-called ‘displaced bipolar cells’ possess an inner segment-like process that extends to the outer limiting membrane and contains abundant mitochondria and even a sensory-type (‘9 + 0’) cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Thus, displaced bipolar cells closely resemble typical photoreceptors except that they lack an outer segment, possess dendrites in the outer plexiform layer, and synapse directly onto retinal ganglion cells. Another intermediate type of bipolar cell occurs in nearly all non-mammalian vertebrate classes and even in some mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Locket, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quesada and Génis-Gálvez, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Young and Vaney, 1990</xref>). This bipolar type has a nucleus localized to the inner nuclear layer, but retains an inner segment-like structure (Landolt’s club), which extends from the cell’s dendritic arbor to the outer limiting membrane and contains abundant mitochondria and a sensory-type cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Locket, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quesada and Génis-Gálvez, 1985</xref>). We suggest that displaced bipolar cells and those with a Landolt’s club represent ‘transitional forms’ on the evolutionary path from photoreceptor to typical bipolar cell. The existence of these transitional forms suggests that bipolar cells may have evolved via the stepwise repression of discrete gene modules required for the development of individual cellular features, or ‘apomeres’, that are specific to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48216.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary model for the divergence of bipolar cells from photoreceptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depiction of photoreceptors (1), conventional bipolar cells (4), and two ‘transitional’ cell types with cellular features intermediate between those of photoreceptors and conventional bipolar cells: displaced bipolar cells (2) and bipolar cells with Landolt’s club (3).

We propose that the ancestral photoreceptor (possibly present in a hagfish-like ancestor) expressed cell type-specific genes via both K50 HD TFs (CRX and OTX2) and a possibly weakly activating Q50 HD TF (RAX). The emergent expression of a strongly repressive Q50 HD TF (VSX2) in bipolar cells then permitted silencing of selected photoreceptor gene modules underlying the formation of defined photoreceptor apomeres (e.g., outer segment). Selective expression of activating Q50 HD TFs in ‘transitional’ bipolar cell types may have allowed the derepression of specific photoreceptor apomeres (e.g., cilium formation, mitochondrial aggregates). Novel bipolar-specific apomeres (e.g., dendrites in the outer plexiform layer [OPL]) may have evolved via co-option of other gene expression programs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48216-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>If this evolutionary model is correct, then how can we account for the co-existence of ‘transitional’ bipolar cell types and ‘conventional’ bipolar cells in a single retina? One testable hypothesis is that VSX2 may be expressed at lower levels in transitional bipolar cell types, thereby permitting expression of additional photoreceptor gene modules and their corresponding apomeres. Alternatively, it is possible that additional activating Q50 HD TFs are expressed in transitional bipolar types, and these TFs can overcome VSX2-mediated repression of selected photoreceptor gene modules. Indeed, we and others have found that multiple Q50 HD TFs are expressed in subsets of mouse bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that transitional bipolar cell types with Landolt’s club may exist in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rowan and Cepko, 2004</xref>). Thus, individual bipolar cell types may control the number of photoreceptor apomeres they express by modulating the balance of activating and repressing Q50 HD TFs in their nuclei.</p><p>The evolutionary divergence of bipolar cells from photoreceptors likely required coordinated changes in both <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar and HD TF expression. The Q50 HD TF, RAX, is expressed in developing vertebrate rods and cones and is required for normal activation of photoreceptor gene expression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodgers et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of a RAX homolog in the photoreceptors of the tadpole larva of the protochordate, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, suggests a primordial role for this Q50 HD TF in activating photoreceptor gene expression in chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that both K50 and Q50 motifs were present in the CREs of the ancestral vertebrate photoreceptor prior to the evolutionary emergence of bipolar cells, and that both K50 (OTX2 and CRX) and Q50 (RAX) HD TFs were required for gene activation in that ancestral cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In this context, the emergent expression of a repressive Q50 HD TF (VSX2) in a primordial bipolar cell would have permitted selective repression of CREs containing Q50 motifs, allowing the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape of the two nascent cell types to begin to diverge. Maintaining expression of selected ‘photoreceptor’ genes in bipolar cells (e.g., <italic>Gnb3</italic>) would then have required the elimination of Q50 motifs from the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of those genes.</p><p>These evolutionary considerations suggest that the modern vertebrate retina arose from an ancestral retina in which photoreceptors directly synapse onto projection neurons (i.e., ganglion cells) without an intervening layer of interneurons (left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Two lines of evidence suggest that such a retina may have existed. First, the retina of the hagfish, the most primitive extant vertebrate, reportedly has photoreceptors that directly synapse onto projection neurons (i.e., ganglion cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamb, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Locket and Jørgensen, 1998</xref>). Second, some vertebrate species (including reptiles, amphibians, and larval lamprey) have an unpaired, median ‘parietal eye’ developmentally related to the pineal gland, which contains photoreceptors that directly synapse onto ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eakin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodt, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mano and Fukada, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Solessio and Engbretson, 1993</xref>). It is possible that the parietal eye evolved from the midline ‘eye’ of a protochordate ancestor, akin to the present-day ascidian larva. The simple lateral eyes of a hagfish-like vertebrate ancestor may then have emerged via co-option of the gene networks required for parietal eye development. Subsequently, bipolar cells may have arisen in the lateral eyes of early vertebrates via subtle changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar and TF expression, paving the way for the emergence of the sophisticated interneuronal circuitry found in present-day vertebrate retinas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Vsx2</italic></td><td/><td>Ensembl: <break/>ENSMUSG00000021239</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>. male and female)</td><td>CD-1</td><td>Charles River</td><td>Strain code 022</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fossat et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morgan et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP;<italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Cross between <italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP and <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCAGGS</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsiau et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td>Plasmid used to create <italic>Gnb3</italic> reporters.</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>-WT-DsRed</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><italic>Gnb3</italic> promoter region driving DsRed</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>-WT-EGFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td><italic>Gnb3</italic> promoter region driving EGFP</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #1-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #2-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #3-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #4-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #5-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- K50 #3 and #5-null-DsRed-</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- Q50 #1-EGFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- Q50 #3-EGFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>Gnb3</italic>- Q50 #1 and #3-EGFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Qiagen Mini-elute PCR Purification kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>Cat no. 28004</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>KAPA Library Quantification Kit</td><td>Roche</td><td>Cat no. 07960140001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit for Illumina Sequencing-HV</td><td>Clonetech</td><td>Cat.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cis-regulatory basis of sister cell type divergence in the vertebrate retina&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The paper has been reviewed by three excellent reviewers who have entered into an intense discussion about its strength and limitations.</p><p>As you will be able to see below, the reviewers find the comparison in transcription factor binding site usage between photoreceptors and bipolar cells to be of significant interest and worth publishing. However, the reviewers were also concerned about potential problems with the profiling of ON vs. OFF bipolar cells and the impact of the paper might depend on how well you can separate the ON and OFF bipolar cells. Only the <italic>Grm6</italic>-GFP, but not the YFP version that you have used, labels the ON BCs. If the data indeed are based on mixed ON/OFF populations, then this needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript that currently seems to implicate that the separation is perfect.</p><p>One suggestion would be to remove the entire ON vs. OFF portion of the manuscript, but in this case, the paper would be significantly weakened unless the comparison of photoreceptor to bipolar could be enhanced. The other alternative might be to combine the Shekhar et al. single cell data into ON and OFF pools and then compare them against your RNA-seq data to see if they are well correlated. If this were to be feasible, and the data were to support the separation, this would significantly strengthen the model. As for now, the comparison in Figure 2 is neither quantitative nor visually clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In order to compare the cis-regulatory features of vertebrate photoreceptors and bipolar cells, Murphy et al. analyze the transcriptomes and open chromatin landscapes of these sister cell types. The authors find that the transcriptomes are very different, while there are similarities in the usage of cis-regulatory motifs, especially K50 motifs. Interestingly, bipolar cell-specific enhancers exhibit an enrichment of E-box motifs that are bound by bHLH TFs, while photoreceptor-specific enhancers exhibit an enrichment of Q50 motifs that are bound by Q50 homeodomain TFs. Murphy et al. demonstrate that a reporter, which labels both photoreceptors and bipolar cells, can be made photoreceptor-specific by mutating its K50 to Q50 motifs. They propose that such conversion and partitioning of cis-regulatory motifs, together with the emergence of transcriptional repressors (such as VSX2 that binds to Q50 motifs), were critical steps in the evolutionary divergence of photoreceptors and bipolar cells as separate sister cell types.</p><p>This rigorous and well-written manuscript should be of interest for a broad readership, as it proposes an exciting model for how closely related cell classes are distinguished during evolution and provides a great resource for the retina community.</p><p>- Is there anything special concerning the expression and/or function subset of genes that use dimeric Q50 motifs (Figure 4)? Do they have anything else in common?</p><p>- In the first paragraph of the Discussion section: “Thus, in both retina and spinal cord, expression of VSX2 promotes interneuron fate at the expense of the alternative 'effector' neuron (photoreceptor or motor neuron) cell type.” The wording is confusing, as a photoreceptor is not an effector neuron.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Murphy et al. describe a study which combines expression (with RNA-seq) and open chromatin (with ATAC-seq) profiling of the ON-bipolar (BC) and OFF-BC cells in the mouse retina. The aim is to identify TF binding motifs that function to differentiate the bipolar cells and the photoreceptors (PRs) and then ON-BCs from OFF-BCs. I have very mixed feelings about this paper for reasons outlined below.</p><p>Authors performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on cells FACS-sorted based on <italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP and <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP to obtain BCs and to subdivide them into ON and OFF subclasses (<italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP/<italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP +/+ and +/- respectively, that can be discriminated based on brightness). However, according to Schubert et al. (2008), which describes the <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP mice, &quot;YFP is expressed in a subset of on-bipolar cells&quot;, i.e. sparsely, which allows them to do electrophysiology on these cells. If I read this correctly, this means that <italic>Otx2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup>/<italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP<sup>-</sup> population should contain a significant number of ON-BCs which did not express <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP. Why <italic>Grm6</italic> RT-PCR is clean is not clear, but other markers should also be used to rule out that ON is contaminating OFF population. Next, Shekhar et al. (2016) also found that one of the ON-BC subtypes (BC5D) expresses <italic>Grm6</italic> at low levels if at all, probably resulting in little or no YFP expression and thus these cells would sort with the OFF population. Grm6 is expressed in the Rod BCs (RBCs) which authors here group with ON-BCs for their analysis. Yet, according to Shekhar et al. transcriptomicly ON- and OFF-BCs are more closely related to each other than ON-BCs are related to RBCs. This is pretty obvious from Figure 2, left panel. All of these issues have a strong potential to muddle the ON vs. OFF comparisons and should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Indeed, perhaps the above issues are the reason why authors find that the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the ON- and OFF-BCs is &quot;complex&quot;. Yet in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C these are pretty clearly negatively correlated, a puzzling result. It would be nice to see this shown as in Figure 5C. Furthermore, this negative correlation would be interesting to explore for both, the BC vs. PRs as well as ON vs. OFF BCs. Thus, to me it seems that the strategy used in the second to last section of the Results (subsection “Photoreceptor- and bipolar-specific open chromatin regions are positively correlated with cell class-specific gene expression”) should be also applied to the ON vs. OFF, and also perhaps to be modified for the anti-correlated genes.</p><p>It is not clear to me why the authors did not use the single cell expression data from Shekhar et al. instead of their own RNA-seq data for comparison with the accessible chromatin regions. (By the way, authors' point that their pooled RNA-seq is somewhat more sensitive is a bit hollow given Shekhar et al. effort to optimize the tradeoff between the sequencing depth and the sequenced cell number.) Would it be possible to classify genes based on their expression in a particular cell type (or cell type pool) and to use the accessibility information simply to know where to look for the TF binding sites (i.e. without worrying about the enrichment of the accessibility)? If this were possible, authors could try to go deeper down the branches of the transcriptional relatedness tree from Shekhar et al., then just the first ON vs. OFF branch. A related question to this is whether (and how frequently) authors found different accessible chromatin regions for the same gene that were enriched in different cell classes?</p><p>I would remove Figure 2 (at least the right side) and Figure 2—figure supplement 2. They seem to be just reprinted Shekhar et al. data reordered according to RNA-seq &quot;lowest adjusted p-value&quot; of the present study. If authors want to compare the gene expression from the two studies, they need to find a way to pool Shekhar et al. data into PR, ON and OFF classes.</p><p>Regarding the electroporation experiments: While it is a nice idea to replace useless Q50 sites with K50 and show transcriptional repression, this experiment does not address the hypothesis posed in the second paragraph of the subsection “Photoreceptor and bipolar cells employ closely related yet distinct cis-regulatory grammars”, i.e. it does not show whether the presence of K50 makes chromatin inaccessible. Also, in the rest of the paper a distinction is made between enhancers and promoters, and the analysis of TF binding sites was done with enhancers, yet the electroporation experiment was done with a promoter (by their definition of &lt;1000bp from a transcription start site) and in fact raises doubt whether the enhancer/promoter partition used by the authors in their analysis was the biologically relevant one. Finally, this experiment relies on pairing of two different TF binding sites, while sequence analysis showed that there is no enrichment of specific pairs in PR vs. BC comparison. In fact, it is not obvious to me why the authors did not find differential enrichment of the TF binding site pairs where one site is a differentially enriched TF binding site (Q50 and E-box).</p><p>In the Discussion, the evolutionary hypothesis is a nice touch, however, given that there are no experiments actually addressing it, does it deserve such a prominent role? Meanwhile, the many interesting observations (e.g. why there is no enrichment of TF binding pairs) remain unaddressed.</p><p>Finally, a major concern is that the paper is difficult to follow and was not written with a broad readership in mind. The authors reasoning is often not clear (e.g. subsection “Bipolar cells have a more accessible chromatin landscape than either rods or cones”, first paragraph), the definitions of the terms used are hard to find (promoter vs. enhancer is defined in the legend of a figure supplement, the fact that they use &quot;TSS-distal&quot; and &quot;enhancer&quot; as synonyms is also hidden in figure legends), figure legends are not clear (e.g. Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and sometimes it is just not clear what authors mean (what are &quot;replicates&quot; in the first sentence of Figure 3A legend). Finally, the entire paper needs some re-organization (e.g. the way PR vs. BC and ON vs. OFF comparisons are written up should parallel each other).</p><p>To sum up, while I am not against the publication of at least part of this data in <italic>eLife</italic>, the paper would need a major overhaul. There are seemingly large issues to address and the analysis feels superficial.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Murphy and colleagues examine the regulatory logic governing photoreceptor- and bipolar cell-specific gene expression. They generate a considerable amount of new data to describe the transcriptome and the open chromatin regions within bipolar cells. Murphy and colleagues then compare their results with prior data from photoreceptors. Interestingly, this revealed that photoreceptor and bipolar cell genes were enriched for different types of transcription factor binding sites. In one example, they show that subtly changing the type of binding site will restrict a broader expression pattern to be only made by photoreceptors. From their data, they then extrapolate a model to explain how bipolar cells evolved from a photoreceptor ancestral state. The experiments and data analysis in this manuscript are rigorous and compelling, but would be improved by some minor modifications. While the discussion about the evolution of photoreceptors is of high interest, the manuscript would be strengthened by additional discussion of the cis-regulatory findings. Specific recommendations are listed below:</p><p>1) A couple modifications to the data analysis and figures would improve the manuscript.</p><p>a) The authors mention that zinc finger transcription factor sites are more common in photoreceptors. However, this binding site preference data is not shown in Figure 4 (except for CTCF). Showing a zinc finger example in Figure 4 would improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>b) In Figure 5C (and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D), it would help the reader to label some of the dots in these plots. For example, showing a few examples of known photoreceptor and bipolar genes. Highlighting a few discordant (black dots, e.g., <italic>Grik1</italic>) genes would help the reader as well.</p><p>c) In Figure 6D, the categorical format provides a nice summary of the data. However, a plot or table showing quantitative data and statistics would make a much stronger case that the type of binding site affects gene expression.</p><p>2) While the discussion about the evolution of photoreceptors and bipolar cells and Figure 7 are done well, it may be hard for readers to link the cis-regulatory data to the evolutionary model. In addition, there are some regulatory findings that are not discussed. The manuscript would benefit from a brief expansion of the Discussion section to address the cis-regulatory grammar findings in more detail. Addressing the following items would strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>a) Why is overall chromatin accessibility different between photoreceptors and bipolars? Does it impact the evolutionary model?</p><p>b) If bHLH factors are important for photoreceptor formation or maintenance, why are these cites depleted from mature photoreceptors? Are there differences between developmental and homeostatic/mature cis-regulatory networks?

Do they have anything else in common?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that reviewer #1 is inquiring about differences between genes which are in proximity to dimeric Q50 motifs, as opposed to those associated with monomeric Q50 motifs. To address this question, we compared lists of genes associated with peaks identified in Figure 5A (open in photoreceptor or bipolar cells, but not other tissues) which harbored either monomeric or dimeric Q50 sites, using the Gene Ontology (GO) tool PANTHER. The list of genes associated with monomeric Q50 motifs (n = 1,370) was enriched for GO biological processes relating to neuronal development, including axon guidance and dopaminergic neuronal differentiation. The list of genes associated with dimeric motifs (n = 423) was similar, but associated with fewer and more generic GO terms, including amino acid import, cell-cell adhesion, and generation of neurons. This limited analysis does not suggest that dimeric and monomeric motifs distinguish functionally distinct gene expression programs. Whether or not dimeric and monomeric Q50 sites function differently as cis-regulatory elements would require a systematic comparison of their activity, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Previous research in our lab indicates that dimeric K50 sites act as stronger activators than monomeric sites in photoreceptors (Hughes et al., 2018). Thus, it could be possible that, in bipolar cells, dimeric and monomeric Q50 sites have similar function, with dimeric motifs representing stronger repressive elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the first paragraph of the Discussion section: “Thus, in both retina and spinal cord, expression of VSX2 promotes interneuron fate at the expense of the alternative 'effector' neuron (photoreceptor or motor neuron) cell type.” The wording is confusing, as a photoreceptor is not an effector neuron.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the expression “effector neuron”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their manuscript, Murphy et al. describe a study which combines expression (with RNA-seq) and open chromatin (with ATAC-seq) profiling of the ON-bipolar (BC) and OFF-BC cells in the mouse retina. The aim is to identify TF binding motifs that function to differentiate the bipolar cells and the photoreceptors (PRs) and then ON-BCs from OFF-BCs. I have very mixed feelings about this paper for reasons outlined below.</p><p>Authors performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on cells FACS-sorted based on Otx2-GFP and Grm6-YFP to obtain BCs and to subdivide them into ON and OFF subclasses (Otx2-GFP/Grm6-YFP +/+ and +/- respectively, that can be discriminated based on brightness). However, according to Schubert et al. (2008), which describes the Grm6-YFP mice, &quot;YFP is expressed in a subset of on-bipolar cells&quot;, i.e. sparsely, which allows them to do electrophysiology on these cells. If I read this correctly, this means that Otx2-GFP<sup>+</sup>/Grm6-YFP<sup>-</sup> population should contain a significant number of ON-BCs which did not express Grm6-YFP. Why Grm6 RT-PCR is clean is not clear, but other markers should also be used to rule out that ON is contaminating OFF population.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s reasoning is sound but is based on a citation error on our part. The correct citation for the source of the <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP mouse line used in our study is Morgan et al. (2011). The line was referred to as ‘Grm6-YFP’ in that study and was also used in a subsequent study (Johnson et al., 2017, Nat. Commun, 8: 1220) where it was referred to as ‘Grm6<sub>L</sub>-YFP-DTA<sup>con</sup>’. This mouse line expresses YFP in the vast majority of ON bipolar cells and not in OFF bipolar cells. We have corrected the citation in the text and address the purity of our ON and OFF bipolar cell populations in the following points:</p><p>1) Co-labeling of <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP positive cells with a marker for photoreceptor and bipolar cell axon terminals (VGLUT1) shows that <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP positive cells terminate exclusively in the inner half of the inner plexiform layer (S3-S5), as expected of ON bipolar cells (Figure 3A, Johnson et al. 2017 Nat. Commun, 8: 1220). <italic>Grm6</italic>-YFP positive cells in the innermost sublamina of the IPL are also labelled with PKCα, a marker for rod bipolar cells.</p><p>2) RNA-seq read counts for pan-ON BC markers (e.g., <italic>Grm6</italic> and <italic>Isl1</italic>) are very high in the ON bipolar population and very low in the OFF bipolar population.</p><p>3) Similarly, qPCR for <italic>Grm6</italic> (Figure 1C) and <italic>Isl1</italic> (new RT-qPCR data, presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2) show high expression in the ON bipolar population and little or no expression in the OFF bipolar population.</p><p>4) In a new analysis (presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1) we combined single-cell RNA-seq data from Shekhar et al. to create ‘pseudo-bulk’ ON and OFF bipolar profiles for comparison to our data. We found that our RNA-seq data for ON and OFF populations correlates very well with pooled pseudo-bulk data for ON and OFF bipolar cells from Shekhar et al. In addition, we found a strong correlation between estimates of fold-change in pseudo-bulk single-cell RNA-seq data and fold-changes identified in our ON vs. OFF comparison (See response to the tenth comment below).</p><p>5) Additional analysis (see next point) indicates that a rare ON BC subtype, BC5D, is absent from both our ON and OFF populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, Shekhar et al. (2016) also found that one of the ON-BC subtypes (BC5D) expresses Grm6 at low levels if at all, probably resulting in little or no YFP expression and thus these cells would sort with the OFF population.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for highlighting the problem of low <italic>Grm6</italic> expression in BC5D cells. To determine whether BC5D cells were sorted into ON or OFF populations, we first examined the expression of the BC5D-specific marker, <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> (identified in Shekhar et al. 2016) in our RNA-seq data. We found that there were very few <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> sequence reads (&lt;100) in either ON or OFF bipolar cells, suggesting that BC5D cells were absent from both populations. Given the low-level expression of <italic>Grm6</italic> in BC5D cells, we reasoned that these cells may have fallen between the fluorescence gates used in our original FACS analysis. To evaluate this possibility, we repeated our FACS analysis, but this time we also collected cells with intermediate levels of green fluorescence which fell between the previously used ON and OFF population gates (this intermediate population is termed ‘YFP-low’). We found that the YFP-low population expressed both the ON BC marker <italic>Isl1</italic> and the BC5D marker <italic>Lrrtm1</italic>, while the newly sorted ON and OFF populations again failed to express <italic>Lrrtm1</italic>. These results (included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2) indicate that BC5D cells were likely excluded from both ON and OFF populations in our original analysis.</p><p>We believe that the absence of BC5D cells does not in any way alter the conclusions of our study. Published estimates of the prevalence of BC5D cells suggest that this cell type comprises only a small percentage of bipolar cells in the mouse retina. Shekhar et al. found that BC5D made up only 2.3% of bipolar cells analyzed by Drop-seq. Furthermore, the authors note that BC5D cells resemble the bipolar cell type identified by electron microscopy as “XBC” by Helmstaedter et al. (2013, Nature, 500:168–174). In that publication, XBC cells comprised only ~1.5% (7 out of 459 cells) of bipolar cells analyzed. We attempted to estimate the proportion of BC5D among ON bipolar cells by quantifying the number of cells in Shekhar et al. Supplementary Figure 7F, which shows a retinal whole-mount preparation labelled with <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Grm6</italic> by double FISH. Using ImageJ to identify cells by particle analysis, we counted a total of 258 <italic>Grm6</italic> positive cells in Figure 7F, indicating that the seven <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> positive cells constitute about 2.7% of ON bipolar cells. While quantifying a single field of view is by no means definitive, this number correlates well with the overall estimates of BC5D representing 1.5-2.3% of all bipolar cells. We have added a discussion of these issues to the main text (subsection “Photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibit divergent transcriptional profiles”, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Grm6 is expressed in the Rod BCs (RBCs) which authors here group with ON-BCs for their analysis. Yet, according to Shekhar et al. transcriptomicly ON- and OFF-BCs are more closely related to each other than ON-BCs are related to RBCs. This is pretty obvious from Figure 2, left panel. All of these issues have a strong potential to muddle the ON vs. OFF comparisons and should be addressed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The grouping of RBCs and cone ON bipolar cells is a drawback of our sorting approach. Our analysis nonetheless suggests that there are very few differences in chromatin accessibility between individual BC types. We estimate that RBCs constitute nearly 60% of the cells in our ON population (RBCs compose 56% of ON bipolar cells identified in Shekhar et al. and ~57% of those identified as ON BCs by Wässle et al., 2009). Thus, we predict that RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from isolated rod bipolar cells will likely resemble our ON population data quite closely. We have addressed these issues in a new paragraph in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, perhaps the above issues are the reason why authors find that the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the ON- and OFF-BCs is &quot;complex&quot;. Yet in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1C these are pretty clearly negatively correlated, a puzzling result. It would be nice to see this shown as in Figure 5C. Furthermore, this negative correlation would be interesting to explore for both, the BC vs. PRs as well as ON vs. OFF BCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We inadvertently transposed the X-axis labels of Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the original submission. We have corrected this error. In addition, we now include a comparison between ON and OFF bipolar cells as suggested by the reviewer (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, to me it seems that the strategy used in the second to last section of the Results (subsection “Photoreceptor- and bipolar-specific open chromatin regions are positively correlated with cell class-specific gene expression”) should be also applied to the ON vs. OFF, and also perhaps to be modified for the anti-correlated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We attempted to remove peaks open in other tissues from the ON vs. OFF comparison, as was done for the photoreceptor/bipolar cell comparison. However, this yielded a very small number of remaining peaks which are more accessible in OFF bipolar cells than in ON (n = 25). We think this is largely a function of the already small number of regions more accessible in OFF bipolar cells and highlights the high degree of similarity between the two datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear to me why the authors did not use the single cell expression data from Shekhar et al. instead of their own RNA-seq data for comparison with the accessible chromatin regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal was to compare chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data from identical bipolar cell populations. We therefore performed both analyses on the same populations isolated in an identical manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(By the way, authors' point that their pooled RNA-seq is somewhat more sensitive is a bit hollow given Shekhar et al. effort to optimize the tradeoff between the sequencing depth and the sequenced cell number.)</p></disp-quote><p>As described by Shekhar et al., the authors optimized their experimental approach for cost-effective discovery and classification of BC subtypes. Single-cell RNA-seq proved to be a powerful approach for unsupervised discovery of BC subtypes, characterization of BC subtype transcriptomes, and identification of BC subtype marker genes. Consistent with our results, previous comparisons of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing have suggested that bulk sequencing has higher sensitivity to detect (and precision to quantify) the transcription of genes with low expression. Therefore, we believe bulk RNA-seq from purified populations of BCs provides a complementary resource for understanding BC gene expression over a broad dynamic range. In response to this comment, we have modified the relevant section of the text (subsection “Photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibit divergent transcriptional profiles”, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would it be possible to classify genes based on their expression in a particular cell type (or cell type pool) and to use the accessibility information simply to know where to look for the TF binding sites (i.e. without worrying about the enrichment of the accessibility)? If this were possible, authors could try to go deeper down the branches of the transcriptional relatedness tree from Shekhar et al., then just the first ON vs. OFF branch.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we have performed the analysis. Unfortunately, we did not identify convincing differences in motif content between peak sets associated with different subtypes of bipolar cells. We evaluated several different strategies for associating genes identified as cluster-enriched by Shekharet al. with ATAC-seq peaks that we identified by profiling bulk populations of bipolar cells, including using peaks within 5, 10, 25, or 50 kb of the transcription start sites corresponding to cluster-enriched genes, and considering promoter and enhancer peaks separately as well as jointly. We then performed motif enrichment analysis on the resulting peak sets. We found that none of these approaches revealed strong differences in the motifs enriched among ATAC-seq peaks associated with genes from different clusters. There are several possible explanations for this result. First, the approach may not adequately enrich for cluster-specific ATAC-seq peaks (high background of shared peaks). Second, ATAC-seq from larger populations may fail to identify cluster-specific peaks in less common bipolar cell subtypes (low signal). And third, the cis-regulatory grammars of bipolar cell subtypes may be too similar to identify differences with this approach. Ultimately, ATAC-seq from purified bipolar cell subtypes and/or single-cell ATAC-seq will be required to differentiate among these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related question to this is whether (and how frequently) authors found different accessible chromatin regions for the same gene that were enriched in different cell classes?</p></disp-quote><p>A very interesting question. We certainly do find peaks near the same gene which exhibit discordant accessibility patterns. For example, using the list of 7,144 peaks identified in Figure 5A, which are either specific to photoreceptors or to bipolar cells, there are a total of 6 peaks which were associated with <italic>Prkca</italic>. Despite bipolar-specific expression, four of these peaks (one of which is highlighted in Figure 5C) are more highly accessible in photoreceptor cells, while two are more highly accessible in bipolar cells. Overall, about 15% (496 bipolar cell-enriched, and 574 photoreceptor enriched) of the 7,144 peaks are associated with genes that were also assigned to peaks enriched in the alternate cell type. Perhaps this percentage reflects the high relatedness of photoreceptor and bipolar cells. We hypothesize that this percentage would be somewhat lower when comparing elements that are specific to more distantly related cell types. Of course, these analyses depend on our ability to accurately match ATAC-seq peaks with genes, which is imperfect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would remove Figure 2 (at least the right side) and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 They seem to be just reprinted Shekhar et al. data reordered according to RNA-seq &quot;lowest adjusted p-value&quot; of the present study. If authors want to compare the gene expression from the two studies, they need to find a way to pool Shekhar et al. data into PR, ON and OFF classes.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that it is important to highlight the correlation between our data and those of Shekhar et al. For this reason, we have chosen not to remove Figure 2 or Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to pool data from Shekhar et al. for comparison with our data. Accordingly, we reprocessed the single-cell data from Shekharet al., aggregating gene-level expression estimates for pan, ON, and OFF bipolar cells by taking the weighted average of normalized counts over all cells belonging to each class (determined by their assigned cluster). We then rescaled these values to directly compare expression estimates from bulk and ‘pseudo-bulk’ RNA-seq. This analysis showed that expression estimates from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq are largely consistent (Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.85). As expected, fewer genes were detected by single-cell RNA-seq, and these tended to have relatively low expression as estimated by bulk RNA-seq. Furthermore, this analysis suggested that our sorting strategy enriched for the desired bipolar cell populations. That is, bulk pan bipolar cell data was more strongly correlated with single-cell RNA-seq from pan bipolar cells compared to rods or cones, and bulk ON bipolar cell data was more strongly correlated with single-cell RNA-seq from ON bipolar cells compared to OFF bipolar cells (and vice versa for OFF vs. ON bipolar cells). Finally, this analysis allowed us to compare the ON vs. OFF bipolar cell differential expression analysis between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. We found that the resulting fold-change estimates were strongly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78), again supporting the interpretation that our sorting strategy was effective in isolating enriched populations of ON and OFF bipolar cells. We now present this analysis in detail in the Results (subsection “Photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibit divergent transcriptional profiles”, fifth paragraph), Materials and methods section, and in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the electroporation experiments: While it is a nice idea to replace useless Q50 sites with K50 and show transcriptional repression, this experiment does not address the hypothesis posed in the second paragraph of the subsection “Photoreceptor and bipolar cells employ closely related yet distinct cis-regulatory grammars”, i.e. it does not show whether the presence of K50 makes chromatin inaccessible.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. The text (subsection “Photoreceptor and bipolar cells employ closely related yet distinct cis-regulatory grammars”, second paragraph) has been adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in the rest of the paper a distinction is made between enhancers and promoters, and the analysis of TF binding sites was done with enhancers, yet the electroporation experiment was done with a promoter (by their definition of &lt;1000bp from a transcription start site) and in fact raises doubt whether the enhancer/promoter partition used by the authors in their analysis was the biologically relevant one.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment identifies an important contrast between our analysis of candidate regulatory regions identified by ATAC-seq and our functional studies characterizing bipolar cell regulatory activity by electroporation. Regarding the biological relevance of promoter and enhancer designations, there are a variety of well-documented differences between enhancers and promoters, including GC content (Natarajan et al., 2012,Genome Res.,9:1711-22 and Wang et al., 2012, Genome Res., 9:1798-812) patterns of transcription factor binding site enrichment (Zheng et al., 2012, Nucleic AcidsRes., 43:74-83), and cell type-specificity (Corces et al., 2016, Nat. Genet., 48:1193–203). While the -1000 bp to +100 bp definition of ‘promoter’ used for data analysis is largely consistent with the size and location of depleted nucleosomes overlapping gene promoters (see Supplementary Figure 6A in Hughes et al., 2017), its main purpose is to exclude promoter sequences from the ‘enhancer’ set. This distinction is not meant to imply that enhancers cannot occur within 1 kb of the transcription start site. We believe the mouse <italic>Gnb3</italic> ‘promoter region’ contains bona fide enhancer sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, this experiment relies on pairing of two different TF binding sites, while sequence analysis showed that there is no enrichment of specific pairs in PR vs. BC comparison. In fact, it is not obvious to me why the authors did not find differential enrichment of the TF binding site pairs where one site is a differentially enriched TF binding site (Q50 and E-box).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in expecting that individually enriched TF sites would lead to pairs which are differentially enriched between the two cell populations. This is in fact the case. Our original analysis was structured to identify combinations of TF binding sites that were enriched given the baseline frequencies of each motif in each peak set. We took this approach reasoning that it was more likely to identify pairs of motifs that function cooperatively (and that the enrichment of pairs of motifs among one peak set vs. another would be trivial if one or both had already been shown to be enriched). We have now reanalyzed motif co-occurrence without normalizing for baseline enrichment. As expected, we find that motifs which are highly enriched in each tissue (e.g. E-box in bipolar cells and homeodomain in photoreceptors) appear in motif pairs which are also enriched in the respective cell population. We have updated our supplementary figure accordingly (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In addition, we state the result of the original analysis: although specific pairs are enriched in one peak set vs. another, the frequencies of peaks with one or both motifs are consistent with an independent model. Please see the last paragraph of the subsection “Photoreceptor and bipolar cells employ closely related yet distinct cis-regulatory grammars”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, the evolutionary hypothesis is a nice touch, however, given that there are no experiments actually addressing it, does it deserve such a prominent role?

Please see the above comment in regard to motif co-enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a major concern is that the paper is difficult to follow and was not written with a broad readership in mind. The authors reasoning is often not clear (e.g. subsection “Bipolar cells have a more accessible chromatin landscape than either rods or cones”, first paragraph), the definitions of the terms used are hard to find (promoter vs. enhancer is defined in the legend of a figure supplement, the fact that they use &quot;TSS-distal&quot; and &quot;enhancer&quot; as synonyms is also hidden in figure legends), figure legends are not clear (e.g. Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and sometimes it is just not clear what authors mean (what are &quot;replicates&quot; in the first sentence of Figure 3A legend).

To clarify this point, we have changed ‘enrichment’ to ‘expression’. Otherwise, zincfinger motifs are in fact highly enriched in both tissues, specifically those corresponding to CTCF and BORIS (a homolog of CTCF with a similar binding site preference). The CTCF motif is actually more highly enriched in bipolar cells than in either rods or cones. Other zincfinger motifs are also differentially enriched, such as PRDM1 and PRDM9 (higher in bipolar cells) and ZNF711, ZNF467 (higher in photoreceptors). However, these motifs are not highly prevalent in the enhancers of either cell type, making density plots as in Figure 4 relatively uninformative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Figure 5C (and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D), it would help the reader to label some of the dots in these plots.

Specifically, the data from Figure 5 is derived from peak sets that are specific to either photoreceptor or bipolar cells. When all regions of accessibility are considered (as in Figure 4), both photoreceptor and bipolar cells show an overall enrichment of E-box motifs, albeit to a different degree. As such, the lack of E-box motif enrichment in the peak set specific to photoreceptors does not necessarily mean that E-box motifs are depleted from the cis-regulatory regions of mature photoreceptors. Rather, this shows that within the specific subset of peaks which are accessible in photoreceptors but not in bipolar cells or other cell types, E-box motifs are not observed in high density. The importance of E-box motifs in photoreceptor cis-regulation is indicated by the high density of E-box motifs within the set of peaks that are shared by photoreceptors and bipolar cells, but not other cell types (Figure 5C, second panel from the right). We expect that there is variation in cis-regulatory networks throughout development, and that these changes are likely to vary from cell type to cell type. It would be interesting to profile and compare the cis-regulatory landscape of developing photoreceptor and bipolar cells in future studies. We now address these points in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Why are bZIP sites (e.g., Nrl) strong in green cones and modest in rods (Figure 4)?</p></disp-quote><p>The significance of the difference in bZIP motif enrichment in rod and cone open chromatin is an interesting and unanswered question. One possibility is that these motifs are bound by NRL (a MAF-type bZIP TF) in rods and by another currently unknown bZIP TF in cones. For example, we previously found that MAF (a MAF-type bZIP TF) is expressed in adult mouse cones (at low levels) but not in rods (see Supplementary Table 6 in Hughes et al., 2017). Additional work is needed to evaluate this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Why do some genes (e.g., Grik1) behave in a discordant fashion?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. Our observation that there is a correlation between accessibility and gene expression is consistent with previous reports in photoreceptors (Hughes et al., 2017) and other cell types (de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018 and Starks et al., 2019). However, the correlation is not perfect (i.e., accessibility is not sufficient for expression or enhancer activity). For example, the mouse LCR, an enhancer which drives expression of red/green cone opsin (<italic>Opn1mw</italic>), is open in both rods and cones, despite its cone-specific expression (Hughes et al., 2017). Similarly, in developmental contexts, regions that are ‘poised’ exhibit accessibility yet remain inactive until later developmental timepoints (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014 and Schulz et al., 2015, Genome Res., 25:1715-26). Presumably, transcriptional activity in these instances requires expression of additional cell type-specific factors. We now address this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
