degeneration is a complication arising from a variety of chronic diseases including advanced cancer. Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α plays a pivotal role in mediating cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration. Here, we show a novel function for retinoblastoma protein (Rb), where Rb causes sarcomeric disorganization. In human skeletal muscle myotubes (HSMMs), up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and concomitant phosphorylation of Rb was induced by TNF-α treatment, resulting in the translocation of phosphorylated Rb to the cytoplasm. Moreover, induced expression of the nuclear exporting signal (NES)-fused form of Rb caused disruption of sarcomeric organization. We identified mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1), a potent actin nucleation factor, as a binding partner of cytoplasmic Rb and found that mDia1 helps maintain the structural integrity of the sarcomere. These results reveal a novel non-nuclear function for Rb and suggest a potential mechanism of TNF-α-induced disruption of sarcomeric organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01228.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01228.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01228.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skeletal muscles, such as the biceps and calves, are one of three main muscle groups in the body, and a range of chronic diseases—including cancer, heart disease and AIDS—can cause wasting and a loss of strength in these muscles. Many different cellular processes are known to be involved in the degeneration of skeletal muscle during illness.</p><p>For example, in people suffering from cancer, the immune response produces large numbers of molecules called inflammatory cytokines to combat the cancer cells, and these molecules are thought to have a role in the breakdown of skeletal muscle. A cytokine called tumour necrosis factor alpha, or TNF-α for short, is thought to cause muscle damage, but the details of this process are not fully understood.</p><p>One possibility is that TNF-α interacts with a protein called Rb—short for retinoblastoma protein—that suppresses the proliferation of cells that leads to cancer. However, if this protein is modified by a chemical process called phosphorylation, the Rb molecules will not be able to suppress the genes that lead to excessive cell growth. The hyperphosphorylation of Rb has been observed in many cancer cells, and it has been shown that high levels of TNF-α in cells results in Rb not working properly, but it has not been clear if faulty Rb also leads to the breakdown of skeletal muscle.</p><p>Now Araki et al. provide evidence that the phosphorylation of Rb by TNF-α leads to skeletal muscle degeneration. Araki et al. found that in muscle cells that contain high concentrations of TNF-α, the Rb molecules move from the nuclei of the cells, where they interact with genes, to the cytoplasm, where they disrupt the formation of structural fibres. This means that Rb inhibits the ability of muscle cells to slide over one during contractions and relaxation, as happens in normal muscle tissue. If confirmed by further experiments, these results could lead to the development of new approaches for the treatment of skeletal muscle degeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01228.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01228.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retinoblastoma protein</kwd><kwd>CDK</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>sarcomeric organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore National Research Foundation and the Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taya</surname><given-names>Yoichi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawauchi</surname><given-names>Keiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TNF-α treatment induces phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of the retinoblastoma protein, which regulates cytoskeletal organization in skeletal muscle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle degeneration, which is characterized by the progressive depletion of muscle strength, occurs in a variety of chronic diseases including advanced cancer, congestive heart failure, and AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tisdale, 2002</xref>). The underlying intercellular mechanism is currently thought to be multifactorial. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, have been shown to be key mediators of cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tisdale, 2002</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seruga et al., 2008</xref>). Elevated levels of TNF-α precede the onset of cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration and act through several cancer-related signaling pathways such as the p53 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guttridge et al., 2000</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2004</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwarzkopf et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) prevents tumor formation by inducing differentiation, controlling cell-cycle progression, and maintaining genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>). To date, numerous studies of Rb function have focused on the transcriptional regulation of E2F. Rb forms a transcriptional repressor complex with two protein groups, E2F transcription factors and LXCXE motif-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halaban, 2005</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>). Rb activity is regulated by sequential phosphorylation on several serine and threonine residues, first by cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and then by cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halaban, 2005</xref>). This serial phosphorylation of Rb induces dissociation of the transcriptional repressor complex, allowing expression of E2F-target genes, which are required for many cellular processes. Loss of Rb function in many cancer cells is frequently caused by aberrant CDK-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau and Wang, 2003</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>). Consequently, selective CDK inhibition is considered a potentially useful approach for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>). In addition, inactivation of Rb, which is induced by TNF-α treatment, has been shown to lead to various cellular behaviors including proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rastogi et al., 2012</xref>) and apoptosis of fibroblasts and aortic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau and Wang, 2003</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rastogi et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a non-nuclear function of Rb has been reported; where Rb at the mitochondria participates in TNF-α-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilgendorf et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether the Rb pathway is involved in cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration mediated by TNF-α.</p><p>A sarcomere is the basic functional unit of striated muscle and consists of two sets of filaments: thick and thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Squire, 1997</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautel, 2011</xref>). The thick filaments are composed of myosin proteins and the thin filaments are assembled from polymerized actin monomers, called filamentous actin (F-actin). The contractile activity of skeletal muscle is achieved through the actin and myosin filaments sliding past one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Squire, 1997</xref>). The motor function of striated muscle therefore, requires the well-ordered assembly of sarcomeres, which is closely tied to the highly organized actin cytoskeleton. The formins are a large family of proteins and are characterized by the presence of the conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kovar, 2006</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). The FH2 domain promotes actin nucleation and polymerization, thereby producing long straight actin filaments and regulating cytoskeletal organization. It has been reported that several members of the formin family serve as key regulators of actin dynamics during sarcomeric organization in striated muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kan et al., 2012</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we present a potential mechanism underlying TNF-α-induced skeletal muscle degeneration. We propose a novel function for Rb; where Rb disrupts sarcomeric organization in human skeletal muscle myotubes (HSMMs) following its phosphorylation and translocation into the cytoplasm. Our study implicates the tumor suppressor protein in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of Rb are induced by TNF-α treatment</title><p>To gain insights into the role of Rb in cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration, we first examined the phosphorylation kinetics and subcellular localization of Rb in TNF-α-treated HSMMs. For this purpose, cells were pretreated with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ, 100 ng/ml) for 8 hr prior to initial TNF-α treatment in order to promote cellular sensitivity to the effects of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsujimoto et al., 1986</xref>). During differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes (from day 0 to day 4), Rb shifted from a phosphorylated to an unphosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, following TNF-α treatment Rb phosphorylation on the CDK4-specific phosphorylation site, serine 780 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitagawa et al., 1996</xref>), was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was not observed on threonine 821, a CDK2-specific phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halaban, 2005</xref>). In untreated HSMMs, Rb was primarily present in the nucleus, but translocated to the cytoplasm after TNF-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In addition, we found that phosphorylated Rb in TNF-α-treated HSMMs was predominantly located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In accordance with the induction of Rb phosphorylation on a CDK4-specific phosphorylation site, TNF-α treatment led to an increase in the level of nuclear CDK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The vast majority of nuclear Rb was in an unphosphorylated state, while cytoplasmic Rb that accumulated after TNF-α treatment was in a phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then tested whether TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb is caused by CDK4-mediated Rb phosphorylation. When CDK4 was depleted by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb induced by TNF-α was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4 triggers its cytoplasmic translocation in HSMMs.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01228.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TNF-α induces cytoplasmic translocation of Rb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) HSMMs were treated with TNF-α for 2 days.

Lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) 2α, a binding partner of nucleoplasmic A-type lamins, interacts with S780-phosphorylated Rb in mitotic myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markiewicz et al., 2005</xref>) and is known to play an important role in nuclear tethering of Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markiewicz et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, when LAP2α was depleted by shRNA in human myoblasts, Rb localized to the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given the level of LAP2α decreased during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markiewicz et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), these results suggest that low-level LAP2α expression in HSMMs facilitates the cytoplasmic translocation of Rb.

In response to electric pulse stimulation (EPS), which evokes a contractile reaction in myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>), approximately 55% of HSMMs displayed beating, an index of contractile reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), while it was hardly observed after TNF-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

In untreated HSMMs, α-actinin was observed at evenly spaced intervals, whereas in TNF-α-treated HSMMs the peak-to-peak distance in line plots of α-actinin intensity along the myofibril was larger and inconsistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>).

Next, we directly examined whether cytoplasmic Rb is capable of disrupting sarcomeric organization. To this end, HSMMs were infected with adenoviruses expressing a heterologous nuclear exporting signal (NES)-fused form of Rb, which was tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein mCherry and influenza hemaglutinin (HA) at its amino-terminus (mCherry-HA-NES Rb). Given a small population of endogenous Rb was localized in the cytoplasm after TNF-α treatment, we expressed NES Rb at a comparable level to TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic Rb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, asterisk vs the open arrowhead).

Data from purified wild-type and LXCXE motif-deleted mutant mDia1 proteins (WT and ΔLXCXE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) showed that binding of mDia1 to Rb was abolished by deletion of the LXCXE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Although differences in the patterns of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 have been reported, we failed to detect the selective phosphorylation of Rb by our in vitro phosphorylation system, which may be due to a supraphysiological activity of CDKs in vitro.

The mutant Rb exhibited substantial interaction with mDia1 even after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of Rb on CDK4 phosphorylation sites alone does not impair its interaction with mDia1 and TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic Rb has the potential to interact with mDia1.</p><p>Muscle wasting/atrophy accompanies cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tisdale, 2002</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharyya et al., 2004</xref>).

TNF-α induces CDK4 activation and the concomitant phosphorylation of Rb. Subsequently, cytoplasmic translocation of Rb is triggered. Cytoplasmic Rb disrupts sarcomeric organization, which may be caused by dysfunction of mDia1. The precise role of mDia1 in the regulation of sarcomeric organization is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sparrow and Schock, 2009</xref>), but the contribution of mDia1 to sarcomeric organization is supported.

The importance of actin nucleation factors for the periodic assembly of sarcomeres is proposed by the recent observations that depletion of actin nucleation factors, such as Fhod3 and leiomodin, results in disordered α-actinin distribution in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chereau et al., 2008</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>).

In contrast, although TNF-α treatment induced Rb phosphorylation, the expression of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and <italic>Tfam</italic> decreased after TNF-α treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Remels et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). These findings suggest that other TNF-α-induced signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB pathway, may affect the transcriptional activity of E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2008</xref>) and/or regulation of the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Remels et al., 2010</xref>). The contractile activity of skeletal muscle is caused by the sliding of thick and thin filaments in the sarcomere, and this sliding action is intimately linked to the proper control of adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Squire, 1997</xref>). Because mitochondria are responsible for cellular ATP production, incomplete restoration of the percentage of beating cells by mDia1 ΔGBD/ΔDAD might be ascribed to an impairment of mitochondrial function caused by TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>In cancer patients, the circulating levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ would be lower than the amounts used in this study. Monocytes/macrophages infiltrate in atrophied muscles and may produce considerable amounts of these inflammatory cytokines. It may therefore be possible that the local concentrations of TNF-α and IFN-γ are elevated in atrophied muscles, which then contributes to phosphorylation of Rb in the long-term. TNF-α-induced skeletal muscle degeneration is achieved through multiple mechanisms. The results presented in this study propose a novel non-nuclear function for Rb, which is independent of the transcriptional regulation of E2F and may be involved in TNF-α-induced skeletal muscle degeneration. In the future, it would be interesting to clarify the role of mDia1 and determine how cytoplasmic Rb disrupts sarcomeric organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Early passage human skeletal myoblasts purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Lonza-supplied growth medium (SkGM-2 BulletKit).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. We concur that several important issues need to be addressed during revision:</p><p>1) More controls are needed for experiments investigating Rb localization, given the tiny amount of protein that localizes to the cytoplasm in over-expression experiments. Antibody specificity should also be verified, for example in null or knocked down cells.</p><p>2) The absence of data on endogenous Rb raises concerns on the real biological significance of the phenomenon described.

Antibody specificity should also be verified, for example in null or knocked down cells</italic>.</p><p>In order to corroborate the reliability of our data regarding TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic translocation of Rb, we carried out the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation experiments of TNF-α-treated HSMMs in parallel with HSMMs infected with adenoviruses expressing mCherry-HA-Rb or mCherry-HA-NES Rb (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, the vast majority of the exogenous Rb proteins were localized in the nucleus (mCherry-HA-Rb) and the cytoplasm (mCherry-HA-NES Rb). These proteins can therefore be used for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, asterisk) and the reliability of our subcellular fractionation experiments are supported as these exogenous Rb proteins properly fractionated into the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. We confirmed that in untreated HSMMs, Rb was primarily present in the nucleus and phosphorylated Rb accumulated in the cytoplasm after TNF-α treatment. In addition, we have verified the specificity of Rb antibodies used in immunofluorescence microscopy. The epifluorescence microscopy data clearly shows that the immunofluorescence signal of these antibodies was significantly weakened in Rb knocked down HSMMs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The information regarding epifluorescence microscopy has been now included in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>2) The absence of data on endogenous Rb raises concerns on the real biological significance of the phenomenon described. While addressing this issue may be technically demanding, it is felt that the novelty of this work will be met with skepticism unless the data are really solid and unquestionable</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern. Our new data suggests endogenous Rb contributes to TNF-α-induced sarcomeric disorganization because TNF-α failed to induce sarcomeric disorganization in Rb knocked down HSMMs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see also author response 4). In addition, given that Rb phosphorylation was partially induced by TNF-α treatment and a small population of endogenous Rb was localized in the cytoplasm, we have examined whether TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic Rb is sufficient for the biological function of Rb in the cytoplasm. To address this issue, we have expressed a NES-fused form of Rb at a comparable level to TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic Rb (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, asterisk versus the open arrowhead). Under this condition, the repeating pattern of α-actinin distribution was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>), which was the same as TNF-α-treated HSMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). These results suggest that TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of Rb yields sufficient cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb, which may have a pivotal role in TNF-α-induced sarcomeric disorganization.</p><p><italic>3) As Rb is known to interact with many proteins, details regarding the mass spec experiments that identified cytoplasmic partners of Rb should be provided, and the reason for selecting specifically mDia1 should be explained</italic>.</p><p>We have now described the information regarding mass spectrometry experiments in greater detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and in the Materials and methods section. The lists of identified proteins are also shown. Sarcomeric disorganization was induced by NES Rb wild-type, but not by NES Rb lacking exon 22. Because the exon 22-deleted mutant Rb is known to be an LXCXE-binding deficient mutant, we hypothesized that the function of cytoplasmic Rb is rendered through its interaction with LXCXE motif-containing proteins. This critical point was therefore addressed, as highlighted by the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Among the proteins identified (∼27 proteins), we focused on mDia1 (DIAPH1) because only mDia1 contains the LXCXE motif. In addition, “it is noteworthy that the band including mDia1 was hardly detected in mCherry-HA-NES Rb Δexon 22-expressing HSMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, band 1).” This sentence has been now included in the Results section of our revised manuscript because it further supports our idea that mDia1 is a candidate of NES Rb-binding protein and is involved in the function of NES Rb WT.</p><p><italic>4) Testing whether TNF-alpha fails to disrupt sarcomeres in Rb null or knocked down myotubes is also an essential control that is currently missing</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ comment, we have generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing shRNA against human Rb (sh-Rb) and tested whether TNF-α fails to disrupt sarcomeric organization in Rb knocked down HSMMs. Suppression of Rb expression by shRNA was validated by immunoblotting and epifluorescence microscopy (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The sequence for sh-Rb was added to the Materials and methods section. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, TNF-α-induced sarcomeric disorganization was attenuated in sh-Rb-expressing HSMMs when compared to control shRNA-expressing HSMMs. These results support our idea that TNF-α-induced cytoplasmic Rb is important for TNF-α-induced sarcomeric disorganization.</p><p><italic>5) Other points to be clarified are the pre-treatment with IFN and the very high dose of TNF-alpha. Is the effect observed only with combination of the two molecules and only at this high dose</italic>?</p><p>We have tested the cells treated with different concentrations of TNF-α (10 or 100 ng/ml) with or without IFN-γ pretreatment. Both phosphorylation of Rb and cytoplasmic translocation of Rb were hardly induced by a high dose of TNF-α (100 ng/ml) alone or a low dose of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in combination with IFN-γ pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>). The amount of TNF-α and IFN-γused in this study would be greater than their circulating levels in cancer patients, but supraphysiological activity of TNF-α is likely to be required in order to obtain a more efficient response in cultured human myotubes. We have now provided relevant discussion in our revised manuscript.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>HSMMs were treated with TNF-α (10 or 100 ng/ml) for 2 days with or without IFN-γ pretreatment (100 ng/ml, 8 hr).
