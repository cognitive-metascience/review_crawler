transcriptional silencing <italic>in cis</italic> to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a poorly understood mechanism. Here we show that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> a single DSB causes transcriptional inhibition of proximal genes independently of Tel1/ATM and Mec1/ATR. Since the DSB ends undergo nucleolytic degradation (resection) of their 5′-ending strands, we investigated the contribution of resection in this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition. We discovered that resection-defective mutants fail to stop transcription around a DSB, and the extent of this failure correlates with the severity of the resection defect. Furthermore, Rad9 and generation of γH2A reduce this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition by counteracting DSB resection. Therefore, the conversion of the DSB ends from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, which is necessary to initiate DSB repair by homologous recombination, is responsible for loss of transcription around a DSB in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08942.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08942.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08942.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA is constantly under assault from harmful chemicals; some of which are produced inside the cell, while others come from outside of the cell. Breaks that form across both strands in a DNA double helix are considered the most dangerous type of DNA damage, and can cause a cell to die or become cancerous if they are not repaired accurately.</p><p>‘Homologous recombination’ is one of the main mechanisms used by cells to repair DNA double-strand breaks. This mechanism requires enzymes to eat away at the end of one of the DNA strands on each side of the double-strand break. This process is called ‘resection’ and it exposes single strands of DNA. These single-stranded DNA ‘tails’ are then free to interact with an intact copy of the same DNA sequence from elsewhere in the cell's nucleus, which is used as a guide when repairing the damage.</p><p>The proteins involved in homologous recombination have to work around other processes that go on inside the nucleus, such as the transcription of DNA in genes into RNA molecules. Previous research has reported that forming a double-strand break in the DNA reduces the levels of transcription for the genes that surround the break, but it was not clear how this occurred.</p><p>In mammalian cells, inhibiting the transcription of genes around a double-strand DNA break depends on a signaling pathway that is activated whenever DNA damage is detected. Manfrini et al. now show that this is not the case for budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>). Instead, the experiments indicate that it is the resection of the DNA around a double-strand break to form single-stranded tails that inhibits transcription in budding yeast. One of the next challenges will be to see if the resection process makes any contribution to changes in the transcription of genes that surround a double-strand break in mammals as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08942.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08942.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

particularly dangerous for cells, since their inefficient or inaccurate repair can result in deletions and chromosomal translocations that can lead to cancer and/or severe developmental abnormalities in humans. DSB formation leads to activation of a complex DNA damage response (DDR), whose key players are highly conserved protein kinases, which include human ATM and ATR, as well as their <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> orthologs Tel1 and Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gobbini et al., 2013</xref>). Once activated by DSBs, ATM/Tel1 and ATR/Mec1 promote DSB repair, delay cell cycle progression or trigger the elimination of genetically unstable cells by inducing cell death.</p><p>One of the main mechanisms to repair DSBs is homologous recombination (HR), which requires resection of the broken ends in order to generate 3′-ended single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that invade the homologous undamaged template. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, DSB resection is initiated by the evolutionarily conserved MRX (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2) complex that, together with Sae2, catalyzes the initial processing of the DSB ends. The 5′-ending strands can then be further degraded by two other machineries depending on Exo1 and Sgs1-Dna2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, the DDR proteins function in the context of a highly organized chromatin environment that needs to be overcome to gain access to damaged DNA. Histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins help to overcome this barrier by altering chromatin structure at the site of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Price and D'Andrea, 2013</xref>). One of the most characterized histone modifications is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX by ATM/Tel1 and ATR/Mec1, which spreads away from the DSB into large domains of surrounding chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Downs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>). Other chromatin alterations detected at DSBs are associated with open and decondensed chromatin, indicating that chromatin at DSBs undergoes a transition to a more open, less compact conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Price and D'Andrea, 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, several proteins associated with repressive or transcriptionally inactive chromatin, including HP1, PcG (Polycomb group) proteins, PRMD2 methyltransferase, KAP-1, su(var)3-9 methyltrasferase variant (SUV3-9) and the macrohistone variant macroH2A1, are recruited to DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soria et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that repressive chromatin can be generated around DSBs. Consistent with this hypothesis, generation of several DSBs distal to the promoter of a reporter gene in mammalian cells leads to ATM-dependent transcriptional repression of this reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>), possibly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional elongation factor ENL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ui et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription of rDNA is inhibited in an ATM-dependent manner in the vicinity of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kruhlak et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the steady state RNA levels of genes proximal to a single DSB have been observed to decrease by microarray analysis also in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>However, a different study in mammalian cells, where individual DSBs were induced at discrete endogenous sequences, showed that only transcription of the DSB-containing gene was affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pankotai et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, non-coding RNAs that control DDR activation are induced in the surrounding of DSBs in both vertebrates and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Francia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michalik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that transcription can occur around DSBs.</p><p>Given these apparently contrasting results, other studies are required to understand how DSBs affect transcription in their surroundings. Furthermore, as DSBs are resected to generate 3′-ended ssDNA, and ATM, macroH2A1, PRMD2 and HP1 proteins are required for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jazayeri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soria and Almouzni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khurana et al., 2014</xref>), whether DSB resection has a role in the DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition needs to be investigated.</p><p>By using the budding yeast HO endonuclease to create single DSBs at different chromosomal loci, we show that DSB induction causes Mec1- and Tel1-independent transcriptional inhibition of genes surrounding the DSB site. Failure to resect the DSB ends prevents this transcriptional inhibition, which is instead enhanced by accelerating the resection process. Altogether, these data indicate that loss of transcription around a DSB in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells is due to the conversion of DSB ends from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to ssDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription is reduced <italic>in cis</italic> to a DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus</title><p>To investigate changes in the transcription of genes surrounding DSBs, we took advantage of a yeast haploid strain (JKM139) where a single DSB can be generated at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus by galactose-induced expression of the HO endonuclease. As the homologous donor sequences <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are deleted in this strain, this DSB cannot be repaired by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). We previously used this strain for total RNA-seq analysis of protein-coding gene expression upon induction of the HO-induced DSB to show that mRNA levels of the vast majority of protein-coding genes underwent no significant change upon DSB generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manfrini et al., 2015</xref>). Here we focused on the <italic>MAT</italic> locus that was not analyzed in the previous study. We mapped the RNA-seq data from two biological replicates of the JKM139 wild-type strain grown in raffinose (time zero, T0) and shifted to galactose-containing medium for 60 (T60) and 240 (T240) min on a restricted reference ‘genome’ corresponding to the <italic>MAT</italic> locus ±10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative analysis of tag densities for annotated genes in this region revealed a moderate signal decrease for the DSB-proximal genes 60 min after HO induction, and a strong signal reduction along the whole region after 240 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, after 240 min of HO induction, density for the proximal genes <italic>BUD5</italic>, <italic>HMRA2</italic>, <italic>HMRA1</italic> and <italic>TAF2</italic> showed a ≥10-fold decrease compared to time zero, while density was only reduced by about twofold for the distal genes <italic>SNT1</italic>, <italic>IMG1</italic> and <italic>BUD23</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08942.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Decrease of RNA levels around a DNA double-strand break (DSB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strand-specific RNA-seq data from the two biological replicates of wild type strain (JKM139) before (time zero, T0) and 60 (T60) or 240 (T240) min after HO induction, were uniquely mapped to the <italic>MAT</italic> locus ±10 kb.

Thus, loss of transcription around a DSB in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is due to the conversion of dsDNA to ssDNA by the resection machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we further extend the observation that induction of a DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells leads to a decrease of the RNA steady state levels of proximal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2000</xref>), by demonstrating that this decrease is not locus specific and is due to dissociation of RNA polymerase II from its template DNA. In contrast to the reported requirement of mammalian ATM for transcription silencing around a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kruhlak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ui et al., 2015</xref>), neither Tel1 nor Mec1 appear to be necessary for transcriptional inhibition at the DSB site in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Instead, we found that mutants defective in DSB resection fail to inhibit transcription around a DSB, and the extent of this failure correlates with the severity of the DSB resection defect. Furthermore, accelerating DSB resection by preventing γH2A generation or by eliminating Rad9 enhances this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that loss of transcription around a DSB in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is not due to an active regulatory mechanism, but to the conversion of the DSB ends from dsDNA to ssDNA.</p><p>Nucleolytic processing of the template DNA strand should stop transcription of the corresponding gene. However, we found that mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II occupancy around a DSB decrease independently of the strand that is transcribed, indicating that loss of non-template DNA strands also impedes transcription. Therefore, the most likely reason of why the conversion from dsDNA to ssDNA stops transcription is that the transcription machinery binds only dsDNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that within a region containing a stretch of dsDNA preceding a single-strand 3′ DNA end, purified RNA polymerase II transcribes within the dsDNA portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lilley and Houghton, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kadesch and Chamberlin, 1982</xref>). Furthermore, structural analyses of transcription initiation reveals that RNA polymerase II and its associated General Transcription Factors bind double-stranded promoter DNA to form a closed preinitiation complex (PIC), where the transcriptional machinery interacts with both template and non-template DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sainsbury et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, removal of either the template or non-template strands prevents binding of T7 RNA polymerase to the promoter, supporting the importance of protein-dsDNA interaction in the spatial organization of the transcriptional initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maslak and Martin, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Interaction of the transcriptional machinery with dsDNA also allows transcription initiation and elongation. In fact, the double-stranded promoter DNA follows a straight path in the PIC complex and this rigidity allows the subsequent transition from a closed to an open promoter complex, where a central DNA region is melted leading to a transcription bubble in which the DNA template strand enters the RNA polymerase II cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murakami et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, competition between the non-template DNA strand and the RNA transcript for base-pairing with the DNA template strand was shown to be important for maintaining structure and function during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kireeva et al., 2011</xref>), reinforcing the inhibitory effects of ssDNA on the transcription process.</p><p>In summary, while DSB-induced transcriptional repression in mammals is reportedly an active mechanism controlled by ATM, the stop of transcription around a DSB in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells is due to the conversion of dsDNA to ssDNA that is necessary to initiate DSB repair by HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In any case, while Mec1 and Tel1 are not required to resect a DSB, ATM and the chromatin compaction promoting proteins macroH2A1, PRMD2 and HP1 promote end resection by facilitating the loading of BRCA1 at the DSB ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soria and Almouzni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khurana et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, whether the nucleolytic processing of the DSB ends contributes to repress transcription around a DSB also in mammals is an important question that remains to be addressed. In fact, although in human cells inactivation of the end resection factor CtIP does not restore trascription around the DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>), other resection machineries are known to be active in resecting DSBs in CtIP-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomimatsu et al., 2012</xref>) and could contribute to inhibit transcription around the DSB.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08942.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for loss of transcription around a DSB.</title><p>Resection of the 5′ strands at both DSB ends leads to release of the transcription machinery (dashed lines) and to subsequent transcription arrest independently of whether the degraded DNA strand acts as template or non-template.

This stopping transcription due to loss of DNA template model is quite a different model from the current repression model, which implies an active regulatory mechanism. As such, an in depth discussion of loss of transcription as a consequence of loss of DNA template with appropriate citations, and a model figure to illustrate this idea, is needed.</p><p>2) The data generated from the HO site at <italic>LEU2</italic> and the HO site at <italic>MAT</italic> need to be in two separate figures, and the difference emphasized more strongly in the text. Otherwise this will all be assumed to be at <italic>MAT</italic> and the apparent novelty of this work, compared to the previous Lee et al. paper, will be reduced.</p><p>3) The result with the <italic>mec1∆ tel1∆</italic> double mutant needs to be reported in order to conclude that the DNA damage checkpoint is not required for stopping transcription around a DNA double strand break.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Although brief, this is an important study that makes significant advances on the previous work from Jim Haber's lab showing that there is progressive transcriptional repression around the DNA double strand break (DSB) induced by the HO endonuclease at the yeast <italic>MAT</italic> locus. There are two important novel results from the current work: 1) the transcriptional repression around a DSB is not dependent on checkpoint activation (in contrast to the situation in mammalian cells); 2) transcriptional repression is dependent on DNA resection. This last finding is very novel and exciting, and has not yet been examined in other systems. The work is of high quality, but the following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Given the partial redundancy of Tel1 and Mec1 in activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, it is important that they show that transcriptional repression around the HO site is not affected in a <italic>tel1 mec1 sml1</italic> mutant, in order to make the conclusion that the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint is not required for transcriptional repression.</p><p>2) Mechanically, it makes sense that DNA resection would block transcription, given that RNA polymerase II binds to double strand DNA, and cannot transcribe from single strand DNA. This should be discussed briefly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This is a very straightforward analysis of a consequence of DNA double-strand break on local transcription. There are a plethora of observations in the literature that bare on this issue, motivating the authors to carry out these studies. At the risk of oversimplification, the message from this story seems to be very simply simplified, that conversion of DNA from double strand to single strand, that allows homologous recombination, has an ‘unintended’ consequence; genes that become single-stranded can no longer by transcribed (presumably it’s well know that RNA polymerase binding and regulation etc. occurs only on double-strand templates, and not on single-strand templates). All of their lovely experiments are consistent with this simple idea, an idea they only state once and, in my view, deserves to be highlighted in the Abstract, and supported with a model at manuscript’s end. Sometimes biology does have simple explanations; this seems to be one of those times.</p><p>I have but a few issues I think important to address, most in the writing. The experiments appear impeccable, thorough, clearly illustrated.</p><p>1) They need to emphasize that they carried out this analysis on a non-<italic>MAT</italic> locus DSB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is of an HO break at the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus. So, they have tested 2 DSBs. Is their general conclusion made any more convincing by test of a third DSB? Yet, showing data at the HO site at <italic>LEU2</italic> is critical for the generality of their conclusions. I suggest they therefore put the <italic>LEU2</italic> HO data in a separate Figure. Shape the data in a similar fashion as the HO data, state distance from HO site, extending left and right from the DSB, as they did for the <italic>MAT</italic> HO site data. Parallel presentations make it easier for the reader.</p><p>2) As I said in the general comments, they need to show a model. The ‘take home’ message is simple, and easily grasped by all with a model. That model can have Rad9 and H2A∆ in it. Yet, most critically is the double-strand to single-strand conversion as the mechanistic explanation. And this inhibition appears to be perhaps unintended consequences of a separate biological reaction, generating a substrate for recombination.</p><p>3) They need a citation that in fact single-strand templates do not support transcription.</p><p>4) I do not quite get how the transcriptional repression cannot be Mec1 regulated, if Mec1 regulates degradation by regulating Rad9, etc.? And degradation of telomere proximal DNA has complex interactions with Mec1 and Rad53, and Rad9; a word on how the telomere resection is or is not relevant here.</p><p>5) In the Results section, the authors allude to a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manfrini et al., 2015</xref>, EMBO Rep) stating: “We previously used this strain for total RNA-seq analysis of protein-coding gene expression upon induction of the HO-induced DSB”. What did they conclude from that study relevant to this study?</p><p>6) The conclusion that the inhibition is not cell cycle regulated, based on but two experiments – asynchronous and G2/M synchronized – is underwhelming. At least under those two conditions they see no difference; tone down the generalization, as the experiments do not support that conclusion. I do not suggest getting rigorous about the cell cycle effects, or lack thereof; this is not an important issue, it seems. Just have the language match the data in this point.</p><p>7) Make it more transparent how gene transcription reduction correlates with extent of degradation. So, when reporting on the r2 restriction site, state how far away it is from the HO site, what gene is there, and how much that genes transcription is reduced and at what time.</p><p>8) At the Results outset, I think it best to set the reader up for the story and technical issues. It is relevant that the time scale, in hours, is far longer than the half-lives of the mRNAs involved, though is this known? Therefore, half-lives of mRNAs does not muddle the analysis.</p><p>9) In the Discussion section, you state that “DSB resection not only generates ssDNA ends necessary to initiate HR, but can also facilitate the access of DNA repair proteins to the site of damage by releasing the transcriptional machinery from the DSB. That is speculation, right? Label as such.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>In the manuscript by Manfrini et al, the authors examine the transcript levels of genes flanking a DNA break in budding yeast and find that transcript levels decrease over time. The decrease in transcription correlates with resection levels, and strains with altered kinetics of resection show corresponding altered kinetics of transcription changes.</p><p>The data in the manuscript are generally of good quality and the changes in transcription and resection are very clear. The really major problem with this manuscript is that the conclusions are written in such a way as to imply that resection is regulating transcriptional repression. However, the data in the manuscript very clearly demonstrates that at the 240 minute time point (at which most of the transcription assays are performed), there is extensive resection of the area containing the genes being analyzed. Resection of double-stranded DNA will prevent transcription factors (such as TBP) from binding to promoter elements and as a result, transcription is no longer possible (and of course, depending on the orientation of the gene, resection can mean that there is no longer a template for the RNA polymerase!). Consequently, most of the cells in the population are unable to carry out transcription of these genes at this time point. This is quite different from ‘transcriptional repression’, which implies regulation. At earlier time points (e.g. shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the only genes affected are precisely those genes that would no longer be completely double stranded in many cells. The ChIP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> fully support this (i.e. that loss of the double stranded DNA sequence results in loss of binding by RNA polymerase II).</p><p>Therefore, what the manuscript is in fact demonstrating is that transcription is never repressed in yeast in genes flanking a DNA break. It is only impeded by loss of DNA sequence during resection. This is different from what has been established in the mammalian system, where there is an active mechanism for signalling to the transcriptional machinery over multiple kilobases where resection isn't taking place. Therefore, if the manuscript is rewritten to make this clear it would be of interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08942.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) We all felt that the likely reason why transcription stops and RNA polymerase II occupancy is lost upon resection is because the transcription machinery, such as TBP and RNA polymerase II bind to dsDNA and not ssDNA.
