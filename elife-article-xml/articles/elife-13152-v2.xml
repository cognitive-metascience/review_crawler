Here, we demonstrate that PlyC is a potent agent for controlling intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> that often underlies refractory infections. We show that the PlyC holoenzyme, mediated by its PlyCB subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes and clears intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative studies using model membranes establish that PlyCB interacts strongly with phosphatidylserine (PS), whereas its interaction with other lipids is weak, suggesting specificity for PS as its cellular receptor. Neutron reflection further substantiates that PlyC penetrates bilayers above a PS threshold concentration. Crystallography and docking studies identify key residues that mediate PlyCB–PS interactions, which are validated by site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report that a native endolysin can traverse epithelial membranes, thus substantiating the potential of PlyC as an antimicrobial for <italic>Spy</italic> in the extracellular and intracellular milieu and as a scaffold for engineering other functionalities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13152.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13152.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13152.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> is the bacterium that causes throat infections and other serious infections in humans. Antibiotics such as penicillin are used to treat active infections, but so-called “strep throat infections” often return after treatment. This is because <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> can enter the cells that line the throat and hide from the antibiotics, which cannot enter the throat cells.</p><p>Endolysins are enzymes produced by viruses that attack bacteria, and these enzymes target and destroy the bacterial cell wall. A previous study revealed that an endolysin known as PlyC could destroy <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> bacteria on contact. PlyC and other endolysins have the potential to act as alternatives to common antibiotics, but before these enzymes can be developed as therapeutics, it is important to understand how they interact with human host cells.</p><p>Like antibiotics, the PlyC endolysin was not expected to enter throat cells. However, Shen, Barros et al. have now discovered that not only can PlyC enter throat cells, it can essentially chase down and kill <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> that are hiding inside. Other similar enzymes could not act in this way, and further studies confirmed that PlyC could move around inside a throat cell without causing it damage. Shen, Barros et al. also determined that PlyC has a pocket on its surface that binds with a specific component of the throat cell membrane, a molecule called phosphatidylserine. This interaction – which is a bit like a lock and key – grants PlyC access into the cell.</p><p>While it is clear that PlyC eventually kills <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> hiding inside throat cells, future experiments will aim to determine how PlyC moves around once inside an infected throat cell. Together, an understanding of how an endolysin enters cells and destroys hiding <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> will contribute to the development of endolysins with broader activity, which can be used as alternatives to common antibiotics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13152.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13152.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>endolysin</kwd><kwd>structure/function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>&lt;i&gt;S. pyogenes&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI11822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischetti</surname><given-names>Vincent A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lösche</surname><given-names>Mathias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unlike other similar enzymes, the antimicrobial enzyme PlyC can interact with and translocate eukaryotic membranes, and then lyse and kill intracellular bacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy)</italic>, a leading human pathogen, colonizes the skin and mucosal surface, and can lead to severe life-threatening conditions including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cunningham, 2000</xref>), as well as a variety of superficial infections such as impetigo and pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis, one of the most common childhood illnesses in the United States, accounts for 15 million outpatient physician visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hing et al., 2008</xref>) and leads to an estimated economic burden of more than half a billion dollar per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfoh et al., 2008</xref>). Globally, <italic>Spy</italic>-associated diseases are correlated with high mortality and represent a worldwide health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carapetis et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The ability of many pathogens, such as <italic>Spy</italic>, to invade host cells, survive at low levels in an intracellular niche, and seed reinfection poses a major challenge in developing effective treatment protocols to address this carrier state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohde and Cleary, 2016</xref>). Inside host cells, pathogens are protected from many antimicrobial agents and host immune effectors, and these evasion mechanisms directly contribute to long-term persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helaine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iovino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pentecost et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Spy</italic> is well known for its ability to proliferate within host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2013</xref>) and escape autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, <italic>Spy</italic> can be recovered from clinical specimens of excised human tonsils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osterlund et al., 1997</xref>), even after antibiotic treatment. No effective approach has yet been identified that can specifically kill intracellular <italic>Spy</italic>, although successful strategies have been reported to control other intracellular bacteria, for example, by antibiotics that can accumulate within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mandell and Coleman, 2000</xref>), encapsulating antibiotics into liposomes or nanoparticles for intracellular delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couvreur et al., 1991</xref>), or antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Grazia et al., 2014</xref>). There is thus the need for an antimicrobial agent that targets both extracellular <italic>and</italic> intracellular <italic>Spy</italic>.</p><p>Bacteriophage-encoded endolysins that act as peptidoglycan hydrolases represent a novel class of antimicrobials that kill bacteria by lysing the cell wall. Exogenously applied, these enzymes kill susceptible Gram-positive bacteria rapidly and with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loessner, 2005</xref>). Numerous studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of endolysins in various animal infection models of human disease, and no adverse side effects have yet been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pastagia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, endolysins have recently gained increasing attention as antimicrobial agents or ‘enzybiotics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischetti, 2005</xref>). However, despite a wealth of knowledge about their antibacterial potential, little is known about their capacity, either inherent or conferred by molecular engineering, to penetrate mammalian cells where they could target intracellular pathogens.</p><p>One such <italic>Spy</italic>-specific endolysin, PlyC, has been characterized using biochemical and structural techniques and shown to be a 114 kDa multimeric holoenzyme. These studies demonstrated that PlyC comprises one PlyCA subunit, harboring two distinct catalytic domains that work synergistically to cleave two different bonds in the peptidoglycan, and eight identical PlyCB subunits that form a symmetrical ring for cell wall recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGowan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>). PlyC’s bactericidal activity against <italic>Spy</italic> in biofilms was shown in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), as was its therapeutic potential in an in vivo model of upper respiratory <italic>Spy</italic> colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we investigate the ability of PlyC to target and control intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> believed to be associated with streptococcal infections that are highly refractory to antibiotic treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PlyC possesses an inherent activity against intracellular <italic>Spy</italic></title><p>To mimic the pathogenic niche for <italic>Spy</italic> colonization and invasion, we established a co-culture model of human epithelial cells and <italic>Spy</italic> strain D471 to differentiate non-adherent, adherent, and intracellular streptococci. In experiments with human epithelial cell lines A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) or Detroit 562 (data not shown), rates of <italic>Spy</italic> adherence ranged from 1 to 5% of the inoculum and rates of internalization ranged from 1 to 10% of the adherent streptococci, which are consistent with previous <italic>Spy</italic>/epithelial cell co-culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaPenta et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>) as well as in vivo findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kugelberg et al., 2005</xref>). Using this co-culture system, the bacteriolytic efficacy of three endolysins known to lyse <italic>Spy</italic> in vitro (PlyC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>); B30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donovan et al., 2006</xref>); and Ply700 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celia et al., 2008</xref>)) were evaluated for activity against intracellular <italic>Spy</italic>. Although we anticipated the enzymes would need to be engineered with cell penetrating peptides or transduction domains in order to acheive intracellular activity, treatment with 50 μg/ml WT PlyC reduced intracellular colonization (colony forming units; CFUs) by 95% (p&lt;0.001) within 1 hr, and lower concentrations displayed a dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, the B30 and Ply700 streptococcal phage endolysins failed to significantly decrease the intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> CFUs. We then assessed PlyC in a co-culture with primary human tonsillar epithelial cells grown from a tonsillectomy as a more clinically relevant model since these cells are known to be the major reservoir for recurrent <italic>Spy</italic> pharyngotonsillitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osterlund et al., 1997</xref>). Roughly 90% of intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> were eliminated when treated with 50 μg/ml PlyC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), similar to the effect in immortalized A549 epithelial cells, although the lower dose treatments did not demonstrate significant killing. At present, it is not known if the differences in efficacy are due to differences in the distribution of cellular receptors between the cell types or other phenotypic differences. Nonetheless, these data indicate that the native PlyC holoenzyme can be internalized by mammalian cells and that the endolysin retains bacteriolytic efficacy against <italic>Spy</italic> in the intracellular environment.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13152.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PlyC eliminates intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> in a dose-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Spy</italic>/A549 co-cultures, treated with 10 µg/ml penicillin and 200 µg/ml gentamicin for 1 hr to remove extracellular bacteria, were incubated for another hour with antibiotic-free growth medium in dilutions of PlyC beginning at 50 μg/ml (440 nM), or with 50 μg/ml heat-denaturated PlyC (70°C for 30 min.), 50 μg/ml (1890 nM) Ply700, or 50 μg/ml (890 nM) B30.

Therefore, the same cationic to anionic mutations were made to PlyCB in the absence of the catalytic PlyCA and proper secondary structure folding was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and analytical gel filtration (data not shown). Of the four PlyCB constructs, only PlyCB<sub>K70E,K71E</sub> was insoluble and excluded from further study. The remaining PlyCB mutants were used to assess <italic>Spy</italic> binding and internalization by A549 epithelial cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed a lack of binding of the PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub> mutant to <italic>Spy</italic> while PlyCB<sub>K23E</sub> and PlyCB<sub>K59E</sub>, as well as a charge-conserving PlyCB<sub>R66K</sub> mutant bound comparably to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, left).

First, we investigated whether electrostatic interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a role in PlyCB internalization, as has been shown for cationic CPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tyagi et al., 2001</xref>) and can be assessed by competing for the membrane-bound GAGs with soluble GAGs such as heparin or chondroitin sulfate-B (CS-B). An excess of heparin or CS-B did not block PlyCB internalization into A549 epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of A549 cells with chondroitinase ABC or heparinase III prior to PlyCB incubation did not abrogate PlyCB internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>), ruling out a role for these GAGs as a PlyCB receptor.</p><p>The second approach focused on anionic lipids, which are also implicated in the internalization of cationic CPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2010</xref>). A phosphoinositide array (PIP Strip) showed that WT PlyCB interacts with phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) but not with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), or any of the phosphatidylinositides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the binding has elements of specificity. PlyCB<sub>K59E</sub> and PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub> that lack the ability to internalize in epithelial cells also lost the ability to bind PI and showed diminished binding to PA and PS.</p><p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was subsequently used to quantify PlyCB binding to sparsely-tethered bilayer membranes (stBLMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGillivray et al., 2007</xref>) containing various anionic lipids in a background of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), where control experiments on pure DOPC showed no detectable protein binding. Typical SPR traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>) show that PlyCB binds phospholipids with largely different affinities and is presumably differentially organized at the surface of DOPC membranes that contain below and above 15 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS). At 10 mol% PS, adsorbed PlyCB washes out in a buffer rinse whereas it is largely retained upon rinsing in membranes with 20 mol% PS. Simultaneously with the SPR characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGillivray et al., 2007</xref>) was used to monitor bilayer degradation upon protein binding. The Cole-Cole plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, obtained with 30 mol% PS at the highest PlyCB concentration, illustrates that changes in electrical membrane characteristics were minimal.

Each of the measurements was performed at multiple isotopic water (H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O) compositions of the buffer.

The protein is deeply inserted in the membrane and spans its entire thickness, headgroup to headgroup. Some protein is superficially adsorbed as evidenced by a protein CVO peak at a distance of ≈20 Å above the membrane surface. Flushing the membrane with protein-free buffer removed this adsorbed protein, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>.

The protein CVOs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref> for stBLMs in contact with protein-containing solutions extend beyond the size of a single PlyCB octamer and could therefore only be modeled by continuous spline-based distributions.

With the bilayer structure modeled as a continuous distribution of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shekhar et al., 2011</xref>), we used the PlyCB crystal structure (PDB: 4F87) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGowan et al., 2012</xref>) and optimized its distance and orientation at the membrane, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nanda et al., 2010</xref>). This rigid body modeling approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, black trace) resembled the protein distribution determined in a spline fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, red trace), which suggests that the inserted protein spans the bilayer at a well-defined angle that leads to a match with the bilayer thickness.

In combination with the residues identified to affect intracellular translocation, this suggests that the groove is a binding site for anionic lipids.

Superimposing this structure on that of a high-resolution structure of WT PlyCB (PDB: 4F87) reveals that the mutated E66 side chain maintains the same location as R66 in the WT protein, and a hydrogen bond with E36 is preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

As an alternative method, we used RosettaLigand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meiler and Baker, 2006</xref>) to model PS and PE docking to one subunit of the PlyCB octamer near the groove surrounded by R29, K59, and R66. Because the burial of the lipid fatty tails cannot be adequately accounted for in this approach, these ligands were trimmed to three different lengths (details, see 'Materials and methods'), with the longest construct retaining the α carbons of the fatty acid chains. In all, approximately 30,000 dockings were performed with each ligand. Possible complexes were selected using two criteria. The first candidate set was selected of models with the lowest interface energy scores (Rosetta total energy of the complex minus the sum of the energies of the isolated protein and ligand) and is composed of 152 PS and 125 PE candidates. Each of the candidates was visually inspected to exclude models in which (1) the phosphate group binds outside of the potential binding groove or (2) there would be unavoidable clashes if the fatty acid tails were complete, narrowing down the count of viable docking poses to 36 PS and 39 PE complexes. The best accepted PS model had an interface energy 3.74 kcal/mol lower than that of the best model for PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). In 11 PS candidates, including the three best models with different tail constructs, the seryl carboxyl formed a salt bridge with R29 and there was also a salt bridge between the phosphate group and R66. In 18 PE candidates, including the three best models with different tail constructs, there was a salt bridge between the amine and E63, as well as between the phosphate group and R66. These electrostatic interactions dominated the energetics, and resulted in opposite orientations of PE and PS relative to the protein.

In semi-quantitative terms, this result is echoed in the Rosetta protein-ligand docking models. For PS and PE, only distinguished through the seryl carboxyl, the results for lipids with truncated fatty acid chains suggest that PS has a lower interface energy (by &gt;3.5 kcal/mol) than that of PE. A part of this energetic difference comes from an interaction between the carbonyl group of the fatty acid tail and R66, not observed for PE because of its consistently different orientation relative to the protein. For the shorter fragments (ligand without fatty acid chains and glycerol backbones, see Materials and methods), the best models for PS and PE do not differ significantly in interface energy, at least partly because the tail carbonyl group is absent. Obvious caveats apply to these results: (1) in a real binding event, the phospholipid ligand is membrane-embedded which may restrict viable conformations in the bound state, despite the fact that the membrane is dynamic and flexible, and (2) trimming of the fatty acid tails may eliminate some contribution of the hydrophobic effect in the bound state, which may, however, be comparable for PS and PE. Despite these caveats, all low-energy candidate models demonstrate strong interactions between the ligand phosphate group and one of the two neighboring arginines – a type of electrostatic interaction that has been experimentally observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods and Ferre, 2005</xref>) – in support of the hypothesis that the lipid binding site is adjacent to R29, K59, and R66. We note that the docking calculations are consistent with the experimental PlyCB-membrane binding data, even though the agreement could be fortuitous if various approximations in the docking analysis compensate. Indeed, the free-energy difference between docked PS and PE compares well with the difference in ΔG observed between PlyCB binding to PS-containing membranes and to membranes without this specific phospholipid ligand. PlyC binding to purely zwitterionic membranes is weak and has not been thoroughly studied, but the binding to non-specific anionic lipids or the binding of PlyCB<sub>R66E</sub> to PS are good proxies which both show ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> values around 4 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) – a difference of the same order of magnitude as that observed in the docking result. We therefore suggest that the docking studies, while somewhat simplified, capture the essence of the specificity observed for PS lipid.</p><p>PS is an important moiety of eukaryotic cellular membranes, preferentially found on the inner plasma membrane leaflet. Disruption of membrane asymmetry is known to follow apoptosis. On the other hand, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Segawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van den Eijnde et al., 2001</xref>) show that membrane inversion is not unique for cell death, and some viruses, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus, utilize PS as the cellular receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carneiro et al., 2006</xref>). It is therefore plausible that PS can also act as a receptor for PlyC, even more so since PS equilibration across the plasma membrane is more likely for cells that are stressed by pathogen invasion. In an analogous system, annexin A5 binds PS reversibly in a calcium-dependent manner and is often used as a marker for apoptosis. Upon binding to PS-containing membrane patches, annexin A5 forms a convex trimer which nanomechanically elicits membrane invagination and the formation of endocytotic vesicles that are actively transported by the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Genderen et al., 2008</xref>). This translocation pathway is not restricted to apoptotic cells, because other proteins can be trapped in such annexin-A5-mediated portals of entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kenis et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, PlyC might penetrate cells in a similar mechanism, as PlyCB possesses eight potential PS binding sites, each on the convex outer surface of the octamer. While further experimental evidence is required, it is tempting to speculate that parallels between the PS-driven membrane interaction of annexins and PlyC may produce membrane invaginations that lead to PlyC endocytosis.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify a novel, effective and – as far as currently assessed – safe enzyme-based antimicrobial agent that specifically targets both extracellular and intracellular <italic>Spy</italic>. With the large pool of endolysins that bear distinct functional domains, our results not only show the potential of PlyC as a topical agent to combat refractory streptococcal infection on the skin and mucosal surface, but also provide a rationale to further investigate the intracellular potential of endolysins against other intracellular pathogens in a species-specific manner. Finally, the identification of PlyCB as the shuttle that catalyzes cellular entry of the catalytic PlyCA subunit opens the possibility that distinct payloads can be fused onto the PlyCB scaffold for delivery into mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> strain D471, the primary <italic>Spy</italic> strain used in this study, is an M6 strain that has been characterized for its pathogenic mechanisms as well as its ability to be internalized by epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>).

X-rays were produced by a rotating anode generator (MicroMax 007HF, Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX) and diffraction data that yielded a resolution of 1.7 Å were measured by RAXIS IV<sup>++</sup> image plates and processed using <italic>d</italic>*<italic>trek</italic> software (Rigaku). The initial model of the mutant was made by omitting the amino acid side chains 29, 36, 59, 63, and 66 from the precedent structure (PDB code: 4F87). The omitted side chains were imaged using difference maps and added to the model during refinement. Refinement converged with <italic>R<sub>f</sub></italic> = 0.25 and rmsd bond lengths of 0.011 Å. The refined mutant structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref> has been deposited in the PDB with accession code 4ZRZ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Computational modeling of PlyCB-ligand docking using Rosetta</title><p>Initial atomic coordinates of the PlyCB octamer were taken from the PlyC holoenzyme X-ray crystal structure (PDB code: 4F88). To relieve preexisting strain according to the Rosetta’s energy function, an energy minimization was performed including all side chains with <italic>RosettaLigand ligand_rpkmin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Baker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meiler and Baker, 2006</xref>). 216 PS structures were extracted from a fully hydrated DOPC:DOPS (3:1) bilayer MD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shenoy et al., 2012a</xref>). A corresponding set of PE structures was obtained by removing the seryl carboxyl group of PS. Because the burial of the lipid fatty tails cannot be adequately accounted for in this approach, the lipid tails were trimmed as follows: (A) fatty acid tails were kept up to the α carbon. (B) Only the phosphate and headgroup were kept. (C) The lipid headgroup was truncated after the <italic>sn</italic>-3 position of the glycerol. All 216 PS (or PE) conformations in the bilayer model were included in the ligand conformer library. A second conformer library containing 25 to 50 conformations, depending on the construct, was generated using Frog2 web interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miteva etal., 2010</xref>). All docking trajectories were started from a position close to the PlyCB cationic groove containing R29, K59, and R66, featuring the crystallographically observed putative phosphate site shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>. Ligand docking poses were sampled within a sphere of 5 Å radius centered at the initial site using <italic>RosettaLigand</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Baker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meiler and Baker, 2006</xref>), which uses a Monte Carlo search algorithm and supports modeling with flexible ligand and protein side chains. For each of the input ligands, 10,000–16,000 models were generated. To compile candidate set 1, the models were ranked by their interface energies. To generate candidate set 2, the models were selected if there existed at least one pair of non-hydrogen atoms between ligand and docking site residues (Y26, R29, E26, K59, V62, E63, and E66) within 3.5 Å distance that were potentially capable of forming an H bond or salt bridge.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant number R01 GM110202 to DCN, R01 GM101647 to ML, and R01 AI11822 to VAF) and DARPA to VAF.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick as Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Phage lysins are a novel class of enzymatic activities with several properties that make them attractive for some therapeutic applications. Previously, it was believed, based on dogmatic views of what enters a eukaryotic cell, that such a therapeutic would not be of much value for treating intracellular microbes – often an important reservoir for bacteria escaping from circulating antibiotics. The reviewers agreed that this manuscript describes the important and unexpected finding that one phage lysin appears to enter the eukaryotic cell and there be effective in killing the common human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> residing within. The importance of this is that tonsillar epithelial cells serve as a reservoir for this microbe in asymptomatic carriers and antibiotic treatment failures. There was a consensus of enthusiasm for this manuscript, which both advances knowledge of molecular trafficking into eukaryotic cells, and does so with potentially important practical implications.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) Phage lysin PlyC unexpectedly enters eukaryotic cells where it is active against intracellular <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>.</p><p>2) It enters via a process that involves phosphatidylserine (PS).</p><p>3) Structural analysis shows the PlyCB to be important for this uptake process, specifically positively charged amino acids on its surface.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following points were raised during review that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) Physiological relevance of the findings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. First, what are the levels of <italic>Spy</italic> intracellular colonization achieved in the two models used? How do those compare to levels found in vivo? Does a higher dosage of B30 lead to increased killing of intracellular <italic>Spy</italic>? From comparison with the structures of Ply700 and B30, can one predict the potential of new endolysins to be internalized by eukaryotic cells?</p><p>2) It would seem important to test 1h (instead of 30 min, subsection “PlyCB mediates PlyC internalization, leading to colocalization with <italic>Spy</italic> and intracellular lysis of streptococci“, first paragraph) of exposure to 100 µg/ml PlyC, as this is the time of exposure used to assessed the activity of the endolysin on intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> cells. Do increasing exposure time and/or PlyC dose lead to any toxicity toward eukaryotic cells? If yes, what is the potential therapeutic window?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as presented, is more confusing than it needs to be. The panels could be larger and re-ordered for more logical presentation. For example, panel D might be better as the last panel because it presents data using a different experimental approach, and panel C could be moved to supplementary material, or presented separately from the SPR data. Lastly, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend contains a substantial amount of text that is better suited to Results, such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> legend text.</p><p>4) The manuscript would benefit from editing to remove jargon and to emphasize in the Introduction the importance of intracellular <italic>S. pyogene</italic>s in infection and carriage based published studies.</p><p>5) Since primary tonsillar epithelial cells showed a measurably diminished level of internalization and killing efficiency by PlyC compared to cultured A549 cells, could lipid content differences between these cells account for differences in PlyC internalization?</p><p>6) Although it is understood that PlyC targets and disrupts the bacterial cell wall and that the PlyCB subunit binds peptidoglycan, there is no mention in this report that <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> membranes also contain phosphatidylserine; might PS be an important receptor in its association with the bacterial surface?</p><p>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Internalization of PlyC depends on caveolae-mediated endocytosis” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>.

First, what are the levels of Spy intracellular colonization achieved in the two models used?</p><p>In this manuscript, we report internalization results of <italic>Spy</italic> for two co-culture models. One uses the immortalized A549 lung epithelial cell line and the other one uses primary tonsillar epithelial cells freshly isolated from tonsillectomies. In both co-culture models, ~2% of inoculated <italic>Spy</italic> adhere to the epithelial cells and of those that adhere, 2-10% are internalized, yielding an overall internalization rate of ~0.04 to 0.2%. The adherence/internalization data for the A549 cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Note, while not included in this manuscript, we have done similar co-culture studies with <italic>Spy</italic> on Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells. In all three co-culture models, the rates of adherence range from 1-5% of the inoculum and rates of internalization range from 1-10% of the adherent streptococci. We did not include the Detroit 562 data in the manuscript because we found the A549 cells easier to grow and used them for all subsequent experiments. Our rates of adherence and internalization in the three models are consistent with the literature as referenced by Ryan et al. and LaPenta et al. Both these manuscripts were already referenced in the original submission, but we now include an expanded statement in our revised manuscript discussing how our adherence/internalization rates compare to previous publications.</p><p>Ryan PA, Pancholi V, and Fischetti VA.

For instance, a murine model of streptococcal skin infection by Kugelberg et al. shows that ~0.01% of inoculated <italic>Spy</italic> persist after Fucidin (a clinically-used antibiotic) treatment, suggesting intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> may have evolved as a mechanism to avoid antibiotic eradication. In addition, in situ image analysis by Thulin et al. reveals that high amount of viable <italic>Spy</italic> present in the soft tissues of human biopsies. Although not ideal, we believe our co-culture model mimics the level of <italic>Spy</italic> colonization/internalization found in vivo.</p><p>Kugelberg E, Norström T, Petersen TK, Duvold T, Andersson DI, and Hughes D.

Hence, only one concentration (50 µg/ml) was selected for depiction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>From comparison with the structures of Ply700 and B30, can one predict the potential of new endolysins to be internalized by eukaryotic cells?</italic> </p><p>The structures for Ply700 and B30 have yet to be solved. However, we do not believe either of these proteins would have internalization potential for a couple of reasons. First, our results demonstrate that PlyCB specifically interacts with phosphatidylserine via a binding groove and no such groove, at least based on primary sequence alignment, is present in Ply700 or B30. Second, even discounting the phosphatidylserine/binding groove results, the electrostatics would make it unlikely for B30 or Ply700 (pI = 4.84 and 4.54, respectively) to interact with the negatively charged lipid membrane. In contrast, PlyCB has a pI of 8.5.</p><p> <italic>2) It would seem important to test 1h (instead of 30 min, subsection “PlyCB mediates PlyC internalization, leading to colocalization with Spy and intracellular lysis of streptococci“, first paragraph) of exposure to 100</italic> µg</p><p><italic>/ml PlyC, as this is the time of exposure used to assessed the activity of the endolysin on intracellular Spy cells. Do increasing exposure time and/or PlyC dose lead to any toxicity toward eukaryotic cells? If yes, what is the potential therapeutic window?</italic> </p><p>This was an error on our part and has been corrected in the revised manuscript.The exposure time should have said 1h, which was correctly stated in the figure caption, instead of 30 min. In reality, we did these experiments at both 30 min and 60 min, which led to the typo, and found no significant difference in the data between the two time points. Additionally, exposure of PlyC at 100 µg/ml for up to 24 hr did not induce cytotoxicity in our co-culture model as verified by total cell count and the trypan blue dye exclusion assay.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as presented, is more confusing than it needs to be. The panels could be larger and re-ordered for more logical presentation. For example, panel D might be better as the last panel because it presents data using a different experimental approach, and panel C could be moved to supplementary material, or presented separately from the SPR data. Lastly, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend contains a substantial amount of text that is better suited to Results, such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> legend text.</p><p>The reviewer is correct. Due to the large number of figures/tables alreadyassociated with this manuscript, we made <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 a</xref> composite figure with many panels. However, the figure/table limitations for <italic>eLife</italic> are more flexible than other journals and as the reviewer points out, this image is more confusing than it needs to be primarily due to the small size of the images. In the revised manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has been broken into three different figures (now new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6) grouped by similarity in experiments and as the reviewer suggested, the former panel 4D is now the last figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in the series. Additionally, as suggested by the reviewer, we have deleted some of text in the figure legends that is already contained in the Results section. The larger size of the image panels, the reordering of the panels, and breaking apart the figure legend into three figure legends should address the review concerns on this point while at the same time making the results more straightforward to read.</p><p><italic>4) The manuscript would benefit from editing to remove jargon and to emphasize in the Introduction the importance of intracellular S. pyogenes in infection and carriage based published studies.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have tried to remove all instances of jargon and wehave also added a paragraph and several citations to the Introduction strengthening the importance of intracellular <italic>Spy</italic> to infection and carriage. We thank the reviewer for pointing out these changes that improve the overall quality of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Since primary tonsillar epithelial cells showed a measurably diminished level of internalization and killing efficiency by PlyC compared to cultured A549 cells, could lipid content differences between these cells account for differences in PlyC internalization?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. Although most published <italic>Spy</italic>adherence/invasion co-culture experiments utilize immortalized epithelial cells including the same A549 cells we investigated, we also sought to include experiments on primary cell lines to account for potential differences that may arise from the immortality of the A549 cells. As stated in response to question 1 above, we saw no significant difference in <italic>Spy</italic> adherence and internalization between primary tonsillar epithelial cells, immortalized A459 lung epithelial cells, and immortalized Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells (Detroit data not presented in the manuscript). However, as the reviewer points out, we did indeed note a lower level of PlyC killing efficiency in the primary cells compared to the immortalized A549 cells. It is unknown whether these findings are due to experimental variation, differences in growth/metabolism between the primary and immortalized cells, or differences in membrane lipid composition as suggested by the reviewer. Given that our data shows PlyCB binds phosphatidylserine, it is certainly plausible that cell-specific lipid composition may affect PlyC internalization rates and subsequent intracellular killing efficacy. At present, we do not know the lipid composition for these various cell lines, but the revised manuscript now includes a discussion about the differences in PlyC killing efficacy between the various cell lines consistent with the reviewer’s comments.</p><p><italic>6) Although it is understood that PlyC targets and disrupts the bacterial cell wall and that the PlyCB subunit binds peptidoglycan, there is no mention in this report that S. pyogenes membranes also contain phosphatidylserine; might PS be an important receptor in its association with the bacterial surface?</italic> </p><p>PlyC binds the streptococcal peptidoglycan via its PlyCB octameric subunit. Whilethe exact nature of the binding epitope on the streptococcal surface is presently unknown, it is strongly believed to be the carbohydrate present within the streptococcal wall teichoic acids, which is consistent with other phage-encoded endolysins that display cell wall binding domains. Although still circumstantial, there is growing evidence that the epitope may be a polyrhamnose moiety within the wall teichoic acids as streptococci sensitive to PlyC all possess the identical polyrhamnose moiety as determined by NMR studies (i.e. <italic>S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae</italic>, etc.). Moreover, PlyC readily acts on purified cell walls where no membranes are present and is easily inhibited by cell wall fragments lacking membranes, ruling out an essential role for phosphatidylserine or other membrane lipids. Lysis of <italic>Spy</italic> by PlyC occurs through passive osmotic lysis of the streptococcal membrane in areas where the protective peptidoglycan has been cleaved by PlyC. This “lysis from without” mechanism is shared by all other endolysins derived from phage that infect Gram-positive hosts. After 16 years of studying PlyC, we have yet to find any evidence suggesting binding, interaction, weakening, or direct lysis of the streptococcal membrane by PlyC or PlyCB. Thus, as stated in our Discussion, we believe that PlyCB uses two completely different mechanisms to interact with the <italic>Spy</italic> peptidoglycan and the eukaryotic membrane, the latter being a moonlighting function.</p><p>To further the discussion above, we searched the literature for data concerning the lipid composition of <italic>Spy</italic>. Although there are only a few studies that investigate the lipid composition, they suggest the <italic>Spy</italic> membrane is primarily composed of glycolipids and the only identified phospholipids are phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (Rosch et al. and Cohen et al.). We could not find any evidence in the literature suggesting that phosphatidylserine is a component of the <italic>Spy</italic> membrane, further supporting our contention that phosphatidylserine binding by PlyCB is a fortuitous moonlighting function.</p><p>Rosch JW, Hsu FF, and Caparon MG.

There is some confusion on the statement that filipin III inhibits internalization of PlyCB and CTxB because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> does show a significant amount of fluorescent-labeled vesicles containing PlyCB. Please clarify.</p><p>We understand the reviewer’s confusion with these figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref> in theoriginal manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref> in the revised submission). First, we should have used the term “intracellular trafficking” or “intracellular transport” instead of “internalization” to describe this set of experiments because it is the trafficking/transport that they were designed to test. The representative fields were chosen to show the diminished intracellular transport of PlyCB (green) and CTxB (red) after treatment with filipin III. In panel 7C, numerous intracellular vesicle containing both PlyCB and CTxB (yellow, signifying co-localization) are seen. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (i.e. pre-treated with filipin III) show no co-localization of the green PlyCB and red CTxB, suggesting the co-localization and intracellular transport observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> occurred via a lipid raft mechanism. Nonetheless, as the reviewer points out, some formed vesicles of PlyCB can still be observed in the filipin III treated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. We expected some PlyCB vesicles to form near the surface, which is what is seen if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, but the lack of co-localization with CTxB or intracellular transport is the key finding. To help clarify this point, we have added additional arrows to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> (now 9C) to highlight the yellow co-localization, removed the arrows to the green PlyCB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (now 9D) and we have expanded our discussion and implications of these findings. We do admit that future work will be needed on all intracellular pathways to fine tune our model, but the present data does implicate lipid rafts in the current working model for intracellular transport of PlyCB. We hope the changes to the revised manuscript clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
