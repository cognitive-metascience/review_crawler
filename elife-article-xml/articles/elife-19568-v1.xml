palaeontological locality in northern Tanzania whose outstanding record includes the earliest hominin footprints in the world (3.66 million years old), discovered in 1978 at Site G and attributed to <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic>. Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19568.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19568.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19568.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fossil footprints are extremely useful tools in the palaeontological record. Their physical features can help to identify their makers, but can also be used to infer biological information. <italic>How did the track-maker move? How large was it? How fast was it going?</italic></p><p>Footprints of hominins (namely the group to which humans and our ancestors belong) are pretty rare. Nearly all of the hominin footprints discovered so far are attributed to species of the genus <italic>Homo</italic>, to which modern humans belong. The only exceptions are the footprints that were discovered in the 1970s at Laetoli (in Tanzania) on a cemented ash layer produced by a volcanic eruption. These are thought to have been made by three members of the hominin species <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic> – the same species as the famous “Lucy” from Ethiopia – around 3.66 million years ago.</p><p>The extent to which body shape and size varied between different members of <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> – for example, between males and females <italic>–</italic> has been the subject of a long debate among researchers. Based on the skeletal remains found so far in East Africa, some scholars believe that individuals only varied moderately, as in modern humans, while others state that it was pronounced, as in some modern apes like gorillas.</p><p>Masao et al. have now unearthed new bipedal footprints from two individuals who were moving on the same surface and in the same direction as the three individuals who made the footprints documented in the 1970s. The estimated height of one of the new individuals (about 1.65 metres) greatly exceeds those previously published for <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>. This evidence supports the theory that body size varied considerably amongst individuals within the species.</p><p>Masao et al. tentatively suggest that the new footprints can be considered as a whole with the 1970s ones. The tall individual may have been the dominant male of a larger group, the others smaller females and juveniles. Thus, considerable differences may have existed between males and females in these remote human ancestors, similar to modern gorillas.</p><p>The newly discovered tracks are only 150 metres away from the previously discovered sets of footprints. This leaves open the possibility that additional tracks may be unearthed nearby that will further our knowledge about the variability and behaviour of our extinct ancestors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19568.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19568.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic></kwd><kwd>Hominini</kwd><kwd>Laetoli</kwd><kwd>footprints</kwd><kwd>Pliocene</kwd><kwd>body size estimates</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dipartimento di Fisica e Geologia, Università di Perugia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherin</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Barili</surname><given-names>Angelo</given-names></name><name><surname>Boschian</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name><name><surname>Iurino</surname><given-names>Dawid A</given-names></name><name><surname>Menconero</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name><name><surname>Manzi</surname><given-names>Giorgio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dipartimento di Biologia Ambientale, Sapienza Università di Roma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manzi</surname><given-names>Giorgio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bipedal footprints made 3.66 million years ago provide the clearest available evidence to date of the occurrence of marked body size variation in <italic>Australopithecus afarensis.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Estimates of body size and proportions are crucial in the evolutionary interpretation of Plio-Pleistocene hominin palaeobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McHenry, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al., 2015</xref>) and have been the subject of ongoing debates, at least since the late 1970s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johanson and White, 1979</xref>). Within-species variability in body size often relates to sexual dimorphism and/or to adaptation to different ecologies. This is particularly true among extant Hominoidea, which show diverse patterns of variation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plavcan, 2001</xref>); for instance, gorillas are polygynous species with strong sexual dimorphism due to intense male-male competition, whereas chimpanzees are promiscuous with definitively smaller sexual dimorphism. It is reasonable to assume that complex relationships among body size, sexual dimorphism, mating system (and/or reproductive strategy) and social structure/behaviour also applied to extinct hominins, including our bipedal relatives of the Plio-Pleistocene. In fact, claims that size variation in <italic>Australopithecus</italic> and/or <italic>Paranthropus</italic> was larger than that in recent human populations include inferences on sexual dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richmond and Jungers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plavcan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lockwood et al., 2007</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reno et al., 2003</xref>), whereas arguments referring to early <italic>Homo</italic> are usually associated with eco-physiological variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Vincenzo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic>, remarkable variation in size and shape within its alleged hypodigm was noted in the original description of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johanson et al., 1978</xref>). Nevertheless, there have always been disputes about the nature and degree of sexual dimorphism characterising this early bipedal hominin, with supporters of either pronounced (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johanson and White, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimbel and White, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McHenry, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richmond and Jungers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lockwood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plavcan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harmon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>) or moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovejoy et al., 1989</xref>) body-size dimorphism.</p><p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richmond and Jungers (1995)</xref> wrote: 'If the fossils from Hadar and Maka (and Laetoli) are assumed […] to be from one sexually dimorphic species, then the degree of sexual dimorphism of <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> would have been at least as extreme as that of the most dimorphic living apes […]. It follows that a strictly monogamous structure would have been highly unlikely.' <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reno et al. (2003)</xref> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plavcan et al., [2005]</xref> and the reply by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reno et al., [2005]</xref>) challenged this premise with an analysis of the sexual dimorphism of femoral head diameter in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>, concluding that these early hominins showed human-like sexual dimorphism and were therefore characterised by a monogamous mating system. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al. (2015</xref>, p. 90) obtained comprehensive and thoroughly vetted data, supporting 'arguments that <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> had substantial size dimorphism […] leading to a large amount of variation in body size within this taxon.'</p><p>It is clear that our ability to investigate this important and controversial issue depends on the possibility of evaluating the body size and proportions of extinct creatures. Estimates are largely inferred from known relationships between metric data in living species, such as bone length (or joint size) and stature (or body mass) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McHenry, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al., 2015</xref>). Similar estimates can be even more plainly obtained from the analysis of single footprints or – even better – from trails of footprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tuttle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>). Among these, one of the most remarkable pieces of evidence are the renowned trackways from Laetoli Site G (northern Tanzania), which are ascribed to <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White and Suwa, 1987</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we report a novel set of hominin tracks discovered at Laetoli in the new Site S, comparing it to a reappraisal of the original evidence.

Consequently, the Tuff is overlain here only by reworked loose soil, and the tracks are not filled up with compact and/or cemented sediment. Preservation issues arise from this situation, because the tuff tends to be rather altered and dislodged along the natural fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The first four tracks in the L8 trail are the best preserved, whereas the state of preservation of the footprint-bearing surface is particularly critical in the northern part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), where the surface appears very damaged by cracks of different size and by plant roots. Some parts of the surface even subsided into micro-grabens developed along the main faults. Consequently, the anterior portion of the track L8/S1-6 is no longer visible because it is situated in one of these lowered parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, a zigzag channel, probably formed by a large root, crosses the northern half of this test-pit from SE to NW, so that L8/S1-5 is virtually indiscernible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the western portion of L8, three large rounded holes (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) originated from roots of acacia trees that grew on the surface. Raindrop imprints are visible to the northern edge of the test-pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) on two relatively well-preserved portions of the tuff surrounded by weathered and lowered areas. These features have also been described in several other footprint-bearing sites at Laetoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leakey, 1987a</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19568.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Southern part of the hominin trackway in test-pit L8.</title><p>Footprints L8/S1-1, L8/S1-2, L8/S1-3 and L8/S1-4 are visible from left to right.

Here, the tracks are sealed by the upper, laminated part of Tuff seven and filled with strongly cemented sediment. The tuff is here in reasonably good condition, even if it is crossed by old tectonic fractures re-cemented by calcite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Moreover, deeply expanding roots penetrate preferentially into the subhorizontal fissures situated between bedding planes, dislodging the rock and fostering carbonate dissolution.</p><p>The taphonomic state of the Footprint Tuff and of the tracks is very similar in M10, which is about 80 cm deep. In M9, the infilling matrix was removed from two hominin tracks (M9/S1-2 and M9/S1-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) in order to examine their inner morphology. Small amounts of water were used during the excavation, in order to soften the sediment and darken its hue to better distinguish it from the surrounding tuff. The infill was finally removed by small dental tools, trying not to damage the very thin calcite film covering the original footprint surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White and Suwa, 1987</xref>). Unfortunately, some vertical crisscross fractures filled by hard calcite veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) preclude a detailed morphological study of the two footprints. An about 4-cm-thick layer of tuff was removed from a footprint-free area of the M9 SW corner, putting into light a deeper horizon containing bovid tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In TP2, the preservation state of the ~66-cm-deep printed tuff is intermediate between the L8 and M9/M10 ones. The southern part is in better condition: the hominin track TP2/S1-1 is rather well preserved and some of the other animal prints are still filled by the sediment of the overlying unit. Unfortunately, the SW portion of the test-pit is crossed longitudinally by north-running roots that cross TP2/S2-1, partially damaging it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). On the contrary, the northern part of the test-pit is poorly preserved because of a micro-graben developed along an EW-trending fault, which also crosses TP2/S1-2, causing the lowering of its anterior portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Geological setting</title><p>The assessment of the Laetoli Site S sequence within the wider framework of the Eyasi Plateau formations is crucial to understand the stratigraphic relationships between the footprint-bearing units of the newly discovered Site S and those of the historical Site G. These relationships can be discussed at two levels of increasing detail, each one affecting different and similarly more detailed aspects of the study of the tracks.</p><p>The first – and most relevant – level regards verifying whether the unit bearing the new tracks corresponds to the Footprint Tuff, part of Tuff 7 together with the overlying Augite Biotite Tuff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leakey and Hay, 1979</xref>, p. 317; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay, 1987</xref>, p. 36), where the Site G tracks were printed. This would imply that the trackways are contemporaneous from a geological/geochronometric point of view. Moreover, considering that Tuff 7 includes a sequence of several sublevels originated by distinct eruptions closely spaced in time, and that its overall deposition time was estimated in weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hay and Leakey, 1982</xref>, p. 55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay, 1987</xref>, p. 36, it can be concluded that all the tracks belong to the same general population of hominins.</p><p>Secondarily, stratigraphic relationships can be explored at higher detail, in order to assess whether the tracks of Site S were printed on exactly the same sublevel of the Footprint Tuff as those in Site G. This aspect would mostly concern the behavioural aspects of a hypothetical single group of hominins, but it must be pointed out that extra-fine correlation between outcrops, even in a depositional environment with moderate lateral variability like the Footprint Tuff deposition area, can be affected by major uncertainty.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Field description of the sequences</title><p>The eye-scale characteristics of the profiles exposed in the test-pits are reported here from the top downwards.</p><sec id="s1-4-1"><title>Test-pit L8</title><p>The Footprint Tuff is extremely shallow and partly eroded in this area, which is limited by the erosional surface of a gully side.

Their size (30–40 mm long and 20–36 mm wide) and morphological features suggest that most of them can be ascribed to the genus <italic>Madoqua</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Some slightly larger prints (60–80 × 40–60 mm) can be referred to medium-sized bovids such as <italic>Gazella</italic>, <italic>Eudorcas</italic> or <italic>Nanger</italic>.</p><p>It is very difficult to distinguish the footprints of <italic>Madoqua</italic>-like bovids from lagomorph footprints because of their very similar morphology and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leakey, 1987a</xref>). Consequently, we decided to ascribe to Lagomorpha only trails that clearly include at least four footprints arranged in the normal hare gait pattern, i.e. two single prints left by the front feet followed by a couple of prints made by the hind feet in the direction of gait. Each single trail (i.e., four footprints) is approximately 200 mm long and 100 mm wide.</p><p>We identified very few prints of giraffids (about 170 × 125 mm) in M10, equids (about 50–95 × 45–70 mm) in L8 and M9 and rhinoceroses (about 150–135 mm) in M9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In M9 and M10, some avian prints (about 60 × 75 mm) often organised in trails, can be referred to Galliformes of the family Numididae, such as the guinea fowl (genus <italic>Numida</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Finally, we report some very small (about 10 × 10 mm) tracks of unidentified animals, probably micromammals, in M9 and M10.</p><p>The above-mentioned assemblage of terrestrial mammal and bird footprints suggests that the local palaeoenvironment was characterised by a mosaic of dry tropical bushland, woodland, open grassland and riverine forest similar to the extant one.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Morphology of hominin tracks</title><p>The morphology of the S1 tracks can be described in detail, but unfortunately the only preserved track of S2 shows an abnormal widening of the anterior part. This enlarged morphology is possibly due to a lateral slipping of the foot before the toe-off; alternatively, it could be due to taphonomic factors as a thick root crossing the footprint longitudinally may have altered its original morphology. The overall morphology of the S1 tracks matches those at Site G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) and is similar in particular to the prints of the larger individual, G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robbins, 1987</xref>): the heel has an oval shape and is pressed deeply into the ground; the medial side of the arch is higher than the lateral one; the ball region is oriented at an angle of about 75° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the foot and is delimited anteriorly by a transversal ridge, formed when the toes gripped the wet ash and pushed it posteriorly. No clear distinction among the toes is visible. The adducted hallux extends more anteriorly than the other toes in all visible footprints. In TP2/S1-1, the hallux apparently shuffled anteriorly when the foot was lifted from the ground. Some tracks (especially L8/S1-3, M9/S1-2, M9/S1-3 and TP2/S1-1) are characterised by a posterior drag mark about 100 mm long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). These marks were possibly left by the heel shuffling on the ash before being firmly placed into the soil. The two latter features were also recognised in some of the G2 prints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robbins, 1987</xref>) and suggest that the feet were probably lifted above the ground at a low oblique angle. The depth distribution pattern indicates that the weight transfer of S1 was similar to that described for G1–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robbins, 1987</xref>): starting from the heel, the weight was transferred along the lateral part of the foot (note the steep slope of the lateral wall of the tracks compared to that on the medial side) up to the distal metatarsal region, and from here to the toes. In some of the S1 tracks (L8/S1-1, L8/S1-3 and TP2/S1-8, all of the right side), however, the area of maximum depth is located beneath toes 2–5. This may suggest a somewhat asymmetrical walking, in which the weight was sometimes loaded on the anterolateral part of the foot before the toe-off. Alternatively, this pattern may be indicative of a rotation of the upper body during the gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmid, 2004</xref>). The angle of gait ranges approximately from 2° to 11°, without any particular difference between the right and left sides. Regarding this aspect, S1 resembles more G2/3, for which very low average angles are reported, whereas G1 shows instead wide asymmetrical angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tuttle, 1987</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19568.017</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Shaded 3D photogrammetric elevation model of a cast of the southern portion of the Site G trackway with close-ups of selected hominin tracks with contour lines.</title><p>Colour renders heights as in the colour bar; distance between elevation contour lines is 2 mm.

The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref> indicate that stature and mass estimates for S1 and S2 (about 165 cm and 44.7 kg, and 146 cm and 39.5 kg, respectively) are higher than those obtained for G1, G2 and G3 (with S2 partly overlapping the higher estimates for G2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stratigraphic position of the new tracks</title><p>Site S is situated on an almost level or very gently dipping surface, situated at the foot of the left (southern) side of the Garusi River valley. Site G is situated about 150 m to the north, on the same surface but 1.5–2 m lower than Site S. Several shallow gullies dissect this surface, producing a complexly terraced morphology: consequently, there is no observable stratigraphic continuity between the two sites. However, the gullies put into light about 2–3 m of the underlying sequence, whose units are horizontally layered and characterised by almost constant thickness. Only a shallow depression elongated E-W can be observed between the sites; this is probably an ancient erosion channel filled by a constant thickness of the Site S footprint-bearing tuff. Even if the area of possible outcrop of the Footprint Tuff on gully sides close to Site S is covered by debris, the correlation between G and S is in general straightforward.</p><p>All previous literature describing the original stratigraphic setting at Laetoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leakey and Hay, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hay and Leakey, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay, 1987</xref>) indicates that the Footprint Tuff can be divided into two main units – the lower and the upper one – which can be subdivided into 14 and 4 sublevels, respectively. Footprints occur on several sublevels of each unit all over the Laetoli area: eight within the lower one (mostly on sublevel 9 and on the topmost sublevel 14), and two within the upper one (sublevels 1 and 2).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leakey and Hay (1979</xref>, pp. 317–318 and fig. 4) provided a brief description of the type-sequence of the Footprint Tuff at Locality 6 (Site A), where a short trackway of human-like footprints – later referred to an ursid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tuttle, 2008</xref>) – was also found. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hay and Leakey (1982</xref>, p. 55 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White and Suwa (1987</xref>, p. 488 specified that the hominin tracks at Site G are situated on the top of horizon B, i.e. on the top of sublevel 14 within the lower unit of the Footprint Tuff. Eventually, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay (1987</xref>, pp. 34–35 and fig. 6) provided a generalised columnar profile of the Footprint Tuff; this is by far the most accurate description available, but is averaged over all the Laetoli area sites. Although the stratigraphic descriptions above are very accurate, they do not provide details about the eye-scale characteristics of the tuffs, i.e. colour, texture, limits, and so on, and no photographs of the sequence have been published.</p><p>The Site S sequence does not fit the aforementioned descriptions perfectly, at least not within the observed area, which is rather narrow. The grey augite-rich tuff of Site S largely matches the description of the Augite Biotite Tuff described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay (1987</xref>, p. 34 and following, level 4 in fig. 2.6, p. 35). Regarding the Footprint Tuff, the upper unit corresponds to Site S Laminated Grey Tuff, but the sublevels here are layered rather crudely, whereas the most evident sedimentary structure is a very fine and almost continuous lamination, which makes the subdivision rather problematic. Energy-sorting of denser grains is apparently a relevant aspect of the depositional processes. The Finely Layered Grey and White Tuff of Site S corresponds to the lower subunit of the Footprint Tuff; 14 sublevels are apparent as in the standard description, but this number may be imprecise (or evaluated differently) because some of them are extremely thin and apparently discontinuous; in fact, some of the thinner (and darker) ones look more like concentrations of gravity-sorted coarser/denser grains situated at the bottom of graded layers. The top sublevel is rather thicker than the others and somewhat whitish instead of greyish, as apparent also in Localities 6 and 7.</p><p>Some lateral variability is not surprising in continental environments, which are normally affected by strong morphogenetic processes and/or lateral changes in the sedimentary environments. Consequently, lateral variability can also be expected within the sequence of the Footprint Tuff, even if the involved volcanic depositional processes were rather uniform over a wide area around Laetoli and gave the whole sequence a remarkably homogeneous aspect throughout its outcrops.</p><p>The correlation between Site G and Site S cannot be absolutely undisputable, at least for the time being, because the original profile could not be examined directly. However, the geological and morphological setting of the area, as well as the characteristics of the newly exposed sequence, indicate with a very good margin of confidence that the newly discovered tracks belong to the Footprint Tuff.</p><p>To provide a more accurate correlation within the Footprint Tuff, we observe that the Site S tracks were printed on the uppermost level of the Finely Layered Grey and White Tuff (unit 4 in the description provided in this paper), which corresponds to the lower subunit of the Footprint Tuff. The lithological change to the overlying subunit is very evident and marked by a sharp surface, often underlined by a thin crack. However, because of the aforementioned dissimilarities, it is not possible to assess with reasonable confidence whether this stratigraphic position also corresponds to the top of level 14 in the standard sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay, 1987</xref>, p. 35, fig. 2.6), i.e. to the same stratigraphic position as the Site G trackways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of the new Laetoli footprints</title><p>Our results show that no matter which method is employed to estimate stature and body mass (see Material and methods), the two individuals S1 and S2 were taller and had a larger body mass than the G individuals.

Consequently, we may emphasise the conclusions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al. (2015)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jungers et al. (2016)</xref>, who reported that the body sizes of the australopithecines and of the early <italic>Homo</italic> representatives were similar, but also that certain australopithecine individuals (at least of <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>) were comparable with later <italic>Homo</italic> species, including <italic>H. erectus s. l.</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. Thus, our results support a nonlinear evolutionary trend in hominin body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Vincenzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jungers et al., 2016</xref>) and contrast with the idea that the emergence of the genus <italic>Homo</italic> and/or the first dispersal out of Africa was related to an abrupt increase in body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHenry and Coffing, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maslin et al., 2015</xref>). The identification of large-size individuals among the australopithecines – i.e. hominins commonly presumed to be small-bodied on average – shows also that the available fossil record can be misleading, resulting in an underestimate of the hominin phenotypic diversity in any given period.</p><p>Moreover, ascribing the S1 tracks to a possible male requires that we reconsider the sex and age of the other Laetoli individuals, who have been object of a plethora of interpretations (and associated illustrations largely disseminated to the public) since Mary Leakey’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leakey, 1981</xref>). The most parsimonious option is that sex and age of the hominins represented at Site G cannot be determined, as subadult individuals could possibly be present among them. However, the body-mass estimates suggest some observations as G1 and G3 fall within the range of putative <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> females (25.5–38.1 kg, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al. [2015]</xref>), whereas G2 and S2 span across the upper female and the lower male ranges (40.2–61.0 kg, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabowski et al. [2015]</xref>) . All of these individuals are definitively smaller than the body mass calculated from the S1 tracks. A possible tentative conclusion is that the various individuals represented at Laetoli are: S1, a male; G2 and S2, females; G1 and G3, smaller females or juvenile individuals.</p><p>Evidence for either marked or moderate body-size variation in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>, based on data collected in a single site, was limited until now to the fossil assemblage from the Hadar 333 locality, dated to 3.2 Ma (with body masses ranging from 24.5 to 63.6 kg). The new estimates for the Laetoli individuals indicate an even more marked variation in body size within the same hominin population, at 3.66 Ma. Consequently, the combined records from Laetoli and Hadar suggest that large-bodied hominins existed in the African Pliocene for over 400,000 years, between 3.66 and 3.2 Ma. At the same time, these data contrast with the hypothesis of a temporal trend of body-size increase among <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> between the more ancient Laetoli and the more recent Hadar fossil samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lockwood et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The impressive record of bipedal tracks from Laetoli Locality 8 (Site G and the new Site S) may open a window on the behaviour of a group of remote human ancestors, envisaging a scenario in which at least five individuals (G1, G2, G3, S1 and S2) were walking in the same time frame, in the same direction and at a similar moderate speed. This aspect must be evaluated in association with the pronounced body-size variation within the sample, which implies marked differences between age ranges and a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>. Significant implications about the social structure of this stem hominin species derive from these physical and behavioural characteristics, suggesting that reproductive strategies and social structure among at least some of the early bipedal hominins were closer to a gorilla-like model than to chimpanzees or modern humans.</p><p>Finally, the discovery reported here opens up the intriguing possibility that additional hominin trails may also occur in the area between Site G and Site S.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Geology</title><p>Extended geological observations were carried out in the Laetoli area, mostly in the nearby historical Localities 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leakey, 1987b</xref>), in order to compare the sequences exposed there with the new Site S sequence and to assess its stratigraphic position.

We placed two rods equipped with a spherical level on successive pairs of targets and we marked points at the same height on the rods for each pair by using the water level device. The vertical distance between these points and the targets, as well as their mutual distance, were recorded. Repeating this process for all pairs of targets, the relative plan position and the height of the control points were determined respectively by trilateration and by levelling.</p><p>A preliminary accuracy check was carried out during fieldwork, by using trilateration graphic rules in plan and by the method of successive levelling for heights. By assigning a z-coordinate to the first control point, all subsequent coordinates were derived from addition and subtraction of heights between two successive points. The check was performed by computing the algebraic sum of all height differences, and by verifying that the obtained value was close to zero. Finally, the error obtained in each test-pit was distributed to every z-coordinate of the points, in order to reduce it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The photographic survey was carried out by three shooting modes: (i) using the camera with the 24 mm lens, mounted on a telescopic rod at 4 m above the test-pits, in order to record each test-pit, as well as the spatial connection between test-pits; (ii) using the camera freehand with the 24 mm lens, in order to acquire additional shots of each test-pit; and (iii) using the camera close to the ground with the 50 mm lens, in order to acquire detailed sub-areas. More than 2,000 photos were taken, for a total of about 50 GB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data processing</title><p>Data processing started by checking measurements in plan and height. This step is preliminary to the definition of the control point coordinates. The trilateration method was used to obtain x,y coordinates of the control points in plan. For each test-pit, six measurements were taken at the same height: the length of the four sides of the perimeter and the length of the two diagonals. Redundant measurements were used to compute the errors. In addition to a preliminary graphical control by CAD software (Autodesk AutoCAD), the automatic calculation software MicroSurvey STAR*NET was used to adjust, by least squares technique, a new set of x,y coordinates and heights of the control points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The report provided by the software shows that the residues of adjustments never exceeded 10 mm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which is a fully acceptable figure considering the size of the test-pits.</p><p>Once the adjusted x,y,z coordinate of all the control points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were computed, we used them to scale and locate in the 3D space the 3D models built by the <italic>Structure from Motion</italic> technique (see below).</p><p>The pictures were first calibrated to reduce lens geometric distortion, and tone adjustment was applied in order to homogenize them and to reduce the effects of different lighting conditions during shooting. Subsequently, the software Agisoft Photoscan was used to generate 3D spatial data starting from the pictures, through the following phases: (i) alignment of the images; (ii) creation of the <italic>dense point cloud</italic>; (iii) transformation of the dense point cloud into a surface (<italic>mesh</italic>); (iv) application of the texture to the mesh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Unfortunately, the whole set of morphometric data for the unearthed tracks was never published; only average values obtained from a selected number of tracks were provided.

The easiest method follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tuttle (1987)</xref> and consists of estimating the stature starting from the footprint length considering the ratio between foot length and stature in modern humans. Given that the foot length in <italic>H. sapiens</italic> is generally about 14% to 16% of stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tuttle [1987]</xref>, and references therein), we computed two estimates for the Laetoli hominins assuming that their feet were, respectively, 14% and 16% of their body height (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). This method, however, is not fully reliable because it is based on the body proportions of modern humans, and because it does not take into account that the footprint length does not accurately reflect the foot length. For this last reason, we also estimated stature using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al. (2013)</xref>, who published some equations based on regressions of stature by footprint length in modern Daasanach people (from the Lake Turkana area, Kenya). In particular, given the probable low walking speed of the Laetoli hominins (see below), we used the 'walk only' equation (Standard Error of Estimate, SEE = 5.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>). The obtained results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>) fall within the range of statures estimated with the first method (except for G1 and G3, for which slightly taller statures were calculated). Finally, to assess how the results were influenced by considering modern human data, we also computed some estimates using the foot:stature ratio known for <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>). This ratio is 0.155–0.162 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>), so we obtained stature estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>) predictably close to or slightly lower than the lower limit of the estimates given by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tuttle (1987)</xref> method.</p><p>Similarly, we estimated the body mass of the Laetoli track-makers using the 'walk only' regression equation that relates footprint area (i.e., footprint length x max. width) to body mass (SEE = 3.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>). For S2 only, we used the relationship between the footprint length and body mass (SEE = 3.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>) because of the enlarged morphology of TP2/S2-1. As for the stature, we re-calculated the mass using the known ratio between foot length and body mass in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic> (0.543–0.632) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, George H Perry (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Jungers (Reviewer #2) and Matthew Bennett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this paper provides both the description of a major discovery of new footprints of early bipedal hominins from Laetoli, Tanzania at 3.6 MYA and a valuable analytical result concerning early hominin body size variation. Laetoli is already famous for its Site G fossil footprints of (presumably) <italic>Australopithecus afarensis</italic> individuals. The new Site S footprints reported here represent very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behavior and morphology. A dozen new footprints from the S1 (N=11) and S2 (N=1) trails are sufficiently complete to estimate the body sizes of their makers (again, presumably <italic>A. afarensis</italic>) as well as approximate walking speeds. The new stature estimate for one of the individuals greatly exceeds those previously reconstructed from fossilized skeletal material or footprint data for any <italic>A. afarensis</italic> individual, consistent with substantial body size variation and likely sexual dimorphism within a single species of sexually dimorphic australopithecines.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a several concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. These points include the need to focus on the most appropriate body size estimation methods, to provide appropriate analysis and visualization of the comparisons of body size estimates among the different australopithecine individuals, and to revise the presentation of the manuscript to better reach a general, non-specialist audience.</p><p>1) The authors provide stature and mass estimates from the footprints using both modern human and australopithecine reference samples. The use of the modern human reference samples for stature estimates are inappropriate because they assume body proportions akin to modern humans, which are not possessed by australopithecines. Unfortunately, the australopith-based estimates are based on one individual, the tiny iconic female &quot;Lucy&quot; (A.L.288-1), and foot length in this individual is itself estimated. The authors should be more circumspect in reporting their results, acknowledging that the stature estimates from modern humans are likely exaggerations, and focus their interpretations on the more appropriate (but still tenuous) australopithecine-based predictions – still with the caveat about the limitations of the data from which the predictor is derived. Regardless, these footprints do expand the upper limit of size in (presumably) <italic>A. afarensis</italic>, and offer strong support for arguments favoring strong sexual size dimorphism in this extinct species.</p><p>2) The manuscript should provide additional data and analysis on the footprints and on the comparisons to previous australopithecine body size estimates. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> should provide the range and standard deviation for print length, width, and index in addition to the average for S1, G1 and G3 trails. An ANOVA or other statistical test for significant differences in these parameters among the 3 trails should also be provided.</p><p>3) While there are 14 figures in the current version of the manuscript that contain images of the footprints themselves (see Essential Revisions comment #5 below), there are currently no figures depicting the key analytical result of the paper; that is, the large stature estimate of the S1 individual compared to estimates available for other australopithecines. This needs to be remedied. One option could be to depict stature estimates for all available australopithecines on the Y axis with MYA on the X axis, using different symbols for estimates derived from skeletal elements vs. footprints (and including the error estimates on the plot where available). Another part of the figure could illustrate the geographical location of each fossil/ footprint, with notation making it possible to reference each datapoint between the two panels.</p><p>4) The manuscript presentation requires rework, especially for general audience suitability. In the Introduction and Discussion, for non-specialist readers the significance of this result for interpretations of hominin behavior and evolutionary biology needs to be much more clear. There is not a need to list every theory; rather, focus on one or two of the main/ strongest implications (and the logic behind them, based on previous work) for early hominin behavior/ evolution based on the results of this study, laying out the case very clearly in the Discussion (after presenting possibilities of both sides in the Introduction). In the Results, the main results need more attention. For example, it is insufficient to simply (and briefly) refer the reader to the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref> for the main results of the study.

These points include the need to focus on the most appropriate body size estimation methods, to provide appropriate analysis and visualization of the comparisons of body size estimates among the different australopithecine individuals, and to revise the presentation of the manuscript to better reach a general, non-specialist audience.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors provide stature and mass estimates from the footprints using both modern human and australopithecine reference samples. The use of the modern human reference samples for stature estimates are inappropriate because they assume body proportions akin to modern humans, which are not possessed by australopithecines. Unfortunately, the australopith-based estimates are based on one individual, the tiny iconic female &quot;Lucy&quot; (A.L.288-1), and foot length in this individual is itself estimated. The authors should be more circumspect in reporting their results, acknowledging that the stature estimates from modern humans are likely exaggerations, and focus their interpretations on the more appropriate (but still tenuous) australopithecine-based predictions – still with the caveat about the limitations of the data from which the predictor is derived. Regardless, these footprints do expand the upper limit of size in (presumably) A. afarensis, and offer strong support for arguments favoring strong sexual size dimorphism in this extinct species.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this. A new sentence was added in the manuscript to highlight that we mainly focused our interpretations on the australopithecine-based prediction method. For this reason, the estimated stature of S1 cited in the discussion was changed from about 170 to 165 cm (subsection “Implications of the new Laetoli footprints”). Finally, we formatted in bold type the australopithecine-based estimated statures and body masses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript should provide additional data and analysis on the footprints and on the comparisons to previous australopithecine body size estimates. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> should provide the range and standard deviation for print length, width, and index in addition to the average for S1, G1 and G3 trails. An ANOVA or other statistical test for significant differences in these parameters among the 3 trails should also be provided.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> was amended as requested by the reviewers. Unfortunately, we could not perform any statistical test for significant differences because in the literature the individual measurements of the G footprints were <italic>never published</italic>, but only average values and, at most, ranges (see Leakey, 1981; Tuttle, 1987).</p><p><italic>3) While there are 14 figures in the current version of the manuscript that contain images of the footprints themselves (see Essential Revisions comment #5 below), there are currently no figures depicting the key analytical result of the paper; that is, the large stature estimate of the S1 individual compared to estimates available for other australopithecines. This needs to be remedied. One option could be to depict stature estimates for all available australopithecines on the Y axis with MYA on the X axis, using different symbols for estimates derived from skeletal elements vs. footprints (and including the error estimates on the plot where available). Another part of the figure could illustrate the geographical location of each fossil/ footprint, with notation making it possible to reference each datapoint between the two panels.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting this. We built a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) in which the estimated stature of hominin individuals is plotted against time (Ma). We decided to consider not only australopithecines, but also some early <italic>Homo</italic> individuals, in order to emphasise that the estimated stature of S1 can be comparable to that of more derived taxa, such as <italic>Homo erectus sensu lato</italic>. We used different symbols for estimations derived from footprints vs. skeletal elements, namely femurs. In the latter case, we also indicated graphically if the estimates are based on actual vs. estimated femur length. Each point in the graphic is also linked to the corresponding palaeontological locality through a colour code. Data used to build the figure are in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>. We commented on the figure in the Discussion (subsection “Implications of the new Laetoli footprints”) and wrote a dedicated section in the Materials and methods (subsection “Stature estimate comparisons”).</p><p><italic>4) The manuscript presentation requires rework, especially for general audience suitability. In the Introduction and Discussion, for non-specialist readers the significance of this result for interpretations of hominin behavior and evolutionary biology needs to be much more clear. There is not a need to list every theory; rather, focus on one or two of the main/ strongest implications (and the logic behind them, based on previous work) for early hominin behavior/ evolution based on the results of this study, laying out the case very clearly in the Discussion (after presenting possibilities of both sides in the Introduction). In the Results, the main results need more attention. For example, it is insufficient to simply (and briefly) refer the reader to the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref> for the main results of the study. Also, some brief explanation for how body mass and stature are calculated should be provided in this section (Essential Revisions comment #1 above is also relevant here).</italic> </p><p>We think that this is definitely a good suggestion. We extensively modified the Abstract and Introduction, trying to provide a comprehensive background on the subject of intraspecific morphological variation in hominins and on how it can influence biological and behavioural aspects. In addition, in the Introduction, we discussed the basis for the scientific debate on the variation in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>, in order to enable the reader to better understand the value of our conclusions.</p><p>Introductive notes about Laetoli were moved to a new section (The site: a brief overview), in which some additional information on this important site were added for non-specialist readers.</p><p>In the Results, we added a sentence (subsection “Speed, stature and body mass estimates”) to stress the main results of our stature and body mass estimation. The sentence in the aforementioned subsection briefly explains how stature and body mass were calculated.</p><p>The Discussion section was modified and expanded to emphasise the importance of our results in the context of the debate on the variation in <italic>Au. afarensis</italic>, also adding some recent references on the subject (e.g., Maslin et al., 2015; Jungers et al., 2016). Moreover, we started from the body size estimated data to add some inferences on biological aspects, such as sexual dimorphism and social structure.</p><p><italic>5) Many of the 14 figures are gorgeous, and the images and descriptions of the find are an important part of the paper.
