For drosophilids, yeast fulfills most dietary protein and micronutrient requirements. While several yeast metabolites activate known gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the chemosensory channels mediating yeast feeding remain unknown. Here we identify a class of proboscis GRNs required for yeast intake. Within this class, taste peg GRNs are specifically required to sustain yeast feeding. Sensillar GRNs, however, mediate feeding initiation. Furthermore, the response of yeast GRNs, but not sweet GRNs, is enhanced following deprivation from amino acids, providing a potential basis for protein-specific appetite. Although nutritional and reproductive states synergistically increase yeast appetite, reproductive state acts independently of nutritional state, modulating processing downstream of GRNs. Together, these results suggest that different internal states act at distinct levels of a dedicated gustatory circuit to elicit nutrient-specific appetites towards a complex, ecologically relevant protein source.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31625.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When animals run low on a certain nutrient, they change their behavior to seek out and feed on foods rich in that missing element. For example, fruit flies lacking sugar will look for and eat more sweet food; if they need proteins, they will instead favor yeast, flies’ principal source of proteins.</p><p>In fruit flies, certain neurons on the insects’ tongue (or proboscis) are dedicated only to taste. These cells are divided in groups specialized for a type of nutrient – for instance some of them only react to sugar. Taste neurons sense food and help coordinate how much and for how long the animals will feed. However, despite how important proteins are for flies, the neurons dedicated to tasting yeast had yet to be identified.</p><p>Here, Steck, Walker et al. report discovering a new set of taste neurons in fruit flies, which are activated by a unique combination of molecules present in yeast. Crucially, without these neurons being active, the insects can no longer adjust their diet to eat more yeast when they are deprived of proteins. The activity of these cells is also regulated by internal levels of nutrients derived from proteins.</p><p>The yeast-specific taste neurons are present in two areas on the fly’s proboscis, which is used like a straw when feeding. The two sets of cells have different roles in the consumption of yeast. The first group, which is located at the extremity of the proboscis, helps flies detect and start consuming the resource. The second group, which is on the inner surface of the proboscis, influences whether the insects keep feeding. If one of these groups of neurons is deactivated, flies continue to eat yeast as normal, showing that the system is redundant. However, if both sets are turned off artificially, the insects stop favoring yeast even when they are in need of proteins.</p><p>Steck, Walker et al. show how the animals’ internal states also influence the activity of these neurons. When the insects are deprived of molecules that are only found in proteins, these newly discovered neurons are primed to react more strongly when they are exposed to yeast. This potentially makes flies eat more yeast, and as a result consume more proteins.</p><p>Many biological systems in flies are similar in other insects and even humans. If this is the case for these taste neurons, fruit flies could be a good model to study how pests such as locusts and mosquitoes are attracted to the proteins in crops and blood, but also how humans make decisions about food.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>Taste</kwd><kwd>Behavior</kwd><kwd>Feeding</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-BCM/118684/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/79325/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itskov</surname><given-names>Pavel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0022/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005032</institution-id><institution>Fundação Bial</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>283/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005032</institution-id><institution>Fundação Bial</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>279/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLiACT ITN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Champalimaud Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two different classes of taste receptor neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster proboscis play distinct roles in yeast feeding and are both modulated by the fly's internal amino acid state in order to promote protein-specific appetite.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decision-making is a key function of the brain. One of the most ancestral and consequential decisions animals need to make is which foods to eat, since balancing the intake of multiple classes of nutrients is critical to optimizing lifespan and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>). To do this, many animals, including humans, develop so-called ‘specific appetites’, seeking out and consuming specific foods in response to a physiological deficit of a particular nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beauchamp et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deutsch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes and Wood-Gush, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</xref>). Recently, several populations of central neurons driving consumption of specific nutrients have been identified in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jarvie and Palmiter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). How these circuits modulate sensory processing to elicit state-specific behavioral responses, however, is poorly understood.</p><p>The ability to precisely control the intake of dietary proteins is emerging as a conserved phenomenon across phyla. Insects, for example, tightly regulate their intake of protein depending on their internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dethier, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simpson and Abisgold, 1985</xref>). Mosquito disease vectors impose a huge burden on human health due to their need for dietary protein, which drives host-seeking and feeding behaviors only during specific internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Judson, 1967</xref>). Dietary protein homeostasis is not specific to invertebrates, as humans are also able to select high-protein foods when low on protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gosby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffioen-Roose et al., 2012</xref>). Although protein is essential for sustaining key physiological processes such as reproduction, excessive protein intake has detrimental effects on aging and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>). This emphasizes the importance of this tight control of protein intake.</p><p>Most <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, are highly adapted to consume yeast as the major source of non-caloric nutrients in the wild, including proteins, and thus amino acids (AAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumberger, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camargo and Phaff, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Phaff et al., 1956</xref>), as well as other nutrients such as sterols and vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Starmer and Lachance, 2011</xref>). It is therefore essential for flies to precisely regulate the intake of yeast. This is achieved by modulating decision-making at different scales, from exploration to feeding microstructure, according to different internal state signals, including AA state, reproductive state, and commensal bacteria composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). Deprivation from dietary protein or essential AAs leads to a compensatory yeast appetite, thought to be mediated by direct neuronal nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>). Activation of a small cluster of dopaminergic neurons by AA deficit is involved in stimulating this appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2017</xref>); while in parallel, a protein-specific satiety hormone, FIT, is secreted by the fat body in the fed state and inhibits intake of protein-rich food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Mating further enhances the yeast appetite of protein-deprived females through the action of Sex Peptide on a dedicated neuronal circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2017</xref>). Finally, specific commensal bacteria can suppress the yeast appetite generated by deprivation from essential amino acids, through a mechanism likely to be distinct from simply providing the missing amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). How the nervous system integrates these different internal state signals, and how these signals modulate neural circuits that process chemosensory information and control feeding behavior, is unknown.</p><p>Contact chemosensation is critical for assessing the value of food sources for feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>), as well as for a range of other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auer and Benton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2015</xref>). As in many insects, <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are distributed in different parts of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stocker, 1994</xref>), and their central projections are segregated according to the organ of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, different classes of GRNs are thought to be specialized to detect different categories of taste stimuli, including bitter compounds, sugars, water and sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujishiro et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inoshita and Tanimura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soldano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Of these, the most well-characterized are sweet-sensing GRNs, which mediate attractive responses to sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujishiro et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masek and Keene, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tauber et al., 2017</xref>) and glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wisotsky et al., 2011</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated that sweet GRNs innervating labellar taste sensilla and pharyngeal taste organs act in parallel to support sugar feeding, since loss of taste sensilla alone does not abolish flies’ feeding preference for sugar, but combining this with silencing of pharyngeal sugar-sensing neurons drastically reduces sugar preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). Specific roles have been demonstrated for these distinct sweet-sensing GRN populations: sensillar GRNs are important for initiation of feeding, suppression of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>), and inhibition of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2015</xref>), while pharyngeal GRNs are important for sustaining sugar feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>), limiting sucrose intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>), and inducing local search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murata et al., 2017</xref>). These different classes of neurons project to discrete regions within the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain of the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), providing a potential substrate for encoding different gustatory categories. However, unlike sensillar and pharyngeal GRNs, the role of GRNs innervating taste pegs in feeding behavior remains unknown. Moreover, the involvement of the gustatory system in yeast feeding is currently unclear.</p><p>In order to dissect the neural circuit mechanisms by which internal states homeostatically regulate protein intake, it is crucial to identify the sensory inputs that drive intake of yeast. While multiple volatiles produced by yeast fermentation are detected by the olfactory system and are highly attractive at long ranges to fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christiaens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>), the sensory channels that mediate feeding on yeast are unknown. Several yeast metabolites have been shown to activate subsets of taste receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sensillar GRNs detect glycerol, a sugar alcohol produced by yeast, through the Gr64e receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wisotsky et al., 2011</xref>), while some amino acids have been shown to activate a subset of <italic>Ir76b</italic>-expressing GRNs on the legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>). Taste peg GRNs, meanwhile, have been shown to respond to carbonation, a major byproduct of alcoholic fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischler et al., 2007</xref>), although whether this contributes to feeding has never been tested. Whether and to what extent these individual gustatory cues contribute to the high phagostimulatory power of yeast, however, is currently unknown; and how sensory neurons in different anatomical locations coordinately support yeast feeding is not understood. Thus, a major gap in our understanding of the neuroethology of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is that the specific sensory inputs that drive feeding on yeast remain to be characterized.</p><p>In this study, we show that a subset of GRNs on the proboscis is required for yeast feeding behavior. Acute silencing of these neurons drastically reduces feeding on yeast. We show that within this population of GRNs, neurons in distinct anatomical locations show physiological responses to the taste of yeast, and that while these subsets control distinct aspects of yeast feeding behavior, they are ultimately redundant in terms of total yeast feeding. Specifically, sensillar GRNs are essential for feeding initiation by proboscis extension in response to yeast taste. Moreover, using closed-loop optogenetic silencing, we demonstrate that GRNs innervating taste pegs are essential for sustaining yeast feeding bursts after they have been initiated. We further show that the responses of both sensillar and taste peg sensory neurons to yeast are modulated by the internal AA state of the fly: deprivation from dietary AAs increases both yeast feeding and the gain of sensory neuron responses. This effect is specific to yeast GRNs, as sweet-sensing neurons are not sensitized by yeast deprivation. Furthermore, while reproductive state modulates yeast feeding behavior, it has no effect on sensory responses, indicating that distinct internal states act at different levels of sensory processing to modulate behavior. This study therefore identifies gustatory neurons that are required for the ingestion of an ethologically and ecologically key resource of the fly and describes a circuit mechanism that could contribute to the homeostatic regulation of protein intake.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of sensory neurons underlying yeast feeding</title><p>Yeast is a key nutrient source in the ecology of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camargo and Phaff, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Phaff et al., 1956</xref>). While sugars provide flies with energy, yeast is the primary source of nutrients beyond just calories for the adult fly, and particularly of amino acids (AAs) and proteins. As such, flies can independently regulate their intake of sugars and yeast depending on their internal state in order to compensate for nutritional deficiencies. In mated females, deprivation from AAs specifically increases feeding on yeast, whereas deprivation from dietary carbohydrates elicits a specific increase in feeding on sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As such, we first asked whether these metabolites can account for the high phagostimulatory power of yeast in protein-deprived mated females. In these experiments, we deprived mated females of protein for 10 days, in order to evoke a high level of motivation to feed on yeast. We found that while yeast induced an extremely high level of feeding, these other substrates evoked only a very low level of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also found that deactivating yeast, such that it cannot generate carbonation, did not affect the high level of feeding on this substrate. Furthermore, silencing gustatory neurons known to respond to carbonation and glycerol did not affect yeast preference, reinforcing the idea that individually, these specific yeast metabolites do not explain the high phagostimulatory power of yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). For these reasons, we devised a strategy to identify neurons required for feeding on yeast, flies’ natural food source.</p><p>We set out to isolate neurons which, when their synaptic output is acutely blocked, would abolish the high feeding preference of protein-deprived mated females for yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To this end, we employed a two-color food choice assay in which protein-deprived flies had the choice of eating sucrose or yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>) to conduct an unbiased silencing screen of enhancer-trap lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). In this assay, the number of flies feeding on yeast, sucrose or both was visually scored based on abdomen color, and yeast preference calculated as (n<sub>yeast</sub> – n<sub>sucrose</sub>)/n<sub>total</sub>. Using this approach, we identified one line (<italic>1261-GAL4</italic>) which showed a strong reduction in yeast preference compared to genetic and temperature controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and labeled subsets of chemosensory neurons in the head and legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As such, we designed a targeted follow-up screen in which we silenced subsets of chemosensory and neuromodulatory neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and recovered two more lines that reduced the yeast preference of protein-deprived females when their output was acutely blocked during food choice: <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As with <italic>1261-GAL4</italic>, these lines labeled subsets of chemosensory neurons in the head and legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>).</p><p>The loss of yeast preference upon silencing the neurons labeled in these lines could be due to a reduction in yeast feeding, and/or to an increase in sucrose feeding. To disambiguate these possibilities, we used the ability provided by the flyPAD to monitor the feeding of single flies on individual substrates with a resolution of single sips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). We found that in protein-deprived flies, silencing of the neurons labeled in any of thesese <italic>GAL4</italic> lines specifically reduced yeast feeding, without increasing sucrose feeding, confirming that these neurons are required for feeding on yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). To further test the specificity of this manipulation to yeast, we deprived flies from either AAs or carbohydrates, using a holidic diet, and subsequently measured feeding on the flyPAD. Silencing <italic>1261-GAL4</italic> reduced yeast feeding in AA-deprived flies, but did not reduce sucrose feeding in carbohydrate-deprived flies, further highlighting the specificity of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>1261-</italic>, <italic>Ir76b-</italic> and <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> label common neurons required for yeast feeding</title><p>All of these lines drive expression in both olfactory (ORNs) and gustatory (GRNs) receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>).

GRNs were labeled on the labellum (L) and in pharyngeal taste organs (LSO, VCSO), as well as on the legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>1261-GAL4</italic> exhibited more sparse expression in GRNs than the other lines, including in pharyngeal GRNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). GRN projections could be seen in the subesophageal zone (SEZ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), as well as in leg and wing neuropils of the ventral nerve cord (VNC, FL, ML, HL, W, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>Since all of these GAL4 lines label chemosensory neurons, we hypothesized that all three lines label an overlapping population of sensory neurons required for yeast feeding. To test this, we generated an <italic>Ir76b-GAL80</italic> transgene to suppress expression of effectors in <italic>Ir76b</italic>-expressing neurons. Indeed, combining <italic>Ir76b-GAL80</italic> with <italic>1261-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> suppressed expression in a subset of chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Removal of these overlapping neurons abolished the phenotype of silencing these lines, indicating that these three lines label a common population of <italic>Ir76b</italic>- and <italic>Ir25a</italic>-expressing neurons required for yeast feeding. Importantly, this phenotype was due to a sensory deficit, and not to an effect of silencing neurons in the central nervous system, since <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> exclusively labels peripheral neurons (note absence of cell bodies in brains and VNC of <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). These lines therefore provide an entry point to dissect the sensory basis of yeast feeding.</p><p>Yeast is the main source of AAs for wild <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and recently a subset of <italic>Ir76b</italic>-expressing neurons in the legs has been proposed to respond to AAs through the Ir76b receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed a loss of preference for AA-rich food upon silencing the lines we identified: silencing <italic>1261-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> abolished the preference of protein-deprived flies for a diet containing AAs over one containing sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, as with other yeast metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), flies showed a much lower level of feeding on AAs compared to yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in <italic>Ir76b</italic>, which abolish AA responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>), or in <italic>Ir25a</italic> had no effect on yeast feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–E</xref>). These data strongly suggest that AAs are not the sole stimuli mediating yeast appetite.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Taste receptor neurons within the identified lines are required for yeast feeding</title><p>Upon further inspection, we noted that all of the lines identified above show strong expression in multiple subsets of GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the reduction in yeast feeding we identified would depend on silencing of taste receptor neurons common to these lines. To test this, we took advantage of the gustatory-specific enhancer of <italic>Poxn</italic> to generate a GRN-specific GAL80 line (<italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic>). This <italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic> line has the unique property that, unlike the endogenous <italic>Poxn</italic> transcript or <italic>Poxn-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boll and Noll, 2002</xref>), it is expressed broadly in the gustatory system, including taste peg GRNs. Therefore, in combination with the identified drivers, this transgene blocks the expression of effector genes in GRNs innervating taste sensilla, taste pegs, and almost all pharyngeal GRNs, while leaving expression in ORNs largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To directly test the possible involvement of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) labeled by these lines, we performed multiple loss-of-function manipulations of ORNs.

This suggests that blockade of ORNs labeled in these lines does not account for the yeast feeding phenotype of silencing the <italic>GAL4</italic> lines identified above, and indicates that this phenotype is due to a loss of gustatory input.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31625.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Proboscis gustatory receptor neurons are required for yeast intake.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) YPI of yeast-deprived female flies in which <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> neurons were all silenced, or with <italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic>, and corresponding controls.

The data presented above suggest that distinct subsets of <italic>Ir76b</italic> GRNs act redundantly to support total yeast feeding. This finding is reminiscent of the organization of sweet taste in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whereby sweet-sensing GRNs in distinct anatomical locations are thought to act redundantly to determine total sugar intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). In this case, however, these distinct subsets perform different functions in sugar feeding: while sensillar GRNs mediate proboscis extension in response to sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), pharyngeal neurons are important for sustaining sugar feeding after this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that distinct subsets of yeast GRNs might similarly be involved in stimulating distinct behavioral programs that contribute to food consumption. We first focused on taste pegs, since these structures have been hypothesized by Vincent Dethier to sustain feeding in blowflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dethier, 1976</xref>). To identify behavioral programs mediated by taste pegs, we investigated how silencing these GRNs affected the microstructure of yeast feeding behavior, using the ability of the flyPAD to dissect the microstructure of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To do so, we employed a closed-loop optogenetic approach to silence these neurons in a temporally precise manner only after feeding has been initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Flies were placed in a flyPAD arena containing two yeast patches, and interactions with these food patches were analyzed in real time. Each flyPAD arena was equipped with a green LED, and interaction with one of the yeast patches was programmed to trigger the activation of this LED after a specific delay. This experimental design should result in the silencing of neurons expressing the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>) after the initiation of a feeding burst. Contact with the other yeast patch was not linked to LED activation, providing an internal control for each fly. We first tested our hypothesis that yeast sensory neuron activity after feeding burst initiation is required to sustain feeding. To do so, we used this optogenetic approach to silence the activity of neurons labeled by <italic>1261-</italic> or <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> after burst initiation. Indeed, such temporally precise inactivation of these neurons led to a reduction in the number of sips per yeast feeding burst, which was absent in genetic controls, confirming that these lines label neurons required for sustaining yeast feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>We then tested whether taste peg neurons mediate this sustaining of feeding bursts by specifically silencing taste peg GRNs after feeding initiation. We found that this precisely timed silencing of taste peg GRNs, using <italic>57F03-</italic> or <italic>67E03-GAL4</italic>, resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of sips per yeast feeding burst on the stimulated compared to the unstimulated channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). We further confirmed the role of taste peg GRNs in sustaining feeding bursts using <italic>E409-GAL4</italic>, which has been previously shown to specifically label taste peg GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischler et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, this reduced burst length was specific to flies expressing GtACR1, and not genetic controls. The phenotype of <italic>57F03-GAL4</italic> was not due to labeling of IN1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>), since acute silencing using <italic>83F01-GAL4</italic>, which also labels IN1 but not taste peg neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>), did not affect yeast feeding bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Likewise, silencing sweet sensillar neurons in the same manner, using <italic>Gr5a-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), did not affect the number of sips per yeast feeding burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that this effect was specific to taste peg GRNs. These results confirm the finding that the activity of taste peg GRNs is important to sustain yeast feeding bursts after they have been initiated.</p><p>In contrast to taste peg GRNs, we hypothesized that sensillar GRNs might play a role in initiating feeding in response to yeast taste. This hypothesis was based on the anatomical location of taste sensilla, which are situated on the outer surface of the labellum and therefore come into contact with yeast early in the feeding program; and on the fact that sensillar GRNs mediate proboscis extension in response to sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we turned to the proboscis extension response (PER), an innate response of flies to stimulation of the labellum with attractive tastants and which is generally thought to underlie the initiation of feeding bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We found that <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants, which lack taste sensilla but retain taste peg and pharyngeal GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boll and Noll, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>), showed a near-complete loss of PER to yeast when presented to the labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). This result extends previous work showing that PER in response to yeast presented to the tarsi is abolished in <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masek and Keene, 2013</xref>). Likewise, silencing of <italic>Poxn-GAL4</italic>, which labels most sensillar GRNs in addition to some GRNs in the LSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), drastically reduced the probability of PER to yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). These results indicate that while taste peg GRNs are important for sustaining yeast feeding bursts, sensillar GRNs mediate proboscis extension in response to yeast taste.</p><p>It is important to note that while loss of sensillar or taste peg GRN function did affect specific aspects of the feeding program, flies in which these GRN subsets were compromised were still able to attain the same total level of yeast feeding as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). This reinforces our hypothesis that feeding behavior is highly plastic: when one aspect of feeding is impaired, flies will compensate by altering their pattern of feeding to ensure sufficient uptake of critical nutrients. Indeed, we observe evidence for such compensatory changes in flies in which taste peg GRNs are silenced. These flies compensated for the reduced length of yeast feeding bursts by increasing the total number of yeast feeding bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>). Given that protein is an essential resource for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a strategy which relies on distributed gustatory structures linked with behavioral programs that can be flexibly organized ensures that the fly can reach the required level of yeast intake. Since both sensillar and taste peg GRNs within the identified lines seem to play important roles in yeast feeding, we predicted that both should respond to the taste of yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>Ir76b</italic> labellar GRNs respond to yeast taste</title><p>We have shown that <italic>Ir76b</italic>- and <italic>Ir25a</italic>-expressing GRNs in the proboscis of the fly are required for yeast intake.

Indeed, we found that the response of sugar-sensing GRNs (<italic>Gr5a-GAL4</italic>) to sucrose was not enhanced by yeast deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Surprisingly, deprivation from dietary yeast led to a decrease in feeding on sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which was paralleled by a decrease in the response of <italic>Gr5a</italic> GRNs to low sucrose (20 mM, the same concentration used in behavioral experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This reinforces the notion that yeast deprivation is distinct from starvation, which has been shown to increase the sugar sensitivity of <italic>Gr5a</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, deprivation from a specific food, yeast, specifically enhances the sensitivity of primary sensory neurons detecting that nutrient source, providing a potential basis for homeostatic changes in nutrient choice.</p><p>Of all the nutrients present in yeast, AAs are the most potent modulators of reproduction and lifespan, critical life-history traits of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore unsurprising that internal AA state is the main nutritional factor regulating yeast appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that the increase in sensory gain to yeast would be driven by the internal AA state of the fly, such that GRNs would have increased gain when the fly is low on AAs. Alternatively, exposure to dietary yeast could desensitize yeast GRNs, so that a diet devoid of yeast would increase their sensitivity independently of the flies’ nutritional state. To disentangle the effects of AA state from sensory experience, we turned to a chemically defined diet, which allowed us to manipulate specific components of the diet independently, in the absence of exposure to yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2017</xref>). As expected, removal of AAs from the flies’ diet elicited a specific appetite for yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We then imaged the response of yeast-sensing GRNs in flies deprived specifically from AAs, and found that the gain of these GRNs is enhanced by AA deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data indicate that the internal AA state of the fly modulates the gain of yeast-sensing GRNs, potentially allowing the fly to homeostatically compensate for the lack of AAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Reproductive state acts downstream of sensory neurons to modulate yeast feeding</title><p>Animals have to constantly integrate information from multiple internal states to produce adaptive behaviors. Accordingly, yeast appetite is regulated not only by AA state, but also by the reproductive state of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>).

Our finding that yeast feeding is mediated by specific GRNs strongly suggests that, as with salt taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>), mating changes the behavioral response to yeast taste. We therefore hypothesized that the mating state of the animal could be integrated with nutrient state to drive yeast appetite in three distinct manners: by directly modulating the response of yeast-sensing GRNs; by modulating the sensitivity of the nervous system to protein deprivation; or by modulating downstream processing independently of AA state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Having a cellular readout for the effect of these internal states on yeast taste responses allows us to distinguish these hypotheses. We imaged the response of yeast GRNs in virgin and mated females in different yeast deprivation regimes. While yeast deprivation had a strong impact on taste peg and sensillar GRN responses to yeast, there was no significant effect of mating on these responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This is in contrast to the synergistic interaction between deprivation and mating states seen in the flies’ feeding behavior, and suggests that reproductive state may act on downstream gustatory processing to influence flies’ feeding on yeast. In support of this hypothesis, we found that knockdown of <italic>Sex Peptide Receptor</italic> in <italic>Ir76b</italic>-expressing neurons had no effect on females’ postmating yeast appetite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reinforcing the concept that Sex Peptide acts through the SPSN-SAG pathway, and not directly on yeast-sensing neurons, to stimulate yeast appetite in anticipation of the demands of egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho-Santos and Ribeiro, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, by pooling together virgin and mated female imaging data, we found that the response of yeast-sensing GRNs was significantly increased following just 3 days of protein deprivation (AMS1: p=0.004; PMS4: p=0.005, AUC).

As such, animals must adapt their decision-making depending on these states, choosing resources that fulfill current organismal requirements while minimizing the negative impact of mismatches. In the context of feeding, this means not only regulating caloric intake, but also balancing the intake of different nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>). In this study, we identify resource-specific modulation of primary sensory neurons as a potential mechanism underlying such state-dependent tuning of value-based decisions. Specifically, we show that the amino acid (AA) state of the fly modulates the gain of gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the ingestion of yeast, flies’ main source of dietary protein, such that the response of these neurons to yeast is increased when the fly is lacking AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The response of sensory neurons detecting sugars, in contrast, is not increased by protein deprivation, indicating that this modulation is resource-specific. Rather, the response of sugar-sensing neurons is increased by complete starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the gain of these two classes of attractive taste-coding neurons is separately regulated to drive nutrient-specific appetites.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31625.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>State-dependent modulation of yeast taste neurons regulates specific yeast feeding behavior programs to support protein homeostasis.</title><p>Schematic depicting the regulation of yeast feeding by specific taste receptor neurons.

The response of each of these GRN subsets is modulated according to the fly’s internal amino acid state: after 3 or 10 days of deprivation from yeast, the response of these neurons is increased. This modulation provides a potential neuronal basis to increase both the number and duration of yeast feeding bursts when the fly is lacking amino acids, and thereby to maintain protein homeostasis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31625-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>Yeast appetite is driven by the lack of dietary essential AAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>), and AA state modulates GRN responses to yeast. However, the mechanism through which AA state regulates GRN gain is not known and will be an important avenue for future research. AA state could act at two levels in yeast GRNs: at presynaptic terminals within the SEZ, or at the peripheral level, to adapt GRN responses to the internal state. Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have indicated that complete starvation state acts through distinct neuromodulatory mechanisms on the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons in the brain to increase attraction to food odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Root et al., 2011</xref>) and sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marella et al., 2012</xref>) and to decrease sensitivity to bitter deterrents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, acute blockade of synaptic release from these neuromodulatory systems did not suppress yeast appetite induced by yeast deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that a distinct mechanism may regulate sensory gain according to AA state. Alternatively, this modulation could also occur at the level of peripheral sensory responses, as seen for AA responses in the fish olfactory and locust gustatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nikonov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simpson and Simpson, 1992</xref>). In locusts, this peripheral modulation occurs through desensitization by AAs in the hemolymph. Regardless of the mechanism, our results demonstrate nutrient-specific modulation of the gain of select sensory neuron responses as an elegant way to increase the salience of the specific resources that are important to maintain homeostasis in the current state, and thus to optimize lifespan and reproduction.</p><p>AA state is likely to act at multiple levels in the nervous system, in addition to its effect on primary sensory neurons, to drive a robust yeast appetite - similarly to the multilevel integration seen in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, two central systems have been proposed to modulate protein appetite in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: the dopaminergic WED-FB-LAL circuit, which promotes yeast intake in protein-deprived flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and the fat body-derived hormone FIT, which acts in the brain to suppress intake of protein-rich food in the sated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Identifying whether these systems modulate sensory processing, or affect other aspects of the complex behavioral changes that guide protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>), will be important for a mechanistic understanding of the circuit basis of protein appetite.</p><p>The dynamics of value-based decisions are shaped by multiple ongoing internal states, which must interact in the nervous system. How different states interact at the circuit level to shape behavior is poorly understood. Feeding on yeast is known to be synergistically modulated by both AA state and reproductive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that these two states are separately detected by the nervous system and influence taste processing at different levels of the sensory circuit. While AA state strongly modulates the gain of neurons mediating yeast feeding, reproductive state has no effect on these responses. Although virgin and mated females show very different behavioral responses to protein deprivation, our results suggest that they are subject to the same lack of AAs, and that their sensory neurons are modulated in a similar way by protein deprivation. Mating is therefore likely to gate downstream gustatory processing to enhance yeast appetite in anticipation of the nutritional demands of egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). This result stands in contrast to the previously-described modulation of <italic>Ir76b<sup>+</sup></italic> GRN responses to polyamines in the AMS1 region that occurs transiently following mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hussain et al., 2016a</xref>). This modulation is dependent on SPR expression in GRNs; however, in the context of yeast feeding, we show that SPR knockdown in <italic>Ir76b</italic>+ neurons has no effect. Rather, mating state is detected by Sex Peptide sensory neurons in the reproductive tract, and conveyed to the brain by SAG neurons to modulate yeast and salt appetite, with the postmating yeast appetite also requiring the action of octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rezával et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). How the activity of SAG neurons modulates downstream gustatory processing, however, remains to be discovered.</p><p>Yeast is a critical component of the diet of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, providing most dietary proteins in addition to many other non-caloric nutrient requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumberger, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Starmer and Lachance, 2011</xref>). Here, we identify a population of gustatory receptor neurons that is necessary for yeast feeding and responds to yeast taste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These <italic>Ir76b</italic>- and <italic>Ir25a</italic>-expressing neurons are distributed across the proboscis. The strong yeast feeding phenotype, the anatomical overlap of the lines we identified, as well as the strong and selective response of these neurons to yeast, and our finding that they are regulated by yeast deprivation, indicates that the identified neurons play a key role in yeast intake.</p><p>While different yeast GRNs seem to act redundantly to support overall yeast feeding, we demonstrate that distinct subsets of sensory neurons play different roles in the yeast feeding program: while taste sensilla are essential for proboscis extension in response to yeast, taste peg neurons play a key role in sustaining yeast feeding bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We show that silencing taste peg neurons specifically after feeding initiation leads to premature termination of yeast feeding bursts. These data allow us to assign a novel function to <italic>Drosophila</italic> taste peg GRNs: that of regulating the length of yeast feeding bursts. It is interesting to note that the anatomical location of the taste pegs, on the inner surface of the labellum, places them in an ideal position to survey the quality of the food which is being ingested upon initiation of food intake. A similar function in sustaining the intake of sweet solutions has been demonstrated for pharyngeal taste neurons, which are thought to survey the intake of sugars during drinking bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>). Gustatory neurons located close to or inside the pharynx therefore seem to fulfill an important role in controlling the length of ingestion bouts by continuously surveying the quality of ingested food.</p><p>An intriguing finding from our study is that although sensillar and taste peg GRNs are crucial for specific aspects of the yeast feeding program, compromising either of these GRN subsets alone did not affect the total amount of yeast feeding. This highlights how the plasticity of feeding behavior renders these GRN subsets ultimately redundant in terms of total feeding. This finding is reminiscent of sweet taste in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where although sensillar and pharyngeal GRNs play distinct roles in controlling the structure of sugar feeding behavior, these GRN subsets have been shown to be largely redundant in terms of total sugar intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). Our study clearly shows that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is able to compensate for the perturbation of a specific set of sensory neurons, and the feeding subprogram they control, by altering other behavioral parameters underlying feeding such as the total number of feeding bursts. This parallel architecture, which employs distributed gustatory neurons in the proboscis of the fly, ensures sufficient uptake of critical nutrients through flexible behavioral programs.</p><p>Yeast is a complex, multimodal resource, and thus it is likely that multiple stimuli present in yeast activate <italic>Drosophila</italic> chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wisotsky et al., 2011</xref>). At long ranges, flies are attracted by yeast volatiles detected through olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christiaens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>). Olfaction is also important for efficient recognition of yeast as a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>). However, we show that input from the gustatory system is ultimately critical to drive feeding on yeast. Multiple yeast fermentation products, including carbonation, activate the gustatory neurons identified in this study. However, these stimuli on their own do not induce a feeding rate that approximates the phagostimulatory power of yeast. Rather, our results suggest that multiple yeast stimuli must coincide to produce a yeast percept, and that yeast GRNs are likely to be specialized to respond to a variety of chemicals normally found in this microorganism. These chemicals are likely to include both those we showed to activate subsets of <italic>Ir76b</italic> GRNs, and other yeast metabolites currently not known to be detected by <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This would allow flies to ensure the reliable detection of this essential food source, while permitting selective regulation of feeding on yeast depending on internal state. The emerging picture is that multiple yeast metabolites are detected by different gustatory neurons on the proboscis which act redundantly to mediate yeast intake, thus forming a proxy for the perception and ingestion of protein-, and therefore AA-, rich food.</p><p>Intriguingly, some <italic>Ir76b</italic> + GRNs in the legs have been shown to respond to AAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>). However, we show here that tarsal GRNs are dispensable for yeast feeding, and do not contribute to the <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> silencing phenotype. Furthermore, <italic>Ir20a</italic>, the putative receptor that conveys AA responsiveness, is not expressed in labellar GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koh et al., 2014</xref>), and flies lacking <italic>Ir76b</italic>, which is required for these AA responses, feed on yeast to the same extent as controls. Additionally, AAs hardly activate <italic>Ir76b</italic> GRNs on the labellum, suggesting that other components of yeast mediate this response. It is therefore possible that AA taste does not significantly contribute to the detection of yeast but that flies are also able to detect AAs independently to ensure their uptake from non-yeast sources. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that <italic>Ir76b</italic> GRNs have been shown to mediate the taste of substances which are important to support reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hussain et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Ir76b</italic> GRNs could therefore be specialized in mediating the intake of foods that are relevant for reproduction.</p><p>Overall, our data demonstrate that deprivation from a particular nutrient – AAs – specifically increases the gain of gustatory neurons detecting the ethological food substrate – yeast – that provides the animal with this nutrient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In principle, such nutrient-specific sensory gain modulation could represent a general mechanism through which internal states could change the salience of a resource by directing behaviors towards stimuli that are most relevant in a specific state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>All data are from yeast-deprived mated female flies unless otherwise stated.

Yeast deprivation was induced by feeding flies for 3 (or 10) days on a tissue soaked with 6.5 ml of 100 mM sucrose. For nutrient-specific deprivation, flies were reared on yeast-based food, transferred to fresh YBM for one day and then kept for 3 days on holidic medium with or without amino acids. This holidic medium was prepared as detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piper et al., 2014</xref>), using the 50S200NYaa composition to approximate the amino acid ratio found in yeast. For experiments involving thermogenetic silencing, flies were reared and kept at 18°C. Yeast deprivation was induced by keeping flies for 7 days on a tissue soaked with 100 mM sucrose. This longer deprivation time was chosen to compensate for the lower metabolic rate at colder temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Drosophila stocks and genetics</title><p>Neuronal silencing was achieved using the <italic>20xUAS-shibire<sup>ts</sup></italic> transgene inserted in the <italic>VK00005</italic> or <italic>attP5</italic> landing site (gift of Gerry Rubin, HHMI Janelia Research Campus).

Two days later, flies were transferred again to YBM; on the following day, they were transferred to 100 mM sucrose solution for 7 days to induce a yeast deprivation state.

Groups of 16 female and five male flies were briefly anesthetized using light CO<sub>2</sub> exposure and introduced into tight-fit lid petri dishes (Falcon, Corning, NY, USA #351006). For the yeast choice assays, the flies were given the choice between nine 10 μl sucrose spots mixed with red colorant (20 mM sucrose [Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, #84097]; 7.5 mg/ml agarose [Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, #16500]; 5 mg/ml Erythrosin B [Sigma-Aldrich, #198269]; 10% PBS) and nine 10 μl spots of yeast mixed with blue colorant (10% yeast [SAF-instant, Lesaffre, France]; 7.5 mg/ml agarose; 0.25 mg/ml Indigo carmine [Sigma-Aldrich, #131164]; 10% PBS) for 2 hr at 18, 25 or 30°C, 70% RH, depending on the experimental condition. Flies were then frozen and females scored by visual inspection as having eaten either sucrose (red abdomen), yeast (blue abdomen), or both (red and blue or purple abdomen) media. The yeast preference index (YPI) for the whole female population in the assay was calculated as follows: (n<sub>blue yeast</sub> - n<sub>red sucrose</sub>)/(n<sub>red sucrose</sub> + n<sub>blue yeast</sub>+n<sub>both</sub>). For amino acid preference experiments, yeast was replaced with a holidic diet (200NHunt) lacking sucrose, and sucrose was replaced with a holidic diet (50 mM sucrose) lacking amino acids, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>).

Experiments were performed at 25°C, 70% RH. The flyPAD was modified by adding multi-color high-power (10W) RGBA LEDs (LED Engin, San Jose, CA, USA) above each arena. Both channels were filled with 10% yeast mixed with 1% agarose. Periods of active interaction of the fly with the food (activity bouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>]) were detected from each capacitance channel in real time using a custom Bonsai workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>). For the stimulated ‘experimental’ channel, detection of an activity bout was programmed to send an activation pulse to the green (523 nm) LED if the bout was sustained for 250 ms. Measurements using a photodiode identified a latency of 86.5 ms (mean with a range of 50–120 ms) between sending the activation pulse and the LED being illuminated. Thus, the total latency from activity bout onset to LED activation was 300–370 ms. This latency was chosen such that the LED would be activated only after feeding burst initiation: in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> females deprived of yeast for 3 days, &gt;95% of activity bouts on a yeast patch led to feeding burst initiation within 300 ms. Since flies sip at a rate of around 5 Hz within feeding bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>), LED activation would occur consistently within the first 1–2 sips in an activity bout. The LED activation was sustained for 1.5 s independently of the activity of the fly. After this, the closed-loop optogenetic workflow would begin again. For the unstimulated ‘control’ channel, interaction of the fly with the food did not trigger LED activation. We used high-speed video analysis to ensure that optogenetic inhibition of taste peg GRNs using this protocol did not lead to the unspecific termination of feeding by triggering startle responses or other obvious behavioral artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proboscis extension response assays</title><p>PER assays were performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walker et al., 2015</xref>).

Flies were allowed to recover for 2 hr at 25°C in a humidified box, and were then moved to room temperature (~22°C), where the behavioral experiments were performed under a dissection microscope. Flies were first allowed to drink water until they no longer responded to a 5 s stimulation, and then a droplet of 10% yeast was presented for 3 s on the labellum.

Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4°C with rocking. They were then washed in PBST 2–3 times for 10–15 min at RT and again washed overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibodies were applied (Anti-mouse A594 [Invitrogen] at 1:500 and Anti-rabbit A488 [Invitrogen] at 1:500 in 5% Normal Goat Serum in PBST) and brains were then incubated for 3 days at 4°C.

Images of the periphery did not include immunostainings. Heads and legs of female flies were clipped off and placed in a drop of Oil 10S (VWR chemicals, Center Valley, PA, USA) between a slide and a cover slip.

Each fly was lightly anesthetized using CO<sub>2</sub>, and fixed into a custom-made chamber using UV-curing glue (Bondic, Aurora, ON, USA). The proboscis was fixed by the rostrum in an extended position, and UV-curing glue was used to seal around the head capsule within the imaging window, which was then immersed in AHL saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 10 mM trehalose dihydrate, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> dihydrate, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> hexahydrate, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH7.3) bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. A 30G needle (BD Microlance 3, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used to cut the cuticle along the edges of the eyes, just above the rostrum and just below the ocelli, and this piece of cuticle along with the antennae was removed using forceps. Air sacs and fatty tissue surrounding the SEZ were removed, but the esophagus was left intact. The stage was then transferred to a mount under a two-photon resonant-scanning microscope (Scientifica, UK) equipped with a 20x NA 1.0 water immersion objective (Olympus, Japan).

The objective was controlled by a piezo-electric z-focus, allowing serial volumetric scans of the SEZ. The SEZ was imaged at 31 z-positions, with the upper and lower limits defined in order to encompass the entire SEZ (~60–80 μm), at a frame rate of 61.88 Hz, with a 235 × 117 μm (512 × 256 pixel) frame. Imaging data were acquired using SciScan (Scientifica). A frontal view of the fly, illuminated by scattered light from the laser, was simultaneously acquired through a PointGrey Flea3 camera using Bonsai. Each trial consisted of 4650 frames (150 volumes); the gustatory stimulus was applied to the labellum at approximately volume #51 and removed at volume #100 using a pulled glass micropipette filled with the stimulus solution mounted on a micromanipulator (Sensapex, Finland). Each stimulus was applied 2–3 times per fly, and the mean response per fly used for further analysis. For comparing responses across dietary conditions, imaging sessions using flies of each condition were interleaved.

For each fly, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined based on the maximum intensity projection of the first trial for this fly. Two-photon and camera images were aligned using the onset of scattered laser illumination in the camera image.

Imaging analyses have revealed these distributed GRNs displayed excitatory responses to the taste of yeast. They also provide convincing evidence that the internal AA state of the fly selectively modulates yeast GRNs. Another interesting finding is that reproductive state, which modulates yeast feeding behavior, dose not modulate yeast GRNs. Their findings have provided fresh insights into a circuit mechanism for homeostatic regulation of protein intake. Overall, the data appear to support their main conclusions. Given that circuit mechanisms underlying the homeostatic control of protein intake remain poorly understood, this work is interesting and significant. I believe it will be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after some modifications and editing.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>: In panel A <italic>Ir25a</italic>&gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir76d</italic>&gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> flies seem to prefer HB+suc food at 18 °C, while <italic>1261</italic>&gt; <italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> flies showed no such bias.

Both peripheral and central mechanisms are important in this process, and here, Steck et al. seek to characterize the former in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. From a screen of enhancer trap lines, they identify Gal4 drivers that are required for yeast intake and show that GRNs labeled by these drivers respond to specific protein hunger-inducing inputs (amino acid deprivation vs. mating status). Similar phenomenological data have previously been shown in locusts (protein deprivation increases activity of protein-related GRNs, but not sugar-related GRNs). However, these observations by Steck et al. are important because elucidating circuit mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> lays the groundwork for an in-depth dissection of the mechanisms underlying protein hunger, including how peripheral and central mechanisms are integrated to mediate this process. In general, the work is interesting, carefully performed, and clearly explained. However, there are a number of issues that should be addressed.</p><p>1) One of the main findings of the paper relates to the identification of the GRNs required for protein feeding. However, the identity of these GRNs is only indirectly assessed using <italic>Ir76b-Gal80</italic>. It would be much better to use positive intersectional approaches (e.g., split-<italic>Gal4</italic>) to specifically reveal and manipulate these GRNs.</p><p>2) The authors show that individually silencing taste sensilla, taste pegs, and pharyngeal taste organs does not significantly affect yeast feeding. They conclude that the proboscis GRNs in these different taste structures are functionally redundant. However, this is implied, not directly shown. Moreover, because the authors are assaying feeding, it may instead be that the &quot;redundancy&quot; may instead exist with central mechanisms. To address this issue, the authors should elicit the proboscis extension reflex by applying the food to the proboscis (rather than the legs). Related to this point, Masek et al. (PLOS Genetics 2013) showed that a fly's response to yeast (as measured by PER) was eliminated in Poxn mutants. Because the authors do not clearly isolate the protein-related GRNs as mentioned above, it remains possible that central brain neurons are being silenced when using the different Gal4 drivers.</p><p>3) Another finding that differs from prior published work: Ganguly et al., 2017) found that <italic>Ir76b</italic> mutants exhibit substantially reduced yeast preference, whereas the authors find that <italic>Ir76b</italic> mutants have intact yeast preference in protein-deprived animals. How do the authors reconcile these findings?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Steck et al., the authors identify gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) of the vinegar fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, that are critical for yeast preference, and show that these neurons transduce a signal that is modulated by the amino acid deprivation. The authors first show that when flies are deprived of amino acids for several days, they increase specific desire for yeast. The authors use a series of genetic expression experiments to show that three gal4 lines (IR76B, IR25A, and <italic>1261-Gal4</italic>) all label a subset of neurons in the primary taste neurons critical for the increased desire. They went on to show that each driver labels taste pegs, sensilla, and pharyngeal GRNs, but none of these three components on their own were sufficient to eliminate yeast preference, suggesting redundancy. They go on to show that the AMS1 and PMS4 regions, which receive input from the taste neurons and taste sensilla, respectively, respond to yeast and associated components (glycerol, carbonation and putrescine) with calcium elevation. Additionally, they showed that IR76B GRN-derived calcium response to yeast was strongly elevated after deprivation, whereas sugar GRN response was attenuated. They also showed that this deprivation was linked specifically to amino acids in diet, whose absence modulates gain. Finally, they show that mating increases yeast appetite, but not strength of GRN calcium response, suggesting that mating does not affect this circuit, and instead drives increased yeast appetite through other means.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript and I find the results very interesting. The paper is a comprehensive study of a circuit that has received a good deal of attention but in its current form the manuscript has many gaps and fail to pin point the GRNs that are responsible for yeast taste. Also, I think it is especially important to clarify the results of the pharyngeal GRN silencing, especially <italic>Ir94f-Gal4</italic>. There is also no gain of function experiment suggesting taste is the only driving factor that drives yeast preference as strongly suggested in the manuscript. Optogenetic activation of GRNs that show to regulate yeast preference will complement the silencing experiments. After reading the manuscript I still don't know exactly which GRNs are responsible for yeast taste and where they project in SEZ; there is a disconnection between the silencing and imaging experiments.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, authors argue that amino acids are not the sole stimuli mediating yeast appetite. I would be curious to see how the flies will respond to yeast without amino acids. These yeast sources are commercially available. In the manuscript, major components of yeast taste (glycerol, carbonation, amino acids, etc.) are shown to be not required for yeast appetite, however authors do not suggest or provide a clue about what yeast component is important for flies to taste yeast. I understand this is hard but at least some suggestions would be good to mention in the Discussion.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, authors use the <italic>poxn-GAL80</italic> to suppress the expression in GRNs. Some of the <italic>Poxn</italic> enhancers have been shown to label central neurons in the fly brain (see The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pox neuro gene: control of male courtship behavior and fertility as revealed by a complete dissection of all enhancers, Werner Boll, Markus Noll, Development). It would be good to include the expression pattern of the <italic>Poxn-4-14-Gal4</italic> or provide evidence that <italic>Poxn-Gal80</italic> only suppresses expression of GRNs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, I</xref> see GFP expression in <italic>IR76b-Gal4</italic> outside of chemosensory regions in the fly brain. This expression is suppressed with <italic>Poxn-Gal80</italic>. There is a possibility that internal yeast sensing might be involved in yeast feeding, thus it would be good to clarify the expression of the enhancer that is used to generate the Gal80. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, there are still GFP positive neurons in VNC. What is the evidence that these neurons are not involved in yeast preference? The authors claim that yeast preference is due to only yeast taste and this sentence is not completely accurate.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3, I</xref> see a lot of variation in different Gr and IR silencing experiments, some of which are significant. Could authors comment on this? Especially <italic>Ir60b-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Ir94f-Gal4</italic> seem to have an impact on yeast preference. There is a clear difference with <italic>Ir94f-Gal4</italic>&gt;<italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> at 30 °C vs. 18 °C. However, because authors do not show how controls behave in 18 °C, it is inconclusive. Why are authors not mentioning these results in the text? These two Gal4s have been shown to regulate sugar ingestion and might be involved in yeast appetite too (see A receptor and neuron that activate a circuit limiting sucrose consumption, Joseph R et al. <italic>ELife</italic>, 2017). This paper also has not been cited in the references.</p><p>4) The authors test AMS1 and PMS4 calcium response to carbonation, glycerol, and putrescine, but did not test mixed amino acids, a critical component of the yeast diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31625.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors returned a revised manuscript within the two-month timeframe.

We focused on addressing all the points raised by the reviewers and we are confident that we managed to satisfy all requests.</p><p>We agree that identifying specific subsets of neurons would be an exciting addition to the manuscript. We therefore focused on this key point in our efforts to revise the manuscript and we are happy to report that we can now show that a specific subset of <italic>1261-GAL4/Ir76b/Ir25a</italic> gustatory neurons, namely the taste peg neurons, fulfill an important function in sustaining yeast feeding. These new data therefore assign a specific functional role in yeast feeding to a subset of the neurons previously identified in our study. To our knowledge, this is the first time a specific function in mediating feeding has been assigned to this group of taste neurons. We would also like to highlight that we use a state-of-the-art approach to prove the involvement of taste peg gustatory neurons in yeast feeding. This approach relies on closed-loop optogenetic inactivation of neurons specifically after the initiation of feeding bursts. Furthermore, in the revised manuscript, we also use the proboscis extension response assay, a classic gustatory assay, to show that sensillar gustatory neurons are likely to be involved in initiating yeast feeding, as flies without functional gustatory sensilla do not show proboscis extension towards yeast.</p><p>Importantly, our original conclusion still remains valid. Despite the specific function of taste pegs and taste sensillar gustatory neurons in mediating specific aspects of yeast feeding, the total level of yeast feeding remains unchanged when either of these two subsets of neurons is inactivated. Therefore, our original conclusion that the different sets of gustatory neurons are likely to act redundantly to ensure robust feeding is supported by these new data. We now also provide behavioral evidence for our hypothesis that upon silencing of specific gustatory subsets, flies modify their feeding motor program to compensate for a potential reduction in total yeast feeding.</p><p>Addressing more specifically the points made above.</p><p>We still think that our original conclusion regarding yeast GRN organization is correct – namely that multiple subsets of gustatory neurons, all of which are common to the three lines we identified, coordinately mediate total yeast feeding. This conclusion is supported by three main arguments: 1) All the lines which we identified in the screen as abolishing yeast feeding show a broad and common overlap in specific neurons in the gustatory system, but not in other neurons (for example, these lines label different subsets of olfactory receptor neurons). 2) All neurons on the external surface of the labellum which we surveyed with our imaging setup show robust and strong responses to yeast taste, as well as to some yeast metabolic byproducts such as carbonation. Furthermore, the calcium response to yeast stimulation in the sensillar as well as peg GRN projections is regulated by the internal amino acid state of the animal, reflecting the regulation of yeast feeding behavior. 3) As demonstrated by our new data, silencing subsets of these neurons does not reduce the total intake of yeast, but does compromise specific aspects of the yeast feeding program. These new data show that taste peg neurons and very likely also sensillar GRNs participate in controlling distinct aspects of yeast feeding. However, silencing a specific subset leads to a compensatory change in the feeding program, which ultimately allows the fly to achieve the same level of total food intake as controls. This compensatory mechanism is very likely to rely on the function of the other gustatory neurons labeled in the lines we identified, as silencing all of these neurons prevents compensation and thereby almost completely abolishes yeast feeding.</p><p>We do however agree with the reviewers that identifying subsets of gustatory neurons controlling yeast feeding would significantly add to the current manuscript. As also suggested by the reviewers we have spent multiple years trying different intersectional strategies to reduce the number of neurons which are required to maintain yeast feeding. During these last two months, we redoubled our effort and performed additional intersections using further strategies but likewise, none of these have been successful. The strategies used over the last years relied on using GAL80 lines, FLP&gt;FRT positive and negative intersections, and/or LexA-based positive and negative intersections. The results fell into two categories: either no experiment led to a reduction in total yeast feeding, or when a significant reduction in yeast feeding was observed, subsequent neuroanatomical analyses showed that the intersection was only partially or not at all successful in restricting the expression pattern. In the latter cases, the intersection either led to clonal effects (some chemosensory neurons were still labeled) or only led to a partial suppression of the expression level. Importantly, none of the experimental results contradicted our previous or current results and interpretations.</p><p>Inspired by comments from the reviewers we now chose a different strategy to identify restricted subsets of neurons with specific roles in yeast feeding. We used GAL4 lines that label specific subsets of GRNs within our identified GAL4 lines, and analyzed the effect of silencing these lines on specific aspects of yeast feeding. The logic of this approach was that different GRNs might support different aspects of yeast feeding, but compensatory mechanisms might mask the effect of manipulating these neurons on total yeast intake. Indeed, we now find that silencing the taste peg gustatory neurons alone changes the length of feeding bursts. Using this strategy, we therefore identify a specific function for taste peg GRNs in yeast feeding. We use a novel closed-loop optogenetic silencing approach to further confirm this finding. This function is specific to taste pegs, as silencing using multiple specific GAL4 lines labeling taste peg GRNs, and no other taste receptor neurons, led to the same effect on yeast feeding bursts; whereas silencing other neurons involved in feeding and taste, such as Gr5a GRNs or IN1 neurons, did not affect the length of yeast feeding bursts. Finally, consistent with previous findings, the changes in feeding burst length did not affect the total number of sips, since flies compensated by increasing the total number of yeast feeding bursts.</p><p>We also use different manipulations of sensillar gustatory neurons to show that one of the functions of the sensillar GRNs on the labellum is to promote the extension of the proboscis upon stimulation with yeast. We therefore also show a new function for the sensillar GRNs on the labellum in yeast feeding. Despite the drastic effects on proboscis extension, abolishing sensillar GRN functions has also no discernable effect on total yeast intake, reinforcing once more our concept of functional redundancy.</p><p>Regarding the proposal to use laser ablation to reveal specific functions of gustatory neuron subsets, we are not aware that this has ever been done for studying the behavioral function of chemosensory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We are aware that laser ablation has been used to dissect the function of the <italic>fdg</italic> neurons, but these are very few central neurons which are readily accessible in an imaging context like the one we employ. We also do not believe that laser lesioning of sensory neurons is feasible in a feeding paradigm. Lesioning a large number of neurons within the proboscis would damage the cuticle and therefore impair proboscis function and feeding behavior in general. Furthermore, to lesion the axons of these neurons within the head cavity would require opening the head cavity in a head-fixed preparation. In our hands, the behavior of flies in such a head-fixed preparation is not comparable to that of freely-moving flies. Finally, this approach would not allow us to selectively ablate peg or sensillar GRNs, since their axons are intermingled in the labial nerve. Given these technical constraints, together with the fact that we now dissect the function of specific gustatory neuron subsets using genetic approaches, we decided not to pursue this proposed approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>: In panel A Ir25a&gt;shi<sup>ts1</sup> and Ir76d&gt;shi<sup>ts1</sup> flies seem to prefer HB+suc food at 18 °C, while 1261&gt; shi<sup>ts1</sup> flies showed no such bias.

However, the identity of these GRNs is only indirectly assessed using Ir76b-Gal80. It would be much better to use positive intersectional approaches (e.g., split-Gal4) to specifically reveal and manipulate these GRNs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that positive intersectional approaches are generally more informative than alternative approaches. We have indeed tried such approaches but none of these has been successful/informative for the reasons explained above. However, it is important to note that in this case the following variables make this approach less appropriate for our study: Given the available literature and our own neuroanatomical analyses, the <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> gustatory neuron populations are very likely to largely overlap (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Intersecting these two lines is therefore very unlikely to substantially reduce the number of labeled gustatory neurons in the <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> line. Furthermore, the <italic>1261-GAL4</italic> line is an enhancer-trap line, and although we have mapped the genomic insertion site of the line and tried different approaches to identify an enhancer element reproducing the same expression pattern, we have not been successful in doing so. We therefore currently lack a large repertoire of genetic tools to do positive intersectional genetics using the <italic>1261-GAL4</italic> line.</p><p>Our plan was therefore to use lines which label subsets of gustatory neurons labeled by the identified lines to perform positive intersections. But conceptually this would be the same as directly using these lines to manipulate the specific neuronal subsets. Importantly, in the current manuscript, using careful behavioral analysis of yeast feeding behavior, we are able to show a function of specific subpopulations of GRNs in specific aspects of yeast feeding. We describe the details of this finding in the answer to the next point, but it is relevant for this point of the discussion that with this finding we can now pinpoint the importance of a specific subset of yeast taste neurons in mediating yeast feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that individually silencing taste sensilla, taste pegs, and pharyngeal taste organs does not significantly affect yeast feeding. They conclude that the proboscis GRNs in these different taste structures are functionally redundant. However, this is implied, not directly shown. Moreover, because the authors are assaying feeding, it may instead be that the &quot;redundancy&quot; may instead exist with central mechanisms. To address this issue, the authors should elicit the proboscis extension reflex by applying the food to the proboscis (rather than the legs). Related to this point, Masek et al. (PLOS Genetics 2013) showed that a fly's response to yeast (as measured by PER) was eliminated in Poxn mutants. Because the authors do not clearly isolate the protein-related GRNs as mentioned above, it remains possible that central brain neurons are being silenced when using the different Gal4 drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. Following this idea, we analyzed the effect of manipulating specific subsets of gustatory neurons on different aspects of the yeast feeding microstructure (e.g. initiation of feeding, sustaining feeding, reinitiating feeding) using the flyPAD system. We observed that silencing taste peg neurons using specific lines led to a reproducible, significant shortening of the length of yeast feeding bursts.</p><p>We followed up this observation using a new closed-loop optogenetic silencing approach. We used recently published inhibitory opsins to specifically inhibit taste peg neurons once yeast feeding has been initiated. This closed-loop silencing approach leads to a dramatic reduction in yeast feeding burst length, confirming the importance of taste peg neurons in maintaining yeast feeding once initiated. Importantly, silencing other neuronal populations using this approach does not affect yeast feeding, confirming the specificity of this phenotype.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have also assigned a function to the sensilla population on the labellum. Using the proboscis extension response assay (PER) we are able to show that, as proposed by Masek and colleagues, taste sensilla are crucial for proboscis extension, and therefore feeding initiation, in response to yeast, in this case presented to the labellum. This is demonstrated by our findings that PER to yeast is strongly reduced both in <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants, and when a large subset of sensillar neurons is silenced using <italic>Poxn-GAL4</italic>.</p><p>Overall, the observation that interfering with specific gustatory subsets affects specific aspects of the feeding program but not overall feeding levels clearly indicates that the nervous system is able to robustly compensate for the loss of a specific subset of gustatory inputs, which ordinarily mediates a specific subprogram of feeding, by “homeostatically” modulating other aspects of food intake. This is exemplified by our finding that upon silencing of taste peg GRNs, flies compensate the reduction in the length of feeding bursts by increasing the number of feeding bursts, which ultimately allows the fly to maintain wild-type levels of yeast feeding.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that central neurons labeled by the identified <italic>GAL4</italic> lines contribute to the silencing phenotype, we can exclude this possibility on the basis of the neuroanatomy of <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> neurons. We apologize for not having made this point clearer, but we mention in the manuscript that this line only labels sensory neurons, and no cell bodies in the central nervous system. This is also visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and I</xref>. We can therefore exclude the hypothesis that the silencing phenotype is due to silencing non-sensory (central) neurons. We have now highlighted this point better in the manuscript by amending the passage to read:</p><p>“Importantly, this phenotype was due to a sensory deficit, and not to an effect of silencing neurons in the central nervous system, since <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> exclusively labels peripheral neurons (note absence of cell bodies in brains and VNC of <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another finding that differs from prior published work: Ganguly et al., 2017) found that Ir76b mutants exhibit substantially reduced yeast preference, whereas the authors find that Ir76b mutants have intact yeast preference in protein-deprived animals. How do the authors reconcile these findings?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note here an important difference between our study and that of Ganguly and colleagues: while we monitor yeast feeding, Ganguly et al. use yeast extract in their experiments. Yeast extract has a much lower phagostimulatory power than yeast (see for example Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, where protein-deprived flies eat less yeast extract than sucrose, which is something we never see in this or other manuscripts when using whole yeast). This is likely due to the fact that yeast extract contains only the water-soluble fraction of yeast, and therefore lacks many other important stimuli driving feeding on yeast. The discrepancy between our data and those of Ganguly and colleagues can be easily explained by supposing that the stimuli mediating feeding on yeast extract depend on <italic>Ir76b</italic>, while complete yeast also contains stimuli which are <italic>Ir76b</italic>-independent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript and I find the results very interesting. The paper is a comprehensive study of a circuit that has received a good deal of attention but in its current form the manuscript has many gaps and fail to pin point the GRNs that are responsible for yeast taste.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above in our comments to the editor and reviewer 2, we now provide evidence that taste peg neurons are specifically responsible for maintaining feeding on yeast. We thereby provide the identity of a specific type of neurons involved in yeast feeding. Importantly, the function of taste peg neurons in controlling the length of feeding bursts is novel. Furthermore, the alteration in feeding bursts upon silencing of taste peg GRNs does not translate into a change in overall yeast intake, as the fly compensates by altering other aspects of their feeding behavior, including the total number of feeding bursts. This explains the lack of overall yeast feeding phenotype when manipulating only this subset of taste neurons, and supports our original interpretation that very likely different yeast gustatory subsets can compensate for the loss of other subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I think it is especially important to clarify the results of the pharyngeal GRN silencing, especially Ir94f-Gal4.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having made our point clear in the previous version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. In this version of the figure, we originally omitted all the additional control experiments we had done in order not to overcrowd the figure. We only showed all of the control genotypes for lines that showed a statistically significant difference between the 18 and 30 °C conditions displayed at the top of the figure. Indeed, in this figure <italic>Ir94f-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> do show a phenotype when compared to the 18 °C control. However, what is not clear in the previous version of the figure is that when compared to the genetic background control experiments these two lines do not show a significantly different level of yeast feeding. The reason for the ambiguity is that the relevant controls were only displayed in the bottom panels of the figure. As was visible in this lower panel, the apparent silencing phenotype disappears when considering the genetic background controls. We have now modified the figure to include all control experiments in all panels, and hope that the argument for a lack of phenotype is now made more clearly. We have also edited the corresponding text to make clear that although individual comparisons may be significant, none of these pharyngeal lines shows a significant reduction in yeast feeding compared to all of the relevant controls:</p><p>“None of these lines showed a reduction in yeast feeding compared to all controls, suggesting that the tested pharyngeal GRNs are not essential to support total yeast feeding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also no gain of function experiment suggesting taste is the only driving factor that drives yeast preference as strongly suggested in the manuscript. Optogenetic activation of GRNs that show to regulate yeast preference will complement the silencing experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made multiple attempts to induce an increase in feeding on a non-yeast substrate by activating yeast GRNs using different <italic>GAL4</italic> lines labeling all or subsets of yeast gustatory neurons. Our attempts to perform “gain-of-function” experiments were based on the use of optogenetic approaches (CsChrimson), thermogenetic approaches (TrpA1), a constitutively active sodium channel (NaChBac), and lacing food with capsaicin and expressing the capsaicin receptor (VR1) in the gustatory neurons of interest. Some of our manipulations of specific GRN subsets did lead to slight but statistically significant increases in total feeding or feeding burst length. However, these effects were not solidly reproducible and differed among lines labeling the same sensory neuron subsets. We therefore decided not to include these data in this manuscript, and assume that while these neurons are required for yeast feeding, their activation alone is not sufficient to induce robust feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After reading the manuscript I still don't know exactly which GRNs are responsible for yeast taste and where they project in SEZ; there is a disconnection between the silencing and imaging experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the new data in which we show the involvement of the peg neurons in controlling yeast feeding burst length satisfies the expectations of the reviewer about pinpointing a specific set of neurons mediating yeast feeding.</p><p>Regarding the apparent disconnect between the behavioral and imaging experiments, we are puzzled by the statement of the reviewer. In our opinion there is a very clear connection between these two types of data. In short, we show that sensillar and taste peg GRNs play specific roles in yeast feeding and that both sensillar and taste peg GRNs labelled by <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> show physiological responses to the taste of yeast, which are modulated by the internal AA state of the animal. Importantly these changes in yeast sensitivity reflect the changes in yeast feeding elicited by the same nutritional manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, authors argue that amino acids are not the sole stimuli mediating yeast appetite. I would be curious to see how the flies will respond to yeast without amino acids. These yeast sources are commercially available.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an interesting experiment to do. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any available yeast that lacks amino acids. We think that perhaps the reviewer is referring to yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Sigma #Y0626). This has been previously claimed by Ganguly and colleagues to be yeast extract without amino acids. However, as stated on the website of Sigma, this is actually a base medium designed for growing yeast and is unrelated to yeast extract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the manuscript, major components of yeast taste (glycerol, carbonation, amino acids, etc.) are shown to be not required for yeast appetite, however authors do not suggest or provide a clue about what yeast component is important for flies to taste yeast. I understand this is hard but at least some suggestions would be good to mention in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now speculate in the discussion on the nature of the yeast components which could be important for mediating the high phagostimulatory power of yeast. In short, we do not think that there is one component which fulfills that specific role, but rather that a blend of different cues leads to the exceptionally high feeding rate observed in protein-deprived mated females. We address this point in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion, and we have added an additional sentence to this passage to clarify our position. A part of this including the added sentence reads:</p><p>“Rather, our results suggest that multiple yeast stimuli must coincide to produce a yeast percept, and that yeast GRNs are likely to be specialized to respond to a variety of chemicals normally found in this microorganism. These chemicals are likely to include both those we showed to activate subsets of <italic>Ir76b</italic>GRNs, and other yeast metabolites currently not known to be detected by <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, authors use the poxn-GAL80 to suppress the expression in GRNs. Some of the Poxn enhancers have been shown to label central neurons in the fly brain (see The Drosophila Pox neuro gene: control of male courtship behavior and fertility as revealed by a complete dissection of all enhancers, Werner Boll, Markus Noll, Development). It would be good to include the expression pattern of the Poxn-4-14-Gal4 or provide evidence that Poxn-Gal80 only suppresses expression of GRNs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, I</xref> see GFP expression in IR76b-Gal4 outside of chemosensory regions in the fly brain. This expression is suppressed with Poxn-Gal80. There is a possibility that internal yeast sensing might be involved in yeast feeding, thus it would be good to clarify the expression of the enhancer that is used to generate the Gal80.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clearly indicate in the list of lines used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) that <italic>Poxn-GAL4</italic> corresponds to <italic>Poxn-Gal4-14</italic>. Indeed, <italic>Poxn-GAL4-14</italic> and, therefore also likely <italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic>, is expressed outside of the gustatory system. This has been nicely documented by Boll and Noll and indeed, when we intersect <italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic> with <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic>, the expression of a few central cell bodies disappears. We still think, however, that it is valid to claim that the effect on yeast feeding upon silencing of <italic>Ir76b-GAL4, 1261-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> is likely due to silencing of gustatory neurons. The main argument is that <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> drives expression exclusively in sensory neurons. Given that the effect of silencing with <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> is abrogated when we introduce either <italic>Ir76b-GAL80</italic> or <italic>Poxn-GAL80</italic>, the phenotype of the lines we identified is very likely due to a common population of taste receptor neurons labelled by <italic>1261GAL4, Ir76b-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic>. It is important to note that we are not claiming that there is no postingestive assessment of yeast in the fly; such an effect could additionally contribute to yeast feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, there are still GFP positive neurons in VNC. What is the evidence that these neurons are not involved in yeast preference?</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> we show the evidence that intersecting <italic>tsh-GAL80</italic> with <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic> abolishes expression in the leg chemosensory neurons but does not abolish the silencing effect on yeast feeding. We therefore conclude that silencing of leg chemosensory neurons does not explain the yeast feeding phenotype observed when silencing <italic>Ir76b-GAL4</italic>. Indeed in this intersection experiment, a few cell bodies are still labeled in the VNC. However, given that <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> does not label these neurons (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref> it only labels chemosensory neurons), and the silencing effect of this line is due to the joint population with <italic>Ir76bGAL80</italic>, these neurons are unlikely to contribute to the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that yeast preference is due to only yeast taste and this sentence is not completely accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if we gave the impression that this is the case. We have tried to be as careful as possible to not claim in our manuscript that yeast feeding depends only on taste. In our opinion we are always clear to say that taste plays an important role in mediating yeast feeding. If the reviewer can point us to a specific sentence we would be very happy to edit it to clarify our position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3, I</xref> see a lot of variation in different Gr and IR silencing experiments, some of which are significant. Could authors comment on this? Especially Ir60b-Gal4 and Ir94f-Gal4 seem to have an impact on yeast preference. There is a clear difference with Ir94f-Gal4&gt;shi<sup>ts</sup> at 30 °C vs. 18 °C. However, because authors do not show how controls behave in 18 °C, it is inconclusive. Why are authors not mentioning these results in the text? These two Gal4s have been shown to regulate sugar ingestion and might be involved in yeast appetite too (see A receptor and neuron that activate a circuit limiting sucrose consumption, Joseph R et al. eLife, 2017).
