(IFT) is essential for the elongation and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Due to the traffic jam of multiple trains at the ciliary tip, how IFT trains are remodeled in these turnaround zones cannot be determined by conventional imaging. Using PhotoGate, we visualized the full range of movement of single IFT trains and motors in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella. Anterograde trains split apart and IFT complexes mix with each other at the tip to assemble retrograde trains. Dynein-1b is carried to the tip by kinesin-II as inactive cargo on anterograde trains. Unlike dynein-1b, kinesin-II detaches from IFT trains at the tip and diffuses in flagella. As the flagellum grows longer, diffusion delays return of kinesin-II to the basal body, depleting kinesin-II available for anterograde transport. Our results suggest that dissociation of kinesin-II from IFT trains serves as a negative feedback mechanism that facilitates flagellar length control in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28606.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cilia and flagella are hair-like structures that protrude from nearly every human cell and play a number of roles including transmitting signals and enabling cells to move. These structures lengthen when new material is deposited at their tip by a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). In this process, protein complexes known as IFT trains carry cargo along tracks that run along the length of each flagellum. Different motor proteins power the IFT trains in different directions: kinesin moves IFT trains from the base to the tip, while dynein moves them back in the opposite direction.</p><p>When IFT trains arrive at the tip of the flagellum, they release their cargo and undergo a major reorganization process in which the trains switch motors in order to move back to the base. Because the many IFT trains at the tip form a kind of ‘traffic jam’, standard imaging techniques have been unable to distinguish exactly what happens during this reorganization.</p><p>A new imaging method called PhotoGate microscopy can track individual molecules inside crowded cells. Chien, Shih et al. have now used this method to visualize the full range of movements made by IFT trains and motors in the flagella of a species of single-celled algae. This revealed that at the tip of the flagellum, IFT trains split apart and mix with each other to assemble into new trains, which move back to the base. In addition, kinesin carries dynein to the tip as inactive cargo, detaches from IFT trains at the tip and diffuses back to the base of the flagellum. This delays kinesin’s return and causes it to accumulate in the flagellum, which helps to explain why flagella assemble more slowly as they lengthen: as the flagellum grows longer, less kinesin is available at the base to transport material to the tip. Thus kinesin diffusion helps the algae to regulate the length of their flagella.</p><p>Further research is now needed to study whether similar mechanisms control the length of flagella in other organisms. Defects in the intraflagellar transport process have been linked to a range of human diseases known as ciliopathies, and so the results presented by Chien, Shih et al. could also help us to uncover the causes and potential treatments for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intraflagellar transport</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>ciliary length control</kwd><kwd>single molecule imaging</kwd><kwd>photogate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM055667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>Mary E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1055017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1617028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM116204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During intraflagellar transport (IFT), kinesin-II dissociates from IFT trains at the flagellar tip and its diffusion in flagella serves as a negative feedback mechanism that facilitates flagellar length control in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia (or eukaryotic flagella, terms essentially referring to the same organelle) are hair-like organelles that extend from the plasma membrane of nearly all mammalian cells. The core structural component of a cilium is the axoneme, a ring of nine unipolar doublet microtubules surrounding a central pair of singlet microtubules. Cilia play essential roles in cell motility, generate the movement of fluids over multiciliated surfaces, and sense extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Satir et al., 2010</xref>). To assemble and maintain functional cilia, the IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>) transports axonemal precursors and sensory proteins bidirectionally between the cell body and the ciliary tip. Defects in IFT are linked to a wide range of human diseases including Bardet-Biedl syndrome, retinal degeneration, and polycystic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Intraflagellar cargoes interact with multiprotein complexes known as IFT particles that are organized into larger IFT trains as they enter the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lechtreck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>). In most species, the IFT trains are transported anterogradely from the base to the tip of a flagellum by heterotrimeric kinesin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>), but some species also use a second homodimeric kinesin to build more specialized sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snow et al., 2004</xref>). Once the trains reach the tip, they are reorganized and transported retrogradely to the ciliary base by dynein-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazour et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Porter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Signor et al., 1999</xref>). Along the length of a cilium, the activities of kinesin and dynein motors are reciprocally coordinated, such that only one type of a motor is active at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, trains move between the tip and base of the cilium without significant pauses or back-and-forth motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>) and switch directions at the turnaround zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). Dynein-1b requires kinesin-II activity to reach the ciliary tip, suggesting that it travels on anterograde trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rompolas et al., 2007</xref>). Retrograde traces of kinesin-II have not been frequently observed in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and it remains unclear how kinesin-II returns to the basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wingfield et al., 2017</xref>). Because anterograde and retrograde IFT trains have different sizes and depart at different frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>), IFT trains must be remodeled at the distal tip and the flagellar base.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the remodeling of IFT complexes at the ciliary tip and base cannot be directly observed by conventional microscopy methods because multiple trains coexist in these turnaround zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wren et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, we adapted PhotoGate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belyy et al., 2017</xref>) to control the number of fluorescent IFT trains entering the flagellum of the unicellular algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. Using this approach, we monitored the turnaround behavior and remodeling of single IFT trains at the flagellar tip. We also elucidated the mechanisms by which the kinesin and dynein motors are recycled in this process and IFT trains reverse their direction of motion. The dynamics of IFT motor turnover at the tip suggest a new mechanism for how <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> controls the length of its flagella.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFT trains split apart and mix with each other at the flagellar tip</title><p>To monitor IFT movement, we tracked the dynamic behavior of IFT27, a core component of the IFT complex B, in a <italic>pf18 IFT27-GFP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qin et al., 2007</xref>).

The gate beam was repeatedly turned on for 0.2 s at 1 Hz to photobleach any additional anterograde trains entering the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Under these conditions, less than 1% of anterograde IFT trains were able to pass the gate unbleached. This approach revealed the full range of movement of single fluorescent IFT trains within the flagellum. IFT movement can be divided into three stages: anterograde movement toward the tip, pausing at the tip, and returning to the base by retrograde transport.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-28606-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28606.008</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Observing the dynamics of single IFT trains at the flagellar tip using the PhotoGate.</title><p>The distal half of the flagellum on the right of a surface-adhered <italic>pf18 IFT27-GFP</italic> cell is photobleached by an intense laser beam.

On average, 2.4 retrograde trains were detected departing from the tip after the arrival of a single fluorescent anterograde train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, N = 97), consistent with higher frequencies of retrograde IFT trains than anterograde IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). However, the number of retrograde trains per fluorescent anterograde train in PhotoGate assays (2.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was significantly higher (Welch’s t-test, p=10<sup>−20</sup>) than the ratio of retrograde to anterograde train frequencies (1.15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggested that IFT complexes from different anterograde trains recombine with each other to form retrograde trains at the tip. To test this possibility, we closed the gate after two or three fluorescent anterograde trains entered the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) and measured the number and return frequency of retrograde trains departing from the tip. If individual trains split and return without mixing with each other, the number and frequency of fluorescent retrograde trains would be proportional to the number of fluorescent anterograde trains. In contrast, we observed 2.4, 3.6, and 4.2 returning trains on average for one, two, and three incoming trains, respectively (N = 97, 60, 42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The return frequencies for one, two, and three incoming fluorescent trains were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.76 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.

This is because providing a higher number of fluorescent GFPs available at the tip increases the likelihood of retrograde trains to have at least one fluorescent GFP. Remarkably, the y-intercept remained constant when we allowed one to three more fluorescent anterograde trains to enter the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that this duration corresponds to processing and breakdown of anterograde trains at the tip (referred to as tip remodeling time).

When extracellular calcium in media (0.34 mM) was chelated using 0.5 mM EGTA, the tip departure time increased to 2.8 s (Welch’s t-test, p=0.01), whereas tip remodeling time (1.4 s) remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). Therefore, calcium has minimal effect on the breakdown of anterograde trains, but may have a regulatory role in the assembly or departure of retrograde trains. Addition of 0.1 mM ciliobrevin D to media results in 50% reduction in the frequency of retrograde and anterograde trains, and 50% and 28% reduction in retrograde and anterograde train velocities, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shih et al., 2013</xref>).

In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, the axoneme contains nine doublet microtubules, each composed of a complete A-tubule (with 13 protofilaments) and an incomplete B-tubule (with 10 protofilaments). The B-tubule terminates before the A-tubule less than 1 µm from the flagellar tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ringo, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Satish Tammana et al., 2013</xref>). Recent electron microscopy studies have revealed that anterograde IFT trains are transported primarily on the B-tubule, whereas retrograde IFT trains are transported on the A-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). The pausing of IFT particles observed at the flagellar tip in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> may therefore reflect not only the time involved in the re-organization of the IFT particles, but also the time required for switching between microtubule tracks.</p><p>In other cilia, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory and mammalian olfactory cilia, the proximal doublet microtubule segment is shorter, and the distal singlet MTs can vary significantly in length (~2.5 µm in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to &gt;100 µm in mouse olfactory cilia). These cilia also employ two different kinesin-II motors for anterograde IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, heterotrimeric kinesin-II is concentrated near the basal body region and transports anterograde IFT particles into the proximal doublet segment, where they are gradually handed over to a homodimeric kinesin-II, OSM-3, for transport into the distal singlet segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snow et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, both the heterotrimeric and homodimeric kinesin-II motors are recycled to the ciliary base by retrograde IFT, not by diffusion, in these and other metazoan cilia studied to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broekhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mijalkovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Signor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another important difference between IFT in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and metazoan cilia is the dynamic behavior of the motors themselves. IFT particles and motors move processively in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>), with little or no evidence for the frequent pausing and reversal along the axoneme previously described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or mouse olfactory sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mijalkovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). We also did not observe acceleration and deceleration of IFT motors near turnaround zones, nor the instantaneous (&lt;600 ms) reversal of dynein-1b at the ciliary tip described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mijalkovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). The reasons for these differences in IFT dynamics and turnover remain unknown, but they may be related to the variations in ciliary structure and organization described above, differential phosphorylation of kinesin-II motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2014</xref>), posttranslational modification of the microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>), and other unidentified factors. In addition, both the frequency and speed of IFT is higher in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dentler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wingfield et al., 2017</xref>) than that measured thus far in metazoan cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yi et al., 2017</xref>).

According to the balance point model, flagellar length is set when flagellar assembly and disassembly rates reach equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>). While the disassembly rate is independent of flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>), the assembly rate is determined by the injection of IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>). The amount of material being transported by these trains to the tip is correlated strongly with the amount of material localized to the flagellar base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ludington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ludington et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wren et al., 2013</xref>), which serves as a loading dock. Previous studies showed that IFT train size and the number of ciliary cargos per train scales inversely with flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with the reduction of the assembly rate as flagella elongate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remained unclear which essential component of the IFT machinery limits the assembly of IFT trains at the basal body during elongation.</p><p>We propose that dissociation of kinesin-II from IFT trains serves as a negative feedback mechanism to control the assembly rate in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Our results show that the majority of kinesin-II dissociates from IFT trains at the flagellar tip and diffuses within the flagellum. Diffusion leads to a large accumulation of kinesin-II in the flagellum as the flagellum grows longer, while the amount of kinesin-II at the base decreases several-fold. As a result, lower amounts of kinesin-II are available to bring new anterograde IFT trains to the flagellar tip. This may lead to a reduction in the IFT train size and the rate of flagellar assembly as the flagella elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>). Indeed, a recent theoretical study demonstrated that increased diffusion time of kinesin-II in longer flagella can explain the inverse relationship between length and IFT motor recruitment rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this model, previous studies showed that KAP intensity at the basal body correlates with KAP loading on IFT trains and the assembly rate during flagellar regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ludington et al., 2013</xref>). In the temperature-sensitive mutant strain <italic>fla10<sup>ts</sup></italic>, inactivation of kinesin-II motility ceases IFT and leads to resorption of the flagellum at a constant rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>). At intermediate temperatures, flagellar length correlates strongly with the estimated fraction of active kinesin-II motors in <italic>fla10<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall and Rosenbaum, 2001</xref>), indicating that the amount of active kinesin-II limits flagellar growth. The experiments performed under Li<sup>+</sup> and cycloheximide treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) also support the idea that altering the amount of KAP available for the flagellar compartment positively correlates with the flagellar length and that the equilibrium length is set when KAP gets depleted below a certain threshold at the basal body. We note that the KAP intensity at the flagellar base was lower (34–40%) in Li<sup>+</sup> and cycloheximide treated cells than in control cells at equilibrium (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, left). Although the reason for this difference remains unclear, it could be due to a reduction of KAP concentration in the cytoplasm or changes in the flagellar disassembly rate under treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson and Lefebvre, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Unlike kinesin-II, IFT components are rapidly recycled to the cell body by dynein-1b and the amount of these components at the flagellar base remains nearly constant as the flagella elongate. Therefore, the abundance of IFT components and dynein-1b at the flagellar base is not limiting to maintain the length, consistent with previous observations that a small amount of IFT complexes and dynein-1b is sufficient to maintain fully grown flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Diffusion is also proposed to play a role in setting the length of bacterial flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renault et al., 2017</xref>), long polymers made from a single protein flagellin. Similar to the flagellar length control model originally proposed for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levy, 1974</xref>), flagellins are injected into the channel of the filament and they diffuse to reach the assembly site at the filament tip, generating a concentration gradient decreasing towards the tip. As the filament elongates, it grows more slowly because it takes longer for the components to reach the tip. In contrast to bacterial flagellin, structural components are carried to the tip by IFT in eukaryotic flagella. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, we showed that diffusion of kinesin-II from the tip sets a concentration gradient decreasing towards the basal body, and its return to the flagellar base is delayed as the flagella elongate. This delay limits the amount of kinesin-II available for building longer flagella.</p><p>Our model is challenged by studies showing that the kinesin-II mutant strains <italic>fla10<sup>ts</sup></italic> and <italic>fla3</italic> maintain nearly full-length flagella at permissive temperatures although they accumulate significantly lower amounts of kinesin-II in the flagellar compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>fla3</italic> cells exhibit slower flagellar regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>), consistent with our prediction that the lower amount of kinesin-II negatively affects the assembly rate. However, a more recent study showed that <italic>fla10<sup>ts</sup></italic> flagella contain wild-type levels of kinesin-II at permissive temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Given these apparent discrepancies, more quantitative approaches will be required to address whether the amount of kinesin-II correlates with flagellar length.</p><p>According to the balance-point model, flagella that contain lower amounts of kinesin-II can still maintain nearly full-length if they also have a lower disassembly rate. The studies that reported a reduction in kinesin-II expression in <italic>fla10<sup>ts</sup></italic> and <italic>fla3</italic> cells also noted significantly reduced anterograde IFT frequency and IFT particle subunits in flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>). This could negatively affect the disassembly rate because IFT is required for efficiently removing certain axonemal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qin et al., 2004</xref>) and resorbing the flagellum prior to mitosis. Indeed, flagellar resorption before mitosis occurs at a faster rate than flagellar disassembly after inactivation of IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan and Snell, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms that control the expression of IFT components after deflagellation, regulate the exchange of material between the basal body and cytoplasm, and load material onto IFT trains must also play a major role in determining the length of flagella. Several studies have shown that IFT components are upregulated and accumulate in large numbers at the flagellar base after deflagellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lefebvre and Rosenbaum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stolc et al., 2005</xref>).

The angle of incident light was adjusted lower than the critical angle to illuminate a deeper field (~300 nm) near the coverslip surface. The fluorescent signal was recorded by an iXon 512 × 512 electron-multiplied charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (Andor, Belfast, United Kingdom). 1.5x extra magnification was used to obtain an effective pixel size of 106 nm. Data were collected at 10 Hz. Excitation laser beams were controlled by shutters (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY). Because the CCD image saturates under intense laser illumination of the focused gate beam, shutter timing was synchronized with the camera acquisition by a data acquisition card (NI, USB-6221) to minimize the number of saturated frames in recorded movies. For two-color imaging, GFP and crCherry fluorescence were separated into two channels on a CCD camera using Optosplit II (Cairn, Kent, United Kingdom).

The second path was focused (2 MW cm<sup>−2</sup>) to the image plane and steered with a fast piezo-driven mirror (S-330.8SL, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany). The piezo-driven mirror was mounted at a position conjugate to the back-focal plane of the objective to ensure that the tilting of the mirror resulted in pure translation of the focused beam in the image plane. The mirror provided a usable travel range of 30 µm x 30 µm area at the image plane. The mirror’s angle was updated via analog output channels of a data acquisition card (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USB-6221) and controlled by software custom-written in LabVIEW.</p><p>Flagellar orientation of surface adhered cells was visualized by TIR imaging. Initially, the gate beam was placed at the tip of flagellum and moved along the flagellar orientation to prebleach the distal half of the flagellum. The gate beam was turned off when it was positioned near the base of the flagellum to allow a single fluorescent anterograde train to enter the flagellum. Occasionally (&lt;5%), two anterograde trains overlapped and entered the flagellum simultaneously. The gate beam was then turned on for 0.2 s of every 1 s to bleach other anterograde trains. Based on the size of the gate beam in the image plane, gating frequency was adjusted such that less than 1% of anterograde IFT trains moved faster than the cutoff speed (3.0 µm s<sup>−1</sup>). The trajectories of these trains can be distinguished from each other as they move at different speeds along the flagellum. The locations of flagellar tips were determined by brightfield imaging (data not shown).

Simulations assumed that anterograde trains arrive and retrograde trains depart from the tip through a purely stochastic process, adding and subtracting particles to a mixed flagellar tip pool.</p><p>We estimated that each anterograde train contains six fluorescent GFPs by comparing the fluorescent intensities of anterograde trains in the <italic>pf18 IFT27-GFP</italic> strain to those of KAP-GFP spots in the <italic>fla3::KAP-GFP</italic> strain under the same imaging conditions and calibrating the number of molecules based on previous photobleaching analysis of the <italic>fla3::KAP-GFP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>). Each retrograde train was constructed by a random selection of IFT particles available at the tip. Tip intensity measurements revealed that the signal of the IFT complexes located at the tip is approximately three times brighter than an average anterograde train. The photobleaching of GFPs (0.07 s<sup>−1</sup>) under TIR illumination was accounted for in simulations and trains with at least one fluorescent GFP upon leaving the tip were marked detectable.</p><p>Simulations were also run to estimate the distribution of diffusing KAP molecules in the flagellum at a steady-state. In these simulations, previously reported values for the anterograde train injection rate (1.3 trains s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>) and the average number of KAP bound to a single anterograde train for each flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>) were used to estimate the number of KAP that arrives at the flagellar tip per second. KAP dissociated from the trains at the tip and immediately started one dimensional diffusion in the flagellum. The resting time of KAP at the tip was insignificant, and was not accounted for. The flagellum was modeled as a 5–12 µm long linear grid with spacing defined as the MSD of KAP diffusing at 1.7 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>) during the time-step of the simulation (5 ms). At every time point, each active molecule had its grid position changed by +1 or −1. The molecules at the extreme terminus of the tip only moved towards the base. The diffusing KAP molecules were perfectly absorbed to the cell body as they arrived at the flagellar base (i.e. perfect sink) and exited the simulation. The simulations were run for 100,000 time points to allow molecules to reach a steady-state. The number of molecules at each grid position was calculated to plot the distribution of KAP molecules diffusing along the length of the flagellum. The total number of KAP was calculated by integrating the number of KAP diffusing along the entire flagellum and KAP on the anterograde trains. This number was compared to a hypothetical scenario that KAP returns to the cell body with active transport. The simulations were run 10 times to calculate the error.</p><p>Simulation codes are available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SingleMoleculeAC/IFT-Dynamics">https://github.com/SingleMoleculeAC/IFT-Dynamics</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chien, 2017</xref>). A copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/IFT-Dynamics">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/IFT-Dynamics</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank K Augsperger for assistance with the isolation and screening of the <italic>D1bLIC-Cherry KAP-GFP</italic> tagged strains, V Belyy, J Bandaria, and P Qin for technical assistance, and W F Marshall and N L Hendel for sharing results prior to publication.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamics of the IFT Machinery at the Ciliary Tip&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors adapt the recently developed PhotoGate method to track individual and small groups of IFT trains arriving at and departing from the ciliary tip in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. The dynamics of the IFT machinery at the ciliary tip and the events driving train turnaround are key areas of interest in the field. Using the PhotoGate, the authors were able to visualize and quantify splitting of IFT trains with more clarity than previously possible. Their conclusions include that the train subunits mix at the tip, and that the anterograde motor kinesin-II returns to the base by diffusion, forming a system that helps control ciliary length. Overall, the reviewers found the approach and the questions asked to be very timely. However, they have raised a few substantive concerns regarding some conclusions and the manuscript presentation that would need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results testing various agents to see if they affect the tip turnaround dynamics are interesting but raise many questions. For ciliobrevin, there is an increase in the return time of IFT27 and KAP. The authors should explain better what effect ciliobrevin has on anterograde and retrograde IFT and the number of these events. Furthermore, assuming that KAP dissociates from IFT complexes and returns to the cell body by diffusion, it is not clear why ciliobrevin affects its return time.</p><p>For IBMX and H-8, these appear to be very blunt tools. What kinases are affected? IBMX is probably better described as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor rather than a kinase (type unspecified) activator (subsection “IFT tip turnaround is regulated by dynein activity and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>”, last paragraph), as it results in increased cAMP levels (which of course do increase PKA activity). H-8 is a kinase inhibitor that affects PKA, PKG and to some extent PKC and other kinases. The paper does not make clear how this relates to the statement about Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects. Could the negative results with IBMX be because this reagent is not effective at this concentration in Chlamy? This is especially important since the literature has identified several kinases that directly affect IFT motors or at least affect IFT and cilia length, including kinases in the CDK, CaMK, and MOK families (for example, Tam et al. 2007, Liang et al. 2014, Burghoorn et al. 2007, Broekhuis et al. 2014). As a way of addressing this point, the authors could report how strongly other IFT parameters are affected, especially for H8. The key question that the authors need to address while revising this section is: do the treatments act directly on the machinery controlling return time, or reflect more general ciliary/IFT perturbation?</p><p>2) It is stated as fact that the IFT complexes mix at the tip (in the Abstract and elsewhere), but the data supporting these statements do not seem conclusive. This conclusion thus should be strengthened by additional data (see considerations below; a photoswitchable probe might be a useful approach). Alternatively, mixing should be mentioned as a plausible suggestion rather than a stated fact.</p><p>The main argument for mixing is that the number of retrograde trains departing the tip is not strictly proportional to the number of incoming anterograde trains. However, there seem to be caveats that prevent this from being the direct test desired:</p><p>a) Concurrent arrival of two trains. Given the relatively uniform velocity of anterograde IFT trains, it seems plausible that the PhotoGate will occasionally allow simultaneous entry of two trains that will remain in the same diffraction limited spot during transit to the tip, giving the appearance of one (bright) train. Inclusion of these events in the analysis could break strict proportionality without invoking mixing. The authors may be able to use simulation or analysis of train intensity to comment on the likelihood of this possibility. In general, a clear example of one anterograde train splitting into three or more retrograde trains is lacking from the manuscript.</p><p>b) Photobleaching. As the authors show, photobleaching has a large bearing on the observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and accounting for the photobleaching rate brings the relationship between anterograde and retrograde trains closer to proportional. A photobleaching rate of 0.05/s is stated, but from which data was this key parameter determined and what is its confidence interval?</p><p>c) The finding that the average number of retrograde trains (2.4) per anterograde train is &quot;significantly higher than the measured ratios of retrograde to anterograde train frequencies (~1.6) (Buisson et al., 2013; Dentler, 2005; Iomini et al., 2001; Mijalkovic et al., 2017)&quot; is used as supporting evidence for mixing. However, the ratios in the cited papers are from a variety of species and differ widely (from 1 – 3.4). What is the ratio in the authors' experiments? In what sense is the difference &quot;significant&quot;; if statistically, what is the test and p-value?</p><p>3) A number of questions were raised regarding the proposed model for kinesin diffusion and flagella length control. At the very least, the questions below should be addressed by better discussion.</p><p>a) If the kinesin diffusion model for control of flagellar length is correct, that would presumably mean that mutants with long flagella (&gt;20 um) have enhanced levels of kinesin compared to the strain used here. This seems an easy prediction to test.</p><p>b) It is not clear that the decrease in KAP at the basal body is really the limiting factor. The residual amount of KAP at the basal body likely is sufficient for some flagellar regrowth as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> can regrow approximately 1/2 length flagella after deflagellation in the absence of any additional protein synthesis (i.e. in cycloheximide). This can be tested in the KAP-GFP system.</p><p>c) Oligomeric status of kinesin-II during diffusion needs to be addressed more clearly. The authors nicely show that KAP departs the ciliary tip by diffusion in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. An interesting observation is that the KAP spot (presumably consisting of multiple copies of the protein) does not split into smaller species, implying that Kap3 diffuses from the tip in the same oligomeric state as it arrives. This raises a number of questions:</p><p>- How many copies of KAP are present per train, based on calibrated fluorescence intensities (these are mentioned in methods, but I could not find the number in the manuscript)?</p><p>- What would hold KAP in oligomeric form if the train splits apart and mixes; do some components of the train remain intact?</p><p>- Why does the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> show single kinesin-II molecules diffusing from the tip, when this seems at odds with the data?</p><p>d) The authors claim that the anterograde transport and retrograde diffusion can explain the increasing fluorescence of KAP towards the tip. Do the other kinesin-2 subunits show a similar gradient along the flagellum?

For ciliobrevin, there is an increase in the return time of IFT27 and KAP. The authors should explain better what effect ciliobrevin has on anterograde and retrograde IFT and the number of these events.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously published the effect of ciliobrevin D in IFT movement in Shih et al. 2013 <italic>eLife</italic>. In that work “we varied ciliobrevin D concentration between 0–150 μM and monitored IFT 2 min after drug treatment in cells adhered both of their flagella to surface. We observed that both anterograde and retrograde IFT train frequencies dropped with increasing concentrations of ciliobrevin D, and at &gt;100 μM ciliobrevin D we observed accumulation of IFT trains at the flagellar tip. At 150 μM ciliobrevin D, retrograde IFT frequency was reduced by 92%. The velocities of retrograde and anterograde trains also decreased by 60% and 36%, respectively.” See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref> of Shih et al. for further information.</p><p>In this work, we used 100 μM ciliobrevin D, in which dynein motors are partially inactivated within 2-10 min of drug treatment. This concentration of ciliobrevin D results in 50% reduction in the frequency of retrograde and anterograde trains. It also leads to 50% and 28% reduction in retrograde and anterograde train velocities, respectively (Shih et al. 2013). We found that ciliobrevin D addition extends the tip resting time for a few seconds, suggesting that dynein activity is critical for the departure of IFT trains from the tip. The results are also consistent with tip accumulation of IFT trains and reduction in the frequency of retrograde trains in Shih et al. However, this delay in tip turnaround is not responsible for the observed reduction in train velocity and frequency, which must be related to the defects in retrograde transport.</p><p>We clarified the effect of ciliobrevin D in IFT motility in the main text by adding: “Addition of 0.1 mM ciliobrevin D to media results in 50% reduction in the frequency of retrograde and anterograde trains, and 50% and 28% reduction in retrograde and anterograde train velocities, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, the tip resting time of IFT27 increased over two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), suggesting that rapid turnover of IFT trains depends on dynein activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, assuming that KAP dissociates from IFT complexes and returns to the cell body by diffusion, it is not clear why ciliobrevin affects its return time.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of our manuscript, we replaced “return time” with “tip resting time” to avoid confusion. We do not claim that ciliobrevin affects return of KAP to the base by diffusion. Instead, our results imply that ciliobrevin affects the time KAP remains at the tip before it starts diffusing in flagellum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For IBMX and H-8, these appear to be very blunt tools. What kinases are affected? IBMX is probably better described as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor rather than a kinase (type unspecified) activator (subsection “IFT tip turnaround is regulated by dynein activity and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>”, last paragraph), as it results in increased cAMP levels (which of course do increase PKA activity). H-8 is a kinase inhibitor that affects PKA, PKG and to some extent PKC and other kinases. The paper does not make clear how this relates to the statement about Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects. Could the negative results with IBMX be because this reagent is not effective at this concentration in Chlamy? This is especially important since the literature has identified several kinases that directly affect IFT motors or at least affect IFT and cilia length, including kinases in the CDK, CaMK, and MOK families (for example, Tam et al. 2007, Liang et al. 2014, Burghoorn et al. 2007, Broekhuis et al. 2014). As a way of addressing this point, the authors could report how strongly other IFT parameters are affected, especially for H8. The key question that the authors need to address while revising this section is: do the treatments act directly on the machinery controlling return time, or reflect more general ciliary/IFT perturbation?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any significant changes in IFT velocity and frequency in IBMX and H-8 treated cells (not shown). We agree with the reviewers’ concern that it is not clear which regulatory proteins are specifically affected with these treatments and whether these concentrations in extracellular medium are sufficient to achieve the desired effect in the first 5-20 minutes of treatment, which is the time period we collected our movies. Because of these shortcomings and the fact that these results are not critical for our conclusions, we removed the IBMX and H-8 data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is stated as fact that the IFT complexes mix at the tip (in the Abstract and elsewhere), but the data supporting these statements do not seem conclusive. This conclusion thus should be strengthened by additional data (see considerations below; a photoswitchable probe might be a useful approach). Alternatively, mixing should be mentioned as a plausible suggestion rather than a stated fact.</p><p>The main argument for mixing is that the number of retrograde trains departing the tip is not strictly proportional to the number of incoming anterograde trains. However, there seem to be caveats that prevent this from being the direct test desired:</p><p>a) Concurrent arrival of two trains. Given the relatively uniform velocity of anterograde IFT trains, it seems plausible that the PhotoGate will occasionally allow simultaneous entry of two trains that will remain in the same diffraction limited spot during transit to the tip, giving the appearance of one (bright) train. Inclusion of these events in the analysis could break strict proportionality without invoking mixing. The authors may be able to use simulation or analysis of train intensity to comment on the likelihood of this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The probability that two IFT trains overlap within a diffraction limited distance (~300 nm) along the length of a flagellum and their velocities are similar such that the distance between them does not increase over 300 nm during 10 µm travel along a flagellum is lower than 2%. Because the likelihood of such events is quite low, they do not affect the results in our simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, a clear example of one anterograde train splitting into three or more retrograde trains is lacking from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an example kymograph to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> (see the left bottom corner of the figure) which shows one anterograde train to split into three retrograde trains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Photobleaching. As the authors show, photobleaching has a large bearing on the observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and accounting for the photobleaching rate brings the relationship between anterograde and retrograde trains closer to proportional. A photobleaching rate of 0.05/s is stated, but from which data was this key parameter determined and what is its confidence interval?</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated GFP photobleaching rate by immobilizing recombinantly expressed GFP at the coverslip surface and monitor the decrease of their fluorescence under our imaging conditions. Exponential fit of the signal over time revealed that the photobleaching rate is 0.05 s<sup>-1</sup> in vitro (the confidence interval is below 0.005 s<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>It is more challenging to measure GFP photobleaching rate in live <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells, because multiple GFPs coexist on a single train. In addition, these trains move, sometimes overlap with each other, and they assemble/disassemble at the tip. To address the concern of the reviewers, we measured the decrease in fluorescence intensity of anterograde trains until they reach the tip. Exponential fit to this data revealed that the photobleaching rate is 0.07 ± 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup> in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), similar to our calculation from the bulk in vitro assay mentioned in previous paragraph. Although this calculation method is more relevant to our measurements, it can monitor only the first 5 seconds of exposure before trains reach the tip, and is less reliable than the in vitro measurements. In either case, the time exponent in simulations is significantly lower than 1.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28606.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The normalized intensity of anterograde IFT20-GFP particles as they travel from the flagellar base (t = 0 s) to the tip.</title><p>A single exponential decay fit (red curve) reveals a photobleaching rate of 0.07 ± 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup> ( ± 95% c.i.).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28606-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The finding that the average number of retrograde trains (2.4) per anterograde train is &quot;significantly higher than the measured ratios of retrograde to anterograde train frequencies (~1.6) (Buisson et al., 2013; Dentler, 2005; Iomini et al., 2001; Mijalkovic et al., 2017)&quot; is used as supporting evidence for mixing. However, the ratios in the cited papers are from a variety of species and differ widely (from 1 – 3.4). What is the ratio in the authors' experiments? In what sense is the difference &quot;significant&quot;; if statistically, what is the test and p-value?</p></disp-quote><p>We found the retrograde-to-anterograde ratio to be 1.15, consistent with previous reports that retrograde frequencies are higher than anterograde trains. We ran a t-test to test the significance of the difference between retrograde-to-anterograde ratio and the number of retrograde trains per anterograde trains in PhotoGate experiments. The p-value is 10<sup>-20</sup>. We have clarified this section as follows:</p><p>“We directly observed that a single anterograde train splits into multiple retrograde trains at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On average, 2.4 retrograde trains were detected departing from the tip after the arrival of a single fluorescent anterograde train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, N</xref> = 97), consistent with higher frequencies of retrograde IFT trains than anterograde IFT trains (Dentler, 2005; Iomini et al., 2001; Qin et al., 2007). However, the number of retrograde trains per fluorescent anterograde train in PhotoGate assays (2.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) was significantly higher (Welch’s t-test, p = 10<sup>-20</sup>) than the ratio of retrograde to anterograde train frequencies in conventional kymographs (1.15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (Dentler, 2005; Iomini et al., 2001; Reck et al., 2016). These observations suggested that IFT complexes from different anterograde trains recombine with each other to form retrograde trains at the tip.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A number of questions were raised regarding the proposed model for kinesin diffusion and flagella length control. At the very least, the questions below should be addressed by better discussion.</p><p>a) If the kinesin diffusion model for control of flagellar length is correct, that would presumably mean that mutants with long flagella (&gt;20 um) have enhanced levels of kinesin compared to the strain used here. This seems an easy prediction to test.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinesin diffusion model states that kinesin-II available at the basal body becomes limiting as the flagella reach its full length. In this case, most KAP are trapped in flagella and their return is delayed by diffusion. There is also significant amount of kinesin-II available in the cytoplasm, even when cells fully grow their flagella. While the cytoplasmic pool of kinesin-II exchanges with the flagellar pool, the exchange rate is rather slow (unpublished observations) compared to the exchange between basal body and the flagellum. The model assumes that total amount of KAP localized to the flagellar compartment (basal body + flagellum) determines its length, while the cytoplasmic pool has no direct effect in length. Therefore, enhanced expression of kinesin-II would be one way to increase the equilibrium length, but this is not the only way. It is also possible to reach longer equilibrium length by reducing the flagellar disassembly rate, enhancing the recruitment of kinesin-II and other IFT components from the basal body to the flagella or affecting other pathways that are involved in flagellar length control. It is not clear by which specific mechanism lf mutations generate a long flagella phenotype.</p><p>We attempted the experiments the reviewers suggested by generating crosses of the KAP-GFP and lf strains to monitor KAP intensity in the lf background. In our preliminary observations, we found significant variability in individual cells, in terms of their flagellar length and KAP-GFP expression. In addition, IFT movement and tip turnaround behavior are significantly altered in some of the strains. Because of these complications, we feel that it will be difficult to compare KAP distribution in the lf background to the KAP-GFP cell line.</p><p>We have designed an alternative experiment to test the predictions of our model. It is previously shown that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> grows longer flagella in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup>. This occurs by recruiting flagellar proteins from the cell body pool into the flagella (Nakamura et al. 1987) rather than requiring new protein synthesis (Wilson et al. 2004), because addition of Li<sup>+</sup> to cells that already grew their flagella leads to a 50% increase in flagellar length even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Based on these results, addition of Li<sup>+</sup> is expected to increase available KAP for flagella to 1.5X compared to control cells. Because these assays can be performed using the same strain, they are more likely to yield interpretable observations.</p><p>We grew the KAP-GFP strain in 50 mM Li<sup>+</sup> and in regular TAP media. In addition, we deflagellated cells and regrew their flagella in the presence of cycloheximide. Consistent with previous observations, cells grew their flagella to 1.5X of their normal length in Li<sup>+</sup>. After these cells reached their steady state length, we calculated the total KAP intensity at the basal body and the flagellum. Consistent with our model, we observed that KAP gets depleted at the basal body at equilibrium. The KAP fluorescence localized to a flagellum correlated strongly with flagellar length, similar to untreated cells. The total KAP fluorescence was 50% higher in Li<sup>+</sup> treated cells than untreated cells. These experiments support the predictions of our model that altering the amount of KAP available for the flagellar compartment positively correlates with the flagellar length and that the equilibrium length is set when KAP gets depleted below a certain threshold at the basal body.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we showed these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also extensively explained these experiments in Results, Discussion and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is not clear that the decrease in KAP at the basal body is really the limiting factor. The residual amount of KAP at the basal body likely is sufficient for some flagellar regrowth as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> can regrow approximately 1/2 length flagella after deflagellation in the absence of any additional protein synthesis (i.e. in cycloheximide). This can be tested in the KAP-GFP system.</p></disp-quote><p>KAP intensity localized to the flagellum after regrowth is several fold higher than KAP localized to the basal body in a steady state. Therefore, the majority of the material required for regrowth is supplemented from the cytoplasmic pool, not from the residual amount left in the basal body.</p><p>In the presence of cycloheximide, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> can grow half-length flagella after deflagellation, suggesting that the cytoplasmic pool of flagellar proteins is at least one half of that localized to the flagellar compartment. This material can be effectively recruited to the basal body after deflagellation even in the absence of new protein synthesis. This treatment is expected to decrease available KAP to 0.5X for the flagellar compartment. Consistent with previous observations, cells grew their flagella to 0.5X of their normal length in cycloheximide. In a steady state, we observed that KAP gets depleted at the basal body at equilibrium. The KAP fluorescence localized to a flagellum correlated strongly with flagellar length similar to untreated cells. The total KAP fluorescence was 50% lower in cycloheximide treated cells than untreated cells.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we showed these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also extensively explained these experiments in Results, Discussion and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Oligomeric status of kinesin-II during diffusion needs to be addressed more clearly. The authors nicely show that KAP departs the ciliary tip by diffusion in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. An interesting observation is that the KAP spot (presumably consisting of multiple copies of the protein) does not split into smaller species, implying that Kap3 diffuses from the tip in the same oligomeric state as it arrives. This raises a number of questions:</p></disp-quote><p>We are also surprised by this observation. We have strong evidence that KAP molecules from a single anterograde train depart from the tip simultaneously (i.e. within a 100 ms frame time), because in most cases the KAP intensity at the tip decreases to background levels in a single frame. After departure, KAP starts rapidly diffusing in the flagellum. In some cases, we observe a single fluorescent spot to diffuse for at least 5-10 s after departure. In other cases, the KAP-GFP signal spreads up quickly along the length of a flagellum, presumably because KAPs split apart and diffuse alone. In the latter case, it is not possible for us to resolve individual molecules because of diffraction-limited resolution (250 nm) of the tracking approach, low fluorescent signal, and limited time resolution (0.1 s) compared to rapid diffusion of the molecules (1.7 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>/s). Therefore, we have strong evidence to suggest that KAP departs together from the tip and in certain cases they diffuse together at the first few seconds after departure. It is also likely that KAP diffuses individually in other cases.</p><p>To highlight this second possibility, we added “Unlike IFT trains, the majority (89%, N = 95) of KAP-GFPs simultaneously departed from the tip in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] The rest of the kymographs were ambiguous.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How many copies of KAP are present per train, based on calibrated fluorescence intensities (these are mentioned in methods, but I could not find the number in the manuscript)?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the photobleaching analysis (Engel et al. 2009 JCB), we anticipate that there are 6 fluorescent GFPs on each anterograde KAP particles. We note that this is the lower boundary estimate for the number of KAP subunits per train because significant fraction of GFPs remain non-fluorescent in physiological conditions (Ulbrich et al. Nat. Methods 4, 319–321 (2007)). In addition, some GFPs may photobleach before we start recording movies or may not be detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What would hold KAP in oligomeric form if the train splits apart and mixes; do some components of the train remain intact?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know whether KAP oligomerizes on its own or some components of the train also dissociate and oligomerize with KAP. We feel it would be too speculative to comment on this point in the manuscript because observed oligomerization may be short lived and occurs in only a subset of the traces, while in other cases KAP may diffuse individually.</p><p>In the Discussion, we added: “In certain cases, KAP-GFP appears to diffuse in an oligomeric form. It remains to be studied what holds KAPs together and whether other components of the IFT trains diffuse with KAP clusters after splitting and mixing at the tip.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why does the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> show single kinesin-II molecules diffusing from the tip, when this seems at odds with the data?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed KAP diffusing as a cluster and individually in the revised model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors claim that the anterograde transport and retrograde diffusion can explain the increasing fluorescence of KAP towards the tip. Do the other kinesin-2 subunits show a similar gradient along the flagellum? Is this seen for kinesin-2 motors in other systems?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have direct ways to test whether other subunits show a similar gradient along the flagellum, because <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains with fluorescent fusions to these subunits do not exist. However, several observations suggest that other subunits also return to the base without a need for retrograde IFT. In Discussion, we wrote: “We propose that the diffusion of KAP-GFP represents the movement of the entire heterotrimeric kinesin-II complex because KAP and the kinesin-II motor subunits co-sediment in sucrose density gradients of purified flagella extracts (Cole et al., 1998; Mueller et al., 2005) and neither KAP nor FLA10 accumulate in flagella during inactivation of retrograde transport (Engel et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 2006; Reck et al., 2016).”</p><p>If only KAP were to dissociate from IFT but the heavy chains return to the base with retrograde IFT, FLA10 would be expected to remain in flagellum after inactivation of retrograde IFT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Manuscript writing and organization.</p><p>a) The manuscript reads as a fusion of two pieces of work: one on IFT machinery dynamics at the tip (with its own discussion in subsection “Kinesin-2 carries dynein-2 as an inactive passenger during anterograde IFT”, third to last paragraphs), and a second on kinesin-II diffusion and ciliary length control (which confusingly resumes with new results following the first discussion).

Marshall’s Western Blot analysis of IFT139 and IFT81, and immunolabeling results of IFT52. To ensure that we see an increase in IFT20-GFP accumulation in flagellum during regrowth, we have repeated our measurements (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We have obtained results similar to what we present in our manuscript. It is not clear what causes these differences between our image analysis versus Western Blot or immunolabeling of flagella. We image a different IFT component and use a different methodology for fixation, data analysis and background correction in comparison to W. Marshall’s studies. In either case, the key point of this analysis is to show that amount of IFT component localized to the basal body remains nearly constant during flagellar regrowth and hence it is unlikely that the number of IFT components at the basal body are critical for limiting the flagellar elongation. This is in stark contrast to KAP-GFP, which is gradually depleted at the basal body during regrowth and accumulates more heavily in flagellum than IFT20 in a fully-grown flagellum.</p><p>We added “This discrepancy may be related to differences in methods for quantifying IFT components in flagella.”</p><p>A central feature of the balance point model is that at least one component of the IFT machinery becomes limited as the flagella elongate and this leads to the reduction of the flagellar assembly rate. When the assembly rate becomes as low as the length-independent disassembly rate, elongation stops and equilibrium length is reached. The model would be void if there is an infinite pool of components available in the cytoplasm and this pool maintains the number of particles at the basal body. Our model is consistent with the postulations of the balance-point model and shows that KAP gets depleted at the basal body, not maintained, as the flagella elongate. Therefore, our results explain which IFT component becomes limited as flagella elongate and why this specific component gets depleted instead of others (i.e. diffusion).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28606.032</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Integrated IFT20-GFP fluorescence at the basal body (left), in the flagellum (middle), and in both regions (right) at different flagellar lengths.</title><p>Each black dot represents a single flagellum and the blue line is the running average ( ± s.e.m., N = 214 flagella from 107 cells).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28606-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The three paragraphs at the end of the section &quot;Kinesin-2 carries dynein-2 as an inactive passenger during anterograde IFT&quot; belong in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved this section to Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, the last of these paragraphs which discusses the differences between Chlamy, worm, and mammalian IFT processes, concerns one of the most important findings of the paper and needs to be prominently and thoroughly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded this section to clearly identify differences between IFT and ciliary length control in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> in Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
