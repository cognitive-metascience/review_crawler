neuronal calcium recordings in the anesthetized rat, we identified blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses directly related to slow calcium waves, revealing a cortex-wide and spatially organized correlate of locally recorded neuronal activity (Schwalm et al., 2017). Here, using the same techniques, we investigate two distinct cortical activity states: persistent activity, in which compartmentalized network dynamics were observed; and slow wave activity, dominated by a cortex-wide BOLD component, suggesting a strong functional coupling of inter-cortical activity. During slow wave activity, we find a correlation between the occurring slow wave events and the strength of functional connectivity between different cortical areas. These findings suggest that down-up transitions of neuronal excitability can drive cortex-wide functional connectivity. This study provides further evidence that changes in functional connectivity are dependent on the brain’s current state, directly linked to the generation of slow waves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>brain states</kwd><kwd>optic-fiber-based calcium recordings</kwd><kwd>slow waves</kwd><kwd>slow oscillations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stroh</surname><given-names>Albrecht</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stroh</surname><given-names>Albrecht</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct brain states govern resting state functional architecture revealed by neurophysiologically defined simultaneous optic-fiber-based calcium recordings and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical excitability are constantly impacted by fluctuations of internally generated activity, even in the absence of external inputs. The resting-state of the cortical functional architecture is characterized by canonical ‘default-mode <italic>networks</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitra and Raichle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raichle, 2015</xref>) which have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raichle, 2011</xref>), primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chauvette et al., 2011</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonckers et al., 2011</xref>). However, the spatio-temporal features of these networks are not static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deco et al., 2013</xref>). Alternating states of excitability, manifesting as different activity states of the brain, can dynamically occur, even in different regions at the same time, as seen in the awake condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2004</xref>). Different states of brain activation can influence responses upon incoming sensory afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>) and are accompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of neuronal activity in many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pais-Roldán et al., 2020</xref>). These alterations can be observed in local electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016</xref>) and optical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonckers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsui et al., 2016</xref>) recordings, as well as in large-scale readouts of brain activity, such as BOLD fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalthoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staresina et al., 2013</xref>). The ubiquity of fluctuating activity states which influence ongoing brain dynamics calls for a state-dependent assessment of resting state functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, using local and brain-wide readouts, we have identified two activity states which were shown to occur under different types of anesthesia used for small animal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). In a state of persistent activity, which can occur during periods of light anesthesia, sedation or during awake periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</xref>), neurons are rather depolarized, sparsely active, leading to temporally dynamic, modality specific, network configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth and Poulet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Souza et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to persistent activity, stands the bimodal activity pattern of slow oscillations, or slow waves which have been extensively described under various conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chauvette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seamari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>), but only most recently in the framework of BOLD fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). Their corresponding low-frequency component ranges at 0.2–1 Hz, reflecting alternating activity patterns: active (<italic>‘up’</italic>) periods in which cells are depolarized and fire action potentials in temporally restricted periods, and silence (<italic>‘down’</italic>) periods with rather hyperpolarized membrane potentials and an almost complete absence of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steriade et al., 2001</xref>). Slow waves can occur rather locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nir et al., 2011</xref>) or can spread over the entire cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>), eventually allowing activity to propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>). In our previous work, we found that independent component analysis (ICA) for data obtained during persistent activity revealed canonical resting-state associated networks, such as the default mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>) or different sensory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pawela et al., 2008</xref>). Defining different states of brain activity by their local and global features of network dynamics by no means entails that their behavioral correlates, as for example in an anesthetized condition versus natural sleep, would be identical. However, defining features of slow wave activity, such as its bimodality, are resembled in a plethora of different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mitra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>), likely because the fundamental difference between fast and slow timescale cortical dynamics is regulated by distinct mechanisms at the single neuron level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okun et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Functional connectivity analysis for resting-state fMRI is used to identify and characterize neural networks in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woodward et al., 2011</xref>), during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>) or memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staresina et al., 2013</xref>). The possibility to combine resting-state fMRI with invasive recordings of brain activity constitutes a pivotal branch of translational research (2018). Despite evidence of subtle changes in anesthesia level being able to dramatically change brain connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hutchison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), little has been investigated on how the brain’s current state impacts functional connectivity derived from blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity. While variations in functional connectivity have been related to cognitive state in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2017</xref>), the effect of neurophysiologically defined states on functional connectivity in the cortex remains unknown. Directly relating functional connectivity to defined brain states may have explanatory value for a broad range of functional brain connectivity studies. We propose that connectivity measures in different conditions such as different anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukhari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalthoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasrallah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2016</xref>) can be classified based on the respective activity state of the brain. Based on these classifications, meaningful comparisons can be drawn both between functional connectivity signature in rodents as well as in humans.</p><p>Here, we find distinct BOLD functional connectivity patterns for a state of persistent activity and for a state dominated by the occurrence of slow waves. We identified BOLD correlates revealing compartmentalized network activity during the persistent activity state and a cortex-wide component during slow wave activity. Furthermore, we show a cortex-wide functional coupling of brain activity during slow wave activity which has its origin in transitions from population <italic>down</italic> to population <italic>up</italic> states which occur during ongoing slow wave activity. Our data reveals the imminent consequences of each slow wave event for the configuration of dynamic functional networks during this type of brain-wide activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We conducted ICA of rat resting-state fMRI signals during isoflurane-induced slow wave activity and in a medetomidine-induced persistent activity. For slow wave activity data, we found a characteristic cortex-wide component as characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, during persistent activity, this cortex-wide component was absent and canonical independent components of well-compartmentalized default mode networks were prevailing. While we found a cortex-wide component in all animals during isoflurane-induced slow wave activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the identified components for persistent activity resembled those described by others for awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becerra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>) or sedated rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bukhari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). We identified default mode network activation in 14 of 15 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a bilateral auditory component in 11 of 15 medetomidine-sedated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and a bilateral component of the insula in 9 of 15 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). All the selected components of each animal can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Similarly, as it has been reported in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>), we identified four default mode network regions: left and right posterior parietal cortex, anterior and posterior insular cortex and orbital/prelimbic cortex. To corroborate the difference in the network organization between both brain states, we then manually defined nine anatomical regions of interests (ROIs) based on the z-scores maps of the persistent activity components. We run a functional connectivity analysis of each ROI for each individual and plotted the resulting matrix. When both matrices are compared, it can be observed that there is a wide distribution of significant connectivity among the different networks (delineated by the black squares) during slow wave activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) compared with the high specificity showed during persistent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate that there are marked differences in the network configurations between both types of activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ICA reveals distinct components for slow wave and persistent activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average z-score maps of the cortex-wide component during slow wave activity.

We parcellated the brain based on anatomical landmarks using the Valdes-Hernandez et al template for rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valdés-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>) and correlated the BOLD signal of 96 cortical structures using the average signal from the white matter structures, ventricles and the animal’s breathing rate as covariables in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The name and order of cortical areas can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We plotted the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the r-values of each matrix (n = 15) to establish whether a difference in the number and strength of significant correlations can be found. The cutoff was calculated for each matrix using FDR (mean 0.379 ± 0.041 s.e.m.). The CDF values differed significantly between both activity states (paired t-test, t(14) = 6.01 p&lt;0.001) at the mean of the cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results suggest that slow wave and persistent activity are related to different functional connectivity patterns. To illustrate this point, we plotted connectivity patterns between regions in both brain states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), from this diagram it is possible to infer that during persistent activity, functional connectivity is more compartmentalized than during slow wave activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased functional connectivity during isoflurane-induced slow wave activity compared to persistent activity related to medetomidine sedation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average of the correlation matrices (n = 8) of the mean BOLD signal in 96 cortical regions for slow wave activity (magenta) and persistent activity (green).

Frequency and power distributions of the BOLD signal and their relationships to functional connectivity have been studied before with respect to specific anesthetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>). fALFF analysis allows to determine the fractional power of the BOLD signal for a particular region of interest (ROI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zou et al., 2008</xref>). To rule out that the connectivity values observed during slow wave activity are due to the spurious consequence of an increase in power, we performed a fALFF analysis to investigate the differences in the BOLD power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), showing that during slow wave activity there is a significant shift to lower power values in the distribution of the fALFF curves which were created with the 96 cortical ROIs of each animal (paired t-test, t(14) = 3.11, p=0.008). To test the dependence of the strength in connectivity from the distance of cortical areas, we correlated the Euclidean distance between pairs with the significant r-scores of the correlation of those pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The closer to 90° angle the slope of those correlations gets, the more dependent of the Euclidean distance their correlation becomes. We found, that this is indeed the case for slow wave activity recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), whose slopes are significantly lower than those of data recorded during persistent activity (paired t-test, t(14) = 5.43, p&lt;0.001). These results corroborate that the BOLD signal during slow wave activity is governed by different dynamics than the BOLD signal during persistent activity. Furthermore, during slow wave activity, BOLD-driven connectivity seems to be less compartmentalized and shows a stronger dependency on the distance between areas than it is the case for persistent activity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Network dynamics differ for slow wave and persistent activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plot of the fALFF analysis.

We first computed the modularity degree of the cortical networks identified during persistent and slow wave activity respectively. Modularity is a quality index for a partition of a network into non-overlapping communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwarz et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, in a brain with more compartmentalized networks this measure is higher than in one that shows a less selective network configuration. When we compared modularity values from networks identified for slow wave activity to those of networks identified for persistent activity, we indeed observed significantly higher values for persistent activity (paired t-test, t(14) = 4.01, p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), resembling results previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Souza et al., 2014</xref>). Global and local efficiency are two important characteristics to differentiate small world from random networks. Small world networks exhibit high values for both measurements, whilst randomized networks show high values in global but low values for local efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Latora and Marchiori, 2001</xref>). When we compared these measures, we did not find significant differences in the global efficiency scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; paired t-test, t(14) = 0.389, p=0.703), but we found significantly lower scores for slow wave activity than for persistent activity in the local efficiency measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; paired t-test, t(14) = 5.869, p&lt;0.001). It is well documented that both, small world and random networks show a short characteristic path length, whilst only small world networks show a high clustering coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>). In our analyses, we found a significantly lower clustering coefficient for networks dominated by slow wave activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; paired t-test, t(14) = 3.789, p=0.002), but no significant differences between networks in slow wave and persistent activity for characteristic path length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; paired t-test, t(14) = 0.636, p=0.535). This suggests that during slow wave activity the cortex rather behaves like a random network, whilst during persistent activity it exhibits small world network features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In summary, graph theory analysis indicated a different functional connectivity pattern for persistent and slow wave activity. For persistent activity canonical well compartmentalized, small world networks seem to play a dominating role, while during slow wave activity a highly interconnected randomized network is prevalent.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Graph theory shows a random network signature during slow wave activity.</title><p>Legend: *=p &lt; 0.05; **=p &lt; 0.01; ***=p &lt; 0.001 (paired t-test n = 15); slow wave activity (magenta), persistent activity (green). vertical dashed line represents the data distribution, central horizontal bar the median and the two extremes horizontal bars point the interquartile range.

In order to demonstrate our effects to be independent of the anesthetic agent, we compared the medetomine-induced sedation persistent activity to a condition of low isoflurane anesthesia (0.5% - 0.7%) that prevents animals of entering slow wave activity (n = 6 animals), hypothesizing that both protocols lead to a similar functional state, that is persistent activity. In the fiber photometry recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), it becomes apparent that the population dynamics recorded under this low isoflurane anesthesia regime resemble the ones obtained under medetomidine, rather than showing similarity to the ones recorded under higher isoflurane concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To quantify whether this observation is meaningful for the BOLD signal, we computed the functional connectivity analysis in the same way as described for the previous experiments and obtained the connectivity matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We computed matrix similarity analysis for each of the six matrices against the mean matrix for slow wave and persistent activity to determine if the connectivity patterns obtained under the low isoflurane concentration rather resemble the ones previously measured under medetomidine, (persistent activity) or the ones measured under higher isoflurane concentrations (slow wave activity). Similarity values can be compared extracting the eigen values of the matrix and then using <italic>Frobenius norm</italic> in order to calculate their similarity. The lower the obtained value, the greater is the similarity between two matrices. In this case, the resulting values related to persistent activity induced by low isoflurane, were significantly lower when compared with the ones for persistent activity induced by medetomidine sedation than when compared to the ones related to slow wave activity under high isoflurane concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; paired t-test, t(5) = 5.19, p=0.003). We used the same matrix similarity computation in a dynamic connectivity analysis. Therefore, we compared the initial 5 min of recordings with a moving average of 5 min in steps of 1 min. The results show that in the case of persistent activity induced by medetomidine and by low isoflurane concentrations, network configurations were significantly more stable than in the case of slow wave activity induced by high isoflurane concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This indicates that the network dynamics during slow wave activity might be related to a constant reorganization of connectivity patterns, probably due to the frequent changes in the rate of population <italic>down-up transitions</italic>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Different activity states of the brain result in characteristic functional connectivity matrices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Calcium fiber photometry schematic.

Local occurrences of slow wave activity have also been shown to take place in cortical circuits during awake periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</xref>). This bimodal pattern – periods of neural quiescence interrupted by short bursts of activity - generates waves of activity that can propagate across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Busche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>). We recently showed that these waves generate a cortex-wide increase in BOLD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>) which may also be responsible for a cortex-wide increase of functional connectivity during slow wave activity. To test this, we analyzed the previously obtained functional connectivity results during slow wave activity while using the cortex-wide component as a covariable, since this component represents a direct correlate of local slow waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). If the high connectivity signature found during slow wave activity is related to population <italic>down-up</italic> transitions, the cortex-wide component as a covariable should remove any correlation that occurs due to such <italic>down-up</italic> transitions observable in the population signal. Following this rationale, we expected that once the <italic>down-up</italic> transition covariable is removed from the connectivity analysis, correlation values should significantly drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ai</xref>). Therefore, the cumulative distribution function of the r-values obtained using the cortex-wide component as a covariable (CWCcov) should be shifted to the left compared with those obtained using the original cortex inverted signal of the cortex-wide component (CWCinv). The CDF data (same analysis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) showed significantly higher values for the CWCcov condition at the mean of the cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Aii</xref>) (paired t-test¸ t(14) = 4.96, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the amount of significantly correlated pairs for each individual at its particular cutoff was also significantly less in the CWCcov condition. (paired t-test, t(14) = 5.435, p&lt;0.001).This suggests a relationship between slow wave activity-related <italic>down-up</italic> transitions in the population signal and the strength of cortical functional connectivity. Additionally, we co-registered calcium photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelsberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grienberger et al., 2012</xref>) and fMRI BOLD signals during slow wave activity in five animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bi</xref>). We quantified the number of population <italic>down-up</italic> transitions in a period of 3 min in the fluorescence signal emitted by a neural population in visual cortex (V1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bii</xref>, upper panel) and correlated it with the number of significant pairs from the functional connectivity analysis of the BOLD signal for the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bi</xref>, lower panel). We quantified these values for 30 min-long recordings using samples of 3 min and a gap of 1 min in between them. The correlation between the amount of <italic>down-up</italic> transitions in the fluorescence signal and the BOLD pairs was significant for five of the six animals (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bii</xref>). In order to overcome a potential source of a spurious correlation, we run a permutation test on each resulting correlation. The permutation test allows to establish the baseline correlation between points and to calculate the distance of the obtained results from that correlation. In the five animals, the permutation test shows that the correlation r-scores are in the 5% of significant values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bii</xref>, normal distribution plots). Finally, we calculated the statistical value for the whole dataset using the recently described repeated measures correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref>) a statistical technique for determining the inter-individuals correlation for intra-subject multiple measurements (r(196) = 0.534, p&lt;10e<sup>−15</sup>).

To corroborate our results on the neural population level, we conducted experiments employing simultaneous optic-fiber-based calcium recordings in somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Slow wave related <italic>down-up</italic> transitions can be easily identified and quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seamari et al., 2007</xref>) and have a duration of 2 s on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

To probe if <italic>down-up</italic> transitions are underlying the increase of functional cortical connectivity in our slow wave activity data, we filtered the fluorescence and the BOLD signal at different frequency intervals before running the cross-correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). Filtering the signal induced a partial abolishment of the slow waves in particular bandwidths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) without interfering with the correlation of both cortical signals in other frequencies. Therefore, one should expect a decrease in the signal correlation on those frequencies when the slow wave activity is abolished.

ICA showed distinct functional networks for each of the investigated activity states. In the case of slow wave activity, a cortex-wide component was found in all animals, while for persistent activity, a clear compartmentalization of the cortical functional structures gave origin to well-determined functional networks, as the default mode or the auditory network. Notably, the relation of population activity to functional connectivity was not dependent on a specific anesthetic agent, suggesting that not the type of anesthesia used, but the induced activity state influenced resting-state networks. The functional connectivity analyses using cortical parcellation corroborated this concept, showing an increase in the connectivity r-scores as well as in the number of significant correlations during slow wave activity. Population activity dominated by slow waves is characterized by long periods of quiescence followed by short lapses of neural activity corresponding to a propagating wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>), as demonstrated by the simultaneous dual cortical calcium recordings. To rule out that the connectivity values observed during slow wave activity are due to the spurious consequence of an increase in power, we performed fALFF analysis and found significantly lower values for data obtained under slow wave activity, probably due to the long periods of quiescence observed in population slow wave activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spatiotemporal network dynamics</title><p>The high degree of compartmentalization in persistent activity dominated networks, observed in the ICA can be corroborated by calculating the dependency of the distance in the r-scores between two areas.

Indeed, when correlating the r-scores and the Euclidean distance of the network’s pairs for persistent activity data, the correlation was significantly lower than for data obtained under slow wave activity. This finding suggests, that indeed, the functional architecture during persistent activity is dominated by specific compartmentalized network nodes, which are not necessarily spatially close, such as the default mode network. In sharp contrast, during slow wave activity, we observed a strong distance dependency, in line with a propagating wave of activity – a slow wave event – eventually recruiting large parts of the cortex. These propagating slow wave events might temporarily switch parts of the functional network from a hyperpolarized, rather quiescent down state into a depolarized <italic>up</italic> state of high excitability and thereby propagate over cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steriade et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Applying graph theory methods, we found that during persistent activity the functional network shows characteristic small world network dynamics, as they have been described previously for the sedated rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Souza et al., 2014</xref>) and for the awake human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>).

In order to rule out anesthesia-specific effects on connectivity, we demonstrated that decreasing the amount of isoflurane administrated to the animal led to a transition from slow wave to persistent activity. Indeed, population and functional connectivity dynamics observed under a low dose of isoflurane rather resembled the ones observed under medetomidine-induced persistent activity, than the ones observed during slow wave activity induced by high isoflurane anesthesia.</p><p>Recently, it is has been shown that spontaneous resting-state associated brain activity is non-random in the temporal domain and that this feature is well conserved for rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Zhang, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, when we analyzed the temporal dynamics of connectivity patterns, we found that animals in persistent activity state, induced either by medetomidine or a low dose of isoflurane, showed rather temporally stable - persistent - connectivity dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steriade et al., 1991</xref>).

A direct demonstration of the involvement of down-up transitions in the functional connectivity maps comes from the significant correlation between the degree of connectivity and the amount of transitions in 4 of 5 animals.

More recently, Laumann and colleagues showed that the dynamic variability over time in fMRI functional connectivity signatures can be explained by fluctuating sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laumann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous resting-state fMRI studies report that anesthetized animals show lower functional coupling than awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). However, some studies show that default mode networks in rodents can be found even after the loss of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2012</xref>), while others show a breakdown in the networks of resting state connectivity under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boveroux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stamatakis et al., 2010</xref>). These apparent dissimilar results have been hypothesized to be dependent on the synchronization of infra-slow oscillatory activity and cross-frequency coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>). Our experiments demonstrate that the origin of these discrepancies may lie in the presence of different activity states of the brain. During persistent activity, compartmentalized patterns are detected, whilst during slow wave activity the degree of connectivity depends on the rate of slow waves generated in a particular period of time. Global signal removal has been shown to reduce connectivity for high isoflurane global synchrony conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>). This might indeed be because this technique is removing the underlying <italic>down-up</italic> transition related signals which are actually explaining a relevant part of the increased connectivity as our results show. Activity states of the brain as well as the rate of <italic>down-up</italic> transitions during slow wave activity in particular are dynamic and can be present under different experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we present data from strictly controlled conditions, in which the entire cortex seems to be engaged in either persistent or slow wave activity. However, in awake animals or during slow wave sleep, this might not be the case.</p><p>The presented results call for a brain state-informed analysis of functional connectivity in resting-state studies, both in humans and in animal models. Human subjects may transition between similar subtypes of these activity states when they transition between different levels of attention during an experiment or when they fall asleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>). Even more so, animals may react differently to the same anaesthetic regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore present a different underlying state of cortical activity while being subjected to the same anaesthesia condition. Similarly, it might be the case that at the beginning of an imaging experiment, an animal is in a state of persistent activity, and while the experiment progresses, shifts into a state of slow wave activity due to a change of underlying physiology or deepened anaesthesia over time. As our results show that this would lead to drastically different functional connectivity signatures, it is necessary to consider the particular activity state and global changes in cortical excitability before deriving conclusions about networks dynamics in any resting-state fMRI experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Lewis rat</td><td valign="top">Janvier labs</td><td valign="top">LEW/OrlRj</td><td valign="top">Female <break/>160–200 gr</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PBS tabletts</td><td>gibco</td><td>18912–014</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>xylocaine</td><td>AstraZeneca</td><td>PUN080440</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>isoflurane</td><td>AbbVie</td><td>8506 CHEBI:6015</td><td>1–1.55%</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Oregon-Green BAPTA1 AM</td><td>Invitrogen <break/>Thermo Fisher scientific</td><td>O6807</td><td>1 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Glucose</td><td>B.

Animals were housed under a 12 hr light–dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. Animal husbandry and experimental manipulation were carried out according to animal welfare guidelines of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz and were approved by the Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, Germany (G14-1-040). fMRI data acquisition fMRI data acquisition for connectivity analyses was performed in two sessions for each animal. For recording slow wave activity data sets, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.2–1.8% in 80% air and 20% oxygen). For recording persistent activity data, animals were sedated with medetomidine (zoetis, bolus injection of 0.04 mg/kg i.p. followed by continuous i.p. infusion of 0.08 mg/kg/hr). In a second group (low isoflurane group), animals were sedated with isoflurane 0.5–0.7% in order to keep the animals in persistent activity. The order of the recording sessions was randomly assigned to each animal. Both sessions were separated by at least 1 week. Measurements were performed on a 9.4 T small animal imaging system with a 0.7 T/m gradient system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Each experimental protocol consisted of T1-weighted anatomical imaging (image size 175 × 175×80, FoV 26 × 29×28 mm, resolution 0.15 × 0.165×0.35 mm), 30 min of resting state T2*-weighted images acquired with a single-shot gradient echo EPI sequence (TR = 1.5 s, TE = 14 ms and FA 65°, 320 × 290 μm² spatial resolution, slice thickness 0.8 mm, 34 continuous slices, 1200 acquisitions in eight animals and TR = 1 s in another seven animals) and a high-resolution in-plane T2-MSME images of the 34 slices (TE = 12 ms, 100 × 100 μm² spatial resolution, image size 256 × 256, slice thickness 0.8 mm, 34 continuous slices). The same protocol was used in the combined recordings with optic-fiber-based calcium recordings. Body temperature and breathing rate of the animal were monitored and recorded during the entire experimental procedure using an SA instruments small animal MRI-compatible monitoring system (Small Animal Instruments, Inc, Stony Brook, NY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>fMRI analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>General Linear Model (GLM) fMRI data processing was performed using Brain Voyager 20.6 for windows (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands). Preprocessing steps included slice scan time correction, 3D motion correction and smoothing of the images, using cubic-spline interpolation method and trilinear/sinc interpolation for the 3D motion correction. Datasets were smoothed using a 0.8 mm FWHM Gaussian Kernel. The initial five images were discarded to include only signals that have reached steady state. T1 images were manually aligned to the rat atlas MRI template of Valdes-Hernandez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valdés-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>). T2*-weighted images and high-resolution in-plane T2*-weighted images were then manually aligned to these T1 previously aligned to the MRI template.

Mask-calculation using the first image was employed and time-series were linearly detrended and converted to z-scores. For back-reconstruction, the ‘GICA’-algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calhoun et al., 2001</xref>) has been used and all results have been scaled by their z-scores. We used the Infomax-algorithm with regular stability analysis without autofill. Images for the ICA were motion corrected and smoothed as described above for each animal. The number of ICs to calculate for each animal was set to 20 and 25 for checking whether some components were subdivided into partial networks. We did not find different components for the networks of interests between both analyses; thus, we used the 20 components. Breathing rate and the signal form ventricles were used a regressors to avoid spurious components. Components that showed clusters outside the brain or a distinctive single slide activity were considered as noise and discarded. For visualization purposes, the z-scores of each animal were averaged and then plotted over the template using the Brain Voyager software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The regions found in the persistent activity ICA were taken as ROI for a connectivity analysis. nine regions were identified base in the connectivity patterns. The time course from each of the nine preselected nodes was extracted, and computed the Pearson correlation between every pair of the nodes to form a correlation matrix. The average signal of the ventricles and white matter was extracted and together with the breathing signal added as a covariable in the correlation analysis. This step resulted in a 9 × 9 matrix for each rat, where r-scores represented the resting state functional connectivity strength between each pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Connectivity analysis</title><p>Connectivity analyses were performed using custom Matlab scripts (The Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA). After normalizing the BOLD-signal to its mean intensity, the cortical volume was parcellated in 96 regions of interest (ROIs) using the MRI template of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valdés-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>. The size of each region consisted in average on 2014 voxels. With an exponential decay distribution. 75% of the regions contained more than 300 voxels with a minimum of 102 voxels and a maximum of 10160. The mean signal for each area was calculated averaging the signal of each voxel. The average signal of the ventricles and white matter was extracted and together with the breathing signal added as a covariable in the correlations. In a second connectivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the time course of the cortex-wide component was added as a covariable, either in its original form or temporally reversed as a control. Then, partial correlation coefficients were calculated for each pair of ROIs. The significance cutoff for each pair of ROIs was calculated independently for each matrix (each individual) using false discovery rate (FDR) correction (mean of cuttof: 0.348 ± 0.045 s.e.m). The FDR was performed on each matrix using the function <italic>mafdr</italic> from matlab based on the method introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Storey, 2002</xref>.

To reduce sensitivity to physiological noise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zou et al., 2008</xref> introduced fractional ALFF (fALFF), which is defined as the ratio of low-frequency amplitudes (0.01–0.08 Hz) to the amplitudes of the entire frequency range (0–0.25 Hz). Similarly, we conducted fALFF analysis using the ratio of 0.01–0.1 Hz for the entire frequency range 0–0.25 Hz.

Under a dissection microscope a small craniotomy was performed with a dental drill (Ultimate XL-F, NSK, Trier Germany, and VS1/4HP/005, Meisinger, Neuss, Germany). The fluorescent calcium sensitive dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1AM (OGB-1, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garaschuk et al., 2006</xref>), filtered, and injected into primary visual cortex (V1; −5.5 mm AP, +3.8 mm ML, −0.5,–0.7 and 0.9 mm DV) for the experiments combining fMRI and calcium photometry, and a second craniotomy and injection were performed in the primary somatosensory cortex front limb area (S1FL; 0 mm AP, +3.5 mm ML, −0.5,–0.7 and 0.9 mm DV;) for the bench experiments including optical recordings in the two cortical areas. After injection of the indicator, the pipette was held in place for 2 min before slowly retracting it from the tissue. After removing the cladding from the tip, an optic fiber with a diameter of 200 µm was inserted perpendicular to the dura above the OGB-1 stained area, typically at 300 µm and fixed to the skull with UV glue (Polytec, PT GmbH, Waldbrunn, Germany). A detailed description of these procedures can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stroh et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber photometry calcium recordings</title><p>For optic-fiber-based photometry calcium recordings, custom-built setups were used (FOM and FOMII, npi Electronic Instruments, Tamm, Germany), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stroh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). The light for excitation of the calcium indicator OGB-1 was delivered by a 650 mW LED with a nominal peak wavelength of 470 nm. LED power was controlled by an adjustable current source. The light beam was focused by means of a fixed focus collimator into one end of a multimode optic fiber which was connected to the system by an SMA connector. The recorded fluorescence signals were digitized with a sampling frequency of 2 kHz using a multifunction I/O data acquisition interface (Power1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) and its corresponding acquisition software (Spike2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calcium recordings analysis</title><p>Data was read into Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA, USA) and downsampled from 2 kHz to 1 kHz by averaging two adjacent values. The baseline of the fluorescence signal was determined and corrected by using the Matlab function <italic>msbackadj</italic> estimating the baseline within multiple shifted windows of 2500 datapoints width, regressing varying baseline values to the window’s datapoints using a spline approximation, then adjusting the baseline in the peak range of the fluorescent signal. This method provides a correction for low-frequency drifts while avoiding contributions of signal-of-interest events. We employed a procedure based on exponential moving average (EMA) filters, originally established to identify slow waves in electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seamari et al., 2007</xref>). Onsets of slow calcium waves were defined as signal timepoints exceeding the threshold (70%), termination of calcium slow waves was defined as signal timepoints dropping below 50% of the threshold value. Further, the detected activity was post-processed in the following order: 1) calcium waves separated by a time-interval below 500 ms were interpreted as one wave; 2) calcium waves with a duration of less than 300 ms were discarded; 3) activity not reaching 90% of the histogram-based cumulative signal intensity was discarded. The correlation analysis with the fMRI connectivity values was performed taking sub-traces of 180 s. This is equivalent of 120 data points in the BOLD signal, above the minimum of 100 points that has been shown to be necessary in the analysis of dynamic functional connectivity between 0.01 and 0.2 Hz with an overlap of 66% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leonardi and Van De Ville, 2015</xref>). To avoid spurious results in the correlation analysis given by the overlap of the collected data points, we performed a permutation test for each individual dataset, creating 10,000 data surrogates shuffling the connectivity indexes with the slow wave events in each subject. The normal distribution of the obtained r-scores represent the chance level of a spurious correlation and the mean of the distribution, the degree of intra-dependence. Thus, the obtained r-score is considered as significant when it falls into the 5% of the extremes of the distribution. The repeated measures correlation was performed using R software for statistical computing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>) using the rmcorr package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analysis were conducted using the statistical and machine learning toolbox of Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA).

connectivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors reproduce and expand their previous work showing that functional connectivity in the rat brain differs between persistent state, as induced by medetomidine anesthesia, and slow wave state, as induced by deep isoflurane anesthesia. They expand the common ICA analysis to show that there are more significant correlations between brain regions under isoflurane than under medetomidine and that the networks under isoflurane resemble a random graph, while those under medetomidine resemble small world networks. Further, the authors provide evidence for their hypothesis that down-up transitions (as they call the onset of a slow wave event) of neuronal excitability as found in slow wave state drive functional connectivity. To probe this, they employ an unusual combination of calcium recordings and resting state fMRI. Combining these two approaches is challenging. In four of five animals they find a correlation between the number of significantly correlated brain regions and the number of down-up transitions. This result has important implications for resting state fMRI, since it calls for strict control of the brain state during resting state fMRI measurements.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can read from the following comments, there are two recurrent themes: (a) your text needs to be revised to make it easier to understand for the general reader. (b) you need to specify the statistics used to analyze your data.</p><p>1) Many of the observations reported in this study have previously been described (e.g. increasing cortical synchrony within high iso condition vs low iso or vs medetomidine (e.g. PMID: 20530220, Grandjean et al., 2014), network connectivity strength between conditions (Bukhari et al., 2018), graph theory metrics (D'Souza et al., 2014), frequency/power distribution (Paasonen et al., 2018, Grandjean et al., 2014), reduced connectivity when global signal is removed especially when there is global connectivity synchrony in high-iso (Grandjean et al., 2014)). Please cite these published findings and relate to the present study.</p><p>2) The combination of BOLD fMRI with the slow-rave recording by photometry (Figure 6B) is novel. However, there, a few methodological concerns that need to be addressed. Most notably, the concept of independence is violated in Figure 6B, because the sampled variable (number of slow-wave and number of significant edges) overlap in their sliding windows approach (3 min windows with 1 min overlap with both the previous and next window). Thus, in a statistical test, the samples may not be considered independent from one another, a key tenant of statistics.</p><p>3) The work would gain importance, if these results were reproduced in a larger group of animals. In particular, graph theory analysis is usually performed in larger cohorts of animals (or at least data sets). However, additional data analysis can also strengthen the paper substantially.</p><p>4) The text is often unclear, lacks proper definitions, there is wrong punctuation in several places making it difficult to read (some examples below). Specifically there are some terms that are not precise or incorrect in the text. For example, the Abstract refers to &quot;these bimodal recordings&quot;. It is not clear to what this refers. Next the Abstract refers to a &quot;persistent state&quot;. Normally one refers to &quot;persistent activity&quot;, and maybe after a classification, it can be referred to as &quot;the state with persistent activity&quot; or even the persistent state.</p><p>4.1) Along these lines: Some sentences in the manuscript are rather confusing, or even wrong, for example in the Introduction there is: &quot;The concept of brain states as defined by the local and global features of network dynamics by no means entails, that different behavioural states as e.g. anesthetized condition or natural sleep would be identical, however, defining features of the slow wave state, such as bimodality, can be identified in a plethora of different conditions as the fundamental difference between fast and slow timescale cortical dynamics is likely regulated by distinct mechanisms at the single neuron level&quot;. This needs rewriting.</p><p>4.2) With regards to revising the text: In the Introduction it is said: &quot;Surprisingly, in rodents as in humans, little has been investigated on how the brain's current state impacts functional connectivity derived from BOLD activity, despite evidence that, for instance, small changes in anaesthesia can dramatically change brain connectivity &quot;. This suggests that, if small changes in anaesthesia result in dramatic changes in brain connectivity, different brain states are -not surprisingly- going to have an impact on functional connectivity (as it has been shown, although questions remain open).</p><p>4.3) The Results start by referring to &quot; We first conducted independent component (IC) analyses of rat task-free fMRI signals in the isoflurane-induced condition, and in the medetomidine-induced condition.&quot; Then one wonders, why in medetomidine? Lacking the information that medetomidine is the way to induce &quot;persistent state&quot; (given that the experimental paradigm in this regard was not described earlier). There is a poor definition of the &quot;persistent state&quot; in the presence of medetomidine. It is obviously a different brain state from slow waves, but what kind of brain state? How different is it from the awake? To what extent is it dose-dependent (as indeed it is)? If there is a detailed characterization by the authors or in the literature, it should be better reported, describing what is the state induced by medetomidine. It should be included at the start of the results including what the comparison is, and why medetomidine is a good equivalent of awake.</p><p>4.4) In the Discussion: &quot;In contrast, animals in slow wave state showed fast, and temporally irregular transitions. This suggests, that individual, specific events within the slow wave state drive the state-specific network signature The occurrence of these events, down-up transitions, or slow waves, are not occurring in a regular, oscillation-like manner, but depend on the overall physiological state of the animal, such as the depth of anaesthesia.&quot;. The concept of &quot;temporally irregular transitions&quot; is confusing. The frequency of the slow oscillations may vary with depth of anaesthesia, however this is compatible with regularity in the oscillations.</p><p>4.5) In the Discussion: &quot;Although, there is abundant evidence on the relevance of infra-slow electrical brain activity for resting state connectivity there has been no direct neural evidence so far linking brain states to changes in network configuration&quot;. Indeed, there are articles both for humans and for rodents illustrating different connectivity patterns with different brain states. However, the relation with the infra-slow (unmentioned so far) here is not that clear.</p><p>4.6) In the Discussion: &quot;pathophysiological condition such as early AD&quot;, since the acronym AD was never defined earlier in the text, please use the explicit term.</p><p>4.7) Discussion: &quot;In this study, we demonstrated that brain states can modify properties of the functional connectome through changes in cortical excitability.&quot; We do not know that it is just &quot;excitability&quot;, since excitability is a broad term. There are other concomitant differences, such as dynamics.</p><p>4.8) The study of the cross-correlations during down to up states is highly suggestive but needs more robust and obvious evidence than that provided.</p><p>5) Description and presentation of the ICA is currently not sufficient.</p><p>5.1) More details on how ICA was performed are required: e.g. how many components were allowed; which components were assigned to noise, and how was this done; was breathing or heart rate used as regressor;</p><p>5.2) Presentation of ICA results is not clear: how many components were assigned to brain activity; what were the weights of these components; showing only three slices is not sufficient – include all slices relevant slices of the respective networks.</p><p>5.3) How was the DMN defined (ie which brain regions were included)? How many of these were found in the ICA component(s) and in which? Suggestion: perhaps register the ICA results on the brain atlas and provide quantitative data on how much of the respective network was identified – how were the average z-scores there.</p><p>5.4) To better illustrate the difference between the brain states, the authors may show serial slices of the brain for SW and P state, so the reader can see which regions were identified.</p><p>6) Since the activity of different networks in the different brain states is the fundamental point of this paper, the authors should provide a confirmation of their ICA, by performing a ROI based correlation analysis. This should be easily doable with the data and the atlas the authors have used already. Such independent confirmation of active networks in the different brain states would make a strong point and probably silence most of the doubt in the community.</p><p>7) Graph theory provides far more information than global results as shown in Figure 4. It would be extremely interesting to see how communities actually are different between brain states. Please provide a representation (e.g. a 2D plot using a force-based algorithm) of the networks in the two brain states.</p><p>8) There is a dramatic difference in noise level in the calcium traces in Figure 5 between SW-I and P-M. Is the scale bar with 3% valid for all three traces or only for the top one? Are these data from the same animal, were they acquired in the same session? If yes, the anesthesia switch needs to be described in both Materials and methods and caption. Add scale bars for each trace. Explain experimental details in the caption. Since there seems to be substantial variation in noise levels, the authors should provide exemplary calcium traces for all conditions for all animals (as a Supplement).</p><p>9) Why was 0.5-0-7% isoflurane added to medetomidine? This appears arbitrary. Is anything known about which concentration induces brain state changes. How does isoflurane concentration influence networks or hemodynamic and calcium signal. Please discuss.</p><p>10) Results shown in Figure 6Bii should be additionally validated by performing correlation plots not only with number of events but also with 1) total up-time during the 180s, 2) average amplitude during the 180s, 3) position of the 180s-frame to exclude an effect of time during 30 min. Please show data also for the fifth animal.</p><p>11) What is the meaning of cross correlation amplitude of filtered data as shown in Figure 7D and E?</p><p>12) Figure captions do not provide sufficient information. Make sure that all symbols are explained, and experimental conditions become clear – for all figures. Three examples: Explain what is shown in the boxplots. What do lines between left and right data in box plots indicate? What do shaded areas indicate (SD, SEM,…)?</p><p>Related to this, there is no statistics described in the Materials and methods section. Adding details is very important to determine what test and how it was performed. Without such a section, the reader cannot assess the plausibility of the results, and thus cannot provide in-depth comments pertaining to the results.</p><p>13) Connectivity matrices must be labelled to identify the individual brain regions. Add a legend on the matrix or a color code plus legend (probably best as a supplement).</p><p>14) Were both positive and negative correlations used. For graph theory analysis is usually separated for positive and negative correlations.</p><p>15) Please explain in detail the process of adjacency matrices construction and the calculation of the threshold.</p><p>16) Connectivity analysis, second paragraph: Please specify the procedure of FDR. Please give the correlation value of connectivity strength and distance not only its significance.</p><p>17) There is no information about the topography of the FC. It is shown that the correlation between Euclidean distance is more negative in slow wave state. It could illustrate that during slow wave state the activity is propagating so the FC follows a spatial gradient rather than long-range connections. Actually, in Figure 2A, one can see that the interhemispheric connections are weaker in slow-wave state than in persistent state, although the overall correlation magnitude is larger.</p><p>18) In Figure 2A, 5C, 6A and 6B, please consider labelling the axis of the matrices, not with all the 96 ROIs but at least partially to give the reader a better idea of the average connectivity found in the two states.</p><p>19) Figure 2C: please describe the test used both in text and figure caption.</p><p>Figure 3: missing the number of the individuals in the figure legend.</p><p>20) In the section Connectivity differences are reflecting different brain states: &quot;In this case, the resulting values of persistent state induced by low isoflurane…. (Figure 4D) (t(5)=5.19, p=0.003). We used the same matrix similarity computation in a dynamic connectivity analysis […] than in the case of slow wave state induced by high isoflurane concentrations (Figure 4E). &quot;. There is an incorrect figure reference, it must be Figure 5D and 5E.</p><p>21) In Figure 7B and C, are those recordings from V1 or S1? Consider showing both together for consistency and to show the propagation delay. Maybe different colours can be used for V1 and S1 and different shades for the filter's frequency bands.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53186.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can read from the following comments, there are two recurrent themes: (a) your text needs to be revised to make it easier to understand for the general reader.

In addition, we augmented the statistical methods used for analyses.</p><p>2) We substantially improved the description of the methodologies used in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Many of the observations reported in this study have previously been described (e.g. increasing cortical synchrony within high iso condition vs low iso or vs medetomidine (e.g. PMID: 20530220, Grandjean et al., 2014), network connectivity strength between conditions (Bukhari et al., 2018), graph theory metrics (D'Souza et al., 2014), frequency/power distribution (Paasonen et al., 2018, Grandjean et al., 2014), reduced connectivity when global signal is removed especially when there is global connectivity synchrony in high-iso (Grandjean et al., 2014)). Please cite these published findings and relate to the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have revised the text accordingly. We included the mentioned literature and relate our results to these important previous findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The combination of BOLD fMRI with the slow-rave recording by photometry (Figure 6B) is novel. However, there, a few methodological concerns that need to be addressed. Most notably, the concept of independence is violated in Figure 6B, because the sampled variable (number of slow-wave and number of significant edges) overlap in their sliding windows approach (3 min windows with 1 min overlap with both the previous and next window). Thus, in a statistical test, the samples may not be considered independent from one another, a key tenant of statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the point of sample independence and thus, have conducted two new analyses for this data. First, we performed a permutation creating 10000 surrogates, shuffling the data pairs of each subject. The means of the correlations scores (r) thereby reflect the degree of dependency of the data, i.e. the intrinsic bias. We compared the obtained r-score with the distribution of the permutation test and found significant results for 5 out of 6 animals. Furthermore, we conducted a repeated measures correlation analysis as proposed by Bakdash and Marusich, 2017, which also yielded significant results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The work would gain importance, if these results were reproduced in a larger group of animals. In particular, graph theory analysis is usually performed in larger cohorts of animals (or at least data sets). However, additional data analysis can also strengthen the paper substantially.</p></disp-quote><p>We have proceeded with the recommendation of the reviewer and have included a new data set, increasing the number of animals from 8 to 15 for the fMRI connectivity analysis (including graph theory analysis) and from 5 to 6 for the combined optic fiber recordings and fMRI measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The text is often unclear, lacks proper definitions, there is wrong punctuation in several places making it difficult to read (some examples below). Specifically there are some terms that are not precise or incorrect in the text. For example, the Abstract refers to &quot;these bimodal recordings&quot;. It is not clear to what this refers. Next the Abstract refers to a &quot;persistent state&quot;. Normally one refers to &quot;persistent activity&quot;, and maybe after a classification, it can be referred to as &quot;the state with persistent activity&quot; or even the persistent state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly revised the text according to this comment. We are using “persistent activity” now in agreement with more common terminology and have rewritten or clarified the mentioned parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.1) Along these lines: Some sentences in the manuscript are rather confusing, or even wrong, for example in the Introduction there is: &quot;The concept of brain states as defined by the local and global features of network dynamics by no means entails, that different behavioural states as e.g. anesthetized condition or natural sleep would be identical, however, defining features of the slow wave state, such as bimodality, can be identified in a plethora of different conditions as the fundamental difference between fast and slow timescale cortical dynamics is likely regulated by distinct mechanisms at the single neuron level&quot;. This needs rewriting.</p></disp-quote><p>This section of the Introduction has been replaced entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.2) With regards to revising the text: In the Introduction it is said: &quot;Surprisingly, in rodents as in humans, little has been investigated on how the brain's current state impacts functional connectivity derived from BOLD activity, despite evidence that, for instance, small changes in anaesthesia can dramatically change brain connectivity &quot;. This suggests that, if small changes in anaesthesia result in dramatic changes in brain connectivity, different brain states are -not surprisingly- going to have an impact on functional connectivity (as it has been shown, although questions remain open).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text in the Introduction and now wrote:</p><p>“…Despite evidence of subtle changes in anesthesia level being able to dramatically change brain connectivity<sup>43-45</sup>, little has been investigated on how the brain’s current state impacts functional connectivity derived from BOLD activity. While variations in functional connectivity have been related to cognitive state in humans<sup>46</sup>, the effect of neurophysiologically defined states on functional connectivity in the cortex remains unknown.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.3) The Results start by referring to &quot; We first conducted independent component (IC) analyses of rat task-free fMRI signals in the isoflurane-induced condition, and in the medetomidine-induced condition.&quot; Then one wonders, why in medetomidine? Lacking the information that medetomidine is the way to induce &quot;persistent state&quot; (given that the experimental paradigm in this regard was not described earlier). There is a poor definition of the &quot;persistent state&quot; in the presence of medetomidine. It is obviously a different brain state from slow waves, but what kind of brain state? How different is it from the awake? To what extent is it dose-dependent (as indeed it is)? If there is a detailed characterization by the authors or in the literature, it should be better reported, describing what is the state induced by medetomidine. It should be included at the start of the results including what the comparison is, and why medetomidine is a good equivalent of awake.</p></disp-quote><p>We now introduce the concept of persistent activity as a state which can occur during light sedation (with e.g. medetomidine) already in the Introduction (“…In a state of persistent activity, which can occur during periods of light anesthesia, sedation or during awake periods<sup>13</sup>, neurons are rather depolarized, sparsely active, leading to temporally dynamic, modality specific, network configurations<sup>19,20</sup>”) and added a sentence in the results stating the components we identified under medetomidine-induced persistent activity and in which conditions these have been described before by others (“…the identified components for persistent activity resembled those described by others for awake<sup>49,62</sup> or sedated rodents<sup>1,63</sup>.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.4) In the Discussion: &quot;In contrast, animals in slow wave state showed fast, and temporally irregular transitions. This suggests, that individual, specific events within the slow wave state drive the state-specific network signature The occurrence of these events, down-up transitions, or slow waves, are not occurring in a regular, oscillation-like manner, but depend on the overall physiological state of the animal, such as the depth of anaesthesia.&quot;. The concept of &quot;temporally irregular transitions&quot; is confusing. The frequency of the slow oscillations may vary with depth of anaesthesia, however this is compatible with regularity in the oscillations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this section was confusing and have rewritten this sentence in the Discussion incorporating the reviewer’s suggestions regarding the regularity being dependent on the depth of anesthesia: “…This suggests that individual specific events within slow wave activity could drive state-specific network signatures, while it has to be taken into account that the regularity of down-up transitions or slow wave events can depend on the overall physiological condition of the animal, such as the depth of anesthesia<sup>6</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.5) In the Discussion: &quot;Although, there is abundant evidence on the relevance of infra-slow electrical brain activity for resting state connectivity there has been no direct neural evidence so far linking brain states to changes in network configuration&quot;. Indeed, there are articles both for humans and for rodents illustrating different connectivity patterns with different brain states. However, the relation with the infra-slow (unmentioned so far) here is not that clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We now further clarify our intended statement in this sentence: “…Although, there is abundant evidence on the relevance of, for example, infra-slow electrical brain activity for resting state connectivity<sup>37,76,77</sup>, there so far has been no evidence linking different population activity states of the brain to changes in functional network configuration directly.” Although for example infra-slow activity (terminology of the cited studies) has been previously studied in relation to resting state activity, we are unaware of studies directly relating activity states of local neural populations to changes in functional network configurations of the entire brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.6) In the Discussion: &quot;pathophysiological condition such as early AD&quot;, since the acronym AD was never defined earlier in the text, please use the explicit term.</p></disp-quote><p>AD has been replaced with Alzheimer’s disease in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.7) Discussion: &quot;In this study, we demonstrated that brain states can modify properties of the functional connectome through changes in cortical excitability.&quot; We do not know that it is just &quot;excitability&quot;, since excitability is a broad term. There are other concomitant differences, such as dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed the term excitability from this sentence in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.8) The study of the cross-correlations during down to up states is highly suggestive but needs more robust and obvious evidence than that provided.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we relate a well-defined neurophysiological event, a slow-oscillation-associated slow wave, to the hemodynamic signal, and contrast the brain state governed by these slow waves with a brain state characterized by rather persistent activity. For that we used, as pioneered in the 2017 <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript (Schwalm et al.), a regressor-based approach. Here, we collected important new evidence on the impact of the temporal dynamics of ongoing activity to the hemodynamic response. But, this approach has limitations: we relate two physiological signals with drastically different temporal resolutions: 1 ms in terms of the optical recordings, 1 s in terms of the fMRI recordings; and we are dealing with different origins of the signals: action potential-mediated influx of calcium vs. a hemodynamic response. We strongly believe, that we provided meaningful further evidence of the relation of these two signals, and that the field of small animal “resting state”, task-free fMRI needs to move beyond comparing anesthetic regimens. But, these inherent limitations prevail, and we simply do not see, how we could provide “obvious evidence” in this complex relation of two drastically different physiological signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Description and presentation of the ICA is currently not sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a significantly improved analysis of the independent components, as well as a more detailed description thereof, please check the following points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.1) More details on how ICA was performed are required: e.g. how many components were allowed; which components were assigned to noise, and how was this done; was breathing or heart rate used as regressor;</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.2) Presentation of ICA results is not clear: how many components were assigned to brain activity; what were the weights of these components; showing only three slices is not sufficient – include all slices relevant slices of the respective networks.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more detailed presentation of the ICA was needed. For this reason, we have added a new supplementary figure with the maps of the selected component for each animal. We have also contrasted the found activation maps with atlas-based information. We also extracted the ROIs of the selected map and performed a connectivity analysis to double check the veracity of the obtained networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.3) How was the DMN defined (ie which brain regions were included)? How many of these were found in the ICA component(s) and in which? Suggestion: perhaps register the ICA results on the brain atlas and provide quantitative data on how much of the respective network was identified – how were the average z-scores there.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the suggestion of the reviewer into account and added the information on the exact DMN regions we found. In a new supplementary figure, we have now also added the maps of each animal that reflect the DMN. This now gives the reader a clear idea on the revealed components of the ICA and their localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.4) To better illustrate the difference between the brain states, the authors may show serial slices of the brain for SW and P state, so the reader can see which regions were identified.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1, we show renderings in all three anatomical orientations, in which, at least in our view, the different activity patterns can be clearly delineated. We would not see how to display our findings in a way which would add further information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since the activity of different networks in the different brain states is the fundamental point of this paper, the authors should provide a confirmation of their ICA, by performing a ROI based correlation analysis. This should be easily doable with the data and the atlas the authors have used already. Such independent confirmation of active networks in the different brain states would make a strong point and probably silence most of the doubt in the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and have conducted the suggested analysis in the new version of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Graph theory provides far more information than global results as shown in Figure 4. It would be extremely interesting to see how communities actually are different between brain states. Please provide a representation (e.g. a 2D plot using a force-based algorithm) of the networks in the two brain states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new subplot in Figure 3 that contains all the pairs of significant connections over the cortex in both states. We believe this is even more informative in terms of visualization than a force-based algorithm in terms of the patterns of connectivity in each state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There is a dramatic difference in noise level in the calcium traces in Figure 5 between SW-I and P-M. Is the scale bar with 3% valid for all three traces or only for the top one? Are these data from the same animal, were they acquired in the same session? If yes, the anesthesia switch needs to be described in both methods and caption. Add scale bars for each trace. Explain experimental details in the caption. Since there seems to be substantial variation in noise levels, the authors should provide exemplary calcium traces for all conditions for all animals (as a Supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>Since the data collection for the different brain states was performed in different sessions, the data previously presented does not correspond to the same experiment. The signal-to-noise-level varies between experiments, as it is dependent on 1) the staining efficacy, which is different from each injection pipette used, and, the relative placement of the optical fiber to the stained region. This is inherent to method, please see also previous studies of us and others (Stroh et al., 2013; Busche,…Konnerth, Science 2008). Therefore, normalization approaches need to be implemented, and amplitudes cannot be compared between experiments. Nevertheless, we now included a trace of an experiment for which the anesthesia was modified within the same session. Thus, this new dataset represents exactly the same noise levels for the calcium recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Why was 0.5-0-7% isoflurane added to medetomidine? This appears arbitrary. Is anything known about which concentration induces brain state changes. How does isoflurane concentration influence networks or hemodynamic and calcium signal. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this part was not clear in the text. The condition called “low isoflurane” included <italic>only</italic> 0.5-0.7% of isoflurane and no added medetomidine. This allowed to keep the animal in stable persistent activity in the scanner while using the same anesthetic that can induce the slow wave activity. We have rephrased this part accordingly to make it cleared for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Results shown in Figure 6Bii should be additionally validated by performing correlation plots not only with number of events but also with 1) total up-time during the 180s, 2) average amplitude during the 180s, 3) position of the 180s-frame to exclude an effect of time during 30 min. Please show data also for the fifth animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included one more animal in our analysis and are now plotting data for 6 animals. Data on the total up-time and the average amplitude is highly dependent on the staining quality and the fiber placement, please see above. Due to bleaching effects OGB-1 signal quality can deteriorate over time, leading to smaller signal to noise ratio that influences the length and amplitude of the slow waves. Finally, taking into consideration that the TR of the fMRI is 1.5 seconds, this seems to be irrelevant for the BOLD signal differences as it only affects a few milliseconds of slow wave duration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) What is the meaning of cross correlation amplitude of filtered data as shown in Figure 7D and E?</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this analysis is to show that down-up transitions drive the high correlation between cortical areas by using a signal of neural origin. We have rephrased this part of the results in order to make it more accessible to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure captions do not provide sufficient information. Make sure that all symbols are explained, and experimental conditions become clear – for all figures. Three examples: Explain what is shown in the boxplots. What do lines between left and right data in box plots indicate? What do shaded areas indicate (SD, SEM,…)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a more detailed description of each figure in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, there is no statistics described in the method section. Adding details is very important to determine what test and how it was performed. Without such a section, the reader cannot assess the plausibility of the results, and thus cannot provide in-depth comments pertaining to the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain the statistical tests used in the text as well as in the figure captions. Accordingly, we have also added the statistical methods in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Connectivity matrices must be labelled to identify the individual brain regions. Add a legend on the matrix or a color code plus legend (probably best as a supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary figure containing the name of all regions used in the study as well as their position in the matrices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Were both positive and negative correlations used. For graph theory analysis is usually separated for positive and negative correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the indications of Rubinov and Sporns, 2010 for the construction of adjacency matrices when analyzing fMRI data, we used only the positive correlation values. We have added this information now in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Please explain in detail the process of adjacency matrices construction and the calculation of the threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added detailed information in the Materials and methods section, explaining the threshold calculation using the FDR calculated for each individual, and the Weighted Undirected Networks construction using Sporns Matlab toolbox for graph theory analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Connectivity analysis, second paragraph: Please specify the procedure of FDR. Please give the correlation value of connectivity strength and distance not only its significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence in the connectivity analysis section explaining how the FDR was calculated and used in our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) There is no information about the topography of the FC. It is shown that the correlation between Euclidean distance is more negative in slow wave state. It could illustrate that during slow wave state the activity is propagating so the FC follows a spatial gradient rather than long-range connections. Actually, in Figure 2A, one can see that the interhemispheric connections are weaker in slow-wave state than in persistent state, although the overall correlation magnitude is larger.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a subplot in Figure 3 that contains all the pairs of significant connections for the cortex in both states. We believe this is highly informative in terms of visualization. We have also added a supplementary figure showing the distribution and names of the regions and their position in the matrices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) In Figure 2A, 5C, 6A and 6B, please consider labelling the axis of the matrices, not with all the 96 ROIs but at least partially to give the reader a better idea of the average connectivity found in the two states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary figure containing all the labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Figure 2C: please describe the test used both in text and figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the statistical tests used in both the figure legend and the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: missing the number of the individuals in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In the section Connectivity differences are reflecting different brain states: &quot;In this case, the resulting values of persistent state induced by low isoflurane…. (Figure 4D) (t(5)=5.19, p=0.003). We used the same matrix similarity computation in a dynamic connectivity analysis […] than in the case of slow wave state induced by high isoflurane concentrations (Figure 4E). &quot;. There is an incorrect figure reference, it must be Figure 5D and 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) In Figure 7B and C, are those recordings from V1 or S1? Consider showing both together for consistency and to show the propagation delay. Maybe different colours can be used for V1 and S1 and different shades for the filter's frequency bands.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the region (V1) in the figure legend and we have improved our explanation in the body of the text. We hope this helps to clarify.</p></body></sub-article></article>
