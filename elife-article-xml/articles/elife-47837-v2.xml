Traditionally, models of spinal circuits have emphasized the role of inhibition in enforcing reciprocal alternation between left and right sides or flexors and extensors. However, recent work has shown that inhibition also increases coincident with excitation during contraction. Here, using larval zebrafish, we investigate the V2b (Gata3+) class of neurons, which contribute to flexor-extensor alternation but are otherwise poorly understood. Using newly generated transgenic lines we define two stable subclasses with distinct neurotransmitter and morphological properties. These V2b subclasses synapse directly onto motor neurons with differential targeting to speed-specific circuits. In vivo, optogenetic manipulation of V2b activity modulates locomotor frequency: suppressing V2b neurons elicits faster locomotion, whereas activating V2b neurons slows locomotion. We conclude that V2b neurons serve as a brake on axial motor circuits. Together, these results indicate a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>circuitry</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National BioResource Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higashijima</surname><given-names>Shin-ichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 DC012536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnall</surname><given-names>Martha W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC016413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnall</surname><given-names>Martha W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS103247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Callahan</surname><given-names>Rebecca A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Most vertebrates locomote via alternating left-right contractions that travel from rostral to caudal; tetrapods additionally alternate between flexors and extensors to regulate limb movements. Due in part to the technical challenges in identifying and manipulating specific classes of neurons in the spinal cord, the underlying circuitry of locomotion remains only poorly worked out.</p><p>Spinal neurons are broadly divided into ten superclasses arising from distinct progenitor domains of which six classes are considered to directly influence motor neurons (dI3, dI6, V0, V1, V2, V3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Within these superclasses, cardinal neuron classes have been identified based on transcription factor expression and neurotransmitter identity (e.g., V2a/Chx10/excitatory; V2b/Gata3/inhibitory). Recently, it has become clear that many of these classes can be further subdivided into anywhere from 2 to 50 subclasses, based on anatomical and genetic distinctions, with as-yet unclear implications for circuit connectivity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Menelaou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Traditionally, patterned locomotion has been modeled as an alternation between excitation and inhibition, which dominate motor neurons during contraction and extension portions of the cycle, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Danner et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, however, evidence from fish, frogs, and turtles has challenged the notion that inhibition is minimal during the contraction of the cycle, i.e., in-phase with excitation. Instead, inhibitory conductances appear to be significant both in- and out-of-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall and McLean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li and Moult, 2012</xref>), suggesting that simultaneous recruitment of excitation and inhibition during the contraction is important for regulating motor neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petersen and Berg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In-phase inhibition is thought to derive from two spinal interneuron classes, the V1 and V2b populations. The V1 population includes Renshaw cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sapir et al., 2004</xref>), which provide recurrent inhibition onto motor neurons with potentially significant shunting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bhumbra et al., 2014</xref>). To date, most analysis of drive from V2b neurons has focused on the shared contributions of V1s and V2bs to reciprocal inhibition governing flexor/extensor alternation in limbed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>). However, this does not shed light on potential functions of ipsilateral inhibition in gain control for regulation of motor neuron firing <italic>during</italic> contraction, as opposed to suppression of motor neuron firing during extension.</p><p>In-phase inhibition increases in amplitude for faster locomotor movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting a potential role in speed control. Here we investigated whether V2b neurons could indeed provide direct inhibition to motor neurons for speed control, taking advantage of the speed-dependent organization of zebrafish motor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Menelaou and McLean, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McLean et al., 2008</xref>). V2b neurons are good candidates for in-phase gain control because they are exclusively inhibitory in mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batista et al., 2008</xref>) with ipsilateral, descending axons within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lundfald et al., 2007</xref>). They arise from a final progenitor division that produces pairs of V2a and V2b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). Given the role of V2a neurons in triggering motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eklöf-Ljunggren et al., 2012</xref>) particularly through speed-specific circuits for titrating levels of motor excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Crone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>), it seems plausible that their sister V2b neurons exert an opposing, inhibitory role in speed control. However, the V2b class has not been well characterized at anatomical or neurochemical levels outside of very early development.</p><p>Here, we define two subclasses of V2b neurons in larval zebrafish based on differential transmitter expression and anatomy and further show that these neurons directly inhibit axial motor neurons in speed-specific circuits. Optogenetic suppression of V2b activity elicits faster locomotion whereas optogenetic activation of V2b activity reduces tail frequency, consistent with a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gata3 transgenic lines label V2b neurons</title><p>V2b neural identity is, in part, conferred by the developmental expression of the transcription factor Gata3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).

These ratios indicate at least two subclasses of V2b neurons: those expressing Glyt2 but not Gad1b, and those expressing both Glyt2 and Gad1b.

Therefore, soma position is not predictive of neurotransmitter expression. In the rostrocaudal axis, the percentage of GABAergic V2b cells is highest (~80%) in rostral segments, then decreases to ~50% by midbody and throughout the rest of the spinal cord. In contrast, Glyt2 robustly colabels with V2b cells throughout the entire spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Large motor neurons with low input resistance are located dorsally within the motor pool and are recruited for the fastest speeds of swimming, whereas more ventrally located motor neuron somata exhibit higher input resistance and are recruited during slower movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Menelaou and McLean, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, we tested whether the glycinergic and GABAergic components of the IPSC differed between fast and slow motor neurons. Bath application of 10 µM strychnine to block glycine receptors abolished a median of 91% of the V2b-evoked IPSC in fast motor neurons, but only 71% of the V2b-evoked IPSC in slow motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E,C</xref>; p=0.003, Wilcoxon Rank test). Similar results were obtained with measurement of the charge integral (over 100 ms: 91% blocked by strychnine in fast motor neurons; 66% block in slow motor neurons). The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (SR-95531, 10 µM) eliminated the remaining IPSC in all cases. Therefore V2b-mediated inhibition onto fast motor neurons is carried out predominantly by glycinergic synapses, whereas V2b inhibition onto slow motor neurons is carried by mixed glycinergic/GABAergic transmission. These results are consistent with the idea that V2b-gly preferentially inhibit more dorsally located fast motor neurons, whereas V2b-mixed inhibit the more ventrally located slow motor neurons.</p><p>Does V2b-mediated inhibition suppress spiking in motor neurons? We tested this by delivering 30 ms pulses of depolarizing current injection to motor neurons, with or without conjunctive optogenetic activation of V2b neurons in the <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> line. Interestingly, V2b activation did not change thresholds or gain relationships on average, in both fast and slow motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Within fast motor neurons, 3/14 neurons did exhibit a clear increased threshold to spike during V2b activation, and in two of those neurons, strychnine completely abrogated the effects (the third was not tested). However, the overall results indicate that V2b suppression of motor neuron spiking is not robust, despite the clear evidence of connectivity. These findings may be attributable to the putative location of V2b synapses on motor neuron dendritic arbors and consequent effects on dendritic integration rather than somatically-elicited spiking.</p><p>Some spinal premotor neurons form synaptic connections within their own populations, suggestive of speed- or state-related ‘gears’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chopek et al., 2018</xref>).

First, to test whether connections from CSF-cNs could slow locomotion, optogenetic activation was delivered caudally to the recorded segment, to target the predominantly ascending axons of CSF-cNs. Caudal stimulation did not affect IBI frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>, paired Student’s t-test, p=0.495). Additionally, we repeated these experiments in a set of <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> animals with low CatCh expression in V2b neurons to account for CSF-cN contributions (&lt;3 V2b neurons per hemisegment, akin to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation in low V2b CatCh expressing animals did not lead to a significant change in tail frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, paired Student’s t-test p=0.174, CatCh- sibling control group p=0.427). Finally, to determine whether visually-induced effects contributed to the locomotor slowing, we delivered a red-shifted excitation (~550 nm) incapable of activating CatCh to rostral segments in the normally-expressing <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> line. Tail beat frequencies of the red-shifted stimulation did not vary from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>, paired Student’s t-test, p=0.467). Activation of V2b neurons in the original experiment did reduce swim bout duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, Student’s t-test p=4.65×10<sup>−3</sup>). However, given the expression of CatCh in ISNs and their known role in influencing swim bout incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Montgomery et al., 2018</xref>) it is not possible to ascertain whether this result arises from V2b inhibition, ISN serotonergic modulation, or a superposition of both. Bout length was not significantly altered in animals with low V2b but strong CSF-cN CatCh expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, Student’s t-test p=0.113), though we note that CSF-cN activation after swim onset (as opposed to throughout) has been shown to reduce bout duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>All together these experiments demonstrate that stimulating V2b neurons reduces the speed of rhythmic tail movements during swim.

The V2b population comprises two stable subclasses, defined by neurotransmitter identity: one subclass is exclusively glycinergic and the other mixed glycinergic/GABAergic. These distinct V2b-gly and V2b-mixed subclasses preferentially inhibit fast and slow motor neurons, respectively, analogous to the speed-dependent connectivity found in a diverse range of zebrafish spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McLean and Fetcho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McLean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Svara et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we found that V2b activity serves as a brake on locomotor speeds: driving V2b neurons slows locomotion whereas suppressing V2b neurons speeds it up. Together, these results indicate that inhibition from V2b neurons is not restricted to enforcing agonist-antagonist muscle coordination but also influences locomotor speed through in-phase modulation of axial motor circuits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>V2b conservation across species</title><p>We demonstrated that V2b neurons are inhibitory and extend axons ipsilaterally and caudally in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) similar to V2b neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lundfald et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Britz et al., 2015</xref>). Gata3+ V2b neurons are widely present in vertebrates but have also been identified in the nerve cord of a marine annelid, indicating an ancestral persistence in motor circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vergara et al., 2017</xref>). V2b neurotransmitter profiles appear to vary throughout development and across species. Gata3-expressing cells in the embryonic 24 hr post fertilization zebrafish are predominantly GABAergic with a smaller subset expressing or co-expressing glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batista et al., 2008</xref>), an inversion of our finding that V2b cells in 5–15 dpf zebrafish are all glycinergic with approximately half co-expressing GABA. Early in development, murine V2b neurons broadly co-express GABA and glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). By P0 in mouse, however, nearly all V2bs are glycinergic and ~25% are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lundfald et al., 2007</xref>), which is broadly similar to our results. In zebrafish, these two subclasses persist out to 15 dpf, implying that they are stable identities.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that V2b-gly and V2b-mixed are distinct identities, the two subclasses exhibit different axon trajectories in the DV axis, perhaps indicating responsiveness to different axon guidance cues. In mouse, V2b subpopulations have not been directly shown. However, the differential expression of the transcription factors Gata2/Gata3/BhlhB5 in non-overlapping neural subsets may imply their presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francius et al., 2013</xref>). More broadly, our finding of subclasses in the V2b population is parallel to previously identified genetically and anatomically distinct subclasses within the V0, V1, and V2a populations in the mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Björnfors and El Manira, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Do V2b-gly and V2b-mixed populations match existing zebrafish neural classes?</title><p>Historically, zebrafish spinal neurons have been classified by anatomy. V2b (Gata3+) neurons are thought to correlate to ventral longitudinal (VeLD) neurons, an anatomically defined cell class with a characteristic longitudinal ventral-positioned axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batista et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bernhardt et al., 1992</xref>). How do the subpopulations we have described here relate to the VeLD population? Based on the ventral axon morphology and GABA co-expression, the V2b-mixed subtype represents a matured version of the embryonic VeLD neurons. In contrast, V2b-gly neurons are distinct in morphology and neurotransmitter profile from VeLDs, indicating either that they have not been previously identified in embryonic stages or that they develop at a later time.</p><p>In mice, the V2 progenitor domain gives rise to a third class of neurons called V2c, which express Sox1 and only transiently Gata3 in very early development (prior to E12.5) before later downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Panayi et al., 2010</xref>). It is unclear whether zebrafish have a homologous V2c population, although Sox1a/b is present in the 24 hpf spinal cord and notably also colabels with Gata3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrzejczuk et al., 2018</xref>). A possible V2c homolog, referred to as V2s, has been identified as a Sox1a/b+ glycinergic cell type deriving from the V2 domain with long, ipsilateral, caudally projecting axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gerber et al., 2019</xref>) similar to the V2b-gly neurons described here. However, Gata3 expression was not investigated in V2s neurons, leaving it unclear whether V2s neurons are in fact V2b-gly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gerber et al., 2019</xref>). Given the persistent, distinguishing expression of Gata3 in both V2b-gly and V2b-mixed subtypes, our data are consistent with the designation of two subclasses within V2b, not a V2c homolog or additional V2s class. Further detailed investigation of Sox1a/b gene expression in these neurons will be required to clearly separate these classes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Speed specific inputs to motor circuits</title><p>Locomotion at faster versus slower speeds engages different sets of spinal interneurons, both within a genetically defined population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McLean and Fetcho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McLean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>) and across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>). Given the observation that slow motor neurons likely receive more input from V2b-mixed neurons whereas fast motor neurons receive largely V2b-gly input, it would be of interest to explore whether the V2b subpopulations are recruited at different speeds of locomotion. An alternative prediction is that, because V2b-gly and V2b-mixed somata extend over a shared DV range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), they are both likely to be recruited at over the same range of locomotor speeds, in line with the principle that DV position dictates speed-dependent recruitment of both motor neurons and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura and Higashijima, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McLean et al., 2008</xref>). Overall the specific postsynaptic consequences of glycinergic and mixed glycinergic/GABAergic inhibition remains unresolved. We posit that the fast decay kinetics of glycine-mediated transmission generates a restricted window of inhibition onto fast motor neurons, which undergo a faster recruitment cycle than slow motor neurons. In contrast, a combination of fast glycine and slower GABA-mediated currents might be expected to offer a longer window of postsynaptic current integration in slow motor neurons. In much of the nervous system, glycine receptor-mediated currents traditionally show faster decay rates than those from GABA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Awatramani et al., 2005</xref>), including at interneuron inputs onto motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O'Brien and Berger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Russier et al., 2002</xref>); with some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dumoulin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2006</xref>). Moreover, GABA can act as a coagonist on glycine receptors and in fact shorten the postsynpatic inhibitory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). Simultaneous whole cell recordings from V2bs and motor neurons will be necessary to elucidate the postsynaptic effects of V2b-gly versus V2b-mixed inputs.</p><p>Intra-V2b connectivity suggests a possible ‘gear shift’ within the V2bs, with the V2b-gly and V2b-mixed populations potentially inhibiting each other to enforce a given speed of swim. One caveat in interpretation of these results is that despite their different somatic positions, fast and slow motor neurons have overlapping dendritic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Svara et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that V2b-mixed neurons make synapses onto all motor neurons, and differential receptor expression is responsible for their IPSC pharmacology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); meanwhile, V2b-gly might be responsible for other functions, such as suppression of dorsal horn sensory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Paired recordings or higher resolution anatomical experiments will be required to distinguish these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>V2b manipulation indicates role in speed control</title><p>One role of ipsilateral inhibition is to mediate flexor-extensor alternations via Ia reciprocal inhibition from V2b and V1 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Britz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Ipsilaterally descending propriospinal neurons may also stabilize left-right alternation, although specific ablation of inhibitory ipsilaterally descending neurons has not been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Danner et al., 2017</xref>).

From this we surmise that ipsilateral inhibition from V1 and V2b shape distinct features of locomotion. V1 neurons may act to terminate motor neuron burst cycles whereas V2b neurons may limit overall speed, much like a brake.</p><p>The exact mechanism of V2b-associated speed changes remains unclear but is unlikely to be due to direct motor neuron spike shunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One possible source of modulation is through local gating of excitatory drive on the dendrites, with V2b-mediated inhibition shunting coincident excitatory inputs during locomotion. Another possibility is that V2b neurons modulate motor circuitry via synapses onto other premotor targets, for example through V2b-V2a connectivity (M. Sengupta, data not shown), mirroring the V1 influence over motor circuitry via direct synapses onto both motor neurons and V2a intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura and Higashijima, 2019</xref>). These results point to a need for greater exploration of connectivity among spinal interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Overall role of V2b in motor circuits</title><p>What is the functional role of V2b-mediated ipsilateral inhibition onto motor circuits? Three broad categories of V2b function occur. First, as discussed above, enforcing flexor-extensor and potentially forelimb-hindlimb alternation in limbed animals. Second, as supported in this work, V2b neurons may serve to titrate excitatory drive onto motor neurons differentially across varying speeds of movement. Measuring inhibitory conductances in motor neurons in vivo has revealed, surprisingly, that inhibition in-phase with excitation actually increases for increasingly strong movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li and Moult, 2012</xref>), rather than diminishing to allow more powerful contractions. In this context, shunting ipsilateral inhibition might serve to enforce tight temporal control over spike timing via shortening membrane time constants. Surprisingly, ipsilateral inhibition does not appear to act as a source of gain control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Thirdly, ipsilateral inhibition may act to isolate movements in certain behaviors that engage dedicated premotor circuitry, for example through the selective inhibition of interneurons during scratching versus swimming in turtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berkowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Berkowitz, 2007</xref>). Some V2b neurons, by virtue of their direct connections with ipsilateral motor circuits, could form part of the locomotor ‘switch’ from one behavior to another. A thorough investigation of V2b-gly and V2b-mixed recruitment during natural behaviors, such as speed transitions, turning, or balance, will allow us to better understand the similar or distinct ways that V2b subclasses influence locomotion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gata3:loxP-DsRed-loxP:GFP</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">ZFIN ID: ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-190724–1</td><td valign="top">BAC line generation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gata3:Gal4</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">ZFIN: ZDB-TG <break/>CONSTRCT-190724–2</td><td valign="top">BAC line generation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gata3:ZipACR-YFP</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">ZFIN: ZDB-ALT-190813-3</td><td valign="top">CRISPR knock-in</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Gad1b:GFP</italic></td><td valign="top"> <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Satou et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top">ZFIN: ZDB-ALT-131127–6</td><td valign="top">BAC line generation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>glyt2:loxP-DsRed-loxP:GFP</italic></td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kimura et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td valign="top">ZFIN: ZDB-FISH <break/>-150901–22721</td><td valign="top">CRISPR knock-in</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS:CatCh</italic></td><td valign="top">McLean lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall and McLean, 2014</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Plasmid and Tol-2 mediated DNA insertion</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">WinWCP</td><td valign="top">J.

Larvae were immobilized with 0.1% α-bungarotoxin and fixed to a Sylgard lined petri dish with custom-sharpened tungsten pins. One muscle segment overlaying the spinal cord was removed at the mid-body level (segments 9–13). The larva was then transferred to a microscope (Scientifica SliceScope Pro or Nikon Eclipse) equipped with infrared differential interference contrast optics, epifluorescence, and immersion objectives (Olympus: 40X, 0.8 NA; Nikon: 60X, 1.0 NA). The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 134 NaCl, 2.9 KCl, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Osmolarity was adjusted to ~295 mOsm and pH to 7.5.</p><p>Patch pipettes (5–15 MΩ) were filled with internal solution for current clamp composed of (in mM): 125 K gluconate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP; for voltage clamp, 122 cesium methanesulfonate, one tetraethylammonium-Cl, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 QX-314 Cl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP. Additionally, Alexa Fluor 568 or 647 hydrazide 0.05–0.1 mM, or Sulforhodamine 0.02% was included. Osmolarity was adjusted to ~285 mOsm and KOH or CsOH, respectively was used to bring the pH to 7.5. Peripheral nerve recordings were made with flame polished pipettes with a ~ 30–50 μm diameter tip, filled with bath solution. Patch recordings were made in whole-cell configuration using a Multiclamp 700B, filtered at 10 kHz (current clamp) or 2 kHz (voltage clamp.) Peripheral nerve activity was recorded in fixed current configuration, signal was processed with 100x gain with 200 Hz and 2 kHz filtering. All recordings were digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1440 or 1550 (Molecular Devices) and acquired with WinWCP (J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde) or pCLAMP 10 (Molecular Devices).</p><p>The <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> line labels both V2b and Kolmer-Agduhr/cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs). To ensure that evoked IPSCs derived from presynaptic V2bs rather than CSF-cNs, epifluorescent illumination was targeted 3–7 segments rostral to the recorded segment. A Polygon400 Digital Micromirror Device (Mightex) was used to provide patterned illumination in indicated recordings. Previous studies found that CSF-cNs have short ascending axons and do not contact any motor neurons besides the caudal primary (CaP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hubbard et al., 2016</xref>). CatCh expression in the <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> line is variegated, with some animals showing strong CatCh expression throughout both CSF-cNs and V2bs, and others showing good expression in CSF-cNs and minimal expression in V2b cells. Additional control experiments were performed in animals with minimal V2b label to demonstrate the absence of contribution of CSF-cN synapses in these experiments. Strychnine and gabazine (SR-95531) were applied at 10 µM.</p><p>In current clamp experiments examining V2b effects on motor neuron firing, 30 ms depolarizing current steps were delivered to motor neurons in increasing amplitude steps (primary motor neurons: 25 pA steps; secondary motor neurons: 5–25 pA steps), alternating between delivery with and without V2b activation targeted 3–5 segments rostral to the recording. V2b neurons were activated with a 10–20 ms pulse of blue light, delivered either via epifluorescence of via the Polygon DMD, as above, that initiated 10 ms prior to the onset of the depolarizing step in order to maximize the peak of V2b inhibition during the current step. At resting membrane potentials, a modest (1–5 mV) non-specific depolarizing current was often seen in response to this optogenetic stimulation; it was insensitive to strychnine, gabazine, and two blockers of serotonergic receptors (cyproheptadine and mianserin, both at 1 µM; data not shown), and therefore seems likely to arise from gap junctional networks of unclear identity. To prevent this from interfering with recordings, small squares of illumination were delivered via DMD to target just V2b neurons, or epifluorescence apertures were narrowed to the smallest possible, minimizing the depolarizing current. As a positive control for the efficacy of this protocol in driving V2b-mediated inhibition, we found that spiking in V2a neurons was significantly reduced by V2b optogenetic activation (data not shown), indicating that the absence of effect on motor neuron spiking was not due to a failure of V2b activation.</p><p>Motor neurons were identified by axon fill that extended into the musculature and/or by retrograde dye labeling from the muscle. For retrograde labeling, 4 dpf larvae were anesthetized (0.02% MS-222) and laid flat on an agarose plate. A Narishige micromanipulator in conjunction with a microinjection pump (WPI, Pneumatic Picopump) was used to deliver small volumes of dye (Alexa Fluor 568 dextran, 3000 MW) via glass pipette into the muscle. Fish recovered in regular system water and were subsequently used for recordings at 5–6 dpf.</p><p>Data were imported into Igor Pro using NeuroMatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>). Spike threshold was defined as 10 V/s, and custom code was written to determine spike width and afterhyperpolarization of the initial spike elicited by pulse steps, code available on Github (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bagnall-lab, 2019a</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/V2b_paper_igor_code">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/V2b_paper_igor_code</ext-link>). Input resistance was calculated by an average of small hyperpolarizing pulses. To isolate IPSCs, 10 µm NBQX was present in the bath and neurons were voltage clamped at the EPSC reversal potential.</p><p>Motor neurons at the dorsal extent of the distribution (&gt;50% of distance from bottom of spinal cord to top) exhibited lower input resistances (mean ± SD: 287 ± 75 MΩ) and were considered ‘fast’ and the remainder, which exhibited higher input resistances (885 ± 367 MΩ) considered ‘slow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLean et al., 2007</xref>).

Igor Pro 6 was utilized for data analysis and statistics unless otherwise noted. V2b cell counts and neurotransmitter coexpression was quantified manually by two researchers (R.C. and M.J.); no significant differences in quantification were detected. Gata3+ V2b cells were identified and marked (ImageJ Cell Counter) relative to spinal cord and segment boundaries, giving total V2b/segment quantities. Subsequently, each cell was evaluated for expression of fluorescent proteins marking Gad1b or Glyt2.</p><p>Transgenic line validation was performed with in situ hybridization and quantified by two researchers (M.B. and R.C.) with no significant discrepancy in results. A ~ 3–5 μm z-stack projection was made in a cell-dense area of spinal cord spanning two to three segments for each animal. ROIs of neurons were drawn in one channel before checking whether there was colocalization in the other channel. Samples were quantified twice: once for completeness (percentage of endogenous RNA positive neurons also expressing the transgene) and once for accuracy (percentage of transgene labeled neurons positive for endogenous RNA). 3–7 animals were evaluated in each line.</p><p>For axon tracing, stitched projection images were made with the Pairwise stitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>) ImageJ plugin. The overlap of the fused image was smoothed with linear blending and was registered based on the fill channel or the average of all channels. Photoconversion cell fill images underwent an extra processing step in which the bleached green channel was subtracted from the photoconverted red channel. The Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Longair et al., 2011</xref>) was used to trace the axon projection and branching relative to marked spinal cord boundaries.

The Weka Trainable Segmentation plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>) was used to segment the motor neuron image into three classifiers; somata, axons exiting the spinal cord, and dendrites. Classification was based on Hessian training features. Training was performed iteratively for each image. The binary segmented images were applied to mask all non-dendrite fluorescence (n = 4 hemisegments/animal; n = 3 animals.) Fluorescence was maximum intensity projected in the z-dimension, collapsed along the horizontal plane and normalized to give an estimate of motor neuron dendrite density in the dorsoventral plane of the spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>NMDA-induced behavior and ZipACR optogenetic supression</title><p>5 dpf <italic>Tg(gata3:zipACR-YFP)</italic> animals and clutchmates were anesthetized in 0.02% MS-222 and placed on an agar plate under a dissecting microscope. A complete spinal cord transection was made with Vannas spring microscissors, plus a sharpened pin if necessary, between spinal cord segments 2 and 5. Tail blood flow was monitored post-transection and throughout the preparation; animals with significantly reduced blood flow were euthanized and not used for recordings. After transection the animal briefly recovered in extracellular solution and then was embedded in a dorsal up position in 1.2% low melting point agarose. Solidified agarose surrounding the tail caudal to the transection was removed with a dissection scalpel. 200 μM NMDA (Sigma Aldrich) in extracellular solution was added to the dish. Recordings were initiated after tail movement began, typically 2–10 min later.</p><p>Behavior experiments were performed with a Scientifica SliceScope upright microscope equipped with a Fastec HiSpec1 camera and an Olympus Plan N 4x/0.10 objective. Image collection was made with Fastec acquisition software. Images were acquired at 200 Hz for 5 s. Optical stimulation was made with 100% intensity full field epi-illumination from a CoolLED pe300ultra source routed through a GFP filter cube (Chroma 49002). Recordings with optical stimulation were alternated with recordings without stimulation; n = 6–17 recordings for each animal.</p><p>Analysis was run in MATLAB R2017a with custom code adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Severi et al.

The caudal edge of the transection and the tail periphery were manually selected as tail boundaries and 10 points for tracking were evenly distributed along the body. The caudal-most tail point was used to calculate tail speed (mm/s) at each frame of the recordings. A tail speed threshold of 0.5 mm/s was used to distinguish true movement from tail drift. Tail movement amplitude was calculated as the maximum tail displacement in the initial second of each recording. Tail beat frequency was computed from left-to-right tail oscillations during manually identified movement bouts; 6–30 consecutive peaks were averaged for each recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Evoked swim with optogenetic activation</title><p>5–6 dpf <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic> and sibling animals were paralyzed and pinned to Sylgard dishes with three sharpened Tungsten pins. 3–4 segments of skin were removed and the recording electrode was placed on the body near the intermyotomal cleft. Swim was induced with a bipolar Tungsten electrode placed on an intact portion of skin ~5 segments caudal to the recording site with an empirically determined stimulation level set to reliably evoke swims (5–50 V). Optogenetic stimulation was made with epifluorescent light through standard filter cubes and a 40x objective at 5% light intensity with 20 ms on/off light cycles under the following conditions: no light, GFP excitation, and RFP excitation. Electical stimulation occured 100 ms post light stimulation. Trials in which the animal initiated swim prior to the electrical stimulation were excluded from analysis. Optical stimulation was made 3–5 segments rostral and 3–5 segments caudal to the peripheral motor recording to assess the contributions of descending (V2b) and ascending (CSF-cN) inhibition to the motor activity. Each recording paradigm was repeated for 16–32 trials. Peripheral motor nerve signal was rectified and inter-beat interval frequencies were manually tabulated in Matlab by experimenter blind to treatment conditions. Trial averages are reported for each recording condition in each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Resource sharing</title><p>Transgenic fish lines generated in this work are available from the authors upon request.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Claire Wyart as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marco Beato (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Callahan et al. present evidence that in the zebrafish larval spinal cord spinal V2b inhibitory interneurons control locomotor speed. This is a very exciting finding as V2b are ipsilateral, descending, and inhibitory interneurons. This finding, along with the recent publication on V1 neurons involved in enhancing speed (Kimura and Higashijima, 2019), provide more evidence that speed control is distributed across many interneurons in the spinal cord and not only restricted to excitatory interneurons.</p><p>Their approach relies on novel BAC transgenic lines where gata3 drives the expression in V2b neurons, together with cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs, ipsilateral ascending neurons originating from p3 and pMN). However, since in contrast, CSF-cNs innately increase locomotor speed during the escape (Bohm et al., 2016), the increase in locomotor speed observed when suppressing activity of V2b and CSF-cNs together should be due to V2b intrinsically reducing locomotor speed.</p><p>Furthermore, the manuscript provides proof of anatomical segregation of the axons of two distinct classes of V2b interneurons, one purely glycinergic and one with mixed GABAergic-Glycinergic phenotype and indicates some novel rules of connectivity, with fast MNs receiving mostly glycinergic inhibition and slow motoneurons receiving mixed inhibitory input. Optogenetic silencing of both classes of V2b neurons results in increased tail beat frequency, leading to the hypothesis that V2b neurons might have a role in controlling locomotor speed. The methodology is sound, all results are clearly represented and the major findings are fully supported by the data. While a role of V2b interneurons in controlling the speed might not come as a complete surprise, the authors give a first functional proof of direct connectivity of V2b and motoneurons, as well as (rather more surprisingly) of connectivity between V2b interneurons themselves.</p><p>As raised by two of the reviewers, the ultimate goal would be to be able to activate/silence the two classes of V2b separately, as well as establishing their rules of connectivity between themselves. Such experiments would require complex intersectional genetics, which would take time and therefore would be better suited for a separate study.</p><p>V2b interneurons appear to act as a break on the central pattern generator (CPG), but it is not clear how they do so. In order to specify the underlying mechanisms, it would be interesting to add to this study two experiments that should be doable in two months:</p><p>1) Optogenetic activation of V2b using an excitatory opsin in the <italic>Tg(gata3:gal4)</italic> line during locomotion to test whether it would slow down locomotion:</p><p>While the authors show the neat result of increased tail beat frequency upon silencing of V2b interneurons, they do not show what happens when such interneurons are activated during tail beat. This would be a relatively simple experiment to perform and would add some information on the potential function of V2b interneurons.</p><p>2) Recordings of MNs in V-Clamp and C-Clamp with optogenetic control of V2b to elicit single spike in order to resolve the properties of the V2b-MN synapses and test how gaba+ versus gaba- V2b firing impact the firing of slow versus fast MNs:</p><p>By increasing the selectivity of the light stimulation to single neuron/single spike (using short pulses of 5ms instead of 20-50ms as previously done), the authors could calibrate the light to get 'unitary' responses in motoneurons, evoke firing in motoneurons (by current injection) and see how activation of one or a group of V2b would alter the firing. Following that, the authors could verify whether the input is mixed or purely glycinergic (and onto fast or slow motoneurons). This should be quite elegant, informative and not too complicated.</p><p>With these two experiments added, this study should lay solid basis for future studies aimed at understanding how the differential connectivity onto fast and slow motoneurons of mixed and pure glycinergic V2b interneurons might affect the function of the locomotor network. The finding of a recurrent disinhibitory loop between V2bs raises interesting possibility of complex interactions and modulations within the premotor network.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) All V2b are glycinergic but some are also GABAergic – overall slightly more ventral with more ventral projections. This mixed neurotransmitter release should slow down IPSCs on their targets. Accordingly, there is a correlate with the projection from V2b onto slow and fast types of MNs. How does the fast glycinergic inhibition impact the firing of fast motoneurons? and reciprocally the slow GABAergic inhibition the firing of slow motoneurons? By doing so, can the authors speculate on how these ipsilateral ascending neurons can slow down the rhythm?</p><p>2) Summary:</p><p>Specify more how V2b project onto different motoneuron (MN) types (&quot;differential targeting to slower and faster circuits&quot;). It would be nice to go further by presenting how the projections and neurotransmitter types together with circuit disinhibition can enable the modulation of speed observed.</p><p>3) Figure 1B: What are the ventral-most cells in this panel (2-3 per segment)? They appear in the V3 domain but do not look like CSF-cNs on the image, could V3 or V2c interneurons also be in the line?</p><p>4) Filled cells in Figure 4 refer to segments 14-18. However, according to the data in Figure 1E, those are among the shortest axon (shorter that the 10-11 group), so I am wondering whether the same neat dorsoventral separation is also seen in higher level segments, especially for the V2b with longest axons (segments 10-11, judging from Figure 1E).</p><p>5) Figure 4, use same Y-scale for F,G and H.</p><p>6) Please report concentrations of strychnine and gabazine. None of the two drugs is selective. While there is no doubt on the qualitative results of Figure 5, knowing the concentrations would allow to judge them quantitatively. Also, how was the extent of block measured? The text reports conductances, so I would assume that the peak was measured. However, since the responses in Figure 5 and 6 originate from multiple spikes in multiple pre-synaptic neurons, the integral of the trace might be more appropriate.</p><p>7) Figure 7: Light activation seems to depolarize the cell (opposite to what shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2). It is highly possible that chloride gradients vary among cells and that minor change in resting potential could change the effect. Is the difference observed between Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 coming from different resting potentials in the two cells shown? In both cases the increased anion conductance causes a large shunt, so there is no doubt about the silencing of neurons. Still, it would be better to have a label with the resting membrane potential.</p><p>8) The spikes represented in Figures 6E and 7B are rather small (10-15 mV amplitude). Overall, it seems that action potentials in V2b interneurons do not have a classical shape, while AP in CSF-cN neurons recorded in the same conditions do (Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Are these representative recordings? Is it a specific feature of these neurons? Can you comment on that?</p><p>9) Introduction, paragraph two: the statement that premotor neurons only belong to five superclasses is not 100% correct. Of the 10 subfamily, at least Di3 have been shown to contact motoneurons (Bui et al., 2013).</p><p>10) Consider moving the 'in situ hybridization' section, table and figure to the Materials and methods or supplementary information. It is a necessary control, but interrupts the flow of information while reading the paper.</p><p>11) Results, second paragraph, and Figure 1: I was wondering whether illustrating the position of the soma of V2b interneurons with a coronal view would be more readable. Indeed, I found the use of false color depth-coded image in panel B difficult to read. Is the red background corresponding to the other half of the spinal cord? Because the color scale states L to R (supposedly left to right), while in the text it is written from medial to lateral. Showing a projection for a full segment for example on a coronal slice would help the reader.</p><p>12) Subsection “Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons”: would it be possible to provide data showing the expression of both GABA and glycine in the same neuron? Are purely GABAergic neurons existing? What is the functional consequences of having a co-release of GABA and glycine?</p><p>13) Figure 7: the panel E is not easy to read and as such does not provide any obvious info. Is this panel really necessary?</p><p>14) Please correct the opening sentence in subsection “V2b axons extend throughout the spinal cord” (probably a mix between two version of the same sentence).</p><p>15) Paragraph three subsection “Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons”: please correct sunclasses</p><p>16) Subsection “Axonal morphology varies by subpopulation identity”: please define VeLD (this is done in the Discussion but not here)</p><p>17) Figure 6—figure supplement 2: panel A the time scale on top might be wrong as the stim duration is 20ms while the scale indicates 0.4 sec?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47837.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In the original manuscript, we suppressed V2b activity and saw that locomotion sped up; reviewers suggested activating V2b neurons as a complementary experiment. We carried out this experiment using optogenetic activation of V2b neurons in a fictive swim preparation and indeed, saw that locomotion slowed down. These new data, along with several controls to address possible confounding influences, are now shown in revised Figure 7. This result significantly supports our conclusion that V2b neurons can serve as a “brake” on locomotor activity.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we used voltage clamp to show that V2b neurons evoked IPSCs in fast and slow motor neurons; reviewers suggested evaluating the effects on motor neuron spiking in current clamp. We carried out these experiments by pairing short depolarizing steps in motor neurons with optogenetic activation of V2b neurons and were rather surprised by the result: on average, there was no effect on threshold or evoked spiking. We did see some motor neurons (3/14 fast motor neurons) with a clear increase in threshold and rightward shift of the input-firing curve, but on average there was no effect. We show these new data in Figure 4F and speculate that V2b-mediated IPSCs may occur on the dendrites, in line with anatomical data about the axon position in the white matter, and therefore might affect dendritic integration but not somatically-evoked firing. We also mention in the Discussion that it is possible the behavioral effects of V2b manipulation are partially or primarily mediated through inhibitory effects onto other spinal neurons, such as the V2a class (for which we have preliminary evidence, described in Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>V2b interneurons appear to act as a break on the central pattern generator (CPG), but it is not clear how they do so. In order to specify the underlying mechanisms, it would be interesting to add to this study two experiments that should be doable in two months:</p><p>1) Optogenetic activation of V2b using an excitatory opsin in the Tg(gata3:gal4) line during locomotion to test whether it would slow down locomotion:</p><p>While the authors show the neat result of increased tail beat frequency upon silencing of V2b interneurons, they do not show what happens when such interneurons are activated during tail beat. This would be a relatively simple experiment to perform and would add some information on the potential function of V2b interneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now carried out this experiment, and indeed activation of V2b neurons slows locomotion, consistent with the notion that they serve at least in part as a brake. These new results are shown in revised Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Recordings of MNs in V-Clamp and C-Clamp with optogenetic control of V2b to elicit single spike in order to resolve the properties of the V2b-MN synapses and test how gaba+ versus gaba- V2b firing impact the firing of slow versus fast MNs:</p><p>By increasing the selectivity of the light stimulation to single neuron/single spike (using short pulses of 5ms instead of 20-50ms as previously done), the authors could calibrate the light to get 'unitary' responses in motoneurons, evoke firing in motoneurons (by current injection) and see how activation of one or a group of V2b would alter the firing. Following that, the authors could verify whether the input is mixed or purely glycinergic (and onto fast or slow motoneurons). This should be quite elegant, informative and not too complicated.</p><p>With these two experiments added, this study should lay solid basis for future studies aimed at understanding how the differential connectivity onto fast and slow motoneurons of mixed and pure glycinergic V2b interneurons might affect the function of the locomotor network. The finding of a recurrent disinhibitory loop between V2bs raises interesting possibility of complex interactions and modulations within the premotor network.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) All V2b are glycinergic but some are also GABAergic – overall slightly more ventral with more ventral projections. This mixed neurotransmitter release should slow down IPSCs on their targets. Accordingly, there is a correlate with the projection from V2b onto slow and fast types of MNs. How does the fast glycinergic inhibition impact the firing of fast motoneurons? and reciprocally the slow GABAergic inhibition the firing of slow motoneurons? By doing so, can the authors speculate on how these ipsilateral ascending neurons can slow down the rhythm?</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out this experiment as requested, and interestingly do not see on average any effect of V2b-mediated inhibition on somatically-evoked spiking. These results, which may reflect dendritically positioned V2b-MN synapses, are shown in Figure 4F. We speculate that dendritic integration in motor neurons may be affected by V2b inhibition, and/or that the major effects of V2b on the circuit are mediated through influence on V2a neurons (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Summary:</p><p>Specify more how V2b project onto different motoneuron (MN) types (&quot;differential targeting to slower and faster circuits&quot;). It would be nice to go further by presenting how the projections and neurotransmitter types together with circuit disinhibition can enable the modulation of speed observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed the question of glycinergic vs. GABAergic kinetics of inhibition in the Discussion. We think there are two plausible hypotheses: (1) Since glycinergic kinetics are typically faster than GABAergic, glycinergic targeting to fast MNs may be “matched” to the faster membrane time constants and oscillations that these neurons must produce, and vice versa with GABA; or (2) Since V2b-gly and V2b-mixed somata occupy roughly the same dorsal-ventral territory, and DV soma position is highly correlated with swim speed recruitment in other zebrafish spinal neurons (e.g. McLean et al., 2007), both the V2b-gly and V2b-mixed subtypes are recruited for a range of swim speeds. Clearly these interesting and conflicting hypotheses will be tested with future experiments!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1B: What are the ventral-most cells in this panel (2-3 per segment)? They appear in the V3 domain but do not look like CSF-cNs on the image, could V3 or V2c interneurons also be in the line?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these additional ventrally positioned cells. We have now anatomically identified them as intraspinal serotonergic neurons (ISN), using a cell fill approach shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 2. We have also added text to further describe them in subsection “Gata3 transgenic lines label V2b neurons” paragraph two as well as in a supplementary text section; additionally, they are now identified in Figure 1. Given their presence in <italic>Tg(gata3:ZipACR-YFP)</italic> and <italic>Tg(gata3:loxP-dsRed-loxP:GFP)</italic> animals (though not <italic>Tg(gata3:Gal4; UAS:CatCh)</italic>) we were initially concerned about any influence that ISN activation may have on the behavioral experiments. However, published work on ISN activation and bath serotonin application demonstrated that serotonin has no influence over tail beat frequency in larval zebrafish, and thus is unlikely to skew our behavioral results showing V2b’s influence over tail beat patterning. We further confirmed this absence of effect with Jacob Montgomery and Mark Masino, who have recently published on ISN in larval zebrafish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Filled cells in Figure 4 refer to segments 14-18. However, according to the data in Figure 1E, those are among the shortest axon (shorter that the 10-11 group), so I am wondering whether the same neat dorsoventral separation is also seen in higher level segments, especially for the V2b with longest axons (segments 10-11, judging from Figure 1E).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment; it illustrates a need for clarity in the presentation of our data in Figure 1E. In this figure, we found that cells originating in segments 10-11 extend axons that are statistically longer than those originating in segments 1-3 and segments 20 through the caudal end of the spinal cord. We have adjusted the description to make this clearer in paragraph two of subsection “V2b axons extend throughout the spinal cord”. However, the point you make regarding whether the DV relationship persists along the extent of the spinal cord is intriguing. We did observe axon trajectories similar to both the V2b-gly and V2b-mixed pathways, i.e. dorsally and ventrally positioned respectively, from Kaede photoconversions which were carried out along the full rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord. However, we don’t have neurotransmitter identity from those experiments (because Kaede occupies both green and red fluorescence channels) so can’t state with confidence that these correspond to the V2b-gly and -mixed subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4, use same Y-scale for F,G and H.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4 has been modified as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please report concentrations of strychnine and gabazine. None of the two drugs is selective. While there is no doubt on the qualitative results of Figure 5, knowing the concentrations would allow to judge them quantitatively. Also, how was the extent of block measured? The text reports conductances, so I would assume that the peak was measured. However, since the responses in Figure 5 and 6 originate from multiple spikes in multiple pre-synaptic neurons, the integral of the trace might be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Concentrations are now reported in Materials and methods subsection “Electrophysiology” (10 µM for each). Regarding quantification of the block, we saw similar results both with peak and integral measurements, but the integral of the trace yielded more variable results depending on the duration of the integration window. However, the results holds up regardless of the choice of integral duration, and we now report the results from a 100 ms window in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 7: Light activation seems to depolarize the cell (opposite to what shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2). It is highly possible that chloride gradients vary among cells and that minor change in resting potential could change the effect. Is the difference observed between Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 coming from different resting potentials in the two cells shown? In both cases the increased anion conductance causes a large shunt, so there is no doubt about the silencing of neurons. Still, it would be better to have a label with the resting membrane potential.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point; the reviewer is correct that this cell happened to be resting quite hyperpolarized, so that the chloride conductance was depolarizing (though shunting). We have added membrane potential labels as suggested, but we also replaced that example neuron with another that was resting closer to Erev(Cl) to reduce confusion among less experienced readers of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The spikes represented in Figures 6E and 7B are rather small (10-15 mV amplitude). Overall, it seems that action potentials in V2b interneurons do not have a classical shape, while AP in CSF-cN neurons recorded in the same conditions do (Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Are these representative recordings? Is it a specific feature of these neurons? Can you comment on that?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is an interesting observation. In some classes of zebrafish spinal neurons it is quite common (e.g. V1 neurons), and the likely explanation is that it occurs due to spike generation happening down the axon, at some electronic distance from the soma. We have now commented on this and referenced recordings with similar spike properties (subsection “V2b cell physiology does not distinguish between subtypes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Introduction, paragraph two: the statement that premotor neurons only belong to five superclasses is not 100% correct. Of the 10 subfamily, at least Di3 have been shown to contact motoneurons (Bui et al., 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comment regarding this oversight, the text in paragraph two has been modified and the citation included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Consider moving the 'in situ hybridization' section, table and figure to the Materials and methods or supplementary information. It is a necessary control, but interrupts the flow of information while reading the paper</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed; now the transgenic line validation text and figure have been moved to the supplementary information and is referenced in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Results, second paragraph, and Figure 1: I was wondering whether illustrating the position of the soma of V2b interneurons with a coronal view would be more readable. Indeed, I found the use of false color depth-coded image in panel B difficult to read. Is the red background corresponding to the other half of the spinal cord? Because the color scale states L to R (supposedly left to right), while in the text it is written from medial to lateral. Showing a projection for a full segment for example on a coronal slice would help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a helpful suggestion and we have removed the false color image and included a z-projection image of a single hemisegment in Figure 1 instead. This looks much cleaner and allows for straightforward labeling of the CSF-cN and ISN neurons. The soma mediolateral position is not important to any points we make in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons”: would it be possible to provide data showing the expression of both GABA and glycine in the same neuron? Are purely GABAergic neurons existing? What is the functional consequences of having a co-release of GABA and glycine?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. Unfortunately, the genetically encoded fluorescent reporters available to us limit our ability to show three color in-vivo images of Gad1b, Glyt2, and Gata3, and thus we have relied on cell counts and distributions to estimate neurotransmitter expression. However, the reviewer is completely justified in wondering whether V2b-GABA neurons exist. To the best of our ability we can only state the possibility that V2b-GABA exist, and if so at substantially smaller quantities than the V2b-gly and V2b-mixed populations. We have included a comment about this in the text in paragraph two of subsection “Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 7: the panel E is not easy to read and as such does not provide any obvious info. Is this panel really necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this panel for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Please correct the opening sentence in subsection “V2b axons extend throughout the spinal cord” (probably a mix between two version of the same sentence).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this typo, we have corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Paragraph three subsection “Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons”: please correct sunclasses.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection “Axonal morphology varies by subpopulation identity”: please define VeLD (this is done in the Discussion but not here).</p></disp-quote><p>A definition has been added at the first mention of VeLDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Figure 6—figure supplement 2: panel A the time scale on top might be wrong as the stim duration is 20ms while the scale indicates 0.4 sec?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this mistake; we have changed the figure accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
