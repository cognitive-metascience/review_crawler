persistently active PKC isoform proposed to maintain late-LTP and long-term memory. But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKMζ in PKMζ-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKMζ is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKMζ is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKMζ-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKMζ persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKCι/λ, a gene-product closely related to PKMζ, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKMζ-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKMζ-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKMζ-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKCι/λ-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKMζ-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKMζ is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKCι/λ activation compensates for PKMζ loss in PKMζ-null mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14846.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14846.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14846.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How are long-term memories stored in the brain? The formation of memories is believed to depend on the strengthening of connections between neurons. During learning, neurons produce an enzyme called PKMzeta (or PKMζ), which is thought to be responsible for maintaining the newly strengthened connections. Inhibitors of PKMzeta, such as a drug called ZIP, disrupt long-term memories. This suggests that the brain may be like a computer hard disc in that its stored information — its memories — could be erased.</p><p>However, recent experiments on genetically engineered mice have thrown the role of PKMzeta into question. Knockout mice that lack the gene for PKMzeta can still strengthen connections between neurons and can still learn and remember. Moreover, ZIP still works to reverse the strengthening and to erase long-term memories. This indicates that ZIP can act on something other than the PKMzeta enzyme. These results have led many neuroscientists to doubt that PKMzeta has anything to do with memory.</p><p>Yet there are two possible explanations for the normal memory in PKMzeta knockout mice. First, PKMzeta is not required for memory, so getting rid of it has no effect. Second, PKMzeta is essential for long-term memory in <italic>normal</italic> mice. However, knockout mice recruit a back-up mechanism for long-term memory storage, which is also sensitive to the effects of ZIP.</p><p>To test these possibilities, Tsokas et al. used a modified piece of DNA that prevents neurons with the gene for PKMzeta from producing the enzyme. The DNA blocked memory formation in normal mice, consistent with a role for PKMzeta in memory. However, it had no effect in knockout mice — the DNA had nothing to work on. This suggests that another molecule does indeed act as a back-up for PKMzeta in these animals. Further experiments revealed that an enzyme closely related to PKMzeta, called PKCiota/lambda (PKCι/λ), substitutes for PKMzeta during memory storage in the knockout mice.</p><p>These findings restore PKMzeta to its early promise. They show that PKMzeta is crucial for long-term memory in normal mice, but that something as important as memory storage has a back-up mechanism should PKMzeta fail. Future work may reveal when and how this back-up becomes engaged.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14846.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14846.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>atypical PKC</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>PKM-zeta</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>PKMzeta</kwd><kwd>PKCiota/lambda</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 MH057068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacktor</surname><given-names>Todd Charlton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH53576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacktor</surname><given-names>Todd Charlton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA034970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shouval</surname><given-names>Harel Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Sacktor</surname><given-names>Todd Charlton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lightfighter Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacktor</surname><given-names>Todd Charlton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH084038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>André Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH099128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>André Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG043688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>André Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1146822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>André Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enzyme PKMzeta is crucial for the maintenance of long-term memories, but a closely related enzyme provides a back-up should PKMzeta fail, thus explaining the controversy over why deleting the gene for PKMzeta may not appear to impair memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>LTP and long-term memory can be divided into two mechanistically distinct phases—a transient induction and a persistent maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malinow et al., 1988</xref>). Induction is thought to rely solely on post-translational modifications. Maintenance requires new protein synthesis soon after strong synaptic stimulation or learning, and these newly synthesized proteins are believed to sustain the synaptic potentiation or behavioral modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</xref>). Although numerous signal transduction molecules are important for LTP and long-term memory, most have been implicated in induction, with many participating in either the initial transient potentiation or the mechanisms for upregulating new protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). In contrast, few molecules have been implicated in maintenance. Such a maintenance molecule would be both: 1) a product of de novo protein synthesis sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission and 2) a necessary component of the mechanism sustaining synaptic potentiation and long-term memory, as shown by inhibition of the molecule reversing sustained synaptic potentiation and erasing long-term memory.</p><p>One hypothesis for a molecular mechanism of maintenance involves the persistent increase in an autonomously active PKC isoform, PKMζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sacktor, 2011</xref>). LTP and long-term memory maintenance may depend upon the function of PKMζ because data suggest the kinase possesses the two essential properties of a maintenance molecule. First, PKMζ is produced in LTP by new protein synthesis and is sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission. PKMζ is generated from a PKMζ mRNA, but this mRNA is translationally repressed in the basal state of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>). During LTP, strong afferent synaptic stimulation derepresses the mRNA and rapidly increases the de novo synthesis of PKMζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>). The newly synthesized kinase, unlike most other protein kinases, is autonomously active without the requirement for second messenger stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sacktor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>), and the autonomous activity of PKMζ is sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Second, multiple inhibitors of PKMζ and a dominant-negative mutated form of PKMζ reverse established LTP maintenance or disrupt long-term memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, this proposed function of PKMζ has been challenged by new findings that LTP and long-term memory appear normal in PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the PKMζ-inhibitor ZIP, which disrupts the maintenance of LTP and long-term memory in wild-type animals, disrupts these same processes in PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Two hypotheses can account for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frankland and Josselyn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matt and Hell, 2013</xref>). First, in a straightforward hypothesis, PKMζ is unnecessary for LTP or long-term memory, and therefore genetically deleting PKMζ has no effect on these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Second, PKMζ is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the mutant mice to substitute for PKMζ, which are also inhibited by ZIP. Here, we used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between the 'PKMζ is unnecessary hypothesis' and the 'PKMζ is compensated hypothesis'.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZIP reverses late-LTP maintenance in both wild-type and PKMζ-null mice and blocks synaptic potentiation produced by PKMζ and PKCι/λ</title><p>We first confirmed the previously published findings that late-LTP appears similar in PKMζ-null and wild-type mice, and that ZIP (5 µM) applied to the bath 3 hr after tetanization reverses late-LTP in both wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>) and PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Within the first training trial both the wild-type and PKMζ-null mice learn to leave the shock zone so they only rarely receive more than 1 shock.

Post-hoc test detects that for both genotypes during pretraining with shock off, the number of shocks the mice would have received for each shock zone entrance (had the shock been on) is greater than during all the training sessions with shock on, as expected. During retention with the shock off, post-hoc test detects that the PKMζ-null animals would have received more shocks for each entrance into the shock zone than the wild-type mice. This difference is consistent with worse retention of avoidance memory in the PKMζ-null mice and may indicate that the place avoidance memory is less persistent in the PKMζ-null mice because it rapidly extinguishes (n’s = 10).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14846.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14846.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14846-fig6-figsupp1-v1"/></fig></fig-group><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-14846-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14846.017</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Inefficient place avoidance in the PKMζ-null mouse.</title><p>These videos show place avoidance behavior during the first training trial.

We used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between these hypotheses. ZIP and chelerythrine are PKMζ-inhibitors but cannot easily be used in a pharmacogenetic approach because they can block the action of both PKMζ and PKCι/λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). But when ζ- and ι/λ-selective inhibitors are examined, experiments reveal a double dissociation between the mechanisms of LTP and spatial long-term memory in PKMζ-null and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, the data indicate that the mechanisms of LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type and PKMζ-null mice are not the same, and the PKMζ is unnecessary hypothesis by which the function of PKMζ in wild-type mice can be inferred from the results obtained from PKMζ-null mice is erroneous.</p><p>To selectively block the action of PKMζ we took advantage of the specific nucleotide sequence of the PKMζ-mRNA translation start site to develop PKMζ-antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that suppress the activity-dependent de novo synthesis of PKMζ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to applications of inhibitors of PKMζ’s phosphotransferase activity that disrupt LTP and long-term memory after PKMζ has already been synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), we applied the PKMζ-antisense during the critical temporal window of new protein synthesis during late-LTP and long-term memory formation when general protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin are effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>), and when PKMζ is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osten et al., 1996</xref>). Acute application of the PKMζ-antisense suppresses the new synthesis of PKMζ and blocks late-LTP without reducing basal levels of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the crucial pool of PKMζ protein sustaining synaptic potentiation in wild-type mice is synthesized de novo in response to tetanization, rather than through the recruitment of pre-existing PKMζ that had been synthesized before the tetanus.</p><p>To examine the mechanism maintaining late-LTP in PKMζ-null mice, we focused on the kinase most closely related to PKMζ, the other ZIP-sensitive atypical PKC, PKCι/λ. We found that whereas the increase in PKCι/λ after tetanization is transient in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>), the increase in PKCι/λ persists in PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In wild-type mice, PKCι/λ is important for early-LTP, and if PKCι/λ is inhibited at the time of afferent synaptic tetanization, neither early- nor late-LTP is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, PKCι/λ-null mice, which can only be partially compensated by PKCζ, are embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seidl et al., 2013</xref>), and therefore studies of LTP using null mutations in which both atypical PKCs are completely eliminated are not feasible. Therefore, to test for a possible role of PKCι/λ in LTP maintenance, we acutely suppressed the activity of PKCι/λ after late-LTP and spatial long-term memory had been established. We used ICAP that selectively blocks PKCι/λ and not ζ kinase activities and which was developed based upon data from the crystal structure of the PKCι/λ catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pillai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2014</xref>). ICAP is designed to convert in cells to a compound that targets and binds to a docking site present in the PKCι/λ catalytic domain, but not in the very closely related PKC/PKMζ catalytic domain, thus competing for binding of substrate proteins to ι/λ and not ζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pillai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2014</xref>). The PKCι/λ-inhibitor disrupts LTP maintenance and established long-term memory in the PKMζ-null mice but not in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). But there is little information on ICAP on other kinases. Therefore, it is possible that ICAP may block the action of other molecules that may contribute to the maintenance of late-LTP and long-term memory in the PKMζ-null mice (e.g. PKCβI, which also increases in PKMζ-null mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although off-target effects of ICAP are thus possible, nonetheless, the specificity of the agent in reversing LTP and spatial memory maintenance in PKMζ-null mice and not in wild-type mice demonstrates that the mechanisms of maintenance in the two mouse genotypes are distinct and is predicted by the PKMζ-compensation hypothesis.</p><p>The effects of ICAP on LTP maintenance only in PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) are thus consistent with the effects of ZIP on LTP in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>), because ZIP blocks the synaptic potentiation produced by both atypical PKCs, PKMζ and PKCι/λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). ZIP does not block the ability of the conventional and novel PKCs to mediate synaptic potentiation, indicating selectivity of the inhibitor towards atypical PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specificity of ZIP toward atypical PKCs is further supported by evidence that ZIP’s effects on LTP reversal and memory disruption in wild-type animals are completely blocked by preventing the reversal of PKMζ’s action on AMPAR-trafficking, indicating the absence of additional, off-target effects of ZIP in brain slices or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Migues et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evuarherhe et al., 2014</xref>). These results conflict with the non-specific toxic effects of ZIP reported on in vitro cultured neurons or at high concentrations in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadeh et al., 2015</xref>). We observed, however, that ZIP causes no membrane perturbation at the lower doses used to block atypical PKCs, but not conventional/novel PKCs, and to specifically reverse potentiated, but not basal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>How PKCι/λ transforms from a transiently increasing kinase in wild-type mice into a persistently increasing kinase in PKMζ-null mice is not known, but likely involves additional compensatory mechanisms that sustain PKCι/λ’s synthesis or decrease its degradation during LTP. A possible role for new synthesis of PKCι/λ in PKMζ-null-LTP is consistent with data that a general protein synthesis inhibitor blocks the formation of late-LTP in PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest the possibility that in wild-type mice PKMζ suppresses the persistent increase of PKCι/λ and that in the PKMζ-null mice without this repression the increase of PKCι/λ is sustained. PKMζ and PKCι/λ compete for protein binding partners in developing neurons, suggesting that the loss of PKMζ may allow for increased binding of PKCι/λ to these proteins that might augment its stability and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parker et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas PKMζ-null mice produce compensatory increases in PKCι/λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the acute suppression of PKMζ synthesis by antisense does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conditional PKMζ knockdown mice, which show LTP like PKMζ-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volk et al., 2013</xref>), have not yet been examined for compensation by PKCι/λ or other molecules. Like the antisense, shRNA knockdown of PKMζ has been found not to induce compensation by PKCι/λ, and to disrupt both late-LTP and long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, further work will be required to determine when and how the loss of PKMζ induces compensation by PKCι/λ or other PKCs.</p><p>Persistently increased atypical PKC activity by either PKMζ or PKCι/λ may thus be a common molecular mechanism for maintaining late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type and PKMζ-null mice, but when the cognitive demands of memory tasks increase, differences in performance emerge. When active place avoidance is made more difficult to acquire, for the first few days of conditioning wild-type mice explore the arena to find the safest location to avoid the shock, but PKMζ-null mice avoid in the least safe position adjacent to the shock zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). After several more days of training, the PKMζ-null mice switch to the wild-type strategy, but nonetheless perform poorly compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). These differences in conditioned behavior may be a sign that the PKMζ-null mice are defective in learning and memory or in integrating information about the relative safety of multiple areas of the arena. Likewise, during unreinforced novel object placement tasks, both mice with and without PKMζ remember a single object-location association discrimination, but when the number of object location-association discriminations is increased to two, wild-type mice remember well, but PKMζ-null mice express no memory for the learned information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that some of the differences in memory expression between wild-type and PKMζ-null mice could be due to the fundamental molecular differences between PKMζ and PKCι/λ. In contrast to the second messenger-independent PKMζ, PKCι/λ can respond to second messengers that might be generated by short-term experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimoto et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, in tasks with high cognitive demand, wild-type animals that express both isoforms can use PKCι/λ and PKMζ for separate functions—PKCι/λ for encoding information about short-term experiences, and PKMζ for encoding information derived from these short-term experiences to be stored in long-term memory. But when PKCι/λ is used for both short-term memory and as a 'back-up' mechanism for long-term memory in the PKMζ-null mice, its continued responsiveness to second messengers produced by short-term experiences may interfere with its function in long-term memory. For example, during active place avoidance, when PKMζ-null mice attempt to find the safest location in an arena, information from one recently visited place might interfere with the integration of information from multiple places required for forming the optimal avoidance strategy. Likewise, in novel object placement, short-term memories of recently visited single object locations may suppress the encoding of multiple object-place associations in a single scheme. Further study of PKMζ-null mutant mice might thus reveal fundamental insights into how PKMζ encodes and stores information in long-term memory under physiological conditions in normal animals.</p><boxed-text id="B1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14846.019</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Does PKMζ play a role in maintaining long-term memories for a lifetime?</title></caption><p>The relationship between the persistent increased activity of PKMζ and the persistent changes in synaptic morphology proposed to sustain long-term memory for a lifetime is an important question for future research. The persistent action of PKMζ could function to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), which once established become independent of PKMζ. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by PKMζ inhibition in neocortex becomes resistant to this inhibition. So far, PKMζ-dependence has been tested for up to 1-3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010</xref>), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shema et al., 2009</xref>).

The slices were perfused with a recirculating volume of 5 ml superfusate containing antisense- or scrambled-oligodeoxynucleotide for 1.5 hr before tetanization and for the duration of the experiment thereafter (30 min post-tetanus for immunoblots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; 3 hr for pharmacogenetic analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>For spatial long-term memory experiments, we adapted the approach used in Garcia-Osta et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Osta et al., 2006</xref>). In preparation for stereotaxic surgery to implant the injection cannula hardware, the mice were anesthetized by a mixture of dexmedetomidine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and ketamine (28 mg/kg i.p.). The animals were mounted in a Kopf stereotaxic frame (Tujunga, CA) to implant a pair of guide cannulae with the tip above the injection target in the dorsal hippocampus (AP −1.94 mm; L ±1.00 mm; DV −0.90 mm). The injection hardware was manufactured by Plastics One, Roanoke, VA (Part Numbers: C235GS-5-2.0, C235DCs-5, 303DC/1, C235IS-5; guide cannula, cannula dummy, cannula cap, injection needle, respectively). Antisedan (0.65 mg/kg i.p.) was administered to reverse the sedation at the end of surgery.</p><p>A week after surgery, the animals received active place avoidance training. Before testing the effect of the antisense injection on place avoidance, the animals received a bilateral injection of saline (1 µl/side) and were left in the home cage to habituate to the procedure. The day after the initial pretraining exposure to the place avoidance apparatus, injections were 1 nmol oligodeoxynucleotide in 0.5 µl PBS/side, 20 min before each training session. The animals were restrained, the cannula cap and dummy removed, and the injection needle inserted into the guide cannula so that it protruded from the end of the guide by 0.5 mm. The other end of the needle was connected to a 1 µl Hamilton syringe via Tygon tubing. The oligodeoxynucleotide solution was infused for 1 min, and after the infusion the needle was left in place for 5 min before removal. The animals were returned to their home cage to recover from any acute effects of the injection and to allow diffusion of the antisense before training began. The data from 1 animal were excluded from behavioral analysis of the effects of antisense because histology revealed misplaced cannulae.</p><p>The biotinylated PKMζ-antisense (Gene Link, Hawthorne, NY) was labeled by a 5'-biotin modification with a C6 spacer. To be equivalent to the training, three biotinylated PKMζ-antisense injections with 2 hr intervals (1 nmol in 0.5 PBS μl/side) were given, and the brain fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 50 min later. The 40 μm coronal sections were stained by immunocytochemistry using mouse anti-biotin antiserum followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), counterstained with DAPI, and examined by confocal microscopy. </p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Kinase assay</title><p>PKMζ was recombinantly expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2002</xref>). PKCι/λ was purchased from ProQinase GmbH (Freiburg, Germany). The reaction mixture (50 μl final volume) contained: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 25 μM ε-peptide substrate (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV, AnaSpec, Freemont, CA), in the presence or absence of phosphatidylserine (5 μg/ml, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and PKCι/λ (184 ng, 0.2 pmol·min<sup>-1</sup>/assay) or PKMζ (4 ng, 0.2 pmol·min<sup>-1</sup>/assay), in the presence or absence of ZIP or chelerythrine at concentrations given in the figures. The reaction, initiated with the addition of 50 μM ATP (final concentration, ~1–3 μCi [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]/assay), was for 30 min at 30ºC, which is in the linear range for enzyme concentration (data not shown). The reaction in which the substrate LANCE Ultra ULight-PKC substrate TRF0108-D (50 nM, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) was substituted for ε-peptide substrate was also in the linear range for enzyme concentration (data not shown). The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 100 mM cold ATP and 100 mM EDTA, and 40 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper and counted by liquid scintillation. Activity was measured as the difference between counts incorporated in the presence and absence of enzyme. Autonomous kinase activity is defined as activity in the absence of phosphatidylserine. To assay the effect of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylation of PKCι/λ on PKCι/λ autonomous kinase activity, PDK1 (100 ng, 8 pmol·min<sup>-1</sup>·mg<sup>-1</sup>; ProQinase), either active or denatured by heating to 100°C, was added to the reaction mixture. The autonomous kinase activity of PKCι/λ was then measured as described above. PKCι/λ activity in the presence of active PDK1 was normalized to that in the presence of denatured PDK1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Active place avoidance</title><p>A commercial computer-controlled active place avoidance system was used (Bio-Signal Group, Acton, MA). The position of the mouse on a 40 cm diameter circular arena rotating at 1 rpm was determined 30 times per second by video tracking from an overhead camera (Tracker, Bio-Signal Group). All experiments used the 'Room+Arena-' task variant that challenges the mouse on the rotating arena to avoid a shock zone that was a stationary 60° sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>). A constant current foot-shock (60 Hz, 500 ms) was delivered after entering the shock zone for 500 ms and was repeated each 1500 ms until the mouse left the shock zone. The arena rotation periodically transported the animal into the shock zone, forcing it to actively avoid the location of shock. The shock amplitude was 0.2 or 0.3 mA, which was determined for each animal in the first session to be the minimum that elicited flinch or escape responses.</p><p>A clear wall made from Polyethylene Terephtalate Glycol-modified (PET-G) prevented the animal from jumping off the elevated arena surface. A 5-pole shock grid was placed on the rotating arena, the centroid of the mouse was tracked by the video tracker, and the shock was scrambled across the 5-poles when the mouse entered the shock zone.</p><p>Every 33 ms, the software determined the mouse’s position, whether it was in the shock zone, and whether to deliver shock. The time series of the tracked positions was analyzed offline (TrackAnalysis, Bio-Signal Group) to extract a number of end point measures. The time to first enter the shock zone estimates ability to avoid shock and was taken as an index of between-session memory. A pretraining habituation period on the apparatus equivalent in time to a training session, but without shock, was provided.</p><p>The training schedule for the pharmacogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) was as follows. The animals received three 30 min training trials, with an intertrial interval of 2 hr. Antisense or scrambled oligodeoxynucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was injected 20 min before each training trial, as described above. Retention testing was a 30 min trial without shock on the next day. ICAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was injected 2 hr before retention testing. The mouse trajectories depict the locations that were visited during the first 10 min, the time frame during which mice that learn the avoidance tend only rarely to enter the shock zone.</p><p>The extended training schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) was as follows. Mice were trained across a 5-day period. The animals received three 10 min training trials per day, with an intertrial interval of 1 hr. On the first day of training, animals received an additional 10 min pretraining habituation session. Retention testing was a 10 min trial without shock on the 6th day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Novelty-preference object spatial memory tests</title><p>Unreinforced hippocampus-dependent long-term memory was tested using adaptations of the object/context mismatch, the object/place mismatch, and the novel object location tests of novelty-preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mumby et al., 1999</xref>). Three open plastic boxes (42 x 42 x 20 cm) were placed at the center of the experimental room. The visual appearance of each box was unique and customized with different patterns on three of the four walls to make distinct spatial contexts, denoted A, B, and C (green, yellow, blue, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The fourth wall was transparent and faced south to provide orientation cues. Unique objects (toys, flasks, jars) were placed 5 cm away from the walls and were fixed to the floor. The apparatus, boxes, and objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol between subjects to eliminate odor cues. A video tracking system (Tracker, Bio-Signal Group, Acton, MA) monitored and recorded the exploratory activity of the animals for offline analysis.</p><p>Each day, the mice were placed in the experimental room 30 min before beginning the behavioral experiments. Each mouse was trained and tested in the object/context mismatch and the object/place mismatch tasks first, followed by the object-location task. Each task had three phases: pretraining, training, and the retention test. Pretraining (Day 1): the animals were allowed to explore each environment for 10 min with no objects present. Training (Days 2–4): the mice were allowed to explore a pair of environments, Contexts A and B, each during two 5 min trials/day, separated by a 1 hr intertrial interval. This allowed the mice to learn the spatial arrangement of the four objects in each box. Retention testing (Days 5 and 6): retention of spatial memory was evaluated on subsequent days by the object/context mismatch and the object/place mismatch tests. In the object/context mismatch test, two of the four objects from one context replace two of the objects in the other context, whereas in the object/place mismatch test, the positions of two objects were exchanged within one context. Each mouse was allowed to explore the altered environment for 3 min, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded. On day 5, an hour after the retention test, the mice received additional training (5 min exploration in contexts A and B with the original arrangement of objects). This additional training was intended to avoid extinction that could be induced by the retention test. The second retention test was on day 6, to test the mismatch task that was not tested on day 5. The order of the retention tests on days 5 and 6, the order of exposure to the boxes during training, the objects and the places were all counterbalanced between the animals and groups. Novel location test pretraining (Day 7): the mice explored the third environment, Context C, for 10 min. Novel location test training (Day 8): two objects were placed in this environment, and the mice explored for 5 min. During three 5 min training sessions, with 1 hr intertrial intervals, the mice could learn the locations of the pair of objects. Novel location retention test (Day 9): one object was relocated to a novel unoccupied place, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded. The relocated object, the location, and the specific environment were counterbalanced between animals and genotypes.</p><p>Offline analysis of the video identified exploration when the mouse’s nose was &lt;2 cm away and oriented toward the object. Memory performance was quantified using a discrimination index calculated as the absolute difference in time spent exploring the changed (i.e. incorrect, misplaced, or relocated) and the unchanged objects divided by the total time spent exploring all the objects. Good memory retention corresponds to a positive discrimination index, which reflects that the animal spent more time exploring the incorrect (object/context mismatch), displaced (object/place mismatch), or relocated (object-location) objects compared to the objects that were not changed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Sample sizes vary for the different experimental approaches (biochemistry, in vitro intracellular current and extracellular field potential physiology, and behavior). The PKMζ is unnecessary and the PKMζ is compensated hypotheses predict all-or-none effects in the experiments, and this provided a basis for sample size estimates. Power analyses were performed using G*Power Version 3.0.6 with α = 0.05 and β = 0.8 and large effect sizes of 1.5–2.0. The effect size estimates were based on prior studies that demonstrated essentially all-or-none effects of PKMζ inhibition on the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral assays used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sacktor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>). Two-population Student’s t tests were performed to compare protein levels in the PKMζ-null and wild-type mice. For LTP experiments the responses to test stimuli were averaged across 5 min for statistical comparisons. Paired Student’s t tests were used to compare the change in the potentiated response at time points at the beginning and end of drug application. Multi-factor comparisons were performed using ANOVA with repeated measures, as appropriate. The degrees of freedom for the critical t values of the t tests and the F values of the ANOVAs are reported as subscripts. Post-hoc multiple comparisons were performed by Newman-Keuls tests as appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05. Effect sizes for binary comparisons and one-way ANOVAs are reported as Cohen's d and as η<sup>2</sup> for two-way ANOVA effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>We are grateful to the late Bob Muller for his comments and dedicate this paper to his memory.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Richard Morris, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers were very supportive of the manuscript and requested only very minor revisions and clarifications. Specifically, please clarify in the revised manuscript your view of the issue raised by Reviewer 1 as their &quot;main concern&quot; and address the statistical issue raised by Reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I am so very pleased to have read this manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> as I have been following the PKMζ story closely, I am not alone in doing so, and I feel sure that a large number of people will wish to read and cite a published version of this manuscript. This is – surely – important work. My reading of the manuscript reveals some questions, which I will come to, but my sense is that the key experiments have been conducted to test the idea that PKMζ is compensated by another atypical PKC in PKMζ null mice, and that this mediates late-LTP and long term memory in such genetically modified mice. The work involves the use of a non-discriminating drug (ZIP), specific antisense molecules, and another compound that targets the compensating PKCι. And the manuscript is beautifully written and accompanied by excellent figures.</p><p>My main concern</p><p>Over 20 years, Dr Sacktor has been building a story about identifying the likely molecular mechanism of long-term memory. The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is <italic>not</italic> shared by others as a third possibility is not considered – namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly.</p><p>The key findings of the manuscript</p><p>In any event, while not sharing exactly Sacktor's perspective, I am wholly persuaded by the impressive data that his group have secured over the years to the effect that PKMζ is an important memory molecule. Unfortunately, the story was seriously dented by the publication in Nature in 2013 of two papers establishing normal LTP and normal long-term memory (LTM) in PKMζ knockout mice. These papers were widely discussed and the general 'backchat' is that they had demolished Sacktor's story. But 'backchat' is not always to be relied upon – as this manuscript now so beautifully demonstrates.</p><p>Sacktor now comes back in this manuscript with convincing evidence that a different atypical PKC, called PKCι/λ (I believe), is upregulated in the absence of PKMζ and may take over some of its functions. In PKMζ null mice, ZIP continues to be effective in reducing late-LTP but it may be that this happens because ZIP, while previously thought to be specific to PKMζ also has an effect on PKCι/λ.</p><p>The way this new body of work takes us further is by first developing, and then using, a very specific antisense molecule targeting the translation start site of PKMζ. The prediction is that this should successfully affect late-LTP in wild-type mice but not in PKMζ null mice. This prediction is upheld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and validated through appropriate biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The next step was to monitor the temporal expression of PKCι/λ after LTP induction. Nicely, it increases transiently in wild-type mice (in which the upregulation of PKMζ is of course doing the work), but it is increased for very much longer (&gt;3 hrs) in PKMζ knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The group went on to test a molecule ICAP that affects PKCι/λ selectively and establish that its application reverses late-LTP in PKMζ null mice but not in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This leaves the issue of why PKCι/λ is upregulated for longer, a point made in Discussion with sensible remarks accompanying.</p><p>Behavioural studies then become the focus with the demonstration using a place avoidance task first developed in the Czech Republic that PKMζ-antisense successfully disrupts LTM in wild-type mice but not in PKMζ null mice. Conversely, ICAP blocks LTM in PKMζ null mice in which such memory is presumed to be mediated, in part, by the compensatory PKCι/λ molecule. Last, some data are presented showing in behavioural studies that the compensation is not 'perfect' and that subtle differences in strategy can be seen between wild-type and PKMζ null mice in their initial learning of the place avoidance task when somewhat less aggressive training is deployed.</p><p>I have described the results in some detail as they seem to me to constitute a serious test of two conflicting hypotheses – as presented at the outset of manuscript – to the effect that either (1) PKMζ plays no role in long-term maintenance (Huganir), or (2) that it does so in wild-type mice, but its absence is effectively compensated in PKMζ gene knock-out mice.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I strongly recommend publication – essentially as the manuscript is written. I wondered if Sacktor should add that one reason for compensation may be because PKMζ is so important for memory that an organism cannot afford to be without the necessary mechanism if the gene were to malfunction – but perhaps that is too speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Tsokas et al. is a remarkably thorough and interesting test of the hypothesis that PKMζ, an atypical protein kinase C isoform, mediates protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP in wild type mice. The authors are responding to a finding that mice, in which PKMζ is knocked out by homologous recombination, still show late LTP and that LTP is still inhibited by an inhibitor of PKMζ termed ZIP. The authors correctly state that the latter findings support either of two hypotheses: 1. PKMζ is unnecessary for long term memory and late-phase LTP; or 2. PKMζ is essential for these processes in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the PKMζ mutant to substitute for PKMζ. They systematically show that in the hippocampus, increased synthesis of PKCι/λ compensates for the lack of PKMζ in the mutant. PKCι/λ, like PKMζ, is inhibited by ZIP, which explains the earlier results in the PKMζ KO mutant.</p><p>The authors show that bath application of phosphorothioated antisense DNA oligonucleotides that are specific for the mRNA encoding PKMζ, specifically block new synthesis of PKMζ during late-phase LTP and also block formation of late-LTP in slices from wild type mice. Scrambled antisense oligonucleotides are the control. In contrast, the PKMζ specific oligonucleotides do not block late phase LTP in slices from the PKMζ KO mutant. This experiment demonstrates that a compensatory mechanism not involving PKMζ has arisen in the mutant mice. I note that in cultured neurons, one would expect the experimenters to show rescue of late-LTP by exogenously expressed PKMζ in conjunction with endogenous anti-sense knock-down. I do not think this particular control is necessary here because it would be very difficult to carry out cleanly in slices and animals; and later experiments by the authors make it clear that the compensatory process involves higher synthesis of PKCι/λ, which they show is not blocked by the anti-sense DNA against PKMζ.</p><p>The authors then show that an inhibitor, termed ICAP, that is specific for inhibition of PKCι/λ inhibits late-LTP in PKMζ KO mutants, but does not inhibit late-LTP in wild type mice. They further show that new synthesis of PKCι/λ increases after induction of LTP in PKMζ KO mice, but does not increase in wild-type mice. These experiments, together with the catalytic similarity between PKCι/λ and PKMζ, make a strong case that PKCι/λ compensates for the loss of PKMζ in the KO mice, during late-LTP.</p><p>In a supplementary figure, the authors show the very interesting finding that an increased level of basal PKCι/λ is measurable in the hippocampus of PKMζ KO mice, but not in the contralatera hemi-brain. Thus, the role of PKCι/λ may be more prominent in hippocampus than in cortex. This finding explains the earlier report that PKCι/λ is not increased in expression in KO brains.</p><p>The authors then show that PKMζ antisense blocks retention of a spatial memory, shock-avoidance task in wild-type mice, but not in PKMζ KO mice. Thus, the compensation extends to behavioral measures. They further show that the retention is blocked in PKMζ KO mice by ICAP, but is not blocked by ICAP in wild-type mice. Finally, the authors show that certain forms of memory are not as efficient in the PKMζ KO mice as in wild-type; thus, demonstrating that the compensation by PKCι/λ is only partially effective.</p><p>My only critical comments are minor, involving clarity of the statistical measures, and are shown below.</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the most complete demonstration of a compensatory mechanism in synapses following KO of a critical component. In addition to proving that PKMζ indeed plays a necessary role in maintenance of late phase LTP, the study provides interesting insight into the precision of such mechanisms underlying behavioral memory. The authors are to be congratulated.</p><p>The statistical analyses of the authors' experiments are extensive; but are only partially explained in the Methods section.

Both reviewers were very supportive of the manuscript and requested only very minor revisions and clarifications.

Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p> <italic>My main concern Over 20 years, Dr Sacktor has been building a story about identifying the likely molecular mechanism of long-term memory. The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is not shared by others as a third possibility is not considered – namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly.</italic> The relationship between the persistent increased activity of PKMζ and the persistent changes in synaptic morphology proposed to sustain long-term memory for a lifetime is an important question for future research. The persistent action of PKMζ could act to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (Chen et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 3, e03896, 2014), which once established become independent of PKMζ. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by injections of ZIP in neocortex becomes resistant to PKMζ inhibition. So far, PKMζ-dependence has been tested for up to 3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (Sacco and Sacchetti, 329, 649-56, 2010), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (Shema et al., 16, 122-8, 2009). Future studies should examine even older memories.</p><p>The discussion of this key question on memory is highlighted in <xref ref-type="box" rid="B1">Box 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>My only critical comments are minor, involving clarity of the statistical measures, and are shown below.</italic></p><p><italic>The statistical analyses of the authors' experiments are extensive; but are only partially explained in the Methods section.
