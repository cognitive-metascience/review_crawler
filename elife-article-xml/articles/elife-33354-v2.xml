We analyzed the contribution of type I and type III interferon (IFN) using a mouse model in which the virus is selectively administered to the upper airways, mimicking a natural respiratory virus infection. Mice lacking functional IFN-λ receptors (<italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) no longer restricted virus dissemination from the upper airways to the lungs. <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice shed significantly more infectious virus particles via the nostrils and transmitted the virus much more efficiently to naïve contacts compared with wild-type mice or mice lacking functional type I IFN receptors. Prophylactic treatment with IFN-α or IFN-λ inhibited initial virus replication in all parts of the respiratory tract, but only IFN-λ conferred long-lasting antiviral protection in the upper airways and blocked virus transmission. Thus, IFN-λ has a decisive and non-redundant function in the upper airways that greatly limits transmission of respiratory viruses to naïve contacts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33354.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza (‘the flu’) and other respiratory viruses make millions of people ill every year, placing a large burden on the healthcare system and the economy. Unfortunately, few options for preventing or treating these infections currently exist.</p><p>The flu virus spreads from infected individuals, enters a new host through the nose and establishes an infection in the upper airways. If the infection stays restricted to this region of the respiratory tract – which consists of the nasal cavity, sinuses, throat and larynx – it causes a rather mild disease. However, if it spreads to the lungs it can cause potentially life-threatening viral pneumonia.</p><p>Epithelial cells line the upper respiratory tract, forming a physical border between the outside world and the human body. These cells are therefore the first to face the incoming virus. In response, the epithelial cells release messenger molecules termed interferons that warn nearby cells to increase their antiviral defenses.</p><p>There are several subtypes of interferons, such as IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ, but it was not known how each subtype helps to combat respiratory viruses. To investigate, Klinkhammer, Schnepf et al. exposed mice to flu viruses in a way that mimicked how an infection would naturally start in the upper airways in humans. Some of the mice were genetically engineered so that they could not respond to either IFN-α/β or IFN-λ.</p><p>The virus spread most effectively from the nasal cavity to the lungs in mice whose IFN-λ system was defective. Infections in mice that lacked IFN-λ were also more likely to spread to other individuals. Furthermore, treating mice with IFN-λ, but not IFN-α, gave their upper respiratory tract long-lasting protection against flu infections and prevented the spread of the virus.</p><p>IFN-λ therefore has a specific and significant role in protecting the upper airways against viruses, and could potentially be used as a drug to block the spread of infections between humans. Currently, IFN-λ is in clinical trials as a potential treatment for hepatitis D. To repurpose it for upper respiratory tract infections, its effectiveness against specific respiratory viruses will first have to be evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>respiratory tract</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF15OC0017902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research-Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11‐107588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_163129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcin</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STA 338/15–1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staeheli</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UniVacFlu</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staeheli</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interferon-λ plays a decisive and previously underestimated role in limiting the spread of respiratory viruses from the nasal cavity to the lungs and it efficiently restricts virus transmission from infected individuals to naïve contacts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza and other respiratory viruses are readily transmitted in community settings. The resulting infection chains and concomitant diseases represent an enormous economic and public health burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osterhaus et al., 2015</xref>). At present, it is largely unknown if and how the innate immune response influences virus transmission efficacy. However, a better understanding of this issue is likely to lead to new therapeutic strategies that reduce viral transmission from infected individuals to naïve contacts.</p><p>Type I and type III interferon (IFN) are virus-induced cytokines that potently restrict viral replication during the first days of infection before activation of the adaptive immune system occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazear et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wack et al., 2015</xref>). The type I IFN family consists of several IFN-α subtypes, a single IFN-β and several minor family members that all bind to and act via the IFN-α/β receptor complex (IFNAR), which is expressed on most nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazear et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wack et al., 2015</xref>) with the possible exception of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>). The members of the type III IFN family (IFN-λ) bind to a different receptor complex (IFN-λ receptor; IFNLR), which is highly expressed on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kotenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lazear et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sheppard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sommereyns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wack et al., 2015</xref>) and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blazek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broggi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses is traditionally studied in ferrets and occasionally in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier, 2015</xref>). In contrast to mice, these animals are not readily accessible to genetic manipulation, and the role of IFN and IFN-regulated host restriction factors is not easily dissected. A recent report provided evidence that the mouse represents a good alternative animal model for studying influenza virus transmission, as long as suitable virus strains are employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edenborough et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivinson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Influenza virus replication is strongly restricted by IFN-regulated <italic>Mx</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haller et al., 2015</xref>). Since most standard inbred mouse strains carry defective <italic>Mx</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haller et al., 2015</xref>), the full magnitude of influenza virus restriction by the IFN system only becomes apparent when mouse strains carrying functional <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles derived from wild mice are employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haller et al., 2015</xref>). We previously introduced defective alleles of the type I IFN receptor α chain (<italic>Ifnar1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) or the IFN-λ receptor one chain (<italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) into <italic>Mx1</italic>-competent C57BL/6 mice and thereby generated a set of mouse lines that carry functional <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles but differ in their ability to respond to type I IFN and IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mordstein et al., 2008</xref>). Using these knockout mouse strains we demonstrated that type I IFN plays a prominent role in the defense against respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus, whereas protection mediated by IFN-λ was surprisingly small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mordstein et al., 2010b</xref>). In contrast, the protective role of IFN-λ during viral infections of the small intestine was found to be far more pronounced than that of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldridge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pott et al., 2011</xref>). This suggested either that (i) the gut and the respiratory tract use fundamentally different antiviral defense strategies or (ii) IFN-λ is important in both organ systems but its beneficial role in the respiratory tract cannot be demonstrated easily due to experimental limitations.</p><p>Recent work with influenza virus-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>) indicated that IFN-λ is produced more quickly than type I IFN, suggesting that IFN-λ plays a non-redundant role in suppressing early virus growth in the respiratory tract. Nevertheless, protective effects of IFN-λ were observed only if very low infection doses were used, presumably because mice with defective <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles were employed for these studies. Furthermore, the important question whether IFN-λ might play a role in restricting transmission of respiratory viruses from infected animals to naïve contacts was not addressed.</p><p>According to standard protocols for experimental influenza virus infections, the virus is delivered intranasally to anesthetized mice in a 40–50 µl volume, allowing immediate infection of the entire respiratory tract. This experimental setup might override the natural barrier function of the nasal mucosa by allowing the infection to artificially initiate in the lower respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivinson et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we applied an infection protocol that guarantees a selective delivery of the virus inoculum to the upper respiratory tract, thus more closely mimicking the natural course of infection. Under such experimental conditions, virus transmission to naïve contacts as well as virus spread from the upper airways to the lower respiratory tract was inhibited far more efficiently by IFN-λ than by type I IFN. Interestingly, the antiviral effect induced by type I IFN in the upper airways was more transient than that of IFN-λ, while no such difference was observed in the lungs. Furthermore, a small number of epithelial cells in the proximal upper respiratory tract failed to respond sufficiently to type I IFN but did respond to IFN-λ. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the superior role of IFN-λ in the upper airways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFN-λ prevents influenza virus spread from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs</title><p>Most previous studies failed to assign a prominent role to IFN-λ in the resistance of mice against influenza and other respiratory viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mordstein et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, when we applied 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the H7N7 influenza A virus strain SC35M intranasally in a standard 40 µl volume, we noted that <italic>Mx1</italic>-competent animals carrying a defective IFN-λ receptor (<italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) supported similar virus replication in the lungs on day three post infection, compared with <italic>Mx1</italic>-competent wild-type (WT) animals. In contrast, <italic>Mx1</italic>-competent mice lacking functional type I IFN receptors (<italic>Ifnar1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) showed significantly elevated viral titers under such experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Respiratory viruses enter the human body via the upper respiratory tract, and the majority of acute respiratory viral infections in humans are confined to the upper airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotton et al., 2008</xref>). To mimic a natural infection in which virus replication initiates in the upper airways, we established an upper respiratory tract infection model in mice. Using poliovirus that is unable to infect mouse cells as an indicator we found that virus delivery can be targeted specifically to the upper respiratory tract of mice if the inoculum is applied in a volume of 10 µl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, a large proportion of the inoculum reached the lungs if the inoculum was applied in a volume of 40 µl. When a 10 µl volume was used to deliver influenza virus strain SC35M specifically to the upper respiratory tract of WT mice, the virus grew well in the upper airways, but was absent or present at only very low titers in the tracheae (3 of 22 animals) and the lungs (1 of 22 animals) on day five post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, viral titers in the upper airways were significantly higher than in WT mice and, most interestingly, many infected <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice contained high virus levels in the tracheae (11/23) and lungs (13/23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, <italic>Ifnar1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice also had significantly higher virus titers in the upper airways than WT mice, and more animals contained virus in the tracheae (5/23) and lungs (9/23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In comparison, <italic>Ifnar1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice seemed to control the virus spread from the upper airways to the lungs slightly better than <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that IFN-λ is more potent in containing viral infections within the upper respiratory tract than type I IFN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33354.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IFN-λ prevents virus spread from the upper airways to the lungs of mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Standard intranasal delivery of virus inoculum: WT (n = 6), <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (n = 4) and <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (n = 7) mice were intranasally infected with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of SC35M in a volume of 40 µl, and viral titers in the lungs were determined on day three post infection by plaque assay.

Since <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed only minimally enhanced susceptibility towards influenza viruses compared with wild-type mice in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mordstein et al., 2008</xref>), it was assumed that the contribution of IFN-λ to protection against respiratory viruses is minor and becomes detectable only when the type I IFN system is defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mordstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mordstein et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mordstein et al., 2010b</xref>) or when infections are performed with very low doses of virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>). Prior studies neglected the upper respiratory tract, where the decisive battle between invading viruses and the host defense system usually takes place. In most previous studies the inoculum was applied to the airways of the animals in a relatively large volume, which delivers the virus directly to the lungs. In this study we used an experimental setup which ensures that the virus is delivered specifically to the upper airways, thus mimicking the natural infection scenario of respiratory viruses. Our work indicates that previous studies have grossly underestimated the non-redundant antiviral potential of IFN-λ in the respiratory tract, and we demonstrate that IFN-λ is of central importance for antiviral defense of the upper airway mucosa during respiratory virus challenge. Galani et al. similarly concluded from a recent study that IFN-λ mediates non-redundant frontline protection against influenza virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>). Their work focused exclusively on the IFN-λ-mediated control of viral replication in the lungs. Although our data is compatible with the published findings, it further demonstrates that the non-redundant role of IFN-λ against respiratory viruses is far more prominent in the upper airways than in the lungs. Our results also show that IFN-λ plays a more important role than type I IFN in limiting the transmission of respiratory viruses to naïve contacts and that IFN-λ confers effective and long-lasting protection.</p><p>Our new data reveals a compartmentalization of the IFN-based antiviral defense system in the upper respiratory tract that is reminiscent to what was previously described for the intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a picture emerges which indicates that IFN-λ is essential for barrier integrity in tissues where viruses most frequently attack the host, and that the type I IFN system ramps up at these sites only after the epithelial barrier has failed to contain the virus. A likely explanation for the evolution of such functional compartmentalization is that this strategy allows shielding the body against minor viral attacks without causing a strong activation of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trinchieri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wack et al., 2015</xref>). Since IFN-λ predominantly acts on epithelial cells rather than immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sommereyns et al., 2008</xref>), it is well suited to limit viral replication at epithelial surfaces without inducing a strong inflammatory response commonly associated with type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee-Kirsch, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Different mechanisms seem to favor IFN-λ over type I IFN in the antiviral defense of the gut and the respiratory tract. Epithelial cells of the intestinal tract of adult mice express no or only very low levels of functional type I IFN receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>) and, consequently, these cells are largely blind to the protective activity of IFN-α and IFN-β. In contrast, replication of influenza and Sendai viruses was clearly inhibited in the upper airways of IFN-α-treated mice during the first days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), excluding the possibility that airway epithelial cells in general are devoid of functional type I IFN receptors. However, the IFN-α-mediated antiviral protection of the upper airways, but not the lungs, was surprisingly short-lived and IFN-α-treated and untreated animals contained comparable viral titers in the upper airways at later times post infection. Furthermore, treatment of primary AECs with IFN-α resulted in a very short-lived upregulation of ISG expression. The situation was strikingly different when IFN-λ was applied. IFN-λ treatment resulted in long-lasting ISG induction in primary AECs and sustained antiviral protection of both the lower and the upper respiratory tract in vivo. Analysis at the single cell level revealed that a small number of epithelial cells in the nasal cavity of mice remained virus-susceptible even if the animals were treated with IFN-α. Interestingly, these cells contained no detectable levels of the IFN-inducible MX1 protein, although the animals were treated with a high dose of IFN-α before virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Since the antiviral effect of IFN-α in the upper airways was poor irrespective of whether it was applied intranasally or systemically, it is unlikely that IFN-α simply failed to penetrate the mucosa of the upper airways. It remains possible that the influenza virus-susceptible cells in the upper airways of IFN-α-treated mice represent a rare specialized epithelial cell type which possesses no functional type I IFN receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>). More likely, however, these cells contain high levels of factors that inhibit type I but not type III IFN receptor signaling such as USP18, SOCS1 and SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">François-Newton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porritt and Hertzog, 2015</xref>). IFNAR1 can be rapidly internalized and degraded upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs, 2013</xref>), while no such effects were reported for the IFN-λ receptor complex. Thus, it remains possible that negative feed-back regulation of IFNAR1 expression is exceptionally strong in epithelial cells of the upper airways. It is important to note that unhindered virus replication in these rare IFN-α-unresponsive cells might initiate a second wave of virus infection in the upper airways shortly after the antiviral state induced by the IFN-α treatment has waned, which could provide an explanation for the transient antiviral effect of IFN-α in the upper airways.</p><p>Since IFN-λ exhibits selective, sustained and highly powerful antiviral activity in the upper airways that efficiently reduces morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>) as well as transmission of respiratory viruses in mice (our current work), we suggest to consider IFN-λ not only for treating diseased patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wack et al., 2015</xref>) but also for the management of respiratory virus outbreaks in community settings. According to our results, such clinical use of IFN-λ may not only improve the health status of patients with respiratory symptoms, but is also expected to strongly inhibit virus transmission from infected individuals to healthy contacts. Clinical studies indicate that the side effects of IFN-λ are minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muir et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the use of IFN-λ as prophylactic drug seems justified in health care units during epidemics with respiratory viruses as an effort to protect people who are not fully protected by vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viruses</title><p>The following influenza A virus strains were used: A/Seal/Massachusetts/1/1980 (H7N7) designated SC35M, A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) designated HK68, and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) designated Udorn.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;IFN-λ prevents influenza virus spread from the upper airways to the lungs and limits virus transmission&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study shows that IFN-λ has non-redundant antiviral effects in the upper respiratory tract, leading to a unique role in controlling virus transmission. The work presented has great merit as virus transmission is a fundamental, yet understudied, parameter in epidemic spread of influenza virus. The importance of IFN-λ in the upper airways for the control of influenza is convincingly shown using different influenza strains. The existence of cells in the URT that are refractory to type I IFN but presumably responsive to IFN-λ is of great relevance.</p><p>The use of gene-targeted mice combined with a meaningful model of virus transmission to identify IFN-λ as a crucial protective factor; the use of small-volume inoculum to mimic better infection in humans; the reconciliation of previous, apparently contradictory data obtained by higher volume infection; and a conclusive demonstration of a clear-cut non-redundant role for IFN-λ in the lung are the strengths of this study.</p><p>Moreover, the information about the timing of the different IFN responses in vivo and the effect of dosage and anatomy on the balance between virus and host response will be of great interest to experimentalists and modelers alike.</p><p>The manuscript is well organized, clearly written and the overall experimental design and data analysis are appropriate. The conclusions are mostly supported by the presented data. A limitation is that only measurements of virus titers are performed in the context of infection while information on IFN production or ISG induction is missing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide some measurements on how much type I or type III IFN is being produced in the airways. There are no measurements shown on how much type I or type III IFN is being produced in the airways. This data is critical to understand the differences between IFN-α/β and IFN-λ systems during infection.</p><p>2) Quantify ISG induction in the mouse airway. The authors have not quantified ISG induction in the mouse airway. It would be informative to measure Mx mRNA in the mouse lung samples.</p><p>There do seem to be individual cells in the airway (Figure 6C) that are responding to infection by expressing the Mx protein. Do these cells express only IFN-λ receptors? Some further combinations of infection, IFN treatment and staining for receptors and response genes as shown in Figure 6 would be extremely informative. For example, are the cells stained for virus in Figure 6C also seen in IFN-λ R-/- mice?</p><p>3) Provide some data on disease outcome. One of the main differences between the IFN type I and type III systems is the cellular/tissue distribution of the receptor, which limits the range of response for type III IFN and the systemic inflammation that usually comes with type I IFN. Did the authors observe any differences in immunopathology between infected <italic>ifnlr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>ifnar<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected mice? Did the author measure levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in those mice? Some information on morbidity or mortality would help the interpretation.</p><p>4) Expand the introduction to clearly highlight the advances of the current study relative to the article by Galini and colleagues.</p><p>5) Discuss the potential mechanistic differences between IFN-α and IFN-λ.</p><p>– The comparisons with IFN-α are sometime overlooked. For example, Figure 2A shows no difference in virus shedding from WTR or IFNAR-/- animals and yet the transmission data showed only 17% transmission from WT but 42% from IFNAR-/-. Please comment.</p><p>– In subsection “IFN-λ confers long-lasting virus protection in the upper airways, whereas IFN-α-mediated protection is short-lived”, the short-lived response to IFN-α is mentioned. Might this be explained by a dosage difference? The peak virus titer in SeV infected lungs is less than that in URT and swabs. IFN-α could just be better at control the lower dose of virus at the lung.</p><p>– The authors take care to control the amount of IFNs applied by titrating them on primary mouse epithelial cells. At 4 hours post infection, the two IFNs types look equivalent but at later time points they do differ (Figure 5C). What does that mean for the in vivo results?</p><p>6) Expand the discussion to include the mechanisms responsible for different responses especially short lived IFN-α response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33354.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide some measurements on how much type I or type III IFN is being produced in the airways. There are no measurements shown on how much type I or type III IFN is being produced in the airways. This data is critical to understand the differences between IFN-α/β and IFN-λ systems during infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that more information on the synthesis of type I and type III IFN in the upper airways of virus-infected mice might help to explain our findings. Accordingly, we employed commercial ELISA kits to measure IFN-λ in lysates prepared from the snout tissue. It turned out that these ELISA kits are not suitable for a proper analysis of IFN levels in tissue homogenates due to strong non-specific background signals. It should be noted that these assays worked well for serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Unfortunately, however, measuring IFN levels in the latter samples does not solve the open questions of our project.</p><p>The only method that worked for us was RT-qPCR. Data presented in a new Figure 2A shows that baseline expression of IFN-λ genes is significantly lower in the upper airways of <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared with wild-type and <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. As a result of reduced baseline expression of the IFN-λ gene, <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also exhibit low baseline expression of the IFN-stimulated <italic>Mx1</italic> gene which may explain why <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show enhanced susceptibility to influenza viruses even though they possess a fully functional IFN-λ system. These new findings are described in subsection “IFN-λ prevents influenza virus spread from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs” of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Quantify ISG induction in the mouse airway. The authors have not quantified ISG induction in the mouse airway. It would be informative to measure Mx mRNA in the mouse lung samples.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new Figure 2B we show induction of IFN genes and a representative ISG (<italic>Mx1</italic>) in the upper airways of infected mice. Baseline expression of IFN-λ mRNA was remarkably high in WT mice, and expression was only moderately induced after virus infection. <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly lower levels of IFN-λ mRNA before infection. Due to technical issues (as explained above) high baseline expression of IFN-λ in snouts of WT mice could not be confirmed on the protein level. Interestingly, expression of the IFN-λ genes in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reached comparable levels as in WT or <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> mice within two days post virus infection. These data indicate that functional type I IFN signaling is needed to prime cells for proper baseline expression of the IFN-λ genes which contributes to early virus defense in the upper airways. These important findings are described in subsection “IFN-λ prevents influenza virus spread from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we also measured <italic>Mx1</italic> expression in lung samples of our mice. We found no significant induction of <italic>Mx1</italic> expression in lung tissue of WT mice within the first three days after selective upper airway infection. These results indicate that IFN-λ is acting locally and stops virus spread from the upper airways to the lungs without triggering a systemic IFN response. We decided against including these negative data in our revised manuscript, mainly because the focus of our work is on the upper airways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There do seem to be individual cells in the airway (Figure 6C) that are responding to infection by expressing the Mx protein. Do these cells express only IFN-λ receptors? Some further combinations of infection, IFN treatment and staining for receptors and response genes as shown in Figure 6 would be extremely informative.

We concluded from this figure that a small number of epithelial cells in the upper airways do not respond to IFN-α and that these cells seem to remain susceptible to virus infection in spite of an IFN-α pretreatment. We would like to emphasize that similar experiments with <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice that were treated before virus infection with IFN-λ and IFN-α, respectively, are shown in Figure 7A and 7B (formerly 6A and 6B). They clearly illustrate that IFN-λ blocked replication of Udorn virus very efficiently, whereas IFN-α did not suppress virus replication in all epithelial cells of the upper airways neither in WT nor in <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide some data on disease outcome.

Further, most of our infection experiments were designed to deliver the virus inoculum selectively to the upper airways rather than to the lungs. It is well known (Ivinson et al., 2017) that such targeted virus infections are not causing disease in mice even if virus strains are used which are highly pathogenic when delivered directly to the lungs. Most likely for these technical reasons we did not observe any differences in immunopathology between <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We modified the text in subsection “IFN-λ prevents influenza virus spread from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs” of the revised manuscript to better explain our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Expand the introduction to clearly highlight the advances of the current study relative to the article by Galini and colleagues.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, at first glance, our work shows similarity to a recently published paper by Galani and coworkers. However, there are important differences between the design and the conclusions of the two studies.</p><p>First, we used a protocol in which virus infection selectively starts in the upper airways, mimicking natural virus contraction. Galani et al., in contrast, used a low virus dose to inoculate the whole respiratory tract, as it is conventionally done in respiratory virus studies.</p><p>Second, we show that the IFN-λ response stops the virus spread already in the respiratory epithelia of the upper airways, preventing infection of the lungs altogether. We demonstrate that the non-redundant role of IFN-λ is most pronounced in the upper airways where the decisive battle between invading respiratory viruses and the host immune defense takes place under natural conditions. We demonstrate that increased amounts of infectious particles are secreted if the IFN-λ system is defective. This enhances the likelihood that the virus will successfully spread to the lungs of the infected individual. In contrast, Galani et al., exclusively focused on the control of viral replication after it has reached the lungs, and on the immune pathology in the infected lungs.</p><p>Third, we demonstrate that IFN-λ-mediated control of viral replication in the upper airways is critical for limiting virus transmission. High amounts of infectious particles are secreted from the upper airways which enhance the probability that the virus is successfully transmitted to a new host. Galani et al., did not assess the role of IFN-λ for virus shedding and contact transmission.</p><p>Forth, we used mice with functional <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles for our studies. In such mice, IFN-mediated antiviral effects against influenza viruses are much more pronounced than in mice lacking functional <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles, providing a broader experimental window which permits detecting small differences in antiviral activity of different IFN subtypes with higher sensitivity. Galani et al., used mice with defective <italic>Mx1</italic> alleles. As a consequence, the protective effects of IFN-λ were more pronounced and more sustained in our study compared with the study published by Galani and coworkers.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we extended the Introduction and the Discussion section of our manuscript to more clearly highlight the advances of our new work relative to the earlier study published by Galani and coworkers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discuss the potential mechanistic differences between IFN-α and IFN-λ.</p><p>– The comparisons with IFN-α are sometime overlooked. For example, Figure 2A shows no difference in virus shedding from WTR or IFNAR-/- animals and yet the transmission data showed only 17% transmission from WT but 42% from IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup>. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The main reason why we do not put emphasis on the type I IFN data shown in Figure 3A (formerly 2A) is that the protective effect of IFN-α was only very mild. As correctly noted by the reviewer, virus shedding was not enhanced in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, although the rate of Udorn virus transmission was slightly enhanced in the experiment shown in figure 4A, this difference did not reach statistical significance and was not observed in transmission experiments with the HK68 virus strain (Figure 4B). The same holds true for SeV: neither virus shedding (Figure 3B) nor transmission (Figure 4C) was significantly enhanced in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared with wild-type animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In subsection “IFN-λ confers long-lasting virus protection in the upper airways, whereas IFN-α-mediated protection is short-lived”, the short-lived response to IFN α is mentioned. Might this be explained by a dosage difference? The peak virus titer in SeV infected lungs is less than that in URT and swabs. IFN-α could just be better at control the lower dose of virus at the lung.</p></disp-quote><p>The short-lived nature of the IFN-α effect cannot be explained by a dosage difference. We used identical amounts of IFN-α and IFN-λ for the treatments, and we showed in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 that both IFN preparations have similar biological activities. It is correct that SeV grew to lower titers in the lungs as compared with the upper airways. However, this observation is not relevant for our argument. In the experiment shown in Figure 6, we infected the whole respiratory tract by applying the virus in a volume of 40 µl. Thus, at the earliest times post infection, virus levels were equally low in all parts of the respiratory tract. Since the IFN treatment of the animals was performed before virus infection, our data shown in Figure 6 demonstrates that IFN-α is less effective in preventing virus growth in the upper airways than in the lungs. The short-lived nature of the IFN-α response is shown in Figure 6B and 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors take care to control the amount of IFNs applied by titrating them on primary mouse epithelial cells. At 4 hours post infection, the two IFNs types look equivalent but at later time points they do differ (Figure 5C). What does that mean for the in vivo results?</p></disp-quote><p>The discovery that the biological effect of IFN-α is short-lived in airway epithelial cells is important. It provides a good explanation for why IFN-α is less potent than IFN-λ in controlling virus growth in the upper airways. Figure 6B formally excludes a second alternative explanation of our findings, namely the possibility that upper airway epithelial cells might lack functional receptors for type I IFN. We extended the Discussion section to highlight this important finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Expand the discussion to include the mechanisms responsible for different responses especially short lived IFN-α response.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed possible mechanisms explaining the short-lived nature of the IFN-α response (see Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
