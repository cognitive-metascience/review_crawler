of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing receptors, greatly influences the glutamate synaptic transmission. Receptor co-agonists, glycine and D-serine, have intriguingly emerged as potential regulators of the receptor trafficking in addition to their requirement for its activation. Using a combination of single-molecule imaging, biochemistry and electrophysiology, we show that glycine and D-serine relative availability at rat hippocampal glutamatergic synapses regulate the trafficking and synaptic content of NMDAR subtypes. Acute manipulations of co-agonist levels, both ex vivo and in vitro, unveil that D-serine alter the membrane dynamics and content of GluN2B-NMDAR, but not GluN2A-NMDAR, at synapses through a process requiring PDZ binding scaffold partners. In addition, using FRET-based FLIM approach, we demonstrate that D-serine rapidly induces a conformational change of the GluN1 subunit intracellular C-terminus domain. Together our data fuels the view that the extracellular microenvironment regulates synaptic NMDAR signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25492.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25492.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NMDA</kwd><kwd>subunit trafficking</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Neuroscience Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groc</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>D-serine has a major role in the regulation of NMDA receptors not only contributing to its activation as the receptors co-agonist, but also by regulating specifically GluN2B-NMDA receptor trafficking and synaptic content at developing hippocampal synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutamatergic synapses mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly through the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). In addition to glutamate, the NMDAR activation requires the binding of a co-agonist. It has been established that endogenous glycine and D-serine can both play thid ms role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliet and Mothet, 2009</xref>) even though D-serine was shown to be the endogenous co-agonist at glutamatergic synapses in the adult forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>). Most NMDAR are heterotetramers comprising various combinations of GluN1 (binding the co-agonist) and GluN2A-D (binding glutamate) subunits, which confer specific biophysical, pharmacological, and signaling properties to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, a variety of different properties and functions have been attributed to GluN2A-containing and GluN2B-containing NMDAR subtypes (thereafter referred to as GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR), such as their alleged roles in plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). During development, the NMDAR composition is tightly regulated: GluN2B subunits are highly expressed during early development and reach a peak around the second postnatal week, whereas GluN2A subunit levels increase only after birth, exceeding GluN2B subunits by adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth and Malenka, 2001</xref>). The progressive enrichment of GluN2A-NMDAR at developing synapses is essential for synaptic maturation, neuronal network and cortical map establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yashiro and Philpot, 2008</xref>).</p><p>It recently emerged that synaptic NMDAR are mostly gated by D-serine, whereas extrasynaptic receptors are gated by glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan and Miller, 2012</xref>). This co-agonist segregation is accompanied by a similar compartmentalization of NMDAR subtypes wherein synaptic NMDAR were mostly GluN2A-NMDAR, whereas GluN2B-NMDAR were found at extrasynaptic locations. This raised the question of whether the distribution of NMDAR subtypes on CA1 neurons is responsible for the spatial segregation of the co-agonist or, on the contrary, whether the compartmentalization of glycine and D-serine dictates the location of NMDAR subtypes on hippocampal neurons. Although there is little evidence that NMDAR subtypes have a preferred co-agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Priestley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wafford et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), it appears that glycine and D-serine differentially regulate the surface dynamics of NMDAR on hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, both glycine and D-serine alter NMDAR internalization in a clathrin-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nong et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we thus investigated whether the two NMDAR co-agonists, glycine and D-serine, modulate the GluN2A/B subunit composition at hippocampal synapses, using a unique combination of single-molecule imaging, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry and electrophysiology in hippocampal networks. We found that the relative abundance of glycine and D-serine dictates GluN2B-NMDAR content in synapses. Since NMDAR surface dynamics modulate NMDAR-dependent synaptic signaling and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupuis et al., 2014</xref>), it thus appears that NMDAR co-agonists act as major regulators of the NMDAR function through subtype-specific alterations of receptor trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GluN2B-NMDAR surface dynamics and distribution are differentially altered by D-serine and glycine</title><p>Using electrophysiological and single-molecule imaging approaches, it emerged that the NMDAR synaptic content relies on both receptor cycling with intracellular pool and fast membrane lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard and Groc, 2011</xref>). To explore the impact of D-serine or glycine on endogenous NMDAR trafficking, we performed single nanoparticle (Quantum Dot, QD) tracking experiments in cultured hippocampal networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These were performed in 10–18 days in vitro (div)-old neurons, a time at which glutamatergic synapses express both GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR, have spine-like morphology, and naturally contain both glycine and D-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>). To assess the effect of glycine and D-serine on receptor surface dynamics, we used exogenous application of each co-agonist or specific enzymatic scavengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollegioni et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Job et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>) that selectively degrade endogenous extracellular D-serine (D-amino acid oxidase, <italic>Rg</italic>DAAO) or glycine (glycine oxidase, <italic>Bs</italic>GO). The control condition refers to the situation before stimuli. We found that the instantaneous diffusion coefficient of GluN2A-NMDAR was decreased by 14% in presence of glycine, whereas D-serine had no effect (glycine: 86 ± 1% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 8115 trajectories, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>; D-serine: 100 ± 2% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 5555 trajectories, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). In order to examine the diffusion pattern of GluN2A-NMDAR (e.g. confined or freely diffusive), we plotted the mean square displacement (MSD) versus time lag, which represents the average area explored by the receptor over time, upon exogenous application of co-agonists. We found that the MSD curves of GluN2A-NMDAR in the presence of glycine or D-serine were undistinguishable (glycine: MSD<sup>0.5-0.75s</sup> = 0.2135 ± 0.011 µm<sup>2</sup>; D-serine: MSD<sup>0.5-0.75s</sup> = 0.246 ± 0.012 µm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 250–252 selected trajectories for each group, p=0.1087; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, GluN2B-NMDAR surface diffusion was markedly reduced in presence of exogenous D-serine, whereas glycine incubation was without significant effect (D-serine: 57 ± 11% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 836 trajectories, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>; glycine: 71.5 ± 11% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 318 trajectories, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). In addition, the diffusion pattern of GluN2B-NMDAR became markedly confined in the presence of D-serine but not glycine (D-serine: MSD<sup>0.5-0.75s</sup> = 0.042 ± 0.0005 µm<sup>2</sup>; glycine: MSD<sup>0.5-0.75s</sup> = 0.107 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 252 selected trajectories for each group; p=0.0022; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that under conditions in which D-serine prevails, the diffusion of GluN2B-NMDAR is slowed down and the receptors exhibit a more confined behavior, an effect possibly due to altered interactions with synaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, the relative content of synaptic GluN2B-QD, estimated as the synaptic fraction of single GluN2B-QD, was strongly reduced by D-serine incubation and degradation of glycine (D-serine: 62.5 ± 12% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 14 dendritic fields, p&lt;0.05; <italic>Bs</italic>GO: 36 ± 15% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 37 dendritic fields, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

To test this, we assessed GluN2-NMDAR synaptic content in cultured hippocampal neurons using live immunocytochemistry with specific antibodies against the extracellular N-terminal of endogenous GluN2A or GluN2B subunit. The synaptic compartment was identified by the presence of the postsynaptic protein Homer-1c and the synaptic localization of GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR was determined by the extent of co-localization of their surface expression with this marker. Incubation with glycine or D-serine (45 min, 30 µM) did not alter the synaptic content of GluN2A-NMDAR (113 ± 12% and 100 ± 8% of control for glycine and D-serine, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 39–41 cells, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and the total (extra- and synaptic) surface amount of clusters (110 ± 9% and 103 ± 7% of control for glycine and D-serine, respectively, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Using the same anti-GluN2A subunit antibody under permeabilized condition, to stain both intracellular and surface GluN2A-NMDAR, revealed no change in the total content (glycine: 97 ± 5%, D-serine 105 ± 5% compared to control, respectively, p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, D-serine reduced the surface synaptic staining of GluN2B-NMDAR (68 ± 7% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 39–40 cells, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), whereas glycine was without significant effect (79 ± 7% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 40 cells, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This was specific to synaptic clusters since the surface staining (extra- and synaptic) of GluN2B-NMDAR was unaffected in all conditions (glycine: 91.5 ± 7%, D-serine: 82 ± 7%, compared to control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The total content of GluN2B-NMDAR, evaluated by the labeling of GluN2B subunits after permeabilization, was not altered by glycine or D-serine incubation (glycine: 103 ± 9%, D-serine: 112 ± 8% compared to control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, the total content of GluN1 subunit (staining in permeabilized condition) was unaltered by glycine or D-serine incubation (glycine: total 102 ± 8%, synaptic 101 ± 8%; D-serine: total 94 ± 5%, synaptic 88 ± 5% compared to control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are thus consistent with the single GluN2B-NMDAR-QD distributions described above, supporting the claim that GluN2B-NMDAR surface diffusion and synaptic content are altered by D-serine. To confirm these findings in a more intact preparation, synaptosomes were isolated from hippocampi of young adult rats (P30) and incubated 1 hr with either co-agonist (30 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Then, GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunit contents were quantified by Western blotting. Consistently, the GluN2B, but not GluN2A, subunit level was significantly decreased after D-serine incubation (glycine/D-serine ratio change relative to control, GluN1 1 ± 10%, GluN2A 10 ± 8%, GluN2B 28 ± 5%, <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). Also, the total amount of GluN2B subunit was not altered by D-serine incubation (control: 1.0 ± 0.11, <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments; D-Serine: 0.95 ± 0.16, <italic>n</italic> = 5; glycine: 0.71 ± 0.14, <italic>n</italic> = 5; p&gt;0.05, ANOVA one followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test), supporting a redistribution of GluN2B-NMDAR. Finally, the synaptic content of the obligatory GluN1 subunit was unaffected by either treatment, suggesting a stable amount of NMDAR with thus possible redistributions of other NMDAR subunits (e.g. GluN3A/B).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25492.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GluN2B synaptic content is decreased after D-serine incubation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface labeling of GluN2A in hippocampal neurons 18–19 div in culture stimulated with glycine or D-serine.

The C-terminus of GluN2 subunits is a well-known hub for interactions with several intracellular partners, especially PDZ scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elias and Nicoll, 2007</xref>). Since our results point to a robust alteration of GluN2B-NMDAR synaptic trafficking and content in presence of D-serine, we hypothesized that this effect depend on an interaction between intracellular scaffold proteins and the C-terminus of the GluN2B subunit. To test this possibility, we prevented such interaction using a competing peptide and reasoned that this should prevent the effect of D-serine on GluN2B-NMDAR trafficking. We used a TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub> peptide mimicking the last 15 amino acids of the GluN2B subunit, to efficiently disrupt the interaction between GluN2B-NMDAR and PDZ proteins, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard et al., 2010</xref>), and a scramble peptide as control (TAT-NS, 20 µM). In presence of TAT-NS (15 min pre-incubation), we observed the expected decrease in GluN2B-NMDAR diffusion elicited by D-serine application (90.5 ± 6.3% of control, <italic>n</italic> = 229 trajectories, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). This was accompanied by an increased confinement behavior of GluN2B-NMDAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, TAT-NS: MSD<sup>0.35-0.55s</sup> = 0.1929 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>, TAT-NS + D-serine: MSD<sup>0.35-0.55s</sup> = 0.1625 ± 0.002 µm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.0079). Remarkably, both these effects were prevented in the presence of the TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub> peptide: D-serine no longer altered the diffusion coefficient (101.1 ± 4.03% of control TAT-GluN2B, <italic>n</italic> = 713 trajectories, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), or changed the confinement behavior of GluN2B-NMDAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, TAT-GluN2B: MSD<sup>0.35-0.55s</sup> = 0.1802 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>, TAT-GluN2B + D-serine: MSD<sup>0.35-0.55s</sup> = 0.1740 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.4206). As previously observed, D-serine decrease the synaptic content of GluN2B-NMDAR (co-localized with Homer-1c) in neurons exposed 45 min to the TAT-NS peptide (85.3 ± 2.5% of control TAT-NS, <italic>n</italic> = 38 neuronal fields; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>); however, this effect was prevented by TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub> peptide incubation (94.7 ± 2.6% of control TAT-GluN2B, <italic>n</italic> = 70 neuronal fields; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Since the TAT peptide itself appears to attenuate the D-serine effect (from 43% decrease, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, to a 10% decrease of GluN2B-NMDAR diffusion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and 32% decreased synaptic content, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, to a 15% decrease, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we evaluated the effect of a lower concentration of peptides (2 µM). First, we confirmed that this concentration was sufficient to decrease the binding between GluN2B-NMDAR and PSD-95, one of the scaffold PDZ-containing proteins within glutamate synapses. Following a 45 min incubation with TAT-NS or TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub> (2 µM), the number of GluN2B surface clusters that colocalize with PSD-95 clusters was reduced by the TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub> peptide (TAT-NS incubation, 7.5 ± 0.5 clusters per 10 µm, n = 30 cells, three independent experiments; TAT-GluN2B<sub>15</sub>: 5.8 ± 0.3 GluN2B clusters per 10 µm of dendrite, <italic>n</italic> = 30 cells; p=0.0091, t-test). Then, we investigated the effect of D-serine in presence of this low concentration of peptides. We report a similar extent of GluN2B-NMDAR decrease after D-serine incubation when compared to the higher TAT concentration (TAT-NS 2 µM + D-serine: 90 ± 4% compared to TAT-NS without D-serine, n = 10 cells per condition), suggesting that TAT peptide, even at low concentration, attenuate the D-serine effects on NMDAR trafficking. Together, these data indicate that D-serine binding regulates GluN2B-NMDAR surface trafficking through a C-terminus-mediated process.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25492.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>GluN2B subunit PDZ-binding domain mediates subunit co-agonist action.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of the surface trajectories of single QD-coupled GluN2B-NMDAR in the synaptic area.

In order to gain more insight into the effect of D-serine binding on NMDAR C-terminus properties, we used Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) to measure the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between two GluN1 C-terminal tails, NMDAR obligatory subunits, tagged with fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dore et al., 2015</xref>), a FRET signal was obtained by co-expressing a ‘donor’ GluN1-GFP with a GluN1-mcherry ‘acceptor’ and measured as a decrease in lifetime of the donor fluorescence. We found that a 1:3 ratio provided the best FRET efficiency (GluN1-GFP: 2.52 ± 0.01 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 70 clusters; GluN1-GFP + GluN1-mCherry 1:3 ratio: 2.34 ± 0.01 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 78 clusters; GluN1-GFP + GluN1-mCherry 1:2 ratio: 2.41 ± 0.02 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 44 clusters, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hippocampal neurons were therefore co-transfected with the GluN1 FRET pair at 1:3 ratio, and GluN2B-FLAG to increase synaptic targeting, and imaged 4 days later. As a negative control, we used a mCherry-GluN2B construct whose tag is in the extracellular domain therefore preventing any FRET with the GluN1-GFP (2.50 ± 0.01 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 60 clusters, p&gt;0.05 compared to control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We analyzed the FRET signal from NMDAR clusters identified in the fluorescent image, localized both on spines (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and shafts (arrow heads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and found no significant difference in the lifetime between these two regions (spines clusters: 2.32 ± 0.02 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 45; shaft clusters: 2.36 ± 0.02 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 43, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of NMDA (20 µM, 5 min), and as expected from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dore et al., 2015</xref>), the lifetime of GluN1-GFP co-transfected with GluN1-mCherry caused a significant increase in the GluN1-GFP lifetime (NMDA: 2.27 ± 0.01 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 124; Tyrode: 2.23 ± 0.01 ns, <italic>n</italic> = 291, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating a smaller FRET efficiency and validating our ability to measure FRET changes with our system. We next assessed the effect of co-agonist applications on the FRET signal and found that D-serine (30 µM, 5 min) decreased the lifetime of GluN1-GFP co-expressed with GluN1-mCherry (baseline: 2,302 ± 19 ps; D-serine: 2,279 ± 20 ps, <italic>n</italic> = 103, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) while glycine (30 µM, 5 min) had no effect on FRET efficiency (baseline: 2,222 ± 20 ns; glycine: 2,226 ± 19 ps, <italic>n</italic> = 110, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Although we only detected small changes in the FRET lifetimes after the application of the D-serine, it is tempting to hypothesize that while glycine and D-serine are considered equivalent with regard to their activation of the co-agonist binding site of NMDAR, they have, in fact, a distinct conformational effect on the receptor: D-serine binding specifically elicits a conformational change that brings the two GluN1 C-tails closer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) while glycine does not. Interestingly, when the cells were pre-incubated with NMDA (20 µM), the following 5-min incubation with either co-agonist did not produced any further change of the lifetime of the GluN1-GFP (NMDA baseline: 2,309 ± 15 ps; glycine: 2,320 ± 15 ps; NMDA baseline: 2,333 ± 13 ps; D-serine: 2,334 ± 13 ps; p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The NMDA binding conformational change prevails over the D-serine-binding-induced change (−23.2 ± 11 ps lifetime change after D-serine incubation compared to 15.2 ± 9 ps lifetime change after D-serine incubation in the presence of NMDA, p=0.06, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the presence of NMDA, the c-terminal tails of the GluN1 subunits probably move apart independently of the co-agonist binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Our data thus support the conclusion that D-serine binding alone modifies NMDAR conformation in a way that glycine does not; however, the lifetime change detected is only of 23.2 ± 11.8 ps, at this point it is not clear if this change is sufficient to modulate the interactions of NMDAR with their intracellular partners in a co-agonist-dependent manner. Further studies with stronger FRET reporters will surely further establish the relationship between the D-serine binding and the modulation of the C-terminal conformation of NMDAR subunits.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25492.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>D-serine binding alone differently modulated NMDAR c-terminal conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of experimental design (top).

In slices from young animals (P10-15), when glycine is the major endogenous co-agonist and GluN2B-NMDAR the major NMDAR subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), we observed that applications of exogenous glycine (100–200 µM, 30 min) or D-serine (50–100 µM, 30 min) had no effect on the GluN2A-NMDAR content (control: 37 ± 3.4% inhibition by zinc; glycine: 36.55 ± 3.43%, p&lt;0.01; D-serine: 36.07 ± 3.64%, <italic>n = 7,</italic> p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) consistent with our finding that GluN2A-NMDAR trafficking remained unaffected by either co-agonist. In slices from adults (&gt;P50), when GluN2A-NMDAR and D-serine predominate, additional D-serine did not modify zinc-induced inhibition but exogenous glycine application elicited a small decrease in GluN2A-NMDAR content (control: 52 ± 2% inhibition by zinc; glycine: 39 ± 2%, p&lt;0.01; D-serine: 51 ± 2% p&gt;0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Therefore, GluN2A-NMDAR content at synapses was mostly unaffected at either age by the synaptic content of glycine or D-serine, which is consistent with our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In contrast, the synaptic content of GluN2B-NMDAR in slices from young animals was strikingly reduced when artificially increasing the availability of D-serine, but not glycine (control: 40 ± 3% inhibition by Ro25-6981; glycine: 36 ± 2.5%, p&gt;0.05; D-serine: 22 ± 2%, p&lt;0.01; <italic>n</italic> = 6–7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Even more strikingly, whereas GluN2B-NMDAR are virtually absent from CA3-CA1 synapses in adult rats under control conditions or after prolonged incubation with D-serine, they contributed to 23 ± 5% of the total synaptic NMDAR population when glycine was exogenously supplied (control: 1.25 ± 2.33% inhibition by Ro25-6981; glycine: 22.65 ± 5.06%, p&gt;0.05; D-serine: 6.36 ± 2.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 13, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicated that providing sufficient amounts of glycine throughout the slice was sufficient to allow GluN2B-NMDAR back in the synaptic space. Notably, D-serine remained without effect on Ro25-6981-mediated inhibition in this experiment indicating that the effect of glycine did not result from the mere recruitment of unsaturated GluN2B-NMDAR. In addition, we previously demonstrated that such application of co-agonist did not alter AMPA receptor synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>). In young slices, the change in Ro25-6981-mediated inhibition after D-serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) was not accompanied by a concurrent increase of zinc inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This may be due to the presence of other NMDAR subunits (e.g. GluN2D, GluN3A/B) and/or GluN1/2A/2B triheteromeric receptors, which have different pharmacological responses than diheteromeric receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhu and Paoletti, 2015</xref>). Collectively, these data represent of ‘proof of concept’ that fluctuations in co-agonist levels, and in particular in the nature of the prevailing co-agonist, markedly alter the NMDAR synaptic content. Intriguingly, these results also strongly advocate that the co-agonist switch occurring during development is instrumental, rather than coincidental, in driving the GluN2B-GluN2A subunit switch. This was further fueled by the finding that glycine levels measured in slices using capillary electrophoresis were ~40% lower in adults than in pups, while D-serine content increased by ~50% over the same period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) confirming that the availability of D-serine and glycine changes and reverses throughout development. Finally, to rule out the possibility that the replacement of GluN2B- by GluN2A-NMDAR at synapses determines the preferential use of D-serine over glycine during development, we carried out full dose-response curves for glycine and D-serine on recombinant GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR. For both receptor subtypes, we found that the EC<sub>50</sub> values for glycine and D-serine as well as the maximal current amplitudes achieved were indistinguishable; indicating that neither subtype of receptor is capable of discriminating between the two co-agonists in respect to binding affinity and extent of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We conclude that the two endogenous co-agonists, glycine and D-serine, i) have the potential to differentially regulate NMDAR function in a subunit-specific manner by eliciting distinct conformational changes that affect the interaction with intracellular partners such as PSD-95, ii) this process is at play in situ, under basal levels of co-agonists, and iii) this mechanism contributes to the NMDAR ‘subunit switch’ that occurs during postnatal development at the canonical CA3-CA1 synapse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the molecular mechanism by which glutamatergic synapses adjust their GluN2A/B-NMDAR signaling has captured a lot of attention over the last decades.

Therefore, intense efforts have been made to unveil the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which glutamate synapses tune their GluN2A/B subunit ratio. In particular, changes in the postsynaptic scaffold apparatus have been thoroughly investigated during development, providing evidence that PDZ-scaffold proteins (e.g. SAP-102, PSD-95) are differentially involved in the regulation of the GluN2A/B subunit ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, extracellular molecules (e.g. reelin, ephrinB) and genetic mechanisms (e.g. transcriptional repressor REST) have also been identified as important regulators of the GluN2-NMDAR switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nolt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that multiple molecular cascades are likely involved into this mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the NMDAR endogenous co-agonists, glycine and D-serine, are also potent regulators of the NMDAR trafficking and synaptic subunit content. This finding is in line with evidence that mice lacking the D-serine synthesizing enzyme serine racemase, as well as mice heterozygotes for the glycine transporter GlyT1 that limits glycine access at excitatory synapses, exhibit altered synaptic GluN2A- and Glu2B-NMDAR content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balu and Coyle, 2011</xref>). In addition, during the induction of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus co-agonists are differentially released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henneberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>), likely inducing the fast change in GluN2A/2B-NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellone and Nicoll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matta et al., 2011</xref>) associated with a lateral displacement of GluN2B-NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupuis et al., 2014</xref>). It has been previously shown that the replacement of GluN2B- with GluN2A-NMDAR at synapses is synaptic activity dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barria and Malinow, 2002</xref>), and require both NMDAR and mGluR5 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bellone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matta et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, several mechanisms seem to contribute to this NMDAR subunit switch during development, how do they act in a coordinate manner is still open for investigation.</p><p>An intriguing feature of our findings is the striking specificity toward GluN2B-NMDAR. Interestingly, it has been reported that GluN2B-NMDAR surface dynamics are specifically altered when neurons are exposed to the extracellular protein reelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groc et al., 2007</xref>), to sexual hormone estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potier et al., 2016</xref>), or to strong synaptic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupuis et al., 2014</xref>). These paradigms have in common to be potent regulators of NMDAR-dependent synaptic maturation and plasticity in the hippocampus. Deciphering the molecular mechanism by which D-serine selectively impacts GluN2B-NMDAR conformation, surface trafficking and synaptic retention is a major challenge. Since there seems to be no difference between the binding of glycine and D-serine onto the co-agonist site of NMDAR as far as affinity and efficacy are concerned, one can rule out the possibility that GluN2B-NMDAR use D-serine as a preferred co-agonist. Interestingly, our data favor a model in which the binding of D-serine induces a rapid conformational change of the receptor C-terminus domain and a consequent alteration of the interactions between GluN2B-NMDAR and PDZ scaffold partners. This is further supported by the observations that the activation of NMDAR with the glutamate-site agonist NMDA also induces a conformational change of the receptor that reduces the interaction between the C-terminus and PSD-95 or with protein phosphate 1 (PP1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dore et al., 2015</xref>). Noteworthy, the conformational changes specifically induced by D-serine do not alter the ion flux through the receptor, reminiscent of a metabotropic-like effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dore et al., 2015</xref>). In-depth investigations of the co-agonist impact on GluN2A and GluN2B subunit conformations will be necessary to shed light on this process.</p><p>Our data support a model in which an increase in D-serine levels reduce GluN2B-NMDAR mobility, favor their internalization and down-regulate their synaptic content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The decreased interaction between GluN2B-NMDAR and PSD-95 after D-serine incubation may favor the receptor endocytosis by unmasking a GluN2B internalization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roche et al., 2001</xref>). This molecular cascade is likely not the sole mechanism since the interaction with PDZ scaffolds is required for the receptor internalization, indeed disrupting the GluN2B-NMDAR interactions with PDZ-containing proteins prevents the D-serine-induced synaptic decrease (competing peptide data). This observation implies that there must be some PDZ-containing proteins, interacting directly with GluN2B subunit, which are essential for the receptors displacement. Among the possible candidates, Scrible1 is a synaptic scaffold that contains four PDZ domains. It binds directly to the GluN2B subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piguel et al., 2014</xref>) and to AP2 adaptor complex, promoting GluN2B-NMDAR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prybylowski et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, D-serine/NMDA stimulation induces GluN2B internalization in the presence of Scrible1, an effect prevented by knocking down the scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piguel et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore propose that D-serine-induced C-terminus conformation change favors the interaction of GluN2B subunit with certain PDZ scaffolds (e.g. Scrible1, SAP102) that promote surface diffusion slow-down and internalization. The identification of the specific scaffold proteins and/or MAGUK family responsible for such effect will thus be of great interest.</p><p>Overall, beyond the well-established role of the NMDAR co-agonists on the receptor activation, we here provide direct evidence that co-agonists also regulate the receptor trafficking within glutamatergic synapses in a fast and subunit-specific manner. This offers new perspectives for translational research given that NMDAR, glycine and D-serine have been tightly linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balu and Coyle, 2015</xref>). Manipulating either co-agonist levels or the surface dynamics of a NMDAR subtype, at specific developmental stages, may represent new therapeutic opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Enzymes</title><p>Recombinant wild-type <italic>R. gracilis</italic> D-amino acid oxidase (<italic>Rg</italic>DAAO, EC 1.4.3.3) and recombinant wild-type <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> glycine oxidase (<italic>Bs</italic>GO, EC 1.4.3.19) were overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells, purified and used as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollegioni et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sonia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Job et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>).

Symbols used are: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.001; ***p&lt;0.0001 throughout the manuscript.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from INSERM, Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, Conseil Régional d’Aquitaine, NARSAD, Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau, and the Human Frontier Science Program.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Co-agonists differentially tune GluN2B-NMDA receptor trafficking at hippocampal synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Camilla Bellone (Reviewer #2) and Andrew Plested (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors investigate the influence of NMDAR co-agonists, D-serine and glycine, on the relative content of GluN2A and GluN2B. Using complementary approaches, the authors showed that GluN2B-NMDARs surface diffusion is reduced and its motion behavior became confined in presence of D-serine or of a glycine scavenger suggesting that when D-serine prevails, the trafficking of GluN2B containing NMDARs is altered and the synaptic content of GluN2B reduced. This process requires conformational changes modulate the interaction of NMDARs with their intracellular PDZ binding scaffolding partners.</p><p>The reviewers felt that this is an impressive study. The authors have deployed a wide range of tools to build a highly plausible investigation of co-agonist action on synaptic content. Whilst some holes remain – see below and no surprise in that given the complexity of the problem – the reviewers felt that the work is a major contribution. The topic is of general interest and the approach is of high quality. They do however feel that the following points must be addressed for being accepted in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First, control experiments are needed to strengthen the conclusions. Those should address the co-localization of Homer 1c and GluN1 to prove that GluN1 has not changed and also examining surface versus the total amount of GluN2A and GluN2B labelling would be important (see below).</p><p>Second, rewriting is necessary in particular in the Discussion, addressing the possible implication of triheteromeric receptors or of other NMDAR subunits, as well as the developmental regulations of scaffolding proteins. The authors should discuss the limitations of the study and provide more balance. Particularly here, the small signal size of the FLIM data requires attention.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> by using immunocytochemistry and synaptosome preparation from hippocampi of young rats, the authors show that GluN2B synaptic content is decreased after D-serine incubation. The authors should show the co-localization of Homer 1c and GluN1 to prove that GluN1 has not changed. Moreover, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, in order to analyze the surface versus the total amount of GluN2A and GluN2B labeling, the authors should perform a different analysis. First, they need to fix the cells without permeabilization, perform a staining with an Ab recognizing the N-terminal part of the protein, permeabilize the cells and subsequently perform a second staining using an Ab that recognize the C-terminal part of the protein. The immunostaining should also be performed with the scavenger to confirm their results.</p><p>The authors show that D-serine reduces the synaptic staining for GluN2B without affecting the total number of GluN2B clusters. In the synaptosome preparation, while the GluN1 and GluN2A levels were not affected by D-Serine application, the GluN2B content was significantly reduced. It is not clear how the authors, based on these results can assume that D-Serine does not change the total amount of NMDARs in the synaptosome. Indeed, since GluN1 homomers cannot be delivered at the membrane, a reduction in GluN2B should be accompanied by an increase in GluN2A content or by an increase in the content of other NMDA receptor subunits. In the Materials and methods, we did not find the explanation for the analysis of the% change in synaptic content. The authors should show the blot of the total homogenate.</p><p>To block the interaction between intracellular scaffolding proteins and the C-terminus of GluN2B, the authors used TAT-GluN2B15 peptide mimicking the last 15 aminoacids of GluN2B. There is a discrepancy between the diffusion coefficient of GluN2B in presence of D-Serine between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Since in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the diffusion coefficient has been calculated in presence of TAT-NS, it seems that TAT itself can affect the mobility of the receptors. The authors should probably try to use a lower concentration of the TAT. In the immunocytochemistry experiments, the authors should use instead of Homer1c, PSD-95 for the co-localization with the receptors. This experiment will also provide the control for the efficiency of the TAT to block the interaction. In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, controls are missing. Moreover, the authors should provide the co-ip in the presence of TAT.</p><p>The FLIM data are inconclusive. These experiments were done carefully, but unfortunately, the probes that are used are just not at all sensitive – that is, they barely change their lifetime with the conditions. This deficit was seen in the original manuscripts reporting these probes. This fact does not rule out that C-terminal dynamics could be responsible but the statistics bear out that the effects are tiny. In the subsection “D-serine alters the conformation of NMDAR C-terminus”, the authors state that &quot;D-serine.… strongly decreased&quot; with lifetime changing from 2302 ps to 2279 ps! This change is minute. 20ps average changes in lifetime are not meaningful, particularly with a frequency FLIM measurement. These translate into FRET distances in the low Å range, that is, smaller than an individual amino acid. The level of significance reached with a hundred of measurements is quite small and therefore I would not draw conclusions from this section. The question therefore, is what to do with the FRET section. It doesn't add strongly to the conclusions or the mechanism, but doing this experiment was the right thing to do. What is really required here is a FRET pair that is a better reporter (totally beyond the scope of this work). I would favour keeping this data in the paper, but strongly toning down the interpretation, something like:</p><p>&quot;Although we could measure small changes in FRET lifetimes, it is not clear whether these changes reflect biologically meaningful interactions among those proteins. More investigations with more robust reporters will be required to strengthen the relationship between D- Serine and intracellular conformational changes.&quot; Of course, the other references (e.g. Discussion) to this part should be toned down too.</p><p>Please also make more efforts to synthesise all the data. The &quot;subunit switch&quot; as measured here is between 1/3 and 2/3 in magnitude (current). This effect is similar in size to the trafficking effect at its greatest, and the synaptic content as measured by live cell imaging. The effects in biochemistry and with the peptide disrupting PSD95 binding are smaller, which is no surprise. There are parts of the text (FLIM data) where effect size is overstated. Does everything add up? I found it hard to judge. Perhaps a conservative approach is best, but I would like to see the authors approach the question – could D-serine dependent trafficking be the entire story for the subunit switch?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25492.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential Revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> by using immunocytochemistry and synaptosome preparation from hippocampi of young rats, the authors show that GluN2B synaptic content is decreased after D-serine incubation.

We report that there is no significant change of GluN1 subunit content, strengthening our former conclusion. The new dataset has been included in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in the section “Synaptic content of GluN2B-NMDAR is reduced by exogenous application of D-serine” of the results. Corresponding protocol can be found in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Moreover, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, in order to analyze the surface versus the total amount of GluN2A and GluN2B labeling, the authors should perform a different analysis.

Unfortunately, we were not able to find “fully-satisfactory” antibodies that would allow us to do this experiment (e.g. using an antibody directed against the GluN2A subunit C-terminus: low signal-to-noise ratio). However, as an alternative, we used the same antibodies as for the surface staining, but under permeabilizing conditions in order to evaluate the total amount of the receptor. We now show that the total amount (intracellular + membrane) of GluN2A- and GluN2B-NMDAR is unaffected by the presence of co-agonists. These new data have now been included into the revised manuscript (new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). The corresponding protocols can be found in Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>The immunostaining should also be performed with the scavenger to confirm their results.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we performed a series of immunostaining with the scavenger enzymes. Since GluN2B-NMDAR diffusion and synaptic content were specifically altered by D-serine, we focused our attention on GluN2B-NMDAR surface staining after incubation with <italic>Bs</italic>GO or <italic>Rg</italic>DAAO. The exposure time was an important parameter to take into account. Indeed, although we were able to detect changes of single GluN2B-NMDAR surface dynamics few minutes after incubation with D-serine, we were not able to detect similar changes using classical immunostaining (e.g. 10 min incubation, data not shown). Changes in synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR with immunostaining were only observed after 30-60 min incubation with D-serine. Thus, we incubated neurons with BsGO or RgDAAO for 45 min. The incubation of neurons with BsGo or RgDAAO did not change the surface content of GluN2B-NMDAR (BsGO: 108 ± 6%, RgDAAO: 107 ± 7% compared to control; control n=50, BsGO n=49, RgDAAO n=50 cells, 5 independent experiments, P=0.7093, Kruskal-Wallis test) nor the synaptic content (GluN2B surface clusters juxtaposed to the Homer1c labeled clusters; BsGO: 115 ± 8%, RgDAAO: 114 ± 8% compared to control, P= 0.5340, Kruskal-Wallis test). At first glance, this outcome may be surprising as we expected a reduction of GluN2B-NMDAR with the enzymes. However, the capacity of the enzymes to scavenge over time the co-agonists is likely not stable, particularly in a living brain cell network. Thus, these experiments do not shed clear lights, as a temporal control of the co-agonist need to be performed with such long incubation with scavenger enzymes. Consequently, we did not include these lines of experiments, as they are not yet informative, in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors show that D-serine reduces the synaptic staining for GluN2B without affecting the total number of GluN2B clusters. In the synaptosome preparation, while the GluN1 and GluN2A levels were not affected by D-Serine application, the GluN2B content was significantly reduced. It is not clear how the authors, based on these results can assume that D-Serine does not change the total amount of NMDARs in the synaptosome. Indeed, since GluN1 homomers cannot be delivered at the membrane, a reduction in GluN2B should be accompanied by an increase in GluN2A content or by an increase in the content of other NMDA receptor subunits.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it was intriguing that only GluN2B-NMDAR levels were altered in presence of D-serine, with no change in GluN1- and GluN2A-NMDAR. An obvious speculation is that the content of other NMDAR subtypes (not investigated in this study) is altered in these conditions. We have now have mentioned this point in the revised manuscript (subsection “Synaptic content of GluN2B-NMDAR is reduced by exogenous application of D-serine”).</p><p><italic>In the Materials and methods, we did not find the explanation for the analysis of the% change in synaptic content.</italic> </p><p>A more detailed description of the analysis of% change in synaptic content has now been added to the Materials and methods in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors should show the blot of the total homogenate.</italic> </p><p><italic>To block the interaction between intracellular scaffolding proteins and the C-terminus of GluN2B, the authors used TAT-GluN2B15 peptide mimicking the last 15 aminoacids of GluN2B. There is a discrepancy between the diffusion coefficient of GluN2B in presence of D-Serine between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Since in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the diffusion coefficient has been calculated in presence of TAT-NS, it seems that TAT itself can affect the mobility of the receptors. The authors should probably try to use a lower concentration of the TAT.</italic> </p><p>The TAT peptides are cell penetrating compounds that are used to deliver big molecules that otherwise would not cross the lipophilic barriers. However, we fully agree that these peptides can have side effects. The 20 µM concentration used for the TAT peptide experiments is based on former evaluations of the binding constants, as well as detrimental effect on the NMDAR surface diffusion (Bard et al., 2010). Here, we report that D-serine effects were “attenuated” in the TAT-NS conditions when compared to the “no peptide” condition, suggesting that the TAT peptide alone affect the receptor trafficking. To tackle this point, we tested the effect of a lower concentration of the TAT peptides (2 µM) on the surface expression of GluN2B subunit, as proposed by the reviewer. Even with such a low concentration the TAT-NS, D-serine effects were “attenuated” when compared to a “no peptide” condition, indicating that the discrepancy between “control” and “TAT-NS” values raised by the reviewer are most likely TAT peptide-induced off-target effects. This set of data has now been included into the revised manuscript (section, “Co-agonist-dependent regulation of GluN2B-NMDAR trafficking depends on interaction between NMDAR and PDZ scaffolds”).</p><p><italic>In the immunocytochemistry experiments, the authors should use instead of Homer1c, PSD-95 for the co-localization with the receptors. This experiment will also provide the control for the efficiency of the TAT to block the interaction.</italic> </p><p>Since the TAT peptides disrupt the interaction with several PDZ-containing proteins, not only PSD-95, we used Homer1c, which does not bind directly to the GluN2B subunit, and therefore is potentially less easily modified by the TAT disrupting peptides. Having a stable synaptic marker is obviously important for our quantification method. Nevertheless, we followed the reviewer suggestion and performed additional experiments in which we evaluated the co-localization between surface GluN2B-NMDAR and PSD-95 clusters to assay the efficiency of the TAT-GluN2B15 peptide. Following a 45 min incubation with TAT-NS or TAT-GluN2B15 (2 µM), the number of GluN2B surface clusters that colocalize with PSD-95 clusters was reduced by the TAT-GluN2B15 peptide (TAT-NS incubation, 7.5 ± 0.5 clusters per 10 µm, n= 30 cells, 3 independent experiments; TAT-GluN2B15: 5.8 ± 0.3 GluN2B clusters per 10 µm of dendrite, n= 30 cells; P=0.0091, t-test). These new data have been included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, controls are missing.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the control value in the revised manuscript: “To note, there was no significant difference between control (no agonist) and glycine condition (control: 2.2 ± 0.4, n=4 independent experiments; glycine: 1.9 ± 0.2, n=4; P&gt;0.05, t-test)”.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the authors should provide the co-ip in the presence of TAT.</italic> </p><p>As now included into the manuscript (see above), the TAT peptide by itself attenuate the effect of D-Serine on the trafficking of GluN2B-NMDAR. As co-ip experiment are surely less discriminant than live immunocytochemistry and obvious single molecule imaging, we did not perform this experiment as it will not provide better insight into the molecular machinery.</p><p><italic>The FLIM data are inconclusive. These experiments were done carefully, but unfortunately, the probes that are used are just not at all sensitive – that is, they barely change their lifetime with the conditions. This deficit was seen in the original manuscripts reporting these probes. This fact does not rule out that C-terminal dynamics could be responsible but the statistics bear out that the effects are tiny. In the subsection “D-serine alters the conformation of NMDAR C-terminus”, the authors state that &quot;D-serine.… strongly decreased&quot; with lifetime changing from 2302 ps to 2279 ps! This change is minute. 20ps average changes in lifetime are not meaningful, particularly with a frequency FLIM measurement. These translate into FRET distances in the low Å range, that is, smaller than an individual amino acid. The level of significance reached with a hundred of measurements is quite small and therefore I would not draw conclusions from this section. The question therefore, is what to do with the FRET section. It doesn't add strongly to the conclusions or the mechanism, but doing this experiment was the right thing to do. What is really required here is a FRET pair that is a better reporter (totally beyond the scope of this work). I would favour keeping this data in the paper, but strongly toning down the interpretation, something like:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Although we could measure small changes in FRET lifetimes, it is not clear whether these changes reflect biologically meaningful interactions among those proteins. More investigations with more robust reporters will be required to strengthen the relationship between D- Serine and intracellular conformational changes.&quot; Of course, the other references (e.g. Discussion) to this part should be toned down too.</italic> </p><p><italic>Please also make more efforts to synthesise all the data.</italic> </p><p>We obviously agree with the reviewer that the observed effects are small, although fully significant. Most importantly for FRET experiments, we performed all the adequate control experiments with several constructs that clearly demonstrate our capacity to measure the interaction between GluN1 subunits. In the revised manuscript, we agreed to tune down some of our sentence, without altering our conclusions. We used the proposed sentences of the reviewer, as seen in the subsection “D-serine alters the conformation of NMDAR C-terminus” of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The &quot;subunit switch&quot; as measured here is between 1/3 and 2/3 in magnitude (current). This effect is similar in size to the trafficking effect at its greatest, and the synaptic content as measured by live cell imaging. The effects in biochemistry and with the peptide disrupting PSD95 binding are smaller, which is no surprise. There are parts of the text (FLIM data) where effect size is overstated. Does everything add up? I found it hard to judge. Perhaps a conservative approach is best, but I would like to see the authors approach the question – could D-serine dependent trafficking be the entire story for the subunit switch?</italic> </p><p>Our intent was not to claim that D-serine is the entire story for the NMDAR subunit switch. To avoid such a misunderstanding, we have now edited our manuscript, emphasizing the role of other mechanisms in the developmental adaptation of the NMDAR signaling (e.g. role of mGluR5; Discussion, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
