lasting changes in neural circuits requires the identification and investigation of the specific ensembles of neurons that are responsible for the encoding of each experience. We have developed a Robust Activity Marking (RAM) system that allows for the identification and interrogation of ensembles of neurons. The RAM system provides unprecedented high sensitivity and selectivity through the use of an optimized synthetic activity-regulated promoter that is strongly induced by neuronal activity and a modified Tet-Off system that achieves improved temporal control. Due to its compact design, RAM can be packaged into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV), providing great versatility and ease of use, including application to mice, rats, flies, and potentially many other species. Cre-dependent RAM, CRAM, allows for the study of active ensembles of a specific cell type and anatomical connectivity, further expanding the RAM system’s versatility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13918.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13918.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13918.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every experience – be it a sight, a sound or a memorable event – activates a unique set of neurons within the brain that together are known as a neuronal ensemble. Identifying these ensembles is key to deciphering how the brain represents experiences and stores them in memory. The most commonly used method for doing so at present relies upon a class of genes called immediate early genes (or IEGs for short). Whenever a neuron becomes active, it switches on its IEGs. By genetically modifying animals to use this mechanism to drive the production of protein markers – such as a fluorescent protein – it is possible to visualize and control the neurons that become activated in response to a stimulus.</p><p>However, existing IEG-based systems for detecting neuronal activity are not ideal. In particular, these systems could be made more sensitive (so that they are more likely to respond to neuronal activity) and more specific (so that they are more likely to respond <italic>only</italic> to relevant neuronal activity). Sørensen, Cooper et al. have now developed a new system for tagging recently activated neurons that offers a number of advantages over its predecessors.</p><p>Known as Robust Activity Marking (RAM), the new system consists of a specially designed DNA sequence that is switched on by neuronal activity. Compared with currently existing systems, the RAM system has low levels of background activity, meaning that it only becomes active in actively firing neurons. It is also extremely sensitive and gives a robust signal. An additional advantage of the RAM system is that the timing of its activation can be precisely controlled. This is useful for identifying those neurons that become active in response to one particular sensory stimulus.</p><p>The DNA elements in the RAM system that respond to neuronal activity are conserved, which means it could be used in a variety of species, from fruit flies to primates. The relatively small size of the RAM system means that, in contrast to other IEG-based systems, it can be introduced into brains by packaging the entire DNA sequence inside a virus particle that can infect a wide range of experimental species. Finally, the design of the RAM system allows it to be targeted to specific subtypes of neurons and to cells that are connected in particular ways.</p><p>Together, the multiple advantages of the RAM system over traditional IEG-based systems should make it possible for neuroscientists from many different fields to explore how the brain stores experiences in patterns of neuronal activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13918.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13918.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

This has been demonstrated in the past several decades by in vivo electrophysiological and calcium imaging experiments in which the activity of neuronal ensembles has been correlated with behavior in active animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grewe and Helmchen, 2009</xref>). Understanding the process whereby experience is converted to long-term memory and consequent behavioral modification requires that <italic>relevant</italic> ensembles of neurons be defined precisely and genetically to allow functional interrogation and manipulation.</p><p>Transcription events triggered within neurons by neuronal activity are key to neural circuit plasticity, ensemble formation, and ultimately information storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzowski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>). Experience-dependent transcription events thus present a promising way to genetically identify neurons responsible for encoding learned experiences in vivo. However, the transcriptional profile must fit the following two criteria: (1) very low basal expression in the absence of salient experience and (2) strong induction by neuronal activity associated with experience and behavior. Immediate early genes (IEGs) such as <italic>Fos, Arc</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> meet these criteria quite well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzowski et al., 2001</xref>), and their promoters have been used to control the expression of effector genes such as fluorescent proteins and opsins in genetically engineered mouse lines, allowing active ensemble labeling and functional perturbation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeyne et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eguchi and Yamaguchi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denny et al., 2014</xref>). However, significant technical obstacles greatly limit the usability of these systems.</p><p>The biggest challenge is to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of neuronal ensemble identification. Existing systems suffer from high background, i.e. labeling of neurons unrelated to the experimental stimulus of interest, which confounds precise identification of the relevant active ensemble. The level of background labeling is determined by the characteristics of the IEG promoter used and the method of temporal control used to isolate events happening within a desired experimental time window. Therefore, to address the problem of background labeling, we wanted to develop an IEG-sensitive promoter with an optimized activity-dependent induction profile and incorporate it into a platform with improved temporal control of effector gene expression.</p><p>In addition, the use of transgenic reporter lines in existing systems requires laborious breeding and is experimentally inflexible. Therefore, we also aimed to develop a system in which both the activity-dependent transcription component and the effector genes for neural circuit interrogation are delivered using a single adeno-associated virus (AAV). In addition to bypassing the requirement for multiple transgenic mouse lines, an entirely viral system can also be used in species other than the mouse.</p><p>Here we present a virus-based platform for the analysis of active neuronal ensembles, which we call the Robust Activity Marking (RAM) system. The following features of the RAM system make it highly selective, sensitive, and versatile: (1) a synthetic neuronal activity-dependent promoter with very low expression in basal conditions prior to a designated experience and strong induction by neural activity during the experience for robust ensemble labeling; (2) a modified Tet-Off system that provides improved temporal control; (3) small size, well within the packaging limit of a single AAV; (4) modular design so that the promoter and effector genes can be easily substituted to address different experimental questions; and (5) proven transferability to species other than the mouse, making it a valuable tool for the wider neuroscience community. We demonstrate the use of the RAM system to interrogate active neuronal ensembles in several different regions of the murine and drosophila brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of a synthetic activity-regulated promoter</title><p>To find a small promoter broadly responsive to neuronal activity, we searched for highly enriched DNA elements among 11,830 previously identified neuronal activity-regulated enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) site (TGANTCA), a consensus sequence for the FOS/JUN family transcription factors, was initially identified as the most highly enriched motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further considered that multiple transcription factors often bind enhancers co-operatively or competitively to tightly regulate gene expression in a combinatorial manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermsen et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore tried combining the AP-1 site with the binding motif of the neuronal-specific activity-dependent gene <italic>Npas4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramamoorthi et al., 2011</xref>) (NRE: TCGTG) to increase the sensitivity and specificity of our promoter.</p><p>We inserted the core NRE/AP-1 DNA motifs into the central midline element (CME), a characterized transcriptional regulatory sequence whose secondary structure is favorable for transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wharton et al., 1994</xref>), resulting in a 24 bp 'enhancer module.' Unless otherwise stated, we assembled promoters by placing four tandem repeats of an enhancer module upstream of the human <italic>FOS</italic> minimal promoter, resulting in a 199 bp synthetic promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

We named this promoter P<sub>RAM</sub>. The CME alone was not responsive to activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Furthermore, P<sub>RAM</sub> performance was not improved by replacing the NRE/AP-1 element with other highly enriched AP-1 containing 10mers found in the 11,830 neuronal activity-regulated enhancers, indicating the significance of the NRE and AP-1 combination in our design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In general, we found no correlation between 10mer enrichment and fold induction in the luciferase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We proceeded with further characterization of P<sub>RAM</sub> and found that removing or substituting the minimal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>), or changing the number of enhancer modules substantially reduced the fold induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). When compared to several other activity-regulated promoters, P<sub>RAM</sub> had among the highest fold induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and the highest relative luciferase activity in response to neuronal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). We compared P<sub>RAM</sub> to another recently developed synthetic activity-dependent promoter, ESARE, which was based on the promoter of the IEG <italic>Arc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawashima et al., 2013</xref>). ESARE had a significantly lower fold induction, due to its high basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Notably, P<sub>RAM</sub> has by far the largest fold induction of any activity-dependent promoter small enough to be packaged into an AAV.</p><p>We next verified that P<sub>RAM</sub> has the characteristics expected from the presence of the FOS and NPAS4 binding motifs. Indeed, over-expression of FOS, NPAS4, or both proteins in combination was sufficient to drive transcription through P<sub>RAM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Expression from P<sub>RAM</sub> was strongly induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>) and by various growth factors known to induce <italic>Fos</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>). When expressed in glia, P<sub>RAM</sub> had minimal basal activity and no activity-dependent induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d</xref>). We concluded that P<sub>RAM</sub> is a neuron-specific and highly activity-dependent promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The RAM system: a modular bicistronic AAV vector with optimized temporal control of gene expression</title><p>We next constructed the RAM system, incorporating P<sub>RAM</sub> into the doxycycline-dependent Tet-Off system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gossen et al., 1995</xref>). Specifically, P<sub>RAM</sub> drives the expression of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA), which efficiently activates the tTA-responsive element (TRE) promoter driving the effector gene cassette. Binding of tTA to TRE can be blocked by administration of the antibiotic doxycycline (Dox), preventing expression of the effector gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and allowing temporal control of gene expression.</p><p>Our preliminary evaluation of the conventional Tet-Off system showed that the accumulation of tTA outside of the designated experimental window contributed to the undesirable background expression of effector genes. We therefore created a destabilized version of tTA, d2tTA, by fusing the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (MODC) to the N-terminus of tTA. Using a luciferase assay after co-transfecting a TRE-luciferase plasmid with either P<sub>RAM</sub>-tTA or P<sub>RAM</sub>-d2tTA into cultured neurons, we found that using d2tTA led to significantly lower basal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>), tighter Dox regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and improved fold induction by a factor of 7–8 compared with conventional tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> shows the final design of the RAM system AAV vector.

Using an optimized titer of AAV-RAM-tdT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>), close to 100% of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons were infected at DIV7. With Dox absent throughout, at DIV14 approximately 5% of neurons (MAP2-positive cells) were labeled with tdT under unstimulated conditions, while nearly 90% of neurons were labeled following bicuculline (Bic) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP) stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–i</xref>). RAM labeling was tightly controlled by Dox, with no labeling cells detected when Dox was present after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–i</xref>). No glial cells were tdT positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Thus, our AAV-based RAM system showed strong induction and low background, as desired.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optimizing in vivo labeling using the RAM system</title><p>We carried out a series of experiments to determine optimal working parameters for our AAV-based RAM system in vivo. For these experiments, we chose the nuclear localized, red-shifted fluorophore NLS-mKate2 as the effector gene. For all in vivo experiments in mice, AAV-Ef1α-EGFP, which constitutively expresses EGFP in infected neurons, was co-injected as an infection control. The titer of the EGFP control virus was adjusted so that nearly 100% of neurons at the injection site were infected. To optimize the RAM virus, animals were placed on a Dox diet 24 hr before viral injection into the hippocampus, and allowed to recover for at least 7 days before administration of kainic acid to induce seizures, which robustly stimulates the limbic system and fully activated P<sub>RAM</sub> in the majority of AAV-RAM infected neurons. With an optimized titer, more than 90% of EGFP+ neurons were also RAM+ after seizure. Using this setup, we found that animals should optimally be off Dox for 24–48 hr before behavioral manipulation (in this case the manipulation was seizure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>), and that effector gene expression peaked within 24 hr following behavioral manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,e–g</xref>).

First we virally targeted the dentate gyrus (DG) sub-region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which is known to express IEGs after CFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Each cohort of animals was divided into the following five treatment groups: (1) left unperturbed in the home cage (HC), (2) CFC, (3) exposed to the novel context only without shock (Context Only) and (4) exposed to immediate shocks (Shock Only) and (5) kainic acid-induced seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>). We quantified the percentage of EGFP+ cells that were RAM+ (labeled with NLS-mKate2) in each treatment group. We found a significant increase in RAM+ cells in both the CFC and Context Only group, compared to the HC animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Importantly, RAM labeled a very similar number of DG neurons in animals exposed to Context Only as in those that underwent CFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), which is consistent with published studies showing that the hippocampus forms contextual representations independent of shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rudy and O'Reilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanselow, 2000</xref>) and that similar levels of IEG induction occur for these two conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramamoorthi et al., 2011</xref>).

We examined RAM labeling in this region in animals subjected to tone-fear conditioning (TFC), a form of cued associative learning known to require the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pare and Duvarci, 2012</xref>).

When CRAM-tdT virus was injected into the DG of Gad2-Cre mice, only GABAergic neurons (most prominently somatostatin-expressing neurons in the hilus) and none of the glutamatergic granule cells were labeled with tdT after kainic acid-induced seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>). While IEGs are known to be induced by experience in GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>), active ensembles of GABAergic neurons have not been explored. Using Cre driver mouse lines for various types of neurons, we envision the CRAM system as a tool well suited to investigating active ensembles of GABAergic neurons and other specific neuronal cell types.</p><p>Like the RAM system, CRAM also worked well in the rat, in this case to identify neuronal ensembles with specific anatomical connections. Since a major projection of the rat PFC is the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>), we injected a retrograde canine adenovirus that expresses Cre recombinase into the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to deliver Cre to DMS-projecting mPFC neurons. AAV-CRAM-tdT was subsequently injected into the mPFC and the animals were subjected to IS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i–j</xref>). We observed significantly more tdT-labeled neurons in animals subjected to IS compared to HC controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k–l</xref>), suggesting CRAM successfully labeled IS-activated mPFC neuronal ensembles that project to the DMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we present the RAM (Robust Activity Marking) system, which makes possible the sensitive and specific labeling and manipulation of the active ensembles of neurons associated with a designated sensory and behavioral experience. Compared to existing methods used to gain access to recently active neuronal ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeyne et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eguchi and Yamaguchi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawashima et al., 2013</xref>), the RAM system delivers unprecedented versatility and much improved selectivity. Additionally, the system showcases a novel, informatics-based approach to constructing small synthetic IEG-sensitive promoters. We believe that this approach could be used to generate other small yet highly sensitive promoters that, when combined with the RAM platform, would allow in vivo interrogation of specific activity-dependent genetic programs.</p><p>The most important features of a neuronal-activity reporter system are high sensitivity and selectivity, resulting from a combination of low background labeling and robust effector gene expression in the active ensemble associated with a designated experience. RAM achieves exceptionally high selectivity and sensitivity through the use of an optimized activity-dependent promoter with the highest fold induction we have observed among existing small activity-regulated promoters, paired with an improved version of the Tet-Off system. In vivo RAM achieved 37-fold and five-fold increases in labeling after CFC, compared to HC controls, in CA3 and DG, respectively. This is significantly greater than the two–three-fold induction achieved using existing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>). The five–37-fold induction achieved with the RAM system implies that 80–97% of the labeled neurons are truly associated with the specific experience, compared to 50–67% with existing technologies, representing a dramatic improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. This improvement alone means that the RAM system can be used in many brain regions and behavioral applications where existing methods will not work.</p><p>With its high sensitivity and selectivity, the RAM system will be ideal for functional perturbation experiments in which the activity of ensemble neurons, identified by RAM, can be manipulated through the targeted expression of effector molecules such as opsins. We show the expression of opsins in CFC-induced, RAM-labeled ensemble neurons can be activated or inhibited 24 hr after CFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a–j</xref>), demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach using RAM. Based on the robust results we obtained by applying RAM to label ensembles in several brain regions (DG, CA3, amygdala and mPFC) using appropriate behavioral paradigms (CFC, TFC and IS), we anticipate that RAM can be readily used to investigate neuronal ensembles in other brain regions, such as CA1, striatum, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, etc., for a variety of behavioral manipulations in the future.</p><p>Like all other existing activity reporters currently being used in the neuroscience field, the sensitivity of the RAM system has not been systematically measured. For example, we do not know the activation threshold for RAM. More specifically, what is the minimal amount of neuronal activity required to activate RAM? What type of neuronal activity is preferentially captured by RAM? How well can RAM distinguish information-carrying neuronal firing from fluctuating noise? Future experiments aimed to obtain these basic operational parameters for RAM, and for any activity reporter, will be critical for us to be able to use these reporters to gain mechanistic understanding of how sensory and behavioral information is processed in the brain.</p><p>As for any IEG-based activity reporter, the efficiency of RAM labeling in particular brain regions or of particular cell types depends on their propensity to express IEGs. For example, activated PV+ neurons appear to be less likely to express IEGs. Even after pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure, only about 20% of the PV+ neurons, compared to over 80% of somatostatin expressing (SST+) neurons, in the cortex were transcriptionally activated to express FOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>). A similar trend was observed in DG after KA-induced seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4a, c</xref>), suggesting either PV+ neurons may be less likely to be recruited to active ensembles or they may require non-IEG-based approaches to be effectively labeled.</p><p>The compact design of the RAM system allows it to be packaged into a single AAV while still accommodating an effector gene up to 1.8 Kb in size. The RAM system can readily accommodate most of the effector genes commonly used to label or manipulate neural circuits. We envision future experiments using effector genes for genetic profiling (e.g. RIBO-TRAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>]), rabies-mediated monosynaptic anatomical tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaway, 2008</xref>), and functional perturbation of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4e,j</xref>). In cases where other, larger promoters and/or larger effector genes are needed, the RAM system can split between two AAVs, one containing the d2tTA expression cassette and the other the TRE-effector cassette.</p><p>Cre-dependent RAM (CRAM) extends the versatility of the RAM system even further. For example, CRAM can be used to study active neuronal ensembles of a particular cell type when Cre expression is controlled by a cell type-specific promoter in a mouse line or virus. Also, by delivering Cre via retrograde and anterograde viruses, neuronal ensembles with specific anatomical connectivities can be explored. Finally, a Flp-dependent RAM system could easily be developed, allowing additional applications of the system.</p><p>Since the P<sub>RAM</sub> 10mer is highly enriched in activity-dependent enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and enhancers are mostly conserved between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), P<sub>RAM</sub> is likely to be active in many different species. Here we demonstrate that P<sub>RAM</sub> works in mice, rats and flies, but it may be applicable to other species as well. Given the flexible design of the RAM system and the relative ease of AAV production, the system makes possible many new and powerful experiments in a field with relatively few viable tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Screening for enriched enhancer</title><p>The coordinates on the mouse chromosome mm9 assembly for the 11,830 activity regulated enhancers identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al.

Enrichment for each 10mer was calculated as the total number of occurrences in the four central bins (i.e. the −80 to +80 region) divided by the total number of occurrences in the eight furthest bins on each flank (−1000 to −681 and +681 to +1000). The larger flanking regions were used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the fold enrichment at the enhancer center relative to the flanks. The enrichment factor, E, adjusted for the larger size of the flanking bins, was defined as E = 4*C/F, where C is the number of hits in the central bins and F is the number of hits in the flanks. The significance of finding each motif was calculated using a binomial test (in MATLAB) under the null hypothesis that the hits should be equally distributed between the center and flanks. The p-value is given by p=1-CDF (4*C, 4*C + F, 0.5), where CDF (n, N, 0.5) is the cumulative distribution function of finding n elements from a binomial distribution with parameters N and 0.5. If there were no hits in either the center bins or the flanks, the p-value was set to 0.5, and the motif was not considered further. The motifs were ranked by their enrichment factors.

Cultures were plated at 100,000 cells per well on 24-well plates coated with poly-D-lysine. Cultures were incubated in Neurobasal A Medium (NBA, Life Technologies) with horse serum and glutamine added. The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After three hours of incubation, the medium was changed to NBA supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and GlutaMAX (Life Technologies). Neurons were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) on DIV5. Reporter plasmids (in pGL4.11) expressing firefly luciferase and a plasmid expressing renilla luciferase under control of the constitutive thymidine kinase promoter (TK)-Renilla (Promega) were co-transfected in every experiment.

The Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System reagents were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Firefly luciferase levels were measured and expressed relative to renilla luciferase levels.

Fold induction of luciferase was calculated as the ratio between stimulated and unstimulated conditions.</p><p>The primary criterion we used to evaluate the synthetic promoters for use as neuronal activity reporters was the fold change in luciferase expression. This is the ratio of the relative luciferase values between stimulated and unstimulated conditions and represents the activity-dependence and selectivity of the promoter. A secondary criterion was the absolute expression level after stimulation, which is the absolute luciferase value normalized against an internal control and reflects the absolute transcriptional strength of the promoter. It is possible for a weak promoter to have high fold induction, due to extremely low activity under basal unstimulated conditions, but to only drive transcription modestly, which will limit its ability to drive the expression of an effector gene to sufficient levels to achieve the required effects.</p><p>Drugs and neurotrophic factors, typically applied together with 10 μL NBA into the wells, were used at the following final concentrations: TTX (1 μM, Tocris), APV (100 μM, Tocris), Nimodipine (5 μM, Tocris), Bicuculline (50 μM, Sigma Aldrich), 4AP (250 μM, Tocris), recombinant human BDNF (50 ng/μL, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), recombinant human NT3 (50 ng/μL, PeproTech), recombinant human NT4 (50 ng/μL, PeproTech), recombinant human IGF1 (50 ng/μL, PeproTech), recombinant human EGF (50 ng/μL, PeproTech), Forskolin (10 μM, Tocris) and PMA (100 ng/μL, Tocris).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Construction of RAM viral vector</title><p>The AAV vector V032 (pFB-AAV-CMV-WPRE-SV40pA, kindly provided by Rachael Neve) served as the backbone for constructing the AAV-RAM vector. All components within the 5’-ITR and 3’-ITR defined by the Mlu1 and Kpn1 sites, respectively, were first removed from V032. At the 5’-ITR site, the TRE promoter followed by a multiple cloning site (MCS), WPRE and bGH poly(A) signal was inserted as one expression cassette in the 5’ to 3’ direction. In the same orientation, the second expression cassette, consisting of P<sub>RAM</sub> driving d2tTA followed by a SV40 poly(A) signal, was inserted downstream of the first cassette and terminated by the 3’-ITR. The two expression cassettes were insulated by incorporation of synthetic poly(A) and RNA polymerase II transcriptional pause signals (both derived from pGL4.11) between the two cassettes. Fluorescent proteins, including tdTomato and mKate2, and the two opsins, Channelrhodopsin (ChR2, a kind gift from Gloria Choi) and Archaerhodopsin (ArchT, a kind gift from Ed Boyden), were inserted into the MCS.

However, the number of reporter+ neurons is comparable between home cage and contextual conditioning paradigms (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C), so it's unclear whether reporter expression in Gabaergic Sst+ neurons (panel d) represents reporter induction in response to conditioning or basal expression seen in control home cage conditions.</p><p>As far as I can tell, there is no control for the aggressive social interaction test of reporter induction in the prefrontal cortex (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G-H).

This tool has the potential to be an important new addition to the arsenal for defining and manipulating cell populations based on neuron activity changes. They developed the RAM promoter, which gives improved signal to noise over past IEG systems and also is compact enough to fit easily inside an AAV vector. This promoter can be used to drive fluorescent proteins and optogenetic neuronal actuators. They go on to demonstrate the application of this tool in mice in a seizure model, contextual fear conditioning, auditory conditioning as well as other models in rat and fly. In addition, a Cre-dependent variant on the tool is described.</p><p>The tool depends on the tetOff tTA system, and doxycycline is administered to reduce background expression after viral expression and prior to the experiment. However, there is some ambiguity here because in the rat model, the dox was excluded and low background was apparently maintained. The use of dox appears to be important for the use of this tool, but the necessity of this component needs to be more explicitly expanded upon so that a future user is well-positioned to understand its importance. In addition, further explanation is required for the modest colocalization of Fos (note Fos, not c-Fos, is the MGI protein abbreviation) with mKate2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the A-A conditions (only about 20%). Although this colocalization is significantly greater than the context A-B, there is no explanation why the colocalization is not higher. Because the expectation is that expression off of this promoter reflects IEG expression in neurons, this discrepancy is especially concerning as it is an essential aspect for application of this tool. Further examination or explanation of this issue is required.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13918.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Manuscript 13918 by Sorensen et al. describes a new method to identify active neurons in vivo and to conditionally express transgenes.

Comment?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer made the very insightful point that the CA1 region is much better established in a place field paradigm. We chose to focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) in this study mainly out of experimental convenience. The DG has been extensively examined in contextual fear conditioning (CFC), making it an excellent region to validate activity reporters. By targeting DG, not only can our results be conveniently compared to other published studies, it also allows us to examine the specificity of the RAM system using the A-A/A-B type of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Being an important region for place field paradigm, CA1 should be thoroughly examined in the future.</p><p>There are two concerns raised about The A-A/A-B experiment (the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). First, the low percentage (~20%) of overlap between RAM+ and Fos+ neurons in the A-A experiment (Reviewer #3). Second, the relatively small difference in overlap between A-A (~22%) and A-B (~13%) conditions (Reviewer #1).</p><p>These are legitimate concerns. To address these concerns, we have carefully examined published studies. Since the behavioral manipulations involved vary considerably, the IEGs used for these experiments are not the same, and the quantification methods and statistical analyses also vary significantly, it is extremely difficult to directly compare numbers between studies. Nevertheless, we tried our best to compare our data to studies done in dentate gyrus using contextual fear conditioning. We found our results to be either comparable to or even more impressive than published studies. For example, a study from the Gage lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in Deng et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2013;2:e00312) reported a ~6% overlap between Fos reporter (Fos-tTA::<italic>tetO-tau-lacZ:tTA*</italic>) positive and Fos+ neurons for A-A exposure. Another study from Dr. Rene Hen’s lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Denny et al. Neuron 83, 2014) showed a 5% or 4% overlap between the Arc-CreER reporter positive neurons and Fos+ or Arc+ neurons for A-A exposure, respectively. While the Gage study didn’t detect a difference in overlapping population between A-A and A-B, the Hen study showed a significant difference between A-A (~4%) and A-B (~2%) conditions. Our data are perhaps best aligned with the study from the Tonegawa lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in Ramirez et al. Science 341, 2013), in which they reported, using a very different quantification method, ~1.8% vs. ~0.9% DAPI+ cells being doubly labeled by the Fos-tTA reporter and Fos antibody under A-A vs. A-B conditions. Assuming the Fos-tTA reporter labeled ~6% neurons following CFC (based on another study from the Tonegawa lab, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in Liu et al. Nature 484, 2012), for the Ramirez study we can estimate that ~30% and 15% of cells labeled by Fos-tTA were also Fos+ for A-A and A-B conditions respectively. This is comparable to our study. Critically, although the overall number of overlapping neurons varied wildly between studies, the trend is a roughly 2-fold increase in overlap between A-A and A-B conditions. In this respect, our data falls in line with the published literature. We have emphasized this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>I would have liked to see a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> looking at dentate 48 hrs after removal of Dox but without kainic acid.</italic> </p><p>This is basically the home cage control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and D.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could benefit from a schematic showing the injection site.</italic> </p><p>A schematic showing the injection site has been included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p><italic>Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> is very nice showing optogenetic control and might be substituted for panels E-G.</italic> </p><p>The optogenetic control is kept as supplementary data.

To the best of my knowledge, no one has systematically examined the activation sensitivity of any of the activity reporters being used in the field. Systematic characterization of activity reporters is very important for the neuroscience field and we are actively working on this using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. However, the process is quite involved. Most of the approaches we tried in vitro in cultured neurons, including using channelrhodopsin and KCl dosage as suggested by Reviewer #2, turn out to be quite invasive and non-physiological. We are currently developing better methods to tackle this problem. As such, we don’t have results to answer the question, but we have included this very important point in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Some controls appear to be missing for the in vivo studies relating to kainic acid induced seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and contextual or tone conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). How many neurons express the reporter 24 hours following:saline rather than kainic acid injection;placement in the contextual testing chamber without being shocked;hearing the tone in the testing chamber without being shocked?</italic> </p><p><italic>These controls will reveal how likely the neurons under consideration express reporter without the experimental manipulation being tested.</italic> </p><p>There are some points regarding the activity induction of interneurons.</p><p>1) Can RAM label activated PV+ neurons (Reviewer #1)?</p><p>2) Reviewer #2 pointed out that the control for the social defeat experiment (original Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H) was missing, making it unclear whether there is behaviorally-mediated reporter induction in the GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>To address these concerns, we used inescapable stress paradigm to determine whether RAM labeling is induced in GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex and if RAM can also label PV+ neurons. The answers to both questions are Yes. The result has been included in the revised manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2 requested the following control experiments.</p><p>1) Saline injection control for kainic acid injection in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 5. The purpose of the seizure condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> was to demonstrate the infection efficiency of the RAM virus, not to compare seizure vs. non-seizure condition. The saline injection control is therefore unnecessary.</p><p>2) Context without shock control in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>We have included this control and, in addition, the immediate shock control in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Consistent with published studies showing context alone significantly induces IEG expressions, the number of RAM+ neurons for context only is numerically very similar to the context + shock condition. Also, the immediate shock didn’t seem to activate RAM at all, which suggests neuronal ensembles labeled by RAM are specifically involved in contextual learning.</p><p>3) Amygdala TFC sound only control in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>We have now included both tone only and shock only controls for the TFC experiment in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref>). In addition, we also included a comparison between LA and basal amygdala (BA). Our results are very much consistent with our current understanding of the functions of these two sub-regions of the amygdala, as well as IEG expression data for those regions after TFC. RAM only significantly labels LA under the tone + shock condition, but not by tone alone or shock alone. In contrast, all conditions significantly activated RAM in BA.</p><p><italic>3) I really appreciate the authors' extending their validation of reporter induction to multiple brain regions and Glu and Gabaergic neurons. However, the number of reporter+ neurons is comparable between home cage and contextual conditioning paradigms (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C), so it's unclear whether reporter expression in Gabaergic Sst+ neurons (panel d) represents reporter induction in response to conditioning or basal expression seen in control home cage conditions.</italic> </p><p><italic>As far as I can tell, there is no control for the aggressive social interaction test of reporter induction in the prefrontal cortex (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G-H). What is the level of basal reporter expression in the home cage in prefrontal cortex? A comparison between the control and aggression conditions would reveal whether there is reporter induction in the Gabaergic neurons in this region.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please provide a schematic of the experimental setup for the in vivo CRAM studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Clarify what &quot;% overlap&quot; means as the y-axis label in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>.</italic> </p><p><italic>3) The first paragraph of the subsection “Application of the RAM System to Other Species” needs to be corrected; AAV-RAM was tested in rats and</italic> P<sub>RAM</sub> <italic>was tested in flies.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Application of the RAM System to Other Species”: cite study showing PFC projection to dorsal striatum.</italic> </p><p>The above points have been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Correct discrepancy between Methods and Supplementary Figure legend: was the social interaction/ aggression test done for 5 or 10 min?</italic> </p><p>The social interaction/aggression experiment in mice has been replaced with inescapable stress experiment in rats.</p><p><italic>6) The authors will be depositing the basic AAV-RAM vector with Addgene. I also encourage them to deposit the CRAM version of the vector and other plasmids described here, including the ones for flies (but see below).</italic> </p><p>As stated in the revised manuscript, both AAV-RAM and AAV-CRAM plasmids, from which other plasmids used in the study can be derived, have been at Addgene and will be available upon the publication of our manuscript.</p><p> <italic>7) Frankly, the fly data seem a bit rushed. For example, do we even know whether luciferase expression is even restricted to the nervous system? I would suggest that the authors hold on to the fly data and submit it as a more complete, separate story.</italic> </p><p>Although I agree with the reviewer that the fly data are not as thorough as we might prefer, I feel that the RAM promoter will be of great interest to the fly community. As far as I know, there is no good activity reporter currently available for use in the fly. Upon discussing with you, the fly data is kept in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript by Sorenson et al. reports extensive characterization of a new tool for marking and manipulating neurons based on immediate early gene expression. This tool has the potential to be an important new addition to the arsenal for defining and manipulating cell populations based on neuron activity changes. They developed the RAM promoter, which gives improved signal to noise over past IEG systems and also is compact enough to fit easily inside an AAV vector. This promoter can be used to drive fluorescent proteins and optogenetic neuronal actuators. They go on to demonstrate the application of this tool in mice in a seizure model, contextual fear conditioning, auditory conditioning as well as other models in rat and fly. In addition, a Cre-dependent variant on the tool is described.</italic> </p><p><italic>The tool depends on the tetOff tTA system, and doxycycline is administered to reduce background expression after viral expression and prior to the experiment. However, there is some ambiguity here because in the rat model, the dox was excluded and low background was apparently maintained. The use of dox appears to be important for the use of this tool, but the necessity of this component needs to be more explicitly expanded upon so that a future user is well-positioned to understand its importance. In addition, further explanation is required for the modest colocalization of Fos (note Fos, not c-Fos, is the MGI protein abbreviation) with mKate2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the A-A conditions (only about 20%). Although this colocalization is significantly greater than the context A-B, there is no explanation why the colocalization is not higher. Because the expectation is that expression off of this promoter reflects IEG expression in neurons, this discrepancy is especially concerning as it is an essential aspect for application of this tool. Further examination or explanation of this issue is required.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #3 pointed out that Dox was not used in experiments done in rats and wondered if the Dox control would work well in the rat. Although not included in the initial submission, we have also used Dox to control RAM expression in the rat, which yielded much more impressive labeling specificity. These experiments replace the old figure panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
