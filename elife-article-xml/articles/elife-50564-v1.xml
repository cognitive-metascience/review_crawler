We developed a transgenic zebrafish line that allows for cell-type-specific labeling and imaging of nascent proteins in the entire animal. By replacing leucine with glycine in the zebrafish MetRS-binding pocket (MetRS-L270G), we enabled the cell-type-specific incorporation of the azide-bearing non-canonical-amino-acid azidonorleucine (ANL) during protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins were then labeled via 'click chemistry'. Using a Gal4-UAS-ELAV3 line to express MetRS-L270G in neurons, we measured protein synthesis intensities across the entire nervous system. We visualized endogenous protein synthesis and demonstrated that seizure-induced neural activity results in enhanced translation levels in neurons. This method allows for robust analysis of endogenous protein synthesis in a cell-type-specific manner, in vivo at single-cell resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>cell type specific</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>translation control</kwd><kwd>neuron specific</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF-643-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shahar</surname><given-names>Or David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie 628003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shahar</surname><given-names>Or David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>743216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The development of a transgenic zebrafish allows for cell-type-specific labeling of neuronal protein synthesis, enabling brain-wide visualization and quantification of protein synthesis and demonstrating region-specific increases following elevated brain activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein synthesis is critical for remodeling synaptic proteomes, especially when this process is associated with information storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>).

Moreover, a variety of neurological syndromes including epilepsy have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kundap et al., 2017</xref>). The zebrafish larval brain is small and translucent, enabling high-resolution imaging of cells. The complexity of brain tissue, however, is still an issue. Neurons, in particular, have long processes, which are tightly entangled in their respective tissues. As such, monitoring protein synthesis levels with cell-type and temporal resolution has so far been impossible in zebrafish neurons, highlighting the need for the methodology developed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-type-specific labeling of newly synthesized proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic demonstrating the method to visualize newly synthesized proteins in the brain in a cell-type-specific manner.

These platforms have recently been coupled with genetic control, allowing access to particular cell types. For example, the wild-type Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) can be modified to enable the charging of a different azide-bearing non-canonical amino acid, the methionine analog azidonorleucine (ANL), which cannot be charged by the wild-type MetRS. By using cell-type-specific promoters, the mutant MetRS can be expressed in cell types of interest and the nascent proteins can be labeled via the administration of ANL, as has been demonstrated in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuet et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To date, overall levels of protein synthesis within neurons across the entire intact brain have not yet been measured and imaged in any vertebrate. The existing protein synthesis reporters used for most single cell analyses rely on fluorescent tagging of individual protein species and therefore do not measure endogenous nascent protein levels. Here we demonstrate for the first time the ability to label and image in situ newly synthesized proteins in vivo in a cell-type-specific manner. We visualized nascent neuronal proteins across the entire animal. Combining a specific Gal4 reporter line with the UAS-MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> and adding ANL for various durations enabled cell-type-specific labeling with temporal control. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of the protein synthesis signal to alterations in neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-type-specific nascent protein tagging</title><p>To enable cell-type-specific non-canonical amino acid tagging in zebrafish, we cloned and mutated the zebrafish MetRS to introduce a point mutation (L270G) at a conserved position in the methionine binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We developed a transgenic line in which the conditional expression of CFP and the MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> (separated by T2A) is under the control of the UAS enhancer. When these fish are crossed to a Gal4 line with a cell-type-specific promoter, cell-type-specific incorporation of azidonorleucine (ANL) into nascent proteins can be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). In order to realize cell-type-specific labeling of newly synthesized proteins in neurons, we crossed the UAS-CFP- MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> line with a well-established pan neuronal driver Gal4 line, ELAVL3-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Following the addition of ANL, the charging of ANL by MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> and its incorporation into protein, a click reaction was performed and newly synthesized proteins were visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that zebrafish nascent proteins can be globally labeled with the non-canonical amino acid azidohomoalanine (AHA) via its addition to the swim water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinz et al., 2012</xref>). We added ANL to the swim water and determined whether there were any apparent behavioral effects. Freely swimming larvae were incubated with different concentrations of ANL for 24 hr (hrs) and the average swim speed was measured. We found that ANL concentrations of 10 mM or less did not affect larval swimming behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We describe a UAS line that allows one to tag newly synthesized endogenous proteins in a cell type-of-interest simply by crossing it with any specific Gal4 driver line.</p><p>Given the importance of protein synthesis for many biological processes, labeling nascent proteins for imaging within the intact organism will be useful for future studies. Non-canonical amino acids have been used to elucidate different biological processes including protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>), protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>) and local protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tcherkezian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously used AHA to label nascent proteins in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinz et al., 2012</xref>) without cell type specificity. To achieve cell-type-specific labeling in mice and other species, we have mutated the MetRS in the evolutionarily well-conserved methionine-binding pocket, resulting in cell type specificity of nascent protein labeling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mahdavi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We detected CFP expression levels above background in all cells with ANL labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Generally, we observed a positive correlation between the intensity levels of CFP (a proxy for the MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> mutant expression) and nascent protein, but there were a few cells detected with a very low expression of CFP and high nascent protein intensity or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The general positive correlation between CFP and nascent protein is expected because CFP is synthesized within the cells of interest and its level of protein synthesis will likely reflect the general translational activity of the cell. Cases in which the expression of CFP is not proportional to the nascent protein labeling may be explained by the following: the CFP labeling intensity is a result of both expression and degradation. CFP may thus bedegraded to a greater or lesser extent in some neurons. Zebrafish larvae exhibit high levels of neural activity during swimming and other natural behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Many neuronal activity-dependent regulatory processes use both protein synthesis and proteasome-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langebeck‐Jensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djakovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bingol and Schuman, 2006</xref>) to remodel the proteome. Recently, evidence for the coordination of protein synthesis and proteasome dependent degradation has been observed, including the degradation of nascent proteins by a neuron-specific 20S membrane proteasome complex (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramachandran et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that dynamic translation and degradation processes result in diverging levels of CFP and other proteins.</p><p>The fact that we detect neurons in which there is strong intensity of nascent proteins with only a faint CFP signal may suggest that even a low amount of the MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> mutant is sufficient for ANL incorporation into nascent proteins. We observed variation in the nascent protein intensities between larvae and between cells within the same larva and even within the same region and between neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings visualizing fluorescently labeled newly synthesized proteins using the non-canonical amino acid AHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu and Cline, 2016</xref>).</p><p>ANL incorporation into nascent proteins was detectable in situ following 12 hr of exposure in the swim water, circumventing the need for ANL administration through food or drink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erdmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>), and allowing better control over the concentration and duration of ANL exposure. This relatively short time window opens opportunities to measure protein synthesis levels in many biological paradigms. We have tried shorter incubation durations but the signal was sparse, the signal-to noise was too low and the variability between cells and between different larvae was high, indicating that shorter incubation time is not sufficient to measure nascent protein levels under these conditions. As far as we know, the 12 hr duration demonstrated here is the shortest available time frame so far for cell-type-specific metabolic labeling.</p><p>We demonstrate that this method can be used to address biological questions by labeling nascent proteins in neurons during an induced seizure-like behavior. PTZ-induced seizure-like behavior in zebrafish larvae results in higher expression levels of immediately early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>). We have previously shown a general increase in protein synthesis, using the non-canonical amino acid AHA which can incorporate into nascent proteins in all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinz et al., 2012</xref>), following exposure of zebrafish larvae to PTZ. However, it was not possible in that study to determine whether the increased protein synthesis signal arose from neurons or other cell types. Here, we used PTZ to induce seizures and revealed an increase in neuronal protein synthesis. Furthermore, the specific labeling of newly synthesized proteins in neurons reduces background signals and noise from other cell types, thereby allowing us to compare different brain regions and neuron groups. For example, the habenula is a highly conserved structure that has been implicated in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hikosaka, 2010</xref>). We found a significant increase in protein synthesis in the habenula following PTZ-induced seizures. Our findings are consistent with an increase in immediately early gene expression following PTZ-induced seizures in the habenula as has been reported in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Bel et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The method described here is robust: ANL, which is incorporated into nascent proteins, and the fluorescent alkyne used for imaging form a strong covalent bond allowing for stringent washes and hence low background signal. While the click chemistry used here precludes live imaging, the ANL incorporation takes place in vivo while the larvae are freely swimming and behaving. Therefore, the duration of the labeling can be chosen according to the studied cell-type, the protein synthesis levels (and degradation), and the biological question. The ability to label newly synthesized proteins in vivo for a pre-chosen duration and to then ‘freeze’ the result before imaging has advantages. Because of the strong stability of the fluorescently labeled newly synthesized proteins following the click reaction one can image the entire larvae, as demonstrated here. This is especially useful for labeling neural networks during dynamic physiological processes such as cumulative calcium influx activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>) or protein synthesis following neural activity (demonstrated here). Beyond the contribution to neuroscience, this platform can be adopted by crossing the UAS-MetRS<sup>L270G</sup> zebrafish line described here to any existing Gal4 driver line of interest.</p><p>Zebrafish larvae have the advantage of being both translucent and smaller than mammals, therefore allowing one to label and image nascent proteins in an entire intact brain or other tissues without the need to slice the tissue. Future experiments using cell-type-specific newly synthesized proteins in zebrafish could include investigating the loci of learning and memory formation. Protein synthesis is essential for the formation of many types of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agranoff et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flexner et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). The method described here, combined with zebrafish larva learning paradigms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>), will enable future studies to reveal the neural networks in which protein synthesis occurs during learning and memory formation. Therefore, methods combining zebrafish larva with cell-type-specific protein synthesis labeling will be widely applicable.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti GFP</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A11122</td><td valign="top">IF(1:600)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Chicken polyclonal anti GFP</td><td valign="top">Aves</td><td valign="top">Cat# GFP 1010</td><td valign="top">WB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey polyclonal anti-chicken IR680</td><td valign="top">Licor</td><td valign="top">Cat# 926–68075</td><td valign="top">WB(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-rabbit IR800</td><td valign="top">Licor</td><td valign="top">Cat# 925–32211</td><td valign="top">WB(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Zebrafish line</td><td valign="top">HuC-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Stevenson, T.

During the last 20 min, larvae were moved to a chamber with swimming lanes that allowed single larvae to freely swim. The positions of the larvae were recorded with a camera at 1 Hz, and tracked automatically with a Matlab script to measure swimming distance and speed. In all the fluorescent labeling experiments, the ANL concentration was 10 mM. 0.1 mM 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) was added to the E3 water at 1 dpf for all larvae in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Click chemistry for fluorescent tagging</title><p>3–4 dpf old larvae were anaesthetized on ice for 45 min. Larvae were transferred to 1.5 ml tubes and washed once with clean E3. E3 was removed and replaced with 1 ml fixation solution (4% PFA, 4% Sucrose in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4)), and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking. Next, larvae were dehydrated in Methanol at −20°C overnight. Samples were gradually rehydrated through successive 5 min washes with 75% methanol in PBST (PBS+0.1% Tween-20), 50% methanol in PBST, 25% methanol in PBST and PBST. Samples were incubated 3 times for 5 min in PBDTT (PBST + 1% DMSO and 0.5% Triton X-100) and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBST for 45 min for permeabilization. Following one wash with PBST, larvae were post-fixed for 20 min in 4% PFA and 4% Sucrose in PBS. Samples were washed 3 times for 5 min in PBDTT and incubated for 3 hr at 4°C in blocking buffer (5% BSA, 10% goat serum in PBDTT). Samples were then washed 3 times for at least 10 min in PBST (pH 7.8). ANL labeled proteins were tagged using a click reaction. To 1 ml PBS (pH 7.8) TBTA (Sigma-Aldrich) 1:500 (stock 200 mM in DMSO, final 0.2 mM) was added followed by a 10 s vortex, TCEP (Thermo Scientific) 1:400 (stock 40 mM in H<sub>2</sub>O, final 0.5 mM), 10 s vortex, 1:500 AlexaFluor-647-alkyne (Invitrogen, stock 2 mM in DMSO, final 2 μM), 10 s vortex, and 1:500 CuSO<sub>4</sub> (stock 200 mM in H<sub>2</sub>O, final 0.2 mM) followed by 30 s vortex. The above click reaction buffer was immediately added to tubes containing the larvae and kept overnight in the dark, at 4°C with gentle agitation. Samples were washed 4 times for 30 min in PBDTT with 0.5 mM EDTA and twice for one hour in PBDTT and kept in PBS (pH 7.4) until mounting. For immunofluorescence, samples were incubated in blocking buffer (10% serum in PBS) for 1 hr and incubated with 1:600 rabbit anti GFP antibody (Invitrogen A11122; to detect CFP) in blocking buffer overnight with gentle agitation at 4°C. Samples were washed in PBST twice and PBS 3 times (~10 min each wash), incubated with blocking buffer for ten minutes and incubated with an Alexa-488 fluorescent secondary antibody (goat anti rabbit, ThermoFisher A1008) overnight with gentle agitation at 4°C. Samples were washed twice with PBST and PBS (pH 7.4). After click or immunofluorescence, the samples were gradually moved to glycerol through successive 5 min washes (25% glycerol in PBS, 50% glycerol in PBS, 75% glycerol in PBS) and finally 100% glycerol and kept at 4°C in dark.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>BONCAT</title><p>Larvae were incubated with 10 mM ANL for 24 hr. After incubation, the media was replaced with fresh E3. Larvae were sacrificed on ice-cold water (30 min). Heads were dissected using a scalpel and immediately snap frozen in tubes (1.5 ml, Eppendorf) that were pre-cooled using dry ice and stored at −80C until lysis. Tissue was homogenized and lysed using a pestle in lysis buffer (1% in Triton X100, 0.4% (w/v) SDS in PBS pH 7.8, 1:1000 EDTA free protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) and benzonase (Sigma, 1:1,000), and denatured at 75°C, 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation. BONCAT was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dieterich et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, 60 μg proteins were dissolved in 120 μL PBS pH 7.8 supplemented with 0.01% SDS, 0.1% Triton, 300 μM Triazol (Sigma, 678937), 50 μM biotin-alkyne tag (Thermo, B10185) and 83 μg/mL CuBr (prepared by dilution of fresh 10 mg/mL solution in DMSO) at 4°C overnight in the dark. Biotinylated proteins were then separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with 1:1000 chicken anti-GFP (Aves), 1:1000 rabbit anti-biotin (Cell signaling) and Donkey anti-chicken IR680, goat anti-rabbit IR800 (IB, 1:10,000, Licor) antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Larvae were directly, or after dissection to remove the eyes and yolk sack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), mounted on Mattek dishes with the dorsal side facing the glass bottom of the dish prior to imaging. Larvae were imaged using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope and a 25X glycerol objective (NA 0.8, PSF: X 0.389, Y 0.336, Z 1.62). Spacing between z planes = 1.89 micron. 488 and 633 lasers were used for Alexa488 and Alexa647, respectively (filters: 504–563 and 652–702, respectively). To image the entire brain, tiling was done with 10% overlap using the ZEN program with a scaling of 0.332 micron per pixel and a 12-bit mode; tiles were stitched together using the ZEN program after imaging. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, in order to allow for the clear visualization of 3-dimensional data of an entire larva in 2 dimensions, a collage was made to exclude non-relevant planes (e.g: in each region of the tail, only 3–5 planes out of ~150 contain neurons, therefore a maximal projection of the entire stack would impede a clear visualization of the neurons).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>3D fluorescence intensity analysis</title><p>Stitched images were imported to Imaris 9.2. Cell segmentation was conducted using CFP channel intensities. Surface segmentation of cells in the entire image was based on the Marching cube algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorensen and Cline, 1987</xref>) using the Imaris program. In some regions where we noticed that the segmentation did not perform well, a regional segmentation was performed again using the same algorithm with a manual threshold in smaller specific ROIs. False positive objects that were not real cells, such as salt crystals, were deleted based on morphology. Splitting of touching objects was allowed using the watershed algorithm. In some cases where splitting of touching objects failed due to a high density of neurons, a few cells were inevitably considered as one. The threshold of the minimal volume was set to 10 μm<sup>3</sup>, and of the minimal ‘sphericity’ was set to 0.75. An example of segmentation in a low density ROI can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, and in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>. Segmentation of a densely labeled ROI in the habenula is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>. After segmentation in the CFP channel, the intensity values were measured in both the CFP and the ANL channels (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or for the ANL channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). For each cell, the average voxel intensity was calculated and documented. Next, based on the average cell intensities, the average intensity of cell in a region or an entire larva was calculated. Finally the mean intensity between 3 to 4 larvae was calculated for each region or entire larvae and plotted (n = 3 or 4). The error bars in all the graphs represent Standard Error of the Mean (SEM), unless otherwise noted. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the bars represent SEM between cells. In all the other graphs, error bars represent SEM between the average intensities of several larvae. One-tailed, two-sample unequal variance (heteroscedastic) TTESTs were used for calculating all the p values (p).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jan Gluesing and Anja Staab for technical assistance, Anett-Yvon Loos for fish husbandry and managment, Doug Campbell for plasmid design, Alejandro Pinzon-Olejua for help with line screening, Susanne tom Dieck for ANL synthesis and Florian Vollrath for image processing assistance.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Large scale cell-type-specific imaging of protein synthesis in a vertebrate brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all three reviewers agreed that this tool was useful for the zebrafish field and could be easily adopted by investigators, the fact that this method has already been established in other model organisms and is an extension of previous work diminished the overall novelty and significance of this tool. In addition, reviewers also had suggestions for improving demonstration of specificity of this tool (see full comments below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Shahar and Schuman apply a bio-orthogonal approach to study the dynamics and extent of protein synthesis in a cell type specific manner in zebrafish. By driving MetRSL270G expression under the ELAVL3 neuron-specific promoter, and adding the unnatural amino acid, azidonorleucine (ANL) to the swim water, the authors observe ANL incorporation indicative of new protein synthesis in neurons in the heterogenous environment of the brain and spinal cord. Using this approach. They then show that protein expression is increased upon seizure induction using the GAG receptor antagonist, PTZ. The authors suggest that the approach can, in principle, be extended to other tissues and cell types and questions, with the UAS line generated serving as a tool for the community.</p><p>Previously, the Schuman lab showed that it is possible to examine protein synthesis using a similar approach in whole larvae (Hinz et al., 2011). They now extend their previous findings to a tissue-specific manner (i.e larval brain and spinal cord neurons) and which (as they report in the Introduction) has been shown previously in other organisms. The Gal4 UAS system for cell type specific expression has been used in zebrafish for a long time. The ability to image sites of protein synthesis in the brain of intact animals post behaviour is likely to be of use to identify regions of the brain important for behaviour (- which is currently visualised in vivo by large through calcium imaging). Overall, the manuscript is straightforward and easy to understand. However, it does not represent a significant advance.</p><p>– The authors should examine ANL incorporation upon inhibition of protein synthesis using cycloheximide or other protein synthesis inhibitor. This will determine if the labelling is specific.</p><p>– The 12 hour incorporation window for the UNAA appears rather long in the context of a fast developing zebrafish larva. What is the half -life of ANL? And what is the shortest ANL exposure window within which incorporation can be detected. Though the 2 hour PTZ treatment shows clear differences over control larvae, a shorter ANL exposure might decrease noise from protein synthesis.</p><p>– It would be helpful to discuss the advantages/disadvantages of this approach as compared to other approaches to estimate newly synthesized proteins.</p><p>– Figure 4 graph D is specific for the animal shown in images B and C, but does not appear to be representative for all the animals analysed, as shown in graph E. It would be useful to do this experiment without ANL and with ANL in wild type controls to examine background autofluorescence or non-specific click reactions post PTZ incubation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Or and Schuman describe a method for cell type specific evaluation of new protein synthesis in intact Zebrafish using transgene expression of a mutant MetRS, that is modified to only charge the non-canonical amino acid, azidonorleucine (ANL). This is a valuable method that will likely be widely used in the Zebrafish community. The method and analysis are described in sufficient detail to allow most investigators to apply it successfully.</p><p>Addressing the following points would strengthen the paper.</p><p>1) Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested that expression of mutant MetRS during development was detrimental. Does use of HuC-gal4 address this problem? In addition to swimming speed, the authors should test behaviors indicative of brain function, such as sensory information processing, to address the concern of developmental toxicity.</p><p>2) The data (for instance Figure 2G) indicate that NSP labeling is not consistently proportional to CFP levels, as a proxy for mutant MetRS expression. Although there are many potential reasons for this, the authors should comment on this potentially interesting observation, and in particular mention variation in rates of protein synthesis and rapid turnover of NSPs within the 24h period examined.</p><p>3) It is not correct to refer to 'the intensity of protein synthesis' since NSP lifetimes can be &lt;24h.</p><p>4) Similarly 'averaged translation intensity' is not an accurate term.</p><p>5) Can the authors comment on the efficiency of ANL labeling NSPs compared to other available methods?</p><p>6) Is application of this method limited to Zebrafish larvae or can is be used in older animals? Does ANL penetrance to the brain change over larval development?</p><p>7) The text and figure legends differ in statements about use 3 or 4 dpf larvae.</p><p>8) The subsection “Induced seizures result in higher protein synthesis levels in neurons” refers to 2.5 h in PTZ. Figure 4A legend and schematic say 2 h.</p><p>9) Subsection “Detection of endogenous nascent proteins in neurons across the brain”. The FUNCAT label in neuronal processes could be NSPs that were synthesized in somata and transported into processes. It is not accurate to claim demonstration of sensitivity to detect dendritic protein synthesis in vivo.</p><p>10) The demonstration of the cell body segmentation in sparsely labeled brain is very nice, but segmentation using Imaris is challenging in densely labeled regions like the habenula.

The method relies on expressing a mutated Methionyl tRNA synthetase in neurons using the well-established elav promoter. The mutated enzyme loads the unnatural amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL) instead of methionine into polypeptides. ANL can then be visualized using click-chemistry with a fluorescent alkyne. Using this protocol, authors show brain wide labeling in neurons and increase in intensity following chemically-induced seizures. As mentioned by the authors in the Introduction, cell-type specific labeling of new proteins has been shown before in <italic>C. elegans, Drosophila</italic> and mice and its establishment in zebrafish larvae is not a major advancement. All of the images in the manuscript are of fixed larvae. Given the obvious advantages of zebrafish for in vivo imaging, the paper would have been exciting if the authors were able to track novel protein synthesis in live animals. But the permeabilization steps required for click-labeling preclude such a possibility. There are other possibilities too such as cell-type specific proteomics characterization of the ANL-labeled proteins but this manuscript does not go that far.</p><p>In addition, the authors could address the following to make the manuscript stronger:</p><p>1) The authors will do well to establish better the specificity of this tool by showing more control data. Figure 2A shows that there is some labeling even in wild type. Authors need to show the corresponding fluorescence image (WT+ANL+) in Figure 1G. WT+ANL+ control data must also be added to Figure 3. Additionally, even without ANL addition, there is some labeling (Figure 2A, middle lane), probably corresponding to non-specific binding of the fluorescent tag. Thus, not all the signal observed corresponds to novel protein synthesis. A quantification of this non-specific background is required.</p><p>2) Related to the point above, were the ANL- samples in Figures 1 and 2 processed for click-dye labeling? Why are the images completely dark?</p><p>3) In Figure 2G, authors show colocalization of CFP and click-label in confocal stacks made from 4-6 planes spanning several cell layer thickness. Single optical slices need to be shown.</p><p>4) Authors report average of averages in Figures 2H and 2I. As such, the variability in signal amplitude seen in different neurons will likely be much higher than the spread shown. It is not clear how much variability is seen within one region, say habenula, in a single larva. It will also be better to show the data scatter for the bar plots shown in 2H and 2I. This is now standard practice.</p><p>5) Why were the spinal cord and habenula alone chosen for the PTZ experiment?</p><p>6) Authors call data in Figure 4D and E &quot;Protein Synthesis Level&quot;. This is too strong – the signal likely reflects NET incorporation of ANL deriving from both synthesis and degradation of proteins.</p><p>7) Supplementary Figure 3 does not seem to be referred anywhere in the text.</p><p>8) There are several places where the figure panels and their description in legends or the Results section are mismatched.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50564.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

In addition, to the swim speed data in the original submission, we have now added additional behavioral data regarding the intact light preference of larvae. Furthermore, we detect active swimming of freely swimming larvae according to their natural preference in a chamber upon frequent light/dark changes in defined regions within the chamber.

The method relies on expressing a mutated Methionyl tRNA synthetase in neurons using the well-established elav promoter. The mutated enzyme loads the unnatural amino acid azidonorleucine (ANL) instead of methionine into polypeptides. ANL can then be visualized using click-chemistry with a fluorescent alkyne. Using this protocol, authors show brain wide labeling in neurons and increase in intensity following chemically-induced seizures. As mentioned by the authors in the Introduction, cell-type specific labeling of new proteins has been shown before in C. elegans, Drosophila and mice and its establishment in zebrafish larvae is not a major advancement. All of the images in the manuscript are of fixed larvae. Given the obvious advantages of zebrafish for</italic> in vivo <italic>imaging, the paper would have been exciting if the authors were able to track novel protein synthesis in live animals. But the permeabilization steps required for click-labeling preclude such a possibility. There are other possibilities too such as cell-type specific proteomics characterization of the ANL-labeled proteins but this manuscript does not go that far.</italic></p><p>Whereas the click chemistry precludes live imaging, the ANL incorporation is done in vivo while the larvae are freely swimming and behaving. The experimentalist can choose the duration of the labeling according to the studied cell-type, the protein synthesis levels (and degradation) and the biological question. The ability to label newly synthesized proteins in vivo for a prechosen duration and then “freeze” the result before imaging has advantages. Because of the strong stability of the fluorescently labeled newly synthesized proteins following the click reaction (which forms covalent bonds), one can image the entire larvae as we demonstrated. In the revised manuscript, we added paragraphs in the Discussion regarding the advantages and state of the art.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors could address the following to make the manuscript stronger:</p><p>1) The authors will do well to establish better the specificity of this tool by showing more control data. Figure 2A shows that there is some labeling even in wild type. Authors need to show the corresponding fluorescence image (WT+ANL+) in Figure 1G. WT+ANL+ control data must also be added to Figure 3. Additionally, even without ANL addition, there is some labeling (Figure 2A, middle lane), probably corresponding to non-specific binding of the fluorescent tag. Thus, not all the signal observed corresponds to novel protein synthesis. A quantification of this non-specific background is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the WT ANL+ control for all the experiments and now add the add images of WT ANL+. The WT ANL+ control for Figure 2F (previously 2G) is in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 3. We also added the relevant image to the modified Figure 3, now including the WT ANL+ control. We did not add the quantification because the CFP channel (not existing in WT) was used for the segmentation. We used “lookup table fire”, because otherwise the image would look too dark. Quantification of the ANL- fluorescence can be found in Figure 2H. We added quantification of Figure 2A in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the point above, were the ANL- samples in Figures 1 and 2 processed for click-dye labeling?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are the images completely dark?</p></disp-quote><p>They are not completely dark. It looks dark because the background is low in the absence of ANL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2G, authors show colocalization of CFP and click-label in confocal stacks made from 4-6 planes spanning several cell layer thickness. Single optical slices need to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We added as a new figure. Please see Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors report average of averages in Figures 2H and 2I. As such, the variability in signal amplitude seen in different neurons will likely be much higher than the spread shown. It is not clear how much variability is seen within one region, say habenula, in a single larva. It will also be better to show the data scatter for the bar plots shown in 2H and 2I. This is now standard practice.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the figure to include the average intensities of all the individual neurons. Please see the modified Figure 2. We moved the previous graphs to the supplementary figure: Figure 2—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why were the spinal cord and habenula alone chosen for the PTZ experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>They were chosen as two exemplar regions with clear morphology and different density of neurons as well as different roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Authors call data in Figure 4D and E &quot;Protein Synthesis Level&quot;. This is too strong – the signal likely reflects NET incorporation of ANL deriving from both synthesis and degradation of proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.
