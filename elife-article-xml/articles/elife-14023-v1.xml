Here we report functional outcomes of non-nuclear Notch signaling to activate autophagy, a conserved cellular response to nutrient stress, regulating survival in murine natural T-regulatory cells (Tregs), an immune subset controlling tolerance and inflammation. Induction of autophagy required ligand-dependent, Notch intracellular domain (NIC) activity, which controlled mitochondrial organization and survival of activated Tregs. Consistently, NIC immune-precipitated Beclin and Atg14, constituents of the autophagy initiation complex. Further, ectopic expression of an effector of autophagy (Atg3) or recombinant NIC tagged to a nuclear export signal (NIC-NES), restored autophagy and suppressor function in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Tregs. Furthermore, <italic>Notch1</italic> deficiency in the Treg lineage resulted in immune hyperactivity, implicating Notch activity in Treg homeostasis. Notch1 integration with autophagy, revealed in these experiments, holds implications for Notch regulated cell-fate decisions governing differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14023.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14023.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14023.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A cell must have access to adequate amounts of nutrients if it is to survive and perform its role in the body. Some cells, including immune cells, must travel around the body to sites where nutrients may be in short supply. For example, a type of immune cell called the T-regulatory cell travels to wounds and other hostile places where other types of immune cells are actively fighting infections and/or damaged cells.</p><p>The T-regulatory cell’s job is to reduce excess or harmful immune activity to prevent the immune system from damaging healthy cells in the body. However, it was not clear how they survive and protect themselves in these tough situations. In 2012, researchers showed that a protein called the Notch receptor helps the T-regulatory cells survive in conditions where nutrients are scarce.</p><p>Now, Marcel et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2012 study – have investigated how the Notch receptor protects mouse T-regulatory cells. The experiments show that T-regulatory cells grown in nutrient-poor conditions in the laboratory activate a protective mechanism known as autophagy. This mechanism recycles damaged or nonessential structures within the cell into nutrients. The Notch receptor is needed to trigger autophagy at the right time and the loss of this receptor causes the cells to die when they are starved of nutrients.</p><p>Further experiments found that the Notch receptor is essential for the T-regulatory cells to work properly in mice. Animals born lacking this receptor in T-regulatory cells quickly develop inflammation in response to even minor irritations. More studies are needed to reveal the details of this protective strategy, and to find out if it is used by other cells in the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14023.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14023.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>T-cells</kwd><kwd>Signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR13446/COE/34/30/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarin</surname><given-names>Apurva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09/860[0137]/2012-EMR-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcel</surname><given-names>Nimi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch1 activates autophagy to regulate the survival of T-regulatory cells from mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Notch signaling is a conserved pathway, directed by ligand-dependent processing, culminating in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NIC) from its membrane-tethered precursor, allowing its translocation to the nucleus to initiate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). Signaling through Notch1 is obligatory for acquisition of T-cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radtke et al., 1999</xref>). However, Notch signaling is differentially activated during T-cell development and in mature T-cells, including the differentiation of induced Tregs (iTregs) from Foxp3<sup>-ve</sup> naive T-cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radtke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yvon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wolfer et al., 2001</xref>). The transcription factor Foxp3 specifies Treg identity and unlike in induced (i)Tregs where Notch1 regulates Foxp3 expression in response to activation cues, in naturally arising Tregs, Foxp3 expression is developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, activated Tregs are also distinguished by non-nuclear Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Macro-autophagy (autophagy) is a conserved catabolic process, which buffers cells from limiting nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>),and is controlled by the evolutionarily conserved Atg/ATG family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). Autophagy is implicated in the regulation of diverse aspects of immunity including the differentiation and homeostasis of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells and Treg function amongst other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deretic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parekh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism[s] by which autophagy is regulated in T-cell subsets are likely diverse and not characterized. In this study we describe Notch1 signaling to autophagy in the context of activated Treg survival and consequences to Treg function.</p><p>Through the analysis of Tregs, activated by T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking in vitro, we show that (non-nuclear) Notch1 regulates survival via the activation of an autophagy-signaling cascade. In agreement with their central role in coordinating decisions of cell death and survival, mitochondria were a prominent cellular target, responsive to perturbations of the Notch-autophagy cascade. We validate these interactions by reconstituting the Notch-autophagy cascade in Notch1 deficient Tregs. We also show that Notch1 confers cytokine-independence via the activation of autophagy in T-effectors, which are derived from naïve T-cells. The consequence of Notch activity in Treg physiology is assessed in two contexts: One, the suppression of antigen-induced T-cell proliferation and correction of defective glucose clearance in genetically obese mice using adoptive transfers of test Treg populations. Second, the characterization of inflammation and increased activation of T-cell subsets occurring in mice with <italic>Notch1</italic> ablated in the Foxp3 (Treg) lineage. Collectively, these findings suggest a hitherto unappreciated role for the (non-nuclear) Notch-autophagy axis in the regulation of natural Treg function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>T-cells depend on cytokines for nutrient uptake and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purushothaman and Sarin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vella et al., 1998</xref>). A role for Notch1 activity in regulating survival in the absence of exogenous cytokines of activated Tregs has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>), however, the cellular mechanisms activated by Notch1 in this context are not known. Autophagy, a conserved catabolic process is implicated in survival in response to nutrient stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lum et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, we investigated if Notch signaling to autophagy regulates activated Treg survival following cytokine withdrawal. Unless otherwise mentioned, the analysis in this study is based on experiments with natural Tregs activated in vitro.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytokine withdrawal triggers autophagy in Tregs</title><p>To assess a role for autophagy in Treg survival, activated Tregs are switched to complete medium, which contains serum but is not supplemented with the cytokine IL-2. Cells are monitored at various time points for induction of autophagy or survival following modulations described in the sections that follow. The recruitment of the microtubule-associated protein LC3 and its smaller lipidated form LC3II, into the autophagosome membrane is a molecular signature and necessary event in the progression of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). The change in LC3 can be detected in immunoblots of cell lysates, where the modified isoform is detected at a reduced molecular weight or by immunostaining intact cells when large puncta are marked by antibodies to LC3.</p><p>An increase in the LC3II isoform was detected in lysates of Tregs, which had been cultured without IL-2 for 6 hr, relative to the onset of the assay (T0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunostaining with the same antibody as used for the immunoblots and visualization of intact cells by confocal microscopy, showed that diffuse LC3 staining observed in Tregs at T0, progressively changed to large, readily visualized puncta by 6 hr, persisting till 15 hr following cytokine-withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The inclusion of Bafilomycin A (Baf), which blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion or 3-Methyladenine (3MA), at the onset of the cytokine deprivation assay resulted in cell death, when measured at 15 hr, indicating that Treg survival was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To validate observations made with chemical inhibitors, we expressed shRNA to Vps34 (the lipid kinase regulating initiation of autophagy) or to Atg7, proteins implicated in autophagy progression, by retroviral infection coupled with antibiotic selection (as described in methods) to generate activated Tregs populations ablated for Vps34 or Atg7 protein expression. The loss of either VpS34 or Atg7 in activated Tregs resulted in cell death following cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), establishing a requirement for these intermediates in Treg survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Notch1 activity regulates autophagy in Tregs</title><p>We next asked if Notch1 is required for activation of autophagy in activated Tregs in response to cytokine withdrawal. These experiments tested for the involvement of non-nuclear, ligand-dependent Notch1 activity, shown earlier to promote Treg survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>). A pharmacological inhibitor of the enzyme γ-secretase, (GS inhibitor)-X, inhibits cleavage (S3 cleavage post ligand binding) and release of NIC. Culturing Tregs with GSI-X abrogated survival following cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In GSI treated cells, immunestaining for Notch1 showed that that staining was restricted to the cell membrane, confirming that receptor cleavage is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, induction of LC3 puncta was not observed in Tregs cultured with GSI during cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that autophagy is not activated. Earlier work from the laboratory had identified a non-redundant role for the ligand Delta Like Ligand (DLL)-1 in Treg survival. Confirming ligand-dependence, ablation of DLL-1 in Tregs, compromised survival and induction of LC3 puncta in cells cultured without cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Contrastingly, but in agreement with published analysis of NIC1 signaling in Tregs, both the induction of LC3 puncta or cytokine-independent survival in Tregs was unchanged following shRNA-mediated ablation of RBPJ-κ, a co-factor of NIC transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The ablation of RBPJ-κ attenuated expression of Hes1 a target of NIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) confirming efficacy of shRNA ablation. Taken together, these data suggested that ligand dependent Notch1 activity was required for autophagy and regulation was independent of canonical Notch interactions, such as those requiring RBPJ-κ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14023.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Notch regulates induction of autophagy in Tregs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Apoptotic damage in Tregs cultured for 15 hr without IL-2, with or without GSI. (<bold>B</bold>) Representative images of Tregs cultured without IL-2, with or without GSI-X for 6 hr, stained for NIC (mNIA, red) and Hoechst 33342 (blue).

In consonance with dependence on autophagy, retroviral transduction of recombinant Atg3 in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Tregs restored survival following cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Atg3 is an E2-ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzyme, which catalyzes the lipidation of the effector protein LC3I (ATG8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mizushma et al., 1998</xref>), a key step in autophagy progression. Atg3 is also implicated in maintaining mitochondrial health under conditions of nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Besteiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radoshevich and Debnath, 2011</xref>). From these experiments we concluded that Notch1 activation of autophagy was necessary for Treg survival following cytokine withdrawal in culture.</p><p>NIC is enriched in the cytoplasm of Tregs (shown later and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>), and we tested if non-nuclear NIC activity regulated autophagy following cytokine withdrawal. Towards this aim, we employed an approach used by others and us to achieve nuclear export of recombinant NIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shin et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs were retrovirally transfected with recombinant NIC tagged to a <underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>E</underline>xport <underline>S</underline>ignal (NIC-NES), which prevents nuclear residence. NIC-NES transfected Tregs express a recombinant predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). NIC-NES expression protected <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs from apoptosis following cytokine-withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and this protection is attenuated by the inclusion of Baf or 3MA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, non-nuclear NIC activity could activate autophagy signaling in Tregs following cytokine withdrawal.</p><p>We next assessed if proteins in the autophagy cascade immune-precipitated with NIC. In Tregs initiated into cytokine-deprivation, an antibody specific for Notch1 (mN1A) but not an IgG (isotype control) immune-precipitated Beclin1 and Atg14 but not Vps34 and LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating that NIC formed complexes with specific components of the autophagy pathway. In the reverse analysis, Beclin1 immune-precipitated NIC confirming the specificity of its association with NIC and this complex also included Atg14 and Vps34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Thus, Beclin is detected in complexes that include either Vps34 or NIC with both complexes including Atg14 as expected. Vps34 and Beclin are known to form multiple and dynamic cellular complexes, which are regulated by the phosphorylation of the proteins themselves as well their interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Thus the exclusion of Vps34 from the NIC complex may indicates interactions with proteins (such as Beclin) whose functions may be regulated by Notch activity. The data do not rule out transient associations between NIC and Vps34. That NIC formed complexes with proteins regulating autophagy in Tregs, indicated a more direct role for Notch1 in the autophagic cascade, although the molecular regulation and dynamics of this interaction remains to be dissected.</p><p>Mitochondrial re-modeling and activity control cellular responses to changing bioenergetic needs, which facilitate transitions between nutrient-replete and deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rambold et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hailey et al., 2010</xref>). Since Notch modulation of mitochondrial function has been suggested in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perumalsamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kasahara et al., 2013</xref>), mitochondrial organization and integrity in Tregs were next examined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitochondrial integrity is dependent on NIC and autophagy</title><p>Mitochondria were analyzed employing a combination of biophysical and imaging methods in live cells and a potentiometric fluorescent probe, DiOC<sub>6</sub>, which measures mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (MTP), an indicator of mitochondrial energetic state.</p><p>Uptake of the dye DiOC<sub>6</sub> is a well-established flow-cytometry based measure of MTP in intact cells. Activated Tregs undergo almost no change in MTP following cytokine withdrawal, consistent with their survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, inclusion of GSI compromised mitochondrial function as it triggered a loss of MTP within 8–9 hr of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, mitochondrial activity was regulated by Notch in Tregs. We next asked if Notch activity also controlled mitochondrial organization in Tregs. In live activated Tregs, mitochondria marked with MitoTracker Green and visualized by confocal microscopy appear as interconnected structures, which remained so following cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Following cytokine withdrawal, further loss of MTP, indicated compromised mitochondrial function in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We compared mitochondrial contiguity in WT and <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs using the technique of fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP) in live cells loaded with MitoTracker Green. Fluorescence recovery in WT Tregs was high, which is consistent with a connected morphology of the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Low FRAP in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs is indicative of discontinuous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), which was confirmed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> inset and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The punctate morphology of mitochondria in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs was reduced, with the organelle appearing more tubular and connected in cells expressing recombinant Atg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or recombinant NIC-NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) relative to cells expressing an empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus a loss of MTP and mitochondrial fragmentation was associated with poor survival outcomes following cytokine withdrawal in Tregs. Our experiments established that NIC and autophagy signaling were critical for the integrity and function of mitochondria in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NIC activates autophagy to promote survival of T-effectors following cytokine withdrawal</title><p>We next assessed if Notch signaling to autophagy was a more generalized mechanism that can be activated in other cells. For this, we employed T-effectors generated from naïve T-cell precursors, as T-effectors do not survive cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purushothaman and Sarin, 2009</xref>) and we had prior evidence that ectopic expression of recombinant NIC protected T-effectors from apoptosis in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bheeshmachar et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>T-effectors - generated as described in methods by TCR stimulation of naïve T-cells - do not increase LC3 puncta or the LC3II isoform following cytokine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Endogenous NIC is nuclear localized in T-effectors unlike Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As was seen with Tregs, the ectopic expression of NIC-NES protected T-effectors from apoptosis triggered by cytokine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However a recombinant NIC modified by the inclusion of a <underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>L</underline>ocalization <underline>S</underline>ignal (NIC-NLS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> inset), which enforces localization to the nucleus did not confer protection from cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Further, protection from cell death was abrogated if inhibitors of autophagy - Baf or 3MA - were included in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Activated Tregs generated from <italic>Cd4-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice and their genetic (Cre negative) controls were compared for molecules enriched in Treg subsets. Gene-expression analysis by microarray was confirmed using RT-PCR analysis and in some instances flow-cytometry analysis for proteins. In this analysis, activated Tregs of the two genotypes showed no striking differences, with loss of Notch1 transcript serving as the positive (internal) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, comparison of gene sets enriched for cytokines associated with Tregs revealed no differences in the <italic>Cd4-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> or genetic (Cre negative) control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar trends were observed in flow-cytometry based analysis of cell surface and intracellular markers implicated in Treg differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These experiments indicated a small difference in the expression of the gene <italic>Eos</italic> and high-affinity IL-2 receptor expression. A better understanding of the functional significance of these changes awaits analysis of other gene groups using combination of approaches described here.</p><p>The distribution of naïve and memory T-cell subsets in circulation, an indication of the resting vs. activated state of the immune system was comparable in Tregs derived from <italic>Cre </italic>negative controls and <italic>Cd4-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Based on the analysis of transcripts, protein expression and immune subsets we expected no difference between wildtype and <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Tregs in functional assays of suppression. Indeed, in earlier work when tested for suppressor activity in vitro, activated Tregs of the two genotypes were comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al 2012</xref>). However, suppression is a multi-step process with distinct demands that operate on cells in vivo, hence we tested Tregs from <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and genetic controls in assays of immune-suppression in vivo.</p><p>Established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quah et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klein et al., 2003</xref>), involving the transfer of responder and suppressor cells into host (immune-competent) mice were followed to measure the ability of Tregs to suppress antigen-induced T-cell proliferation. In this assay, purified naïve (OT-II) T-cells loaded with a fluorescent dye – chosen because it partitions into daughter cells following division - were injected into host mice, which are subsequently challenged with ovalbumin as OT-II cells respond to this antigen. The OT-II T-cells can be distinguished from host cells by antibody-mediated detection of the CD45.2 molecule on their cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Three days post antigen challenge lymph node cells are isolated from the host, cells are gated on CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and the CFSE profile scored in this group using two-color flow-cytometry. The distribution of CFSE loaded cells spans multiple dilutions of lower intensity, indicative of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ei</xref>), whereas in mice not challenged with antigen, CFSE will be detected at the highest intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>, filled histogram). Since functional Tregs suppress T-cell proliferation, co-injection of Tregs and CFSE loaded naïve T-cells, results in reduced/no dilution of CFSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Eii</xref>) following antigen challenge. Thus, the CFSE dilution in antigen-responsive T-cells in a co-injection (adoptive transfer) protocol indicates the percentage of T-cells proliferating in the absence or presence of Tregs. Additionally, by loading Tregs with CFSE and tracking transferred OT-II T-cells by the expression of CD45.2, it can be demonstrated that both the subsets localize to the same lymph node, thereby enabling this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Following the principle described above, naïve T-cells isolated from OT-II (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice, were loaded with the fluorescent dye CFSE as described in methods. CFSE loaded cells were injected into congenic hosts, (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>, B6SJL mice), which differ only in the expression of the CD45 isoform. Naïve T-cells were co-injected without or with in vitro activated (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) Tregs, which were earlier transfected with either shRNA to Notch1 or a scrambled control. Host mice were challenged with the appropriate antigen (mOVA), 15–18 hr after receiving cells. Three days post challenge, cells were isolated from draining lymph nodes of host mice and analyzed for CFSE dilution in the gated CD45.2<sup>+</sup> subset donor OT-II T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, panel i). In mice co-injected with Tregs transfected with scrambled shRNA, proliferation of OT-II cells was expectedly blunted and CFSE fluorescence in OT-II cells detected at the highest intensity of CFSE indicating an undivided population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> panel ii). On the other hand, in cells isolated from mice injected with Tregs transduced with Notch1 shRNA, OT-II T-cells proliferated robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> panel iii), and were comparable to proliferation in OT-II cells injected without Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, panel i). This indicates that Notch1 controls the suppressor activity of Tregs. The expression of Foxp3 was not changed by Notch1 ablation (Figure 5Eii, inset and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Similarly, suppressor activity was attenuated in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, compare panels, i and iii) as compared to wildtype Tregs (Tregs<sup>WT</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> panel ii). However, reconstitution with recombinant NIC restored suppressor activity of <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, compare iii and ii).</p><p>While the data suggest that Notch1 activity can regulate Treg suppressor function, these results are in contrast to an earlier observation from the laboratory wherein <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs showed activity comparable to control Tregs in vitro co-culture suppressor assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>), which we can reproduce (data not shown). Thus, the suppressor assay in the culture dish appears to recapitulate a subset of the diverse cues present in vivo. Another possibility is that the accumulation of IL-2 produced by T-effectors in the co-culture assay, allows for the survival and hence suppressor activity of <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs in vitro. The in vivo assay was a more sensitive read-out of Notch activity in Tregs and we next tested if modulating autophagy in activated Tregs modified suppressor activity.</p><p>In agreement with the reported requirement of autophagy in Treg function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parekh et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), shRNA to Vps34 abrogated Tregs<sup>WT</sup> suppressor activity relative to the cells treated with the scrambled shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> compare iii with ii) as compared to the control group injected without Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Hi</xref>). The ablation of Vps34 (inhibition of autophagy) did not modulate the expression of Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). However, in an in vitro assay of Treg function, which measures suppression of conventional T-cell proliferation via stimulation of T-cell receptor in the presence of antigen presenting cells, the ablation of VpS34 in activated Tregs abrogated suppressor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, compare i and ii). Responder T-cell proliferation was comparable to proliferation of cells stimulated without Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, iii). Thus, Vps34 was critical for Treg function and its requirement revealed in suppressor assays performed in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, suppressor activity in assays in vivo was restored in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs transfected with recombinant Atg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Expression of Atg3 had also protected cells from apoptosis, shown in earlier experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Non-nuclear Notch1 activity is a positive regulator of Treg function</title><p>Since Notch1 modulated Treg function, we tested if this was mediated through non-nuclear Notch activity. In the OT-II T-cell proliferation assay, expression of recombinant NIC-NES restored suppressor activity in transferred <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Aii</xref>). Suppressor activity was not restored in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs transfected with NIC-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Aiii</xref>).

The assay tracks the clearance of glucose injected into the blood stream of obese mice, and builds on the observation that impaired glucose clearance (also referred to as glucose intolerance) is a feature of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Winer et al., 2009</xref>). In this context, the injection of Tregs has been shown to correct defects in the clearance of glucose, although protection is short-term and persists for 10–15 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipolletta et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feuerer et al.,2009</xref>).

Nonetheless, the correction of defective glucose clearance remains a reproducible assay of Treg function.</p><p>In agreement with published observations we show that the clearance of (injected) glucose from blood in fasting <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice, is substantially delayed compared to heterozygous (<italic>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></italic>) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Mice with a <italic>Notch1</italic> ablation, were born in reduced numbers (1:16 as against the expected 1:8 ratio), presented with features consistent with dysregulated immune function and some similarities with <italic>Scurfy</italic> mice, which lack Tregs because of a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox </sup></italic>mice (analyzed from 4–8 weeks of age) were viable, presented with enlarged lymph nodes and increased cellularity relative to <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Increased cellularity resulted from increased numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> (effector memory) and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> (central memory) T-cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Changes in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> subsets, which are expressed on Tregs and are early markers of T-cell activation respectively, were inconsistent, showing small increases in number in some mice or remaining comparable to genetic controls in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). No striking changes were observed in B-cell and myeloid subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, in <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox </sup></italic>mice, which had been injected with WT Tregs, seven days prior to analysis, lymph node inflammation and the number of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in lymph nodes was substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggested that defects in Treg function might contribute to the observed inflammation in <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. In preliminary experiments, the adoptive transfer of <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs did not reduce lymphoid accumulation (not shown). Notably, several <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox </sup></italic>mice were smaller in size than littermate controls, had shorter, roughened fur and developed crusting of skin around the eyes by 4–5 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Nonetheless, Foxp3 expression, assessed by immunostaining in Tregs was comparable in mice of the different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The analysis of <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs in functional assays of inflammation together with the phenotypes of mice with a deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> in Tregs suggests an important role for the receptor in immune homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tregs control inflammatory responses mounted by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buckner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaguchi, 2004</xref>). In this study we position Notch1 regulated autophagy as an integral controlling element of activated Treg homeostasis. This is inferred from the observations that survival and function are compromised following perturbations of Notch signaling or autophagy in Tregs<sup>WT</sup> and the restoration of autophagy and suppressor activity following reconstitution of <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs with the nuclear-excluded recombinant NIC-NES or Atg3. Of note, the requirement for Notch1 in thymus-derived activated Tregs is distinct from identified roles for Notch-TGFβ interactions in iTregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mota et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>More generally, our experiments suggest that Notch-induced autophagy is a mechanism of quality control of mitochondrial architecture. This was also indicated by the restoration of organelle connectivity if NIC-NES or Atg3 were expressed in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs or in T-effectors. The interactions between the organelle remodeling machinery observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perumalsamy et al., 2010)</xref>) and the Notch-autophagy signaling axis, underpinning these outcomes remain to be characterized.</p><p>Cell survival in complex and changing environments associated with inflammation is an important component determining immune cell function. The induction of cell death in Tregs in response to cytokine deprivation appeared to correlate with suppressor function in vivo with one exception. The loss of suppressor activity in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs in vivo, did not agree with outcomes of suppressor assays in vitro, wherein Notch1 appeared to be dispensable for Treg suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the understanding of Notch activity in Tregs we speculate that <italic>Notch1<sup>-/- </sup></italic>Tregs suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro as concentrations of cytokines and growth factors that build up in the dish likely protect <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>Tregs from death. As Foxp3 levels are not compromised in these cells, this will allow suppressor activity. That the ablation of Vps34 compromised Treg activity in both in vivo and in vitro assays, is consistent with autophagy controlling Treg survival <italic>and</italic> playing a defining role in maintenance of functional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), i.e. regulating Foxp3 expression. While we did not detect a loss in Foxp3 expression in the 24–48 hr period following ablation of Vps34, the eventual loss of Foxp3 expression and compromised survival as shown by Wei, et al., may underlie defective suppressor activity observed in the 3–4 day duration suppressor assays.</p><p>The dynamic regulation of Notch and its role as a critical determinant of Treg differentiation, function and homeostasis has emerged from work by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charbonnier et al.,2015)</xref>. Similarly, a more recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), focused on events at the earlier stages of Treg undergoing activation to define a critical role for autophagy during differentiation of Tregs. Although focusing on different stages of (natural) Treg development, taken together, the studies suggest dynamic regulation of Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charbonnier et al.,2015</xref><underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">)</xref></underline> or autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>) in Treg homeostasis, which support the conclusions from our work albeit with some differences.</p><p>Unlike the study by Charbonnier et al., which positions RBPJ-k dependent Notch signaling as a negative regulator of Treg function we find that deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> in the Treg lineage resulted in features of immune-inflammation consistent with a role for Notch1 in Treg function. However, both the studies implicate non-canonical Notch1 activity as necessary for maintenance of Treg identity. We speculate that the increased representation of recently activated and T-memory subsets in <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice, observed in our experiments, is likely a response to antigens experienced in the high barrier – but not SPF1 – conditions, that mice are housed in. Notably, genetic (littermate) controls were indistinguishable from wild type mice indicating the absence of overt infection. Interestingly, the phenotypes of autoimmunity reported in <italic>Atg7</italic> deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), align with lymphoid proliferation and increased cellularity we observe in <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>mice. The interaction between Notch and autophagy revealed in our experiments suggests a hitherto unappreciated role for Notch signaling in the regulation of this process. Whether the effects of autophagy is executed through Notch1 signaling at all stages of Treg activation remains to be investigated.</p><p>Our experiments have focused on activated Tregs, an approach that identified a defining role for mTORC1 in Treg homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Multiple studies have confirmed that the deficiency of Notch1 at later stages of T-cell development does not impair lineage commitment of Tregs. We propose however, that Notch1 tunes a late event in the differentiation of Tregs already committed to the suppressor lineage. This is consistent with our observation that low-levels of immune challenge elicit features of inflammation as compared to the <italic>Cre</italic> negative littermates.</p><p>Notch is implicated in instructive fate choices in the T-cell lineage, with commitment to T-cell fate the earliest amongst these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). Here we demonstrate a critical role for non-nuclear Notch1 activity, wherein Notch-autophagy interactions follow from immune stimulation and are important determinants of Treg function as evidenced in assays of adoptive transfers. Despite defects in <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>Treg function, mice with an ablation of Notch1 in mature CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells did not present overt inflammatory phenotypes, which likely reflect its role in tuning responses of effector T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laky et al., 2015</xref>). However, the targeted deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> in the Treg lineage resulted in inflammatory features suggested an integral role for Notch1 in Treg homeostasis. The possibility that Notch1 activity in Tregs is critical in specific contexts and redundant or non-essential in others cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the integration of autophagy and non-nuclear Notch activity may be a conserved mechanism that tunes cell-fate decisions governed by the receptor in other cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> and <italic>Cd4-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup> (Notch1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) strains were a gift from Freddy Radtke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wolfer et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Foxp3tm4(YFP/Cre)</italic>Ayr/J, C57BL/6J, B6SJL, OT-II and <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db </sup></italic>strains were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Notch1<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup> and <italic>Foxp3tm4(YFP/Cre)</italic>Ayr/J strains were crossed to generate <italic>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice. <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mutant mouse stains were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice.

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Notch1 regulated autophagy controls survival and suppressor activity of activated T-regulatory cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report, the authors demonstrated that Notch signaling regulated mitochondrial organization, survival and suppressor function of activated Treg cells through the activation of autophagy. Furthermore, they confirmed that Notch intracellular domain (NIC) formed a complex with constituents of the autophagy initiation complex and that the overexpression of an effector of autophagy could restore survival and suppressor function in Notch1-deficient Treg cells. Interestingly, they found that Treg specific deletion of Notch1 resulted in development of inflammation because of dysregulation of immune homeostasis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) They show that Notch pathway and autophagy do not affect Foxp3 expression in activated Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, respectively. However, recent studies have reported by using genetically modified mice that Notch pathway and autophagy regulate Foxp3 expression in Treg cells (Nat Immunol., 2015, 16:1162-73; Nat Immunol., 2016 AOP). They should discuss this discrepancy including housing condition of mice (How is the detailed housing condition of mice in this manuscript? Are there any infections that affect immune responses?) Furthermore, Treg cells are known to express several signature genes in addition to Foxp3 (e.g. CTLA-4, CD25, Eos, GITR…). Thus, the additional signature genes also need to be tested in Notch1- or autophagy-deficient Treg cells (The global transcriptome analysis would be informative).</p><p>2) How are shRNAs transduced into Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 E and F</xref>? Do the vectors (retroviral vector?) have some fluorescence marker to detect infected cells?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> that Beclin1 formed a complex with Notch1, VPS34 and ATG14 in Treg cells. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> indicates that Notch1 does not bind to VPS34. This discrepancy should be discussed. In addition, cell death of Treg cells was evaluated by culturing Treg cells at 0.3 x 106/ml concentration. This culture condition appears to be relatively sparse in order Treg to interact with Notch ligands expressed on adjacent Treg cells. Are Notch ligands-mediated Notch cleavage involved in the increased cell death in this culture condition? Downregulation of Notch ligands by shRNA would address this point.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, they demonstrate that mitochondrial organization is regulated by the Notch-autophagy pathway in Treg cells. However, the contribution of mitochondrial organization to Treg survival and function remains unclear in this study.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, they show that Notch1-deficient Treg cells lose their suppressor function in vivo. However, they previously reported that Notch1-deficient Treg cells possessed suppressor activity in in vitro suppression assay (Sci Signal., 2012, 5:ra53). They need to explain this discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>6) They have indicated that the overexpression of Atg3 restores cytokine-independent survival of Notch1-deficient Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. Can the ectopic expression of Atg3 rescue the defect of suppressor function in Notch1-deficient Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>?</p><p>7) They show that IL-2 withdrawal increases autophagy in Treg cells and evaluated their function in vivo by transferring Tregs with OT-II T cells. Is this in vivo model appropriate for evaluating IL-2 withdrawal state?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, which mouse strain was used for isolating Treg cells in co-injection model? Are Treg cells from OT-II mice used? This information is not described in Figure legends and methods sections although the Methods section described that 'activated Treg cells are used'. If authors used in vitro pre-activated Treg cells from B6 mice, did this suppression occur in antigen non-specific manner? As the host mice are not irradiated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the number of two types of donor cells are extremely small compared with host-derived cells. How did the small number of two types of cells interact with each other in vivo, which results in suppression of T cells? It should be explained. The frequency of donor cells relative to host cells should be also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p><p>9) Overall, while the data are quite convincing and extremely well-presented in the figures, the text is frequently difficult to read. There are several places where the reader becomes bogged down and has to read a sentence several times before understanding the point the authors are trying to make to their audience. The authors should work hard to rewrite the manuscript using simple declarative sentences whenever possible. Many sentences contain several dependent clauses which makes the interpretation difficult. In other places, even simple sentences are difficult to understand. For example, in the Results section, the sentence states: &quot;We next assess if preventing the activation of autophagy was detrimental to cytokine-independent survival&quot;. This sentence is difficult to interpret and perhaps could be more clearly stated as &quot;We asked whether autophagy is important for survival in the absence of cytokines&quot;.</p><p>10) Since <italic>eLife</italic> is a journal that reaches a wide audience, many readers are not immunologists and the details of experimental systems are likely to be lost on most readers. In the context of this manuscript, the details of the in vivo suppression systems employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are likely to be confusing to most readers. Simplification of the data described in the subsection “Non-nuclear Notch1 activity is a positive regulator of Treg function” would make these data more accessible to a wider audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14023.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) They show that Notch pathway and autophagy do not affect Foxp3 expression in activated Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, respectively.

Thus, the additional signature genes also need to be tested in Notch1- or autophagy-deficient Treg cells (The global transcriptome analysis would be informative).</italic></p><p>We have expanded the Discussion section of the revised manuscript to incorporate comments on the studies by Chatila et al. and Wei et al. The Discussion has been extended to include the following points, arising from the comments:</p><p>Charbonnier and colleagues (Nat Immunol., 2015, 16:1162-73)position RBPJ-k dependent Notch signaling as a negative regulator of Treg function and implicate non-canonical Notch1 activity in the maintenance of Treg identity. The dynamic regulation of Notch emerging from their experiments, align with our observations and position Notch1 as a critical determinant of Treg differentiation, function and homeostasis. A key difference from this study is that our investigation employed natural Tregs activated in vitro, whereas the Charbonnier group has characterized natural Tregs cells in circulation. The study by Jun Wei et al. (Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286), mapsevents at the earlier stages of Treg activation to define a critical role for autophagy during differentiation of Tregs. Although focusing on different stages of (natural) Treg development, taken together the studies suggest dynamic regulation of Notch activity (Nat Immunol., 2015, 16:1162-73)or autophagy(Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286) for Treg homeostasis. Our experiments, add to these observations by the demonstrated interaction between the two signaling modules in the context of activated Treg survival and function.</p><p>Another notable difference between our study and that of Chatila et al. is in the defects in immune function following the ablation of Notch1 in Tregs. We speculate that some of these may arise from the housing conditions of the mice, as our mice are maintained in high barrier but not in SPF1 conditions. We posit that the inflammation observed in Foxp3Notch1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, results from a breakdown of tolerance and a response to antigens experienced in these conditions. Importantly, genetic (littermate) controls were indistinguishable from wild type mice arguing against overt infection. Interestingly, the phenotypes of autoimmunity reported in Atg7 deficient mice (Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286), are aligned with our observations of lymphoid proliferation and increased numbers of recently activated or memory T-cells in Foxp3Notch1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The interaction between Notch and autophagy revealed in our experiments suggests an hitherto unappreciated for Notch signaling in the regulation of this process. Whether this interaction is conserved at all stages of Treg activation remains to be investigated.</p><p>Foxp3 stability:</p><p>Wei et al.have presented evidence that Atg7 maintains Foxp3 expression in Tregs. While we did not observe a marked difference in Foxp3 expression in the 24-36 hour period following ablation of VpS34, the loss of Foxp3 expression may well be an underlying cause of the deficits observed in suppressor assays.</p><p>As reported by Chatila et al., we observe a small but consistent increase in the Treg<sup>+</sup> subsets in CD4Cre+ Notch1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (reported in the first paragraph of the subsection “Perturbations of Notch1 or autophagy inhibit suppressor activity in activated Tregs”). Since we do not have evidence of a gain of Treg function, we are unable to comment on the physiological consequences of the differences in this number.</p><p>Housing Conditions:</p><p>The mouse colonies used in our study are maintained in high barrier – but not SPF conditions – used by Chatila et al. Immune hyperactivity, may be triggered by either low level of antigen experience or activation of autoimmune responses in the conditions we hold our colonies. However, the mice used in our experiments are not infected as cellularity of lymphoid organs and the representation of naïve and memory T-cell subsets, (which reflect immune responses to ongoing infections) are comparable in genetic controls or littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hence we conclude that the housing conditions, allows immune responses to innocuous antigens, triggering inflammation in the mice of the affected genotype. Information on housing conditions of mice and the health checks on the colony are described in the Methods (subsection “Mice”) of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, Treg cells are known to express several signature genes in addition to Foxp3 (e.g. CTLA-4, CD25, Eos, GITR…). Thus, the additional signature genes also need to be tested in Notch1- or autophagy-deficient Treg cells (The global transcriptome analysis would be informative).</p><p>A global gene expression analysis of Tregs from Notch deficient and control mice has been initiated and is currently ongoing. The analysis included activated Tregs of the two genotypes, where the ablation of Notch1 was under the control of the CD4 promoter. In light of the aforementioned studies, we have expanded the scope of the analysis to examine freshly isolated cells as well as cells deficient in Notch1 under the control of the Foxp3 promoter. Mice, in the latter group is generated in very low numbers in our hands and hence the completion of the analysis is pending availability of enough mice of this genotype.</p><p>Appreciating the importance of this analysis, the revised manuscript now includes a comparison of 15 Treg subset specific genes, confirmed by RT-PCR analysis or flow cytometry for proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, C and D</xref> in the revised manuscript. The corresponding data from the gene expression analysis of these are shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C and D</xref>. While we do not observe differences, we are unable to comment definitively unless the more detailed analysis of the groups mentioned is completed.</p><p><italic>2) How are shRNAs transduced into Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>? Do the vectors (retroviral vector?) have some fluorescence marker to detect infected cells?</italic></p><p>The detailed protocol is now included in the section in Methods (subsection “T-cells and retroviral transductions”).Infected cells are selected by antibiotic selection using puromycin resistance.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> that Beclin1 formed a complex with Notch1, VPS34 and ATG14 in Treg cells. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> indicates that Notch1 does not bind to VPS34. This discrepancy should be discussed.</italic></p><p>This comment highlights a point that was not adequately addressed in the first submission. Vps34 and Beclin are known to form multiple and dynamic cellular complexes, which are regulated by the phosphorylation of the proteins themselves as well their interacting partners (Kang et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012). Thus the exclusion of Vps34 from the NIC complex reveals specific interactions with proteins (such as Beclin) whose functions may be regulated by Notch activity. The data also do not rule out transient associations between NIC and Vps34. The data support the evidence of Notch interactions with autophagy intermediates, but the functional significance of specific or dynamic complexes that include Notch remains to be investigated further.</p><p>The text has been modified in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Notch1 activity regulates autophagy in Tregs”.</p><p><italic>In addition, cell death of Treg cells was evaluated by culturing Treg cells at 0.3 x 106/ml concentration. This culture condition appears to be relatively sparse in order Treg to interact with Notch ligands expressed on adjacent Treg cells. Are Notch ligands-mediated Notch cleavage involved in the increased cell death in this culture condition? Downregulation of Notch ligands by shRNA would address this point.</italic></p><p>The concentration at which cells are cultured for the deprivation assay in 48 well plates or in 24 well plates permits cell contact as this can be confirmed by visual analysis. The requirement for inputs from the DLL-1 ligand in Treg survival following growth factor withdrawal was identified using this format and published earlier (Perumalsamy et al., 2012), hence the data are not included in this manuscript. The requirement for DLL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) was tested based on these earlier observations.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, they demonstrate that mitochondrial organization is regulated by the Notch-autophagy pathway in Treg cells. However, the contribution of mitochondrial organization to Treg survival and function remains unclear in this study.</italic></p><p>In the revised submission, we include evidence that acute disruption of Notch signaling by the addition of the gamme-secretase inhibitor (GSI-X), triggers a loss in mitochondrial trans-membrane potential as early at 8 hours following cytokine withdrawal. The new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in the manuscript, and provide evidence that Notch activity regulates mitochondrial health. The addition of GSI eventually results in cell death as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>As we are yet to identify the mechanism by which Notch activity signals to mitochondria we are currently unable to demonstrate a causal relationship between mitochondrial integrity (function and organization) and Treg suppressor function. However, a link is supported by the evidence that recombinant non-nuclear NIC or Atg3, restore both mitochondrial integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>) and suppressor activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A and C</xref>) in Notch deficient Tregs. We project a role for Notch in maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, based on these data and the current appreciation of the role of mitochondria in cell survival.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, they show that Notch1-deficient Treg cells lose their suppressor function in vivo. However, they previously reported that Notch1-deficient Treg cells possessed suppressor activity in in vitro suppression assay (Sci Signal., 2012, 5:ra53). They need to explain this discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo.</italic></p><p>Based on the understanding of Notch activity in Tregs we speculate that Notch deficient Tregs may be protected from cell death in the suppressor assay performed in the culture dish as levels of cytokines and growth factors can build up in the dish. As Foxp3 levels are not compromised in Notch<sup>-/-</sup>Tregs, this will allow suppressor activity.</p><p><italic>6) They have indicated that the overexpression of Atg3 restores cytokine-independent survival of Notch1-deficient Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. Can the ectopic expression of Atg3 rescue the defect of suppressor function in Notch1-deficient Treg cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>?</italic></p><p>The experiments with Atg3 are included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> in the revised manuscript. In both systems, Atg3 restores the defect in suppressor function.</p><p><italic>7) They show that IL-2 withdrawal increases autophagy in Treg cells and evaluated their function in vivo by transferring Tregs with OT-II T cells. Is this in vivo model appropriate for evaluating IL-2 withdrawal state?</italic></p><p>The analysis of IL-2 withdrawal in vitro is a model to examine cell intrinsic processes that regulate survival and homeostasis in the T-cell lineage. This assay had uncovered unusual signaling by Notch in the Treg subset (Perumalsamy et al., 2012) and revealed the interaction with autophagy as reported in the current study.</p><p>Cell survival in complex and changing environments associated with inflammation is an important component determining cell function. The identification of the Notch-Autophagy axis for cell survival motivated the experiments to assess this interaction in the contexts of suppressor function. We capitalized on the ability to manipulate these molecules in isolated cells, and test consequences for function in different models. Our conclusions are strengthened by the recent observations using other approaches (Wei et al., Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286I), ascribing a critical requirement for autophagy in Treg homeostasis.</p><p><italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, which mouse strain was used for isolating Treg cells in co-injection model? Are Treg cells from OT-II mice used? This information is not described in Figure legends and methods sections although the Methods section described that 'activated Treg cells are used'. If authors used in vitro pre-activated Treg cells from B6 mice, did this suppression occur in antigen non-specific manner? As the host mice are not irradiated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the number of two types of donor cells are extremely small compared with host-derived cells. How did the small number of two types of cells interact with each other in vivo, which results in suppression of T cells? It should be explained. The frequency of donor cells relative to host cells should be also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</italic></p><p>We apologize that this information was not presented in a concise manner in the original submission. The information on the source of mice and additional experimental detail are included in the Methods and legends. The supporting text has also been modified for clarity.</p><p>The Tregs are not derived from the OT-II mice and hence to that extent suppression is not determined by the TCR specificity of the Tregs and responder OT-II cells. However, multiple modes of suppression are associated with Tregs and with dendritic cells or CD4 or CD8 T-cells (which is not antigen-specific) as well as modifying the cytokine milieu are thought to be some of the mechanisms by which Tregs mediate suppression. The protocol for the suppressor assay we have used is as established by others (Quah et.al, 2007; Klein et al., 2003).</p><p>In addition, suppressor activity has also been validated in another model using the IPGTT assay.</p><p>The revised submission includes data to show that the two cell types – OT-II and Tregs – are detected in the same host lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We have used molecular markers to track cells using flowcytometry, which allows for the detection of relatively low numbers of cells as can be seen in the plot in the supplementary figure. In the experiments contributing data in the study, we do not collect information on Tregs but use a combination of a cell surface CD45.2 marker and CFSE fluorescence to track OT-II cells thereby excluding the host and transferred Tregs from the analysis, respectively.</p><p><italic>9) Overall, while the data are quite convincing and extremely well-presented in the figures, the text is frequently difficult to read.

We trust these will substantially address the concerns raised.</p></body></sub-article></article>
