A key outstanding question is how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are modulated to ensure that bi-oriented attachments are selectively stabilized and maintained. The Astrin-SKAP complex localizes preferentially to properly bi-oriented sister kinetochores, representing the final outer kinetochore component recruited prior to anaphase onset. Here, we reconstitute the 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex, including a novel MYCBP subunit. Our work demonstrates that the Astrin-SKAP complex contains separable kinetochore localization and microtubule binding domains. In addition, through cross-linking analysis in human cells and biochemical reconstitution, we show that the Astrin-SKAP complex binds synergistically to microtubules with the Ndc80 complex to form an integrated interface. We propose a model in which the Astrin-SKAP complex acts together with the Ndc80 complex to stabilize correctly formed kinetochore-microtubule interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheeseman</surname><given-names>Iain M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheeseman</surname><given-names>Iain M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM052468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson-Kubalek</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and cell biological analyses reveal that the Astrin-SKAP complex acts to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule interactions through its intrinsic microtubule binding activity and its association with the Ndc80 complex, the core component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The macromolecular kinetochore complex links chromosomes to dynamic microtubule polymers and harnesses the forces generated by microtubule growth and depolymerization to facilitate accurate chromosome segregation. The proteins that comprise this critical interface have been the subject of intense study in multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>). Many kinetochore components, including the core microtubule-binding Ndc80 complex, are conserved throughout eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). The Ndc80 complex associates with microtubules using a precise binding site and angled orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alushin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the Ndc80 complex, other kinetochore-localized microtubule binding proteins have been identified that act together with the Ndc80 complex to stabilize microtubule attachments or facilitate processive interactions at the outer kinetochore. In budding yeast, the Dam1 complex provides a ring-like coupler to stably attach each kinetochore to a depolymerizing microtubule by conferring processivity to the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lampert et al., 2010</xref>). In metazoans, the Ska1 complex adds additional microtubule binding and confers its microtubule-tracking ability to the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Welburn et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we implicate the vertebrate-specific Astrin-SKAP complex as an important additional player in forming an integrated kinetochore-microtubule interface.</p><p>We and others previously isolated a complex of Astrin, SKAP, and the dynein light-chain LC8 from human cells that localizes to both kinetochores and spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Astrin and SKAP play critical roles in chromosome segregation and the maintenance of spindle bipolarity based on depletion and knockout experiments in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mack and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thein et al., 2007</xref>). Within the Astrin-SKAP complex, the SKAP subunit contains two important microtubule-binding activities. First, SKAP possesses a microtubule plus-end tracking activity through its interaction with EB family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). SKAP plus-end tracking is required for proper interactions of astral microtubules with the cell cortex and metaphase spindle positioning, but not for chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>). Second, SKAP binds directly to microtubules, and mutants that precisely disrupt microtubule binding result in dramatic defects in chromosome alignment and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In an important contrast to other components of the kinetochore-microtubule interface, the Astrin-SKAP complex associates dynamically with kinetochores during mitosis and only localizes to aligned and bi-oriented kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mack and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the Astrin-SKAP complex is the final component of the outer kinetochore that is recruited prior to anaphase onset. This unique localization timing suggests a model in which the Astrin-SKAP complex stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments as cells prepare for chromosome segregation. However, the specific function and interactions for the Astrin-SKAP complex at kinetochores remain largely unknown.</p><p>Here, we identify a fourth subunit of the Astrin-SKAP complex, MYCBP, reconstitute the complete, four-subunit, human Astrin-SKAP complex from insect cells, and dissect its biochemical and cell biological interactions. Our work indicates that Astrin has a separable C-terminal kinetochore localization domain and an N-terminal region that associates with microtubules through its interaction with SKAP. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry to trap Astrin in its kinetochore-bound state, we find that the Astrin-SKAP complex interacts with the Ndc80 complex. We reconstitute an interaction between the N-terminal half of the Astrin-SKAP complex and the Ndc80 complex in the presence of microtubules. Importantly, we find that the Ndc80 and Astrin-SKAP complexes can bind to microtubules simultaneously to form an integrated interface. Our work suggests a model in which the Astrin-SKAP complex stabilizes correctly formed kinetochore-microtubule attachments through its own intrinsic microtubule binding activity and its coordinate association with microtubule-bound Ndc80 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of a 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex</title><p>To understand the molecular role of the Astrin-SKAP complex at kinetochores, we first sought to define the organization and assembly of the complex. As a first step to reconstituting an intact Astrin-SKAP complex, we began by reanalyzing the composition of the Astrin-SKAP complex isolated from human tissue culture cells. In addition to the previously defined subunits Astrin, SKAP, and LC8, we consistently identified MYCBP as an interacting partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In reciprocal immunoprecipitations, MYCBP isolated the Astrin-SKAP complex, as well as some of its previously defined interactors, including the AKAP family proteins and ARFGEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furusawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furusawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishizaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taira et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mass spectrometry data obtained from these affinity purifications is consistent with MYCBP participating in multiple, distinct protein complexes, similar to our previous results with LC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Supporting its interaction as a component of the Astrin-SKAP complex, MYCBP localizes to kinetochores only after chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and in an Astrin and SKAP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26866.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of a 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Pooled mass spectrometry data from Astrin and SKAP IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>) identifies MYCBP.

We were able to isolate a complex containing full length versions of each protein that co-purified over Ni-NTA resin and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To dissect the associations within the complex, we generated a series of truncations within Astrin. Truncating the C-terminal half of Astrin by removing residues 694–1193 (Astrin 1–693) did not alter the associations within the Astrin-SKAP complex and resulted in increased expression of a well-behaved complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An additional truncation to remove the predicted N-terminal unstructured region of Astrin (residues 1–324; predictions made using Jpred: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>]) further improved expression (Astrin 324–693), and maintained the association of all complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, truncations within residues 324–465 resulted in aberrant (larger) gel filtration migration, consistent with altered structure or self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we found that a region containing the central coiled-coil region of Astrin (residues 465–693) migrated appropriately by gel filtration and was sufficient to interact with SKAP, LC8, and MYCBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Within this 465–693 region of Astrin, eliminating a small predicted loop (residues 465–482) containing a ‘TQT’ motif implicated in LC8 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lo et al., 2001</xref>) disrupted the interaction between Astrin and LC8, but did not alter SKAP or MYCBP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These truncated Astrin-SKAP complexes (Astrin 324–693 and Astrin 465–693) appeared as regular, elongated molecules by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To define the stoichiometry of the Astrin-SKAP complex, we conducted analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) on the minimal Astrin 465–693 complex, as well as a version of this complex containing a GFP-tagged SKAP subunit.

To analyze the microtubule binding activity of the intact Astrin-SKAP complex, we conducted microtubule co-sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The complex containing the N-terminal Astrin region (1-693) bound to microtubules with an apparent affinity of 3.2 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Previous work from our lab and others indicated that SKAP contains the primary microtubule binding activity for the Astrin-SKAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>).

Furthermore, the Astrin-SKAP complex decorated and bundled microtubules based on negative stain transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), although it did not display an apparent ordered binding behavior. In contrast, we found that a charge swap mutant in SKAP (‘5xD’), which substantially reduced Astrin-SKAP complex spindle microtubule localization in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>), also eliminates the binding of the Astrin-SKAP complex to microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Recent work found that a SKAP peptide (SKAP aa 57–147), containing the microtubule-binding domain, displayed competitive microtubule binding with the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>).

For these experiments, we varied the concentration of the Ndc80 Bonsai complex over a range from 0 to 6 µM in the presence of a constant 2 µM microtubules, allowing us to create conditions where the Ndc80 complex fully saturated the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Under these conditions, the Astrin-SKAP complex showed a concentration-dependent increase in binding in the presence of the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, even at the highest saturating concentrations of Ndc80 complex, the Astrin-SKAP complex was still able to bind robustly to the microtubule-Ndc80 complex, indicating that these complexes are able to bind to microtubules simultaneously. These results support synergistic, rather than competitive microtubule binding.</p><p>To assess the specificity and requirements for the interaction between the Astrin-SKAP and Ndc80 complexes in the context of microtubules, we next tested altered versions of each complex. We first tested the interaction between the human Astrin-SKAP complex and a ‘Broccoli’ version of the NDC-80 complex from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, an organism that lacks a detectable Astrin-SKAP complex homologue. Like the human complex, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NDC-80 complex serves as a core microtubule interactor, but these proteins show distinct binding modes and significant sequence differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2016</xref>). At low NDC-80 concentrations, we observed increased Astrin-SKAP complex microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As the NDC-80 complex promotes microtubule bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>), we speculate that it may create higher avidity sites for the multimeric Astrin-SKAP complex. However, in contrast to the cooperative interactions with the human Ndc80 complex, we found that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NDC-80 complex displayed competitive interactions with the Astrin-SKAP complex at high NDC-80 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, the synergistic interaction we observed requires sequences or features specific to the human Ndc80 complex.</p><p>We also found that the N-terminus of Astrin is required to achieve robust interactions with the Ndc80 complex. Removing the Astrin N-terminal domain (1-464) significantly compromised its interaction with the Ndc80 complex as demonstrated by two observations. First, the Astrin 465–693 complex displayed only a modest enhancement of its microtubule binding activity in the presence of 1 µM Ndc80 complex (K<sub>D</sub> ~2.2 µM vs. 1.7 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Second, the Astrin 465–693 complex was competed off of microtubules at increasing Ndc80 complex concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, we have identified specific features on both the Ndc80 and Astrin-SKAP complexes required for their robust interaction in the context of microtubules and for their ability to bind simultaneously to create an integrated interface.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that the Astrin-SKAP and Ndc80 complexes co-assemble to form a stable interaction with microtubules. Upon the formation of bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule interactions, the Astrin-SKAP complex is targeted to kinetochores through the Astrin C-terminus. This concentrates the Astrin-SKAP complex in the vicinity of the Ndc80 complex where it utilizes both the SKAP microtubule binding activity and the Astrin N-terminus to generate a coordinated interaction with the microtubule-binding interface of the Ndc80 complex. Both of these interactions likely contribute to stabilizing bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule interactions, although our analysis of the Astrin replacement mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) suggests that the intrinsic SKAP microtubule binding activity plays the most critical role in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of mitosis is to ensure that each pair of sister chromatids forms bi-oriented attachments to the mitotic spindle. However, it remains unclear how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are modulated to ensure that only correct, bi-oriented attachments are stabilized, whereas incorrect attachments are eliminated. Prior work has focused on the negative regulation of improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments by Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</xref>) and the role of force in stabilizing microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>). Our work suggests an additional potential mechanism to stabilize proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments through the activity of the Astrin-SKAP complex binding to microtubules and stabilizing the Ndc80-microtubule interface. In contrast to other established components of the kinetochore-microtubule interface, the Astrin-SKAP complex displays a unique localization timing to bi-oriented kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Its switch-like kinetochore localization is the mirror opposite of the spindle assembly checkpoint components that target preferentially to unattached and mis-aligned kinetochores. This late mitotic localization brings the Astrin-SKAP complex to correctly attached kinetochores at a time of high kinetochore tension, just prior to chromosome separation and segregation at anaphase onset. Thus, the Astrin-SKAP complex may act to stabilize proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments to ensure correct chromosome segregation during metaphase and anaphase.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26866.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of Astrin-SKAP kinetochore attachment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of kinetochore localization in prophase and metaphase for a selection of outer kinetochore components.

Here, we reconstitute and validate Astrin-SKAP microtubule binding in vitro. Astrin’s interaction with Ndc80 in the presence of microtubules places the Astrin-SKAP complex as an integral part of the outer kinetochore-microtubule interface along with the Ska1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The Ndc80 complex is the core microtubule binding unit of the kinetochore and is widely conserved across eukaryotes. Intriguingly, although the Astrin-SKAP complex is conserved throughout vertebrates, SKAP and Astrin knockouts in mice and rats have shown that this complex is dispensable for viability in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2002</xref>). Given the Astrin-SKAP complex’s established role in human cells, it is possible that the requirements for the Astrin-SKAP complex may be an important mitotic distinction between rodent and human kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and van den Heuvel, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous work analyzed truncations to narrow down Astrin’s kinetochore binding domain to residues 482–1193 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>) and SKAP binding domain to residues 482–850 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we further refine the SKAP binding site on Astrin using complex reconstitution and cell biological approaches to residues 482–693. We additionally identify a C-terminal Astrin domain (amino acids 694–1193) that is sufficient for kinetochore localization. Importantly, this region lacks the binding sites for the other components of the complex. Consequently, we find that this Astrin mutant is unable to recruit SKAP to kinetochores, and that cells containing only Astrin 694–1193 have chromosome segregation phenotypes similar to a Astrin knockout or SKAP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>). Together with previous studies highlighting the importance of SKAP microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>), these results establish the importance of kinetochore-localized Astrin-SKAP complex microtubule binding for proper chromosome segregation. The Astrin-SKAP complex has the potential to make several important contributions to microtubule interactions. First, the Astrin-SKAP complex is a multimeric microtubule binder due to the presence of two copies of the SKAP microtubule binding subunit per complex as defined by our analysis of Astrin-SKAP complex stoichiometry. This may serve to enhance the affinity of the kinetochore-microtubule interaction at a time when it is experiencing high force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rago and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). Second, Astrin’s interaction with the Ndc80 complex in the context of microtubules leads to the intriguing possibility that the Astrin-SKAP complex acts as a stabilizer or clamp at aligned kinetochores. The human Ndc80 complex has a well-defined binding site and angle on microtubules and is able to bind at every tubulin monomer within the microtubule lattice using the ‘toe’ region of its CH domain. In addition, the Ndc80 complex interacts with the negatively-charged E-hook of tubulin using its positively charged N-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the presence of saturating Ndc80 complex on microtubules would be expected to thoroughly compete with and block most microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friese et al. (2016)</xref> recently noted that a small piece of SKAP, containing its microtubule binding domain, reciprocally competes with the Ndc80 complex for microtubule binding. In contrast to this expectation, we find that the reconstituted Astrin-SKAP complex binds even to Ndc80-saturated microtubules and that this activity requires SKAP microtubule binding. Similar to Ndc80’s N-terminal tail, SKAP’s microtubule binding domain is positively charged and predicted to be unstructured, so both likely require access to the tubulin E-hook. Astrin’s interaction with Ndc80 may position SKAP to access the conformation of the Ndc80-bound E-hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in cells, SKAP may access microtubule regions beyond the reach of kinetochore-tethered Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). These results indicate that these two complexes can coexist and collaborate at kinetochores.</p><p>Due to the unique localization timing of the Astrin-SKAP complex, its regulation is an intriguing problem. Our work defines two Astrin-SKAP binding sites at kinetochores - the kinetochore-bound microtubule and the Ndc80 complex. These interactions can at least partly explain Astrin-SKAP’s dependence on kinetochore-microtubule attachment for its localization. We propose a model in which Astrin-SKAP is fully active for kinetochore binding only when Ndc80 is docked on kinetochore microtubules. In this case, the Astrin-SKAP complex would act in the opposite manner of the Mps1 checkpoint protein, which has been shown to compete with microtubules for free Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hiruma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the microtubule-dependent interactions, we find that the C-terminus of Astrin contains a kinetochore interaction domain and localizes to kinetochores with similar localization timing to the full-length complex, despite an inability to bind to microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests additional regulation of the interaction between Astrin’s C-terminus and its unknown kinetochore binding partner(s). We note that we sporadically obtained peptides from the CENP-L/N complex and the Dsn1 subunit of the Mis12 complex in our cross-linking immunoprecipitations of Astrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations of the CENP-L-N complex also isolated the Astrin-SKAP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), supporting a potential association. Theoretically, Astrin’s long coiled-coil domains would allow it to span large distances from these inner kinetochore locations to the microtubule interface. Alternatively, Astrin’s C-terminus could bind to a secondary location on the Ndc80 complex. Defining the structure and kinetochore binding site of Astrin’s C-terminal domain are important future goals for understanding Astrin-SKAP’s kinetochore localization and regulation. Taken together, we have defined the 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex as an integrated component of the outer kinetochore microtubule interface with the Ndc80 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and tissue culture</title><p>Cell lines were generated and maintained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2016</xref>).

In addition to the comments below, we would like to mention some key features of these biochemical studies and the nature of the Astrin-SKAP complex composition/stoichiometry. Although we didn’t emphasize this in the text, reconstituting the Astrin-SKAP complex was perhaps the most complex biochemical challenge ever conducted by our laboratory. Successfully isolating this recombinant complex required us to first define the physiological features of the Astrin-SKAP complex, including defining the correct SKAP isoform (see Kern et al. 2016) and identifying a 4<sup>th</sup> complex subunit (MYCBP – this paper). Even with this information, we needed to test multiple different expression systems and carefully optimize the purification procedure and buffer conditions for this very finicky complex. In speaking with the Gruneberg lab, who are excellent biochemists and are also interested in the Astrin-SKAP complex, they also experienced significant challenges in trying to reconstitute this complex that prevented them from conducting similar studies. Obtaining the full length Astrin-SKAP complex and the slightly truncated variant that lacks the Astrin kinetochore localization domain (but retains other key features) allowed us for the first time to test the key properties and behaviors of this intact complex, including its stoichiometry, microtubule binding behavior, and synergy with the Ndc80 complex.</p><p>The biochemical analysis from the Musacchio and Hatzfeld labs (Friese et al., 2016, Gruber et al., 2002) provides an important background and context for our work. However, we would particularly like to highlight the importance of reconstituting a full length and 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex containing all of the physiological cellular binding partners. For the Friese et al. paper, the Musacchio group primarily analyzed the stoichiometry of a shorter SKAP peptide. This suggested that SKAP formed a trimer, but it is harder to make strong statements regarding its stoichiometry in the absence of its physiological Astrin interaction. The version of the minimal Astrin-SKAP complex that the Musacchio lab obtained (lacking LC8 and MYCBP) was not well behaved enough for AUC. The Gruber et al. paper was performed with Astrin (with a small truncation) that was expressed in bacteria, denatured with urea, and refolded from inclusion bodies. Although this is an excellent paper, refolding a large &gt;1000 amino acid protein from bacteria could result in anomalous behaviors. This is particularly true for a protein that lacks its native and constitutive binding partners (SKAP, LC8, and MYCBP). From our reading of the paper, the stoichiometry information that they report was largely based on the two putative N-terminal globular (“lollipop”) regions that they observe by EM. As both we and the Musacchio group note, the N-terminus of Astrin is predicted to be largely disordered, and may just have re-folded incorrectly into an aggregated structure. Thus, we believe that our study provides the definitive information on the nature and stoichiometry of the physiological Astrin-SKAP complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should confirm their in vitro microtubule binding experiments using full length Ndc80 complexes, which they have shown that they can purify.

For the revised manuscript, we have conducted substantial additional biochemistry and microtubule binding assays to address these issues.</p><p>To consider these experiments, we would first like to highlight the substantial biochemical constraints for working with these complex and challenging proteins. The Musacchio lab (Friese et al. 2016) was able to obtain very high concentrations (80 µM) of a short SKAP peptide (~100 amino acids) to use for their competition experiment. This peptide lacks the vast majority of protein features present in the intact Astrin-SKAP complex. We do not doubt the biochemical validity of their competition experiments with this construct, in which two minimal microtubule binding regions from Ndc80 and SKAP would be expected to compete. However, our goal was to assess whether SKAP behavior accurately reflects the activity of the entire Astrin-SKAP complex, in which additional interactions would be feasible.</p><p>We have endeavored to use the full Astrin-SKAP dimeric complex for our in vitro work, to better match the situation in a cell. We were incredibly excited to be able to express and purify the full length Astrin-SKAP complex. However, this full length complex expresses at very low levels (&lt;200 nM) and we have only been able to isolate small quantities. In addition, this Astrin-SKAP complete complex does not tolerate the low salt conditions needed for microtubule binding assays. Therefore, we worked to find a minimal truncation that would improve Astrin-SKAP complex behavior without disrupting its key features and properties required for complex assembly and its interaction with microtubules. By analyzing the cellular properties of Astrin, we were able to separate this large protein into two functional regions – a C-terminal domain that is sufficient to localize to kinetochores, but does not associate with the rest of the complex, and an N-terminal region (amino acids 1-693) that is sufficient for complex association and microtubule binding. The Astrin-SKAP complex purified with this Astrin truncation is much better behaved (salt tolerant, etc.), but we are still unable to achieve substantial amounts or concentrations of this complex. Importantly, we were able to demonstrate clear microtubule binding for this truncated Astrin-SKAP complex and demonstrate a clear synergy in the Ndc80 complex mixing experiments.</p><p>For the revised paper, we attempted to conduct a modified version of the Friese et al. experiment in which we added the Astrin-SKAP complex to assess the behavior of the Ndc80 complex. The prediction from the Friese et al. work is that the presence of the Astrin-SKAP complex would compete off the Ndc80 complex from microtubules. For these experiments, we used limiting concentrations (~30 nM) of the Ndc80 complex and added in as much Astrin-SKAP complex as was feasible to obtain. However, even when isolating the Astrin-SKAP complex from ~1 L of insect cell culture and using the entire purification for one round of microtubule binding assays, we were unable to obtain final concentrations of the Astrin-SKAP complex above ~250 nM. The data from two versions of these binding assays are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. In each case, the Astrin-SKAP complex did not compete off the Ndc80 complex. Instead, Astrin-SKAP complex modestly increased the microtubule binding activity of the Ndc80 complex, as would be predicted from the reciprocal experiments. However, based on the behavior of the Astrin-SKAP complex at these higher concentrations and variability in the purification behavior towards achieving these amounts, we have chosen not to include this data in the paper.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26866-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>For the prior version of the paper, we chose to use the Ndc80 complex “Bonsai” version. This internal truncation of the Ndc80 complex removes some coiled-coil regions and a “loop” but contains the extensively defined microtubule binding activity of the complex, and can be purified and concentrated to very high levels. This construct allowed us to conduct the competition experiment with sufficient concentrations to demonstrate a clear synergy with the Astrin 1-693 complex, but to compete off an Astrin-SKAP construct (Astrin 465-693) that does not have the necessary Astrin interaction domain for synergistic binding. To conduct these competition experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and 5D</xref>), we required a starting concentration of 48 µM Ndc80 Bonsai complex to achieve the final concentrations in the reaction mix. Our lab has not purified the full-length human Ndc80 complex before, and technical challenges remain for achieving this. However, we note that based on our attempts and the nature of the published literature on this complex from the Mussachio lab, it is evident that it would not be obtainable at the levels and concentrations needed for our assays.</p><p>For the revised paper, we have conducted some related experiments with the Ndc80 Broccoli complex (see Schmidt et al. 2012). This complex lacks the “roots” of the complex that mediate its kinetochore targeting, but contains the entire N-terminal regions of Nuf2 and Ndc80, including an internal Ndc80 “loop” region, thereby providing a complex highly analogous to full length Ndc80 for microtubule binding studies. Although we are unable to obtain this complex at the concentrations required for the saturation competition experiments, we were able to conduct the synergy experiments as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. As for the prior work with the Ndc80 Bonsai complex, we found that the Ndc80 Broccoli complex substantially enhanced the apparent microtubule binding activity of the Astrin-SKAP complex. This data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. However, we note that this assay has additional considerations related to the fact that the Ndc80 complex causes microtubule bundling when present at higher concentrations. Thus, although we have included these experiments for comparison, we would particularly like to highlight the competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5D</xref> for indicating how potent and specific the Ndc80-Astrin-SKAP interaction is on microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should assay more thoroughly the requirement for synergistic binding in vivo for chromosome attachment, behaviour or segregation. This is important because Friese et al., Nat Comm. published that Ndc80 does not bind synergistically to microtubules. The authors could compare the behaviour of full length and the 456 truncation mutant, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>For the revised version, we have conducted substantial additional experimentation to analyze Astrin behavior in human tissue culture cells. For these experiments, we went back to the drawing board to create a robust system for generating gene replacements for Astrin. We utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 inducible knockout system to target endogenous Astrin combined with a transient BacMam expression system to introduce our large constructs. Astrin depletion following induction of these knockouts results in chromosome mis-alignment and spindle multipolarity (a hallmark of severe chromosome mis-alignment defects – see McKinley et al. 2017). We were able to rescue this phenotype by BacMam-based expression of full length Astrin in which the sequence was hardened against the CRISPR guides. In contrast, we found that the Astrin 694-1193 construct is fully defective in chromosome alignment. This mutant localizes to kinetochores, but is unable to associate with the rest of the Astrin-SKAP complex or bind to microtubules. Finally, the Astrin 465-1193 construct was able to rescue the most severe mitotic defects. The 465-1193 truncation associates with SKAP and other subunits. Thus, the most critical activity for this complex is to associate with microtubules at aligned kinetochores, whereas the deletion of the N-terminus does not result in catastrophic phenotypes. Providing this information provides an important context for the various roles of these regions, but dissecting the specific contributions of this domain will require more targeted phenotypic studies, which are beyond the scope and time feasible for this paper. For example, this mutant may show synthetic interactions with mutants that perturb the Ska1 complex, which also associates with the Ndc80 complex, but generating this double mutant represents a complex technical challenge. These additional cellular data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
