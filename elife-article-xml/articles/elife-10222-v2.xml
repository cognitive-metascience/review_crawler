Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures, we designed synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10222.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10222.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10222.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many plants, fungi, and bacteria have evolved to produce small molecules that have powerful effects on the cells of other living organisms, and can even kill them. These naturally produced compounds are often used as starting points for developing new drugs. One such class of compounds are the cyclic peptides, which can be relatively easily produced in the laboratory and are able to penetrate cells. Some cyclic peptides have also proved to be useful for treating cancer and immune diseases, so researchers are keen to identify others that have similar effects. One promising prospect, called ternatin, is produced by several species of fungi. In high doses, ternatin can kill mammalian cells, but it was not clear how it does so.</p><p>To learn more, Carelli et al. searched a chemical database for cyclic peptides related to ternatin and identified several similar compounds that were reported to kill cancer cells. Inspired by the structures of these cyclic peptides, Carelli et al. synthesized modified versions of ternatin. One of these was 500 times more potent than ternatin, which means a much lower dose of the compound is still able to kill cancer cells.</p><p>Further experiments showed that ternatin blocks the production of new proteins in cells. Specifically, ternatin binds to a complex that includes a protein called elongation factor-1A (eEF1A). Mutations in a particular region of eEF1A prevent ternatin from killing cells, suggesting a potential binding site for ternatin.</p><p>The next challenge is to dissect the mechanism by which compounds binding to this site on eEF1A block protein synthesis and kill cells. A related challenge is to understand why certain cancer cells are hypersensitive to ternatin and other eEF1A inhibitors, while other cancer cells are relatively resistant. These questions are relevant to the development of eEF1A inhibitors as cancer treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10222.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10222.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>natural product</kwd><kwd>elongation factor-1A</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>cyclic peptide</kwd><kwd>target identification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taunton</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ancient complex comprising the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and aminoacylated tRNA is shown to be the target of a cyclic heptapeptide and two unrelated natural products with potent anticancer activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrocyclic natural products are a rich source of biologically active compounds, and identification of their targets can open up new opportunities for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Driggers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Villar et al., 2014</xref>). Cyclic peptide natural products, especially those containing one or more <italic>N</italic>-methyl (or <italic>N</italic>-alkyl) amino acids, comprise a privileged class of macrocycles due to their modular structure, relative ease of synthesis, intrinsic cell permeability, and constrained three-dimensional architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bockus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giordanetto and Kihlberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hewitt et al., 2015</xref>). Examples of cyclic peptides with well characterized cellular targets include cyclosporin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 1991</xref>), trapoxin and romidepsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taunton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakajima et al., 1998</xref>), and cotransin/CAM741 and decatransin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besemer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Junne et al., 2015</xref>). These macrocyclic compounds target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling (cyclophilin/calcineurin), epigenetic regulation (histone deacetylases), and secretory protein biogenesis (Sec61 translocon), respectively. In addition to serving as drugs and potential leads for cancer and immune diseases, these cyclic peptides have proven to be useful as chemical probes, revealing new cellular roles for their target proteins, as well as mechanistic insights into the biochemical processes they orchestrate.</p><p>Ternatin (<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) is an <italic>N-</italic>methylated cyclic heptapeptide that inhibits adipogenesis at low nanomolar concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> 20 nM) and becomes cytotoxic at ten-fold higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shimokawa et al., 2008a</xref>). Previous work established an important role for leucine-4, as substitution with alanine (ternatin-4-Ala, <bold>2</bold>) abolished biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimokawa et al., 2008b</xref>). Motivating the current study, ternatin's molecular target and mechanism of action were completely unknown. While searching for cyclic peptides that, like ternatin, incorporate a β-hydroxy leucine, we found a patent application that describes partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an <italic>Aspergillus</italic> fungus in Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blunt et al., 2010</xref>). All five compounds were reported to be cytotoxic to cancer cells in the picomolar to low nanomolar range (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.1–24 nM vs HCT116, MCF7, and P388 cells). One of the more potent congeners, termed ‘A3’, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. Although only 4 out of 11 stereocenters in A3 were assigned, we were able to map the amino acid sequence, stereochemistry, and <italic>N</italic>-methylation pattern directly onto the structure of ternatin.

These considerations led to the design of cyclic peptides <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> as potential ‘north/south’ hybrids of ternatin and A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Compound <bold>3</bold> differs from ternatin only at position 6, whereas <bold>4</bold> additionally has dehydro-homoleucine at position 4. Here, we demonstrate that ternatin and its structural variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis, with compound <bold>4</bold> showing the greatest potency. We further identify the elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This family of <italic>N</italic>-methylated cyclic heptapeptides represents a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Synthesis of <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> proceeded uneventfully according to a route previously established for ternatin (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shimokawa et al., 2007</xref>). We synthesized both C4 epimers of dehydro-homoleucine (2-amino-4-methylhex-5-enoic acid), maintaining the (<italic>S</italic>)-stereochemistry at C2 (by analogy to L-leucine at position 4 of ternatin) and varying the C4 side-chain stereochemistry; each epimer was incorporated separately into the final cyclic peptide. The (2<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>R</italic>)-epimer depicted in <bold>4</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) was slightly more potent than the (2<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>S</italic>)-epimer in cell proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and was used in all subsequent experiments.</p><p>We first tested the effects of compounds <bold>1–4</bold> on HCT116 cells. Ternatin (<bold>1</bold>) potently inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> 71 ± 10 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), whereas ternatin-4-Ala (<bold>2</bold>) had no effect up to 10 μM, consistent with its reported lack of activity in an adipogenesis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimokawa et al., 2008b</xref>). Ternatin-4-Ala (<bold>2</bold>) is thus a valuable negative control compound for mechanism-of-action studies. Structural modifications inspired by the <italic>Aspergillus</italic> cyclic peptides had significant effects on potency. While substitution with pipecolic acid increased potency two-fold, further substitution with (2<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>R</italic>)-dehydro-homoleucine resulted in an additional ten-fold increase (IC<sub>50</sub> 4.6 ± 1.0 nM). To extend these results, we tested <bold>1</bold> and <bold>4</bold> against a panel of 21 cell lines derived from diverse solid and hematological tumors. While IC<sub>50</sub> values of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>4</bold> spanned 3–4 orders of magnitude, they were correlated across all cell lines (Spearman correlation, 0.84, p&lt;0.0001), with <bold>4</bold> being twenty-fold to &gt;500-fold more potent than <bold>1</bold>, depending on the cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This strong correlation suggests that ternatin and <bold>4</bold> kill cancer cells by a similar mechanism. Moreover, the pipecolic acid and dehydro-homoleucine substitutions in <bold>4</bold> resulted in dramatically increased potency across all cell lines tested.</p><p>Based on its broad anti-proliferative activity across many cell lines, we speculated that <bold>4</bold> might inhibit a fundamental cellular process. Indeed, global protein synthesis was abolished in cells treated with <bold>4</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Pulse labeling of newly synthesized proteins with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine revealed that <bold>4</bold> inhibits protein synthesis more potently than ternatin, in agreement with the cell proliferation results.

The polysome profile was unchanged in cells treated with <bold>4</bold> compared to DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, left panel), indicating that global translation initiation was not perturbed. To test for inhibition of translation elongation, we asked whether <bold>4</bold> could abrogate polysome runoff induced by the initiation inhibitor harringtonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lindqvist et al., 2010</xref>).

Previous efforts to prepare a biotinylated ternatin probe yielded an inactive analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimokawa et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore designed the bifunctional probe <bold>5</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), which incorporates photo-leucine at position 4 and an alkyne at position 6 for tagging via click chemistry conjugation, similar to our previous strategy with cotransin cyclic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacKinnon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacKinnon and Taunton, 2009</xref>).

Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic activity of the cyclic heptapeptide natural product A3, we designed compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, which are up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin. Ternatins inhibit protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation, and photo-ternatin <bold>5</bold> identified eEF1A as a plausible target. Surprisingly, photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA. To our knowledge, specific binding of a small molecule to the eEF1A ternary complex has not been reported previously. Whether this binding event blocks translation elongation by a mechanism analogous to the antibiotic kirromycin, as suggested by the genetic dominance of ternatin sensitivity, is an exciting question that awaits future biochemical and structural studies.</p><p>Also unexpected was our discovery that two structurally unrelated natural products, didemnin and ansatrienin, compete with <bold>5</bold> for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. Combined with the recent finding that nannocystin A targets domain III of eEF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krastel et al., 2015</xref>), our study suggests that four natural products with highly diverse chemical structures have evolved independently to target a shared interaction surface near Ala399 on eEF1A. A didemnin variant, plitidepsin, is currently in advanced clinical trials for multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PharmaMar Pipeline</xref>). Hence, drugging this surface on eEF1A may have clinical utility. Of the four structurally divergent natural products now identified as eEF1A inhibitors, ternatins may be particularly attractive as leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts, due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HCT116 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in McCoy’s 5A media (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Axenia Biologix, Dixon, CA), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 ug/mL streptomycin (Gibco).

The authors began with an astute detective work to identify the relationship between ternatin and some of highly potent antiproliferative cyclic peptides disclosed in the patent literature. They then synthesized a few analogs and identified one (ternatin analog #4 or ternatinA4) with 20- to 50-fold higher potency than the ternatin itself in a large number of cancer cell lines. Based on limited structure-activity relationship, an active photo-affinity label with a clickable handle was made and used to detect a 50-kD protein from cell extract. Guided by the effect of ternatin and analogs on translation elongation, the authors guessed that the 50-kD protein is eEF1A, a GTPase that is involved in the loading of charged tRNA during the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Subsequently, the authors found that ternatinA4 indeed bound to eEF1A in a GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA dependent manner, suggesting that ternatin bound to the ternary complex of eEF1A, GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA. To confirm that eEF1A is the bona fide target for ternatinA4, the authors took advantage of a known Ala399 mutant of eEF1A that was recently reported to confer resistance to another elongation inhibitor nannocystin A. Indeed, the same A399V mutant was found to confer resistance to ternatinA4 to cells and lost binding to ternatinA4. Moreover, the authors also demonstrated that the known eEF1A inhibitors didemnin B and ansatrienin B could both compete against the ternatin photo-affinity label for binding to eEF1A, suggesting that they share the same target.</p><p>This is a fascinating detective story epitomizing the power of combining chemical tools with biological intuition to elucidate the mode of action of a promising family of natural products and related analogs. The strengths of the manuscript include (1) Synthesis and discovery of a new derivative, ternatinA4, with significantly improved cellular activity over ternatin itself.

Though ternatin and its analog ternatinA4 are not the first translation inhibitors targeting eEF1A, their structural simplicity and ease of synthesis renders them more ideal leads for future drug development. (4) The data are of high quality and convincing.</p><p>A few issues remain that the authors may consider addressing to further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) Very minor: A gradient symbol was used to show changes in concentrations of compounds used in different experiments (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Though the lowest and highest concentrations were shown, it is not immediately obvious what those intermediate concentrations were. As there were only a limited number of lanes, the drug concentration for each lane should be either shown in the figure or figure legends.</p><p>2) Minor: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, the authors used inhibition of polysome depletion by an initiation inhibitor as a hint that ternatinA4 likely inhibits the elongation phase of protein synthesis. A more definitive and popular method is to use a dual luciferase reporter with one of the luciferases under the control of an IRES element from a viral transcript. This can be easily done and will complement the polysome depletion assay.</p><p>3) Major but optional: Since it has been shown that ternatinA4 binds to the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex, an obvious mechanistic question is what is the functional impact of this interaction on the complex. A couple of obvious questions that come to mind include 1) Does ternatinA4 affect the binding of the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex to the ribosome? 2) Does ternatinA4 inhibit the ribosome-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of the eEF1A complex? It is noted that the authors may not have the assays established in the lab. Hence, these experiments are optional.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe their efforts to elucidate the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic natural product, ternatin, as well as related compounds. Guided by a photocrosslinkable and clickable ternatin derivative that they design, and cell biological investigation of the effects of the compound on protein synthesis, they identify eEFA1 as the cellular target of ternatin. Their assertion is supported by the demonstration that a single point mutation in eEFA1 abolishes photocrosslinking to their ternatin probe and confers cellular resistance to ternatin.</p><p>The study nicely demonstrates the utility of chemical biology approaches for target identification and has identified what appears to be the major cellular target of a class of compounds with therapeutic potential. Overall, it is a nice body of work that will be of interest to scientists in the fields of chemical biology and drug discovery.</p><p>I have only two concerns about the manuscript in its present state:</p><p>1) The authors claim that ternatin binds to a ternary complex containing GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA. Their claim is supported by RNaseA digestion of lysate that abrogates cross-linking to the ternatin probe and their reconstitution of the ternary complex. My concern relates to the resconstitution experiment that relies upon Phe-tRNA obtained from extracts. It seems that in this context the authors cannot exclude that some other RNA component may be important for binding, or that eEFA1 is somehow processed by residual activity carried over from the extract. There is no description of the purification protocol used to isolate the tRNA. Furthermore, why was Phe-tRNA used? Will any tRNA suffice or is ternatin binding specific to a complex containing Phe-tRNA?</p><p>2) The authors use ternatin-resistant cell lines containing A399V/T mutations, however these lines appear to have been generated by selection against another protein synthesis inhibitor. In light of this, these cell lines may contain additional mutations that are necessary for ternatin resistance. I suggest that the authors demonstrate that overexpression of a mutant eEFA1 transgene confers similar cellular resistance to the drug.</p><p>If these concerns can be addressed, then this manuscript should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Carelli and co-workers the authors seek to identify the macromolecular target of the ternatin natural product and related derivatives.

In light of this, these cell lines may contain additional mutations that are necessary for ternatin resistance. I suggest that the authors demonstrate that overexpression of a mutant eEFA1 transgene confers similar cellular resistance to the drug.</italic></p><p>Because resistance to ternatin is recessive (heterozygous A399 mutants are only partially resistant), and endogenous eEF1A is one of the most abundant proteins in the cell, the proposed experiment is challenging. Despite many attempts with various expression vectors, we were unable to express mutant eEF1A at high enough levels to confer significant resistance in a 'wild-type' cell line.</p><p>We therefore devised an alternative experiment, the results of which strongly support our central conclusion that eEF1A is the relevant target of ternatin cyclic peptides. Starting with homozygous A399V EEF1A1 cells, which are completely resistant to compound 4, we show that ectopic expression of WT eEF1A is sufficient to restore sensitivity. By contrast, A399V cells transduced with A399V eEF1A remain completely resistant. These new data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> Reviewer 3: <italic>In my opinion, it is a missed opportunity that the authors do not come back and try to explain the results of the 21 cell line panel in the context of their data. Could it be that the three highly resistant cell lines have these very mutations in the EE1A1 gene (that confer resistance to 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>)? That would be incredibly exciting. And, actionable – as the authors mention this eEF1A is not an uncommon target for drugs to hit, and experimental therapeutics that hit this target are in the clinic. If patient outcome could be predicted before treatment (based on this mutation) that would be a most valuable part of this work.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s enthusiasm and agree this is an important question. We note that mechanisms underlying intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs are often complex and multifactorial. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer's intriguing question, we scrutinized internal RNAseq data (available for 18 of the 21 cell lines). We did not identify any EEF1A1 or EEF1A2 mutations at A399. Mutations at other EEF1A1 positions were tentatively identified in two of the three most resistant cell lines, as well as one highly sensitive cell line. However, the functional relevance of these mutations is unknown and currently under investigation.</p><p><italic>Full reviews:</italic></p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] A few issues remain that the authors may consider addressing to further strengthen the manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Very minor: A gradient symbol was used to show changes in concentrations of compounds used in different experiments (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Though the lowest and highest concentrations were shown, it is not immediately obvious what those intermediate concentrations were. As there were only a limited number of lanes, the drug concentration for each lane should be either shown in the figure or figure legends.</italic></p><p>We have adjusted the figure legends to improve clarity.</p><p><italic>2) Minor: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, the authors used inhibition of polysome depletion by an initiation inhibitor as a hint that ternatinA4 likely inhibits the elongation phase of protein synthesis. A more definitive and popular method is to use a dual luciferase reporter with one of the luciferases under the control of an IRES element from a viral transcript. This can be easily done and will complement the polysome depletion assay.</italic></p><p>We agree this is an interesting experiment that would complement the polysome depletion assay. However, we have chosen to focus our efforts on generating additional genetic data that implicate eEF1A as the biologically relevant target of ternatin-family cyclic peptides. Experiments to define the precise mechanism by which ternatins inhibit protein synthesis will form the basis of a future study.</p><p><italic>3) Major but optional: Since it has been shown that ternatinA4 binds to the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex, an obvious mechanistic question is what is the functional impact of this interaction on the complex. A couple of obvious questions that come to mind include 1) Does ternatinA4 affect the binding of the eEF1A-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex to the ribosome? 2) Does ternatinA4 inhibit the ribosome-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of the eEF1A complex? It is noted that the authors may not have the assays established in the lab. Hence, these experiments are optional.</italic></p><p>These are exciting mechanistic questions that we hope to address in future studies.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] I have only two concerns about the manuscript in its present state:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors claim that ternatin binds to a ternary complex containing GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA. Their claim is supported by RNaseA digestion of lysate that abrogates cross-linking to the ternatin probe and their reconstitution of the ternary complex. My concern relates to the resconstitution experiment that relies upon Phe-tRNA obtained from extracts. It seems that in this context the authors cannot exclude that some other RNA component may be important for binding, or that eEFA1 is somehow processed by residual activity carried over from the extract. There is no description of the purification protocol used to isolate the tRNA. Furthermore, why was Phe-tRNA used? Will any tRNA suffice or is ternatin binding specific to a complex containing Phe-tRNA?</italic></p><p>While we cannot completely exclude the presence of trace RNA contaminants in our photo-affinity labeling experiments, it is important to note that we did not use extracts to generate Phe-tRNA. Bulk tRNA was purified from reticulocytes according to Merrick (1979) and is free of mRNA, 18S rRNA, and 28S rRNA. After charging bulk tRNA with Phe using a partially purified aminoacyl tRNA synthetase fraction (purified by DEAE chromatography according to Merrick, 1979), Phe-tRNA was isolated by sequential phenol-chloroform extraction, EtOH precipitation, and Sephadex G-25 chromatography (Walker and Fredrick, 2008). Phe-tRNA is often used in biochemical reconstitution experiments due to its relative stability. Whether ternatin binds eEF1A in the presence other aa-tRNAs is an intriguing question that merits further investigation.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] There are a few issues/questions, some of which could make the paper much more interesting and useful if answered:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors assess compounds 1 and 4 in a 21-cell line panel, but this panel does not include the workhorse cell line for this study (HEK293T), very odd. Where does this cell line fall in the two orders of magnitude sensitivity spectrum? That information would be useful in interpreting if the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are expected to be typical, or are anomalous.</italic></p><p>We have added proliferation data for HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>), which show essentially the same sensitivity as HCT116 cells.</p><p><italic>3) Again, it is strange that the authors go to the trouble to generate nannocystin-resistant HCT116 cells – why not generate cells that are directly resistant to 1 or 4? I assume this was attempted.</italic></p><p>The nannocystin-resistant, <italic>EEF1A1</italic>-mutant cell lines were generated in a separate study (Krastel et al., 2015); we obtained and tested these cells because our experiments with ternatin implicated eEF1A as the likely target.</p><p><italic>4) There are many places where key data is mentioned but not shown anywhere (effect on actin/tubulin, the nannocystin-resistance of the cell lines, etc.).
