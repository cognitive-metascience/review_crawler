AMPAR auxiliary proteins regulate receptor trafficking, and modulate receptor mobility and its biophysical properties. The AMPAR auxiliary protein Shisa7 (CKAMP59) has been shown to interact with AMPARs in artificial expression systems, but it is unknown whether Shisa7 has a functional role in glutamatergic synapses. We show that Shisa7 physically interacts with synaptic AMPARs in mouse hippocampus. <italic>Shisa7</italic> gene deletion resulted in faster AMPAR currents in CA1 synapses, without affecting its synaptic expression. <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO mice showed reduced initiation and maintenance of long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses. In line with this, <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO mice showed a specific deficit in contextual fear memory, both short-term and long-term after conditioning, whereas auditory fear memory and anxiety-related behavior were normal. Thus, Shisa7 is a bona-fide AMPAR modulatory protein affecting channel kinetics of AMPARs, necessary for synaptic hippocampal plasticity, and memory recall.</p></abstract><kwd-group

excitatory synaptic transmission is largely mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of glutamatergic transmission depends on both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>). In the post-synapse this process is mainly determined by regulation of the number and biophysical properties of synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conti and Weinberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jonas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bredt and Nicoll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choquet and Triller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shepherd and Huganir, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo, 2012</xref>). Activity-dependent plasticity underlying learning, memory, and synapse turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malenka and Nicoll, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Derkach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newpher and Ehlers, 2008</xref>), has been shown to rely on AMPAR post-translational modifications and specific protein interactions. Over the last years, a range of mostly transmembrane proteins has been identified as components of native brain-derived AMPAR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>). The function of most of these direct AMPAR interactors is hitherto unknown, however, several have been identified as AMPAR auxiliary subunits, affecting trafficking, channel kinetics, surface mobility, and activity-dependent regulation of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackson and Nicoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Straub and Tomita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sumioka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martenson and Tomita, 2015</xref>). The transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>), the Cornichon homologs (CNIH-2 and CNIH3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwenk et al., 2009</xref>), Germ Cell-Specific Gene 1-Like (GSG1L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shanks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>]), SynDIG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalashnikova et al., 2010</xref>), Porcn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlenhardt et al., 2016</xref>), and the recently identified members of the Shisa family, Shisa9/CKAMP44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pei and Grishin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karataeva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrow et al., 2015</xref>) and Shisa6/CKAMP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>) all modulate AMPAR function in a unique manner. TARPs and cornichons decrease deactivation and desensitization rates of the activated AMPAR, and promote synaptic targeting. In contrast, GSG1L increases AMPAR deactivation and desensitization when overexpressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shanks et al., 2012</xref>) and in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of <italic>GSG1L</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). This overexpression also reduces synaptic AMPAR expression and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Shisa proteins display a distinct profile of modulation of AMPAR expression, channel kinetics and activity-dependent regulation. Shisa9 and Shisa6 similarly slow AMPAR deactivation ex vivo in the dentate gyrus and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>), and both proteins slow the rate of recovery from desensitization in a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, Shisa9 enhances the desensitization rate and reduces short-term facilitation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>), whereas Shisa6 prevents AMPAR desensitization, thereby reducing short-term synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, Shisa7/CKAMP59 was identified as AMPAR interacting protein by co-immunoprecipitation with GluA1 and GluA2 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrow et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, Shisa7 did not exert effect on channel kinetics, unlike Shisa6 and Shisa9. Whether Shisa7 has a functional role in glutamatergic synapses and behavior that depends on glutamatergic synaptic transmission is not known. Here, we find that Shisa7 displays strong synaptic enrichment and colocalizes with the AMPAR. We reveal that Shisa7 directly associates with AMPARs within native hippocampal protein complexes, independent of AMPAR subunit composition. By creating transgenic animals lacking the Shisa7 protein, we find that Shisa7, unlike shown for Shisa9, is important for hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as well as contextual memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Shisa7 shares high structural similarity with the established AMPAR-associated proteins Shisa6, and Shisa9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Furthermore, Shisa7 has a wider expression pattern than Shisa6 and Shisa9. Shisa7 is found highly expressed in telencephalic structures (e.g., cortex, hippocampus, striatum), and to a lesser extent in diencephalic (e.g., nuclei of the (sub- and hypo-) thalamus) and in some mesencephalic structures (e.g., superior and inferior colliculus), as can be observed at the transcript and in part at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Like Shisa6 and Shisa9, Shisa7 is a postsynaptic protein that shows strong co-localization with Homer1 in hippocampal neurons and a high level of enrichment in the biochemically isolated PSD fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). Shisa7 was found to interact with postsynaptic scaffolding protein of the disks large (Dlg) homolog family, PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), via its C-terminal PDZ motif. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments identified the established AMPAR auxiliary subunit Shisa6 as part of hippocampal Shisa7 complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The synaptic context in which Shisa7 resides together with these other AMPAR interactors may enable the combined and possibly cooperative modulation of AMPAR properties.</p><p>Of the Shisa family members only Shisa6, and not Shisa9, was identified as co-interactor in the Shisa7-AMPAR complex. Thus, Shisa9 is not likely to decorate the same AMPAR population as Shisa7. Shisa6 was recently established as an AMPAR-auxiliary protein involved in AMPAR kinetics and AMPAR mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, Shisa6 was shown to interact with TARP γ−8. Although TARP γ−8 might not be a component of the Shisa7-AMPAR complex, as apparent from the immunoprecipitation in WT <italic>vs. Shisa7</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), it may have gone undetected. Interestingly, the levels of other AMPAR auxiliary proteins did not change upon deletion of Shisa7, suggesting that receptors without Shisa7 are not perturbed in their remaining auxiliary protein composition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Shisa7 provides distinct modulation of AMPAR kinetics</title><p>Shisa7 is a Shisa family member with a distinct profile of AMPAR modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Shisa7 influences AMPAR kinetics when co-expressed in HEK293 cells, resulting in an increase in the rate of desensitization, a lower sustained current in the prolonged presence of glutamate, and a reduced recovery from desensitization in contrast to what has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrow et al., 2015</xref>). However, this opposition might reflect a difference in the Shisa7 and GluA1 protein levels, or a ratio thereof, upon expression in HEK293 cells. We found no effect on the rate of AMPAR deactivation. Shisa6 on the other hand, while bestowing a similar reduction in the AMPAR recovery from desentization, was found to reduce the rate of deactivation, reduce the rate of desensitization, and strongly increased the sustained steady state current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, whereas all Shisa family members reduce the rate of recovery from desensitization, only TARP γ−8 increases the recovery time. Thus, albeit that Shisa7 is structurally more related to Shisa6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pei and Grishin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farrow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>), some of its functional effects on AMPAR kinetics measured in a heterologous system resemble that of Shisa9, i.e. reducing sustained AMPAR current and increasing desensitization. This yields a new member of the Shisa family with unique properties.</p><p>Importantly, in contrast to the HEK293 cell system, when assessed within the neuronal context of hippocampal slices, Shisa7 deletion strongly shortens the decay time of mEPSCs and the decay and rise time of evoked AMPAR currents (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), leaving NMDAR currents unaltered. This ex-vivo effect on evoked and/or miniature EPSC decay kinetics is a feature shared by most of the identified AMPAR auxiliary subunits, and has been reported for Shisa6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>), Shisa9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>), TARP γ−8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>), CNIH2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudkkazi et al., 2014</xref>), but not for GSG1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). Since AMPAR deactivation was not affected upon co-expression of Shisa7 and GluA1-containing AMPARs in heterologous cells, we conclude that the observed alterations in AMPAR decay time in <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO neurons relies on the neuronal cellular context. These could be mediated by: (i) interactions of Shisa7 with GluA2- and GluA3-subunit containing AMPARs, (ii) neuronal phosphorylation states of the receptor or Shisa7, (iii) (secondary) interactions of Shisa7 with other auxiliary proteins in the complex resulting in a combined and possibly cooperative modulation of AMPAR kinetics, or (iv) <italic>Shisa7</italic> deletion rendering the AMPAR in a state that allows other auxiliary subunits to more prominently modulate biophysical properties of the receptor. In the latter case, it must be noted that no compensatory changes were observed in the synaptic membrane expression levels of AMPAR auxiliary subunits TARP γ−8, Shisa6 or Shisa9 in the <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO condition. Finally, testing of the aforementioned ideas would require a technically challenging reconstitution of the protein complexes in vitro, based on the exact complex composition identified in vivo, to search for a mimic of the physiological effects that were observed in brain slices.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of AMPAR auxiliary subunits on short-term synaptic plasticity appears to be diverse, even within the same protein family. Whereas Shisa6 and TARP γ−8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>) facilitate short-term plasticity, Shisa9 decreases short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>), and Shisa7 is without effect. Apparently, there is no direct correlation or causality between the effect of Shisa and TARP proteins on in vitro AMPAR recovery from desensitization and ex vivo synaptic depression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Shisa7 is required for synaptic plasticity-dependent changes in AMPAR expression</title><p>Most of the yet identified AMPAR-auxiliary proteins, such as Shisa9, members of the Cornichon and TARP family control AMPAR surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coombs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2012</xref>). Here we show that the absence of Shisa7 has no effects on the amplitudes of mEPSCs and electrically-evoked amplitudes in hippocampal CA1 neurons, in line with results obtained for Shisa6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). These data imply that both Shisa6 and Shisa7 are not involved in synaptic recruitment of AMPARs under basal conditions. We further confirmed this by showing that the expression of the AMPAR in biochemically isolated synaptic membrane fractions, and in synapses of primary hippocampal cultured neurons is not altered due to Shisa7 deletion.</p><p>Although basal expression of the AMPAR is not dependent on Shisa7, plasticity experiments revealed that induction and maintenance of LTP in the Schaffer collaterals fails dramatically in <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO mice. Firstly, deletion of <italic>Shisa7</italic> strongly affects the initiation phase of LTP, as is most profoundly visible when analyzing EPSP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This initial phase of LTP is characterized by an increase in intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002</xref>), followed by a reduction in AMPAR mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>) through diffusional trapping, a process that is dependent on TARP phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the fact that the Shisa family members do not contain the typical class I PDZ binding motif found in Dlg-interacting proteins but rather the type II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Songyang et al., 1997</xref>), our data reveal that Shisa7 is directly associated with the prominent diffusion slot organizer and postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (DLG4) through its C-terminal PDZ-motif. A similar PDZ-protein association was observed for Shisa9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karataeva et al., 2014</xref>) and Shisa6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaassen et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically for Shisa6, we previously showed that this interaction underlies its ability to reduce AMPAR mobility. However, we here did not perform these experiments, mainly due to the observed loss of spines after Shisa7 overexpression. Taken together, it is suggested that Shisa7 plays a role in immobilization of the AMPAR in the PSD upon stimulation, likely due to binding of synaptic scaffolds or via indirect modulation of TARP phosphorylation.</p><p>The subsequent phases of LTP are characterized by the exocytosis and recruitment of additional AMPARs to postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>), thereby providing a lasting increase in synaptic strength and spine size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopec et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO animals show a profound deficit in this maintenance phase of LTP, yet they do not display impaired synaptic AMPAR targeting under basal conditions. This phenotype was corroborated in cultured neurons, in which the chemical LTP-induced increase in surface GluA1 was not observed in the <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO.</p><p>The <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO LTP phenotype in the CA1 region resembles that of TARP γ−8 KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>]). On the other hand, Shisa9 has no effect on LTP, as measured in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khodosevich et al., 2014</xref>), but it does modulate AMPAR surface expression similar to TARP γ−8. Together, this highlights the unique role of Shisa7 on AMPAR functionality compared with other Shisa proteins. We propose that in contrast with other auxiliary subunits, such as Shisa6, Shisa7 has only mild effects on AMPAR gating and therefore does not influence short-term plasticity. Indirect interaction with the protein machinery that is required for AMPAR exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jurado, 2014</xref>) could aid to maintain synapses in a potentiated state, as is necessary for LTP. Furthermore, after LTP induction, Shisa7 could act as scaffolding protein in the PSD through direct interaction with Dlg family members to promote diffusion trapping based on its C-terminal type II PDZ-ligand motif (EVTV). A rescue experiment introducing Shisa7 with and without this PDZ-ligand motif in a <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO background could support this hypothesis. However, considering that the level of Shisa7 expression through viral delivery cannot be controlled and viral Shisa7 expression leads to spine loss, this experiment would lead to inconclusive results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Shisa7 is specifically involved in plasticity underlying contextual memories</title><p>Although AMPAR auxiliary subunits have been studied in detail for cellular hippocampal plasticity processes, studies on the biological significance in terms of general behavioral effects and cognition are sparse and so far have been studied for TARP γ−8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gleason et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2016</xref>) and GSG-1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>GSG-1L</italic> KO rat has no spatial memory deficits in the Morris Water Maze and a spatial object recognition test, although non-spatial novel object recognition memory is impaired. AMPAR-directed compounds that partially disrupt the interaction between TARP γ−8 and the AMPAR prevent the effect of TARP γ−8 on desensitization and deactivation, and have a dualistic effect when systemically administered during spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maher et al., 2016</xref>); at high dose it impairs acquisition of spatial memory in the Morris water maze, whereas at low doses it has a facilitating effect.

In addition, the basolateral amygdala contributes both to the contextual component of fear memory retrieval, as well as to the cued component of tone-shock pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gale et al., 2004</xref>). It is of interest that only contextual memory was impaired, leaving auditory fear memory intact, whereas Shisa7 is expressed in the hippocampus and amygdala at both the transcript and protein level. Hence, the impact of Shisa7 deletion on plasticity is probably brain region-dependent, which might result from the distinct composition of the associated proteins that reside in different Shisa7-AMPAR complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed that <italic>Shisa7</italic> is functional in AMPAR-containing synapses in the hippocampus and is involved in the fine-tuning of the channel properties of AMPARs, affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and takes part in hippocampus-dependent fear memory.

editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The AMPA receptor-associated protein Shisa7 regulates hippocampal synaptic function and contextual memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Auxiliary subunits of AMPARs play critical roles in regulating AMPAR activity in vivo, and CKAMP/Shisa family proteins have been shown to function as AMPAR auxiliary subunits. Here Schmitz et al. show that <italic>Shisa7/CKAMP59</italic> is enriched in the mouse PSD fraction. Overexpressed Flag-Shisa7 in <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO primary cultured neurons co-localize with Homer1 and co-IPed with AMPARs. Furthermore, Shisa7 modulates recovery from desensitization of GluA1 expressed in HEK cells without affecting the deactivation and desensitization. In the Shisa7 KO mice the decay kinetics of mEPSC and eEPSC were significantly faster without obvious changes in expressions and localizations of AMPARs and other synaptic proteins. Furthermore, LTP and contextual fear memory were impaired in <italic>Shisa7</italic> KO mice.</p><p>Even though the interaction of Shisa7 and AMPA receptor subunits was previously reported, this study advances our understanding of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits and of Shisa proteins in particular. The results show an unexpected role of Shisa7 in regulating the recovery from desensitization. The findings that induction and LTP is impaired in absence of Shisa7 and that Shisa7 plays region-specific roles in memory processes are of additional relevance. Further, the experiments are well performed. Important open questions exist, though, about the mechanisms of Shisa7 function. In addition, the manuscript contains a number of imprecise descriptions and lack of explanations, which require careful attention in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanism by which Shisa7 impacts LTP is unclear. Is the desensitization rate of AMPA receptors causally linked to LTP induction or maintenance? If there is no such evidence, the authors should test alternative explanations. Even though Shisa7 does not impact synaptic AMPA receptor abundance at steady state, Shisa7 may regulate the activity-dependent trafficking of AMPA receptors to synapses as LTP is induced and their synaptic retention during LTP maintenance. This can be addressed e.g. using quantitative surface staining after chemical LTP in cultured neurons.</p><p>2) To conclude specific changes in AMPARs, analysis of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs is necessary. A ratio of AMPAR/NMDAR-mediated evoked EPSC amplitude and NMDAR decay kinetics in Shisa7 KO mice should be provided.</p><p>3) Shisa7 prolongs AMPAR currents and regulates LTP. However, the data seem to provide little insights into the underlying mechanism(s). The authors should try virus-mediated rescue experiments and demonstrate that the observed changes in mEPSC currents and synaptic plasticity can be rescued by wild-type Shisa7 but not by a mutant Shisa7, which e.g. lacks the PSD-95-binding C-terminus.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The AMPA receptor-associated protein Shisa7 regulates hippocampal synaptic function and contextual memory&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues, specifically regarding essential point 3 in the prior decision letter that we would like you to address before acceptance. That point asked for a rescue experiment by wildtype Shisa7, but not by mutant Shisa7 that for example lacked the PSD-binding C terminus. In your rebuttal you indicate that you did not think these experiments would be informative as &quot;…we observed previously that overexpression of Shisa7 results in a loss of spines in WT and KO culture alike. Apparently, the acute increase in Shisa7 levels has a major impact on synapse integrity. For this same reason, it would not make sense to include a quantitative analysis of the Shisa7 – PSD-95 colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rather, this image was shown for qualitative purposes, namely that the majority of Shisa7 is in the post-synaptic density together with PSD-95, as our biochemical data shows. Thus, given the fact that the viral expression level of Shisa7 is hard to control and leads to spine loss, we think a rescue experiment will not lead to justified conclusions…&quot;.</p><p>We accept your decision not to pursue these experiments in the manuscript. However, we think readers might have similar questions. Thus a discussion of these issues and your observations with overexpression in WT and KO cultures deserves discussion in the text of your manuscript. Thus please revise the discussion in that regard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24192.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanism by which Shisa7 impacts LTP is unclear.
