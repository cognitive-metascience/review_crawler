However, some cell lines that depend on glutamine anaplerosis in culture rely less on glutamine catabolism to proliferate in vivo. We sought to understand the environmental differences that cause differential dependence on glutamine for anaplerosis. We find that cells cultured in adult bovine serum, which better reflects nutrients available to cells in vivo, exhibit decreased glutamine catabolism and reduced reliance on glutamine anaplerosis compared to cells cultured in standard tissue culture conditions. We find that levels of a single nutrient, cystine, accounts for the differential dependence on glutamine in these different environmental contexts. Further, we show that cystine levels dictate glutamine dependence via the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic>. Thus, xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression, in conjunction with environmental cystine, is necessary and sufficient to increase glutamine catabolism, defining important determinants of glutamine anaplerosis and glutaminase dependence in cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27713.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells need to consume certain nutrients in order to grow, and some cancer drugs work by affecting the ability of the cells to use these nutrients. For decades researchers have grown cancer cells in petri dishes with standard nutrient formulations (also known as tissue culture), but the nutrients available to cancer cells in tissue culture are not the same as those found in the body.</p><p>Cancer cells growing in tissue culture consume large amounts of a nutrient called glutamine. These cells die when exposed to a class of drugs called glutaminase inhibitors that prevent them from processing glutamine. However, when these same cancer cells grow as tumors in animals, they process less glutamine and are not affected by glutaminase inhibitors. So what differences are there between growing cancer cells in tumors and tissue culture that explain this different reliance on glutamine?</p><p>Muir et al. reasoned that changing the levels of nutrients available to cancer cells might change what these cells consume, and so grew human cancer cells in cow serum (which has a similar nutrient content to blood in humans and other mammals). Indeed, these cells consumed less glutamine and responded to glutaminase inhibitors in a way that is similar to how tumors in the body respond to these drugs. Comparing the nutrient content of cow serum and typical tissue culture formulations revealed that high levels of the nutrient cystine cause the cells to rely more on glutamine.</p><p>The results presented by Muir et al. suggest that cancer cells in tumors could be made to consume more glutamine and that this would make them sensitive to glutaminase inhibitors – a possibility that will be studied in future work. Exposing cultured cancer cells to nutrient levels closer to those found in the body may also better predict how tumor cells use nutrients and respond to some treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>) and reflects the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017</xref>). Indeed, one of the earliest noted biochemical differences between cancerous and normal tissues is increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cori and Cori, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>). Beyond increased glucose metabolism in tumors, another long standing observation is that many cancer cells consume substantial amounts of glutamine in culture, far in excess of other amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eagle, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, many cancer cell lines depend on extracellular glutamine for proliferation in vitro, even though glutamine is nominally non-essential and can be synthesized from other nutrients. This contributed to the concept that some cancer cells are glutamine addicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wise and Thompson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Glutamine can be used to support proliferation in multiple ways. It is a proteinogenic amino acid, can act as a nitrogen donor for the synthesis of amino acids as well as nucleotides, and glutamine can contribute carbon to the TCA cycle to replace cycle intermediates that are removed for the production of biomass, a process termed anaplerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daye and Wellen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeBerardinis and Cheng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of the fate of glutamine nitrogen in proliferating cancer cells in vitro suggests that most glutamine nitrogen is excreted as ammonia and alanine, suggesting that the high rate of glutamine consumption is not due to nitrogen demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>). Instead, glutamine metabolism is important for TCA cycle anaplerosis in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuneva et al., 2007</xref>). Across cancer cell lines, the majority of aspartate, glutamate and TCA cycle metabolites are glutamine-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wise and Thompson, 2010</xref>), with production of amino acids being a major fate of anaplerotic glutamine carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosios et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these results, proliferation of many cell types following glutamine starvation is rescued by providing an alternative source of the TCA cycle intermediates α-ketoglutarate (αKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wise et al., 2011</xref>) or oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that anaplerosis contributes to the large cellular consumption of glutamine in culture, and to dependence on this amino acid for cell proliferation and survival.</p><p>Glutamine can enter the TCA cycle through multiple metabolic routes. First, several transporters are capable of transporting glutamine into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hediger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hyde et al., 2003</xref>). Relevant to cancer, the neutral amino acid transporters ASCT2/<italic>SLC1A5</italic> and LAT1/<italic>SLC7A5</italic> are known to have higher expression in certain tumors, and can mediate glutamine uptake in cell lines derived from these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhutia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pochini et al., 2014</xref>). Intracellularly, glutamine is converted to glutamate either by donating the amide nitrogen for the production of nucleotides or asparagine, or by glutaminase activity (encoded by <italic>GLS1 or GLS2</italic>), which produces glutamate and ammonia from glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curthoys and Watford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krebs, 1935</xref>). In proliferating cells, glutaminase activity can be the primary driver of glutamate production from glutamine, as amide nitrogen incorporation into mass is low compared to release of glutamine nitrogen as ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brand, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brand et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosios et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wise et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic or pharmacological loss of <italic>GLS1</italic> activity depletes TCA metabolites and slows proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gameiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seltzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Timmerman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yuneva et al., 2012</xref>). This has led to interest in targeting glutaminase activity therapeutically, and the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 is being evaluated in clinical trials to treat cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2014</xref>). In the last step of glutamine carbon entry into the TCA cycle, glutamate produced from glutamine is converted to αKG by either transamination reactions or by glutamate dehydrogenase to produce αKG as an anaplerotic TCA cycle intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreadith and Lehninger, 1984</xref>). Rapidly proliferating cells have been shown to preferentially use transamination reactions for αKG production, consistent with their increased need for nitrogen for biosynthetic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coloff et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, consistent with these observations of increased glutamine catabolism and dependence in rapidly proliferating cultured cells, glutamine catabolic pathways are controlled by oncogene expression and upregulated in many cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Tumor cell environment can also influence dependence on glutaminase for anaplerosis and proliferation. Tracing of glucose and glutamine fate in tumors derived from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mouse <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven NSCLC found that these tumors rely more on glucose than on glutamine for TCA cycle anaplerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hensley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>). This correlated with resistance of these tumors to glutaminase inhibition in vivo; but surprisingly, cell lines derived from these tumors with decreased glutamine catabolism showed dramatically increased glutamine anaplerosis and sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition when cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that, even for cells capable of glutamine catabolism, environmental differences between tumors in vivo and tissue culture dictates the use of glutamine for anaplerosis.</p><p>We describe the identification of an environmental factor that contributes to differential glutamine anaplerosis between human NSCLC tumors growing in vivo and cell lines cultured in vitro. Nutrient availability is different for cancer cells growing as tumors in vivo compared to culture conditions in vitro, and we explored the role of nutrient environment by culturing the human A549 NSCLC cell line in adult bovine serum, a medium that more closely models in vivo nutrient levels. In this condition, the contribution of glutamine carbon to the TCA cycle decreases to levels observed for A549 tumors growing in vivo. Culture in adult bovine serum also induces glutaminase inhibitor resistance, a phenotype seen for NSCLC tumors in vivo. Deconvolution of differences in media composition showed that levels of a single nutrient, cystine (the oxidized dimer of the amino acid cysteine), largely dictates the observed differences in glutamine anaplerosis and dependence. Further, we find that cystine regulation of glutamine anaplerosis depends on expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT (encoded by the gene <italic>SLC7A11</italic>). Lastly, we find that administration of cystine to tumor bearing mice increases glutamine use by tumors in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that environmental cystine availability and xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression are critical determinants of glutamine anaplerosis and glutaminase dependence. They also highlight how nutrient conditions can impact cell metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells in vivo or cultured in adult bovine serum exhibit limited glutamine catabolism compared to cells cultured in standard tissue culture conditions</title><p>Mutant <italic>Kras-</italic>driven mouse lung cancer cells exhibit differences in glutamine metabolism dictated by their environment, such that glutamine extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in cell culture but not in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>). To confirm this finding, we examined glutamine metabolism in mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven human A549 lung cancer cells cultured in multiple environments. For these studies, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to trace the fate of glutamine where all five carbons are <sup>13</sup>C labeled ([U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine) in each environment, focusing on whether glutamine carbon contributed to the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we verified that glutamine was not a major source of TCA cycle carbon in subcutaneous A549 xenograft tumors. For these studies [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine was infused into tumor bearing animals for 6 hr to achieve a final enrichment of ~35% labeled glutamine in plasma and ~25% in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>), there was little labeling of intratumoral glutamate, TCA cycle intermediates, and aspartate from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine despite the presence of labeled glutamine in the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These findings suggest that glutamine is not a major source of TCA cycle carbon in A549-derived tumors in vivo. Normalization of tumor m + 5 glutamate label to m + 5 glutamine labeling indicates that only ~25% of glutamate is derived from glutamine in these tumors. In contrast, when A549 cells are cultured in RPMI-based media with [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine added to a similar enrichment of ~33%, we find that ~27% of glutamate is glutamine derived, which when normalized to glutamine enrichment indicates that 80% of glutamate is derived from glutamine under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, when the cells are cultured in RPMI, more than 60% of the carbon in aspartate and other TCA cycle intermediates was derived from glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is consistent with glutamine being a major TCA cycle carbon source for A549 cells in culture, and demonstrates that compared to standard culture conditions tumors derived from these cells use less glutamine in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27713.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Decreased use of glutamine for TCA cycle anaplerosis by A549 cells in tumors, and when cultured in adult bovine serum, compared to RPMI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram detailing how uniformly-labeled glutamine ([U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine) can be metabolized to generate labeled glutamate, aspartate and TCA cycle intermediates via oxidative metabolism.

A549 cells grow exponentially with a doubling time of ~48 hr when cultured in bovine serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and can be maintained indefinitely in such medium (see Materials and methods for details). We added [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine to adult bovine serum to achieve an enrichment of ~33% that is comparable to the labeled glutamine enrichment observed in plasma and tumors in vivo. We then traced the fate of <sup>13</sup>C carbon into the TCA cycle and found substantially less labeling of glutamate, aspartate and TCA cycle metabolites compared to cells cultured in RPMI-based media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, only ~35% of glutamate was estimated to be derived from glutamine when cells were cultured in adult bovine serum. We verified that glutamine labeling reached isotopic steady state after 8 hr of culture in adult bovine serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that these labeling differences were not explained by differences in labeling kinetics. Importantly, the decrease in glutamine-derived label observed in A549 cells cultured in adult bovine serum was not specific to bovine serum or to serum products, as the contribution of glutamine carbon to glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates was similarly reduced in adult bovine heparinized plasma and adult human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Reduced TCA cycle labeling from glutamine when cells are cultured in adult bovine serum is not limited to A549 cells. [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine labeling of TCA cycle intermediates was higher in cell lines derived from cancers arising in diverse tissues when cultured in RPMI compared to culture in adult bovine serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, culturing cancer cells in serum or plasma results in reduced glutamine catabolism to support TCA cycle anaplerosis.</p><p>Sensitivity of <italic>Kras</italic>-driven mouse lung cancer cells to the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 correlates with glutamine carbon contribution to the TCA cycle, such that tumors derived from these cells in vivo were insensitive to CB-839 while proliferation of the same cells is inhibited in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we find that A549 cells cultured in RPMI are also sensitive to CB-839, but the same cells become resistant to CB-839 when cultured in adult bovine serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, A549 cells cultured in bovine serum exhibit decreased glutamine metabolism and are resistant to glutaminase inhibitors, adopting a metabolic phenotype with regards to glutamine metabolism that is more similar to lung tumors in vivo than to lung cancer cells cultured in standard tissue culture media.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differences in the small molecule fraction between RPMI and adult bovine serum affect glutamine use for TCA cycle anaplerosis</title><p>We next sought to identify factors that are different between RPMI and adult bovine serum that account for the observed differences in glutamine anaplerosis and dependence. Dialysis experiments were used to determine whether differences in the small molecule (&lt;3.5 kDa) or large molecule (&gt;3.5 kDa) fractions accounted for differences in glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle. First, we dialyzed a small volume of RPMI against large volumes of adult bovine serum using 3.5 kDa cutoff dialysis cassettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This medium termed ‘adult bovine serum → RPMI,’ contained the small molecule fraction from adult bovine serum and the large molecule fraction from RPMI-based media. Similarly, we dialyzed adult bovine serum against RPMI to generate ‘RPMI → adult bovine serum,’ containing RPMI small molecules and the adult bovine serum large molecule fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Cells could be cultured in both media conditions, allowing us to trace the fate of [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine in A549 cells cultured in each media. Similar to cells grown in adult bovine serum, cells grown in ‘adult bovine serum → RPMI’ exhibited low fractional labeling of glutamate, aspartate and TCA cycle metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, cells cultured in ‘RPMI → adult bovine serum’ exhibited higher labeling of aspartate and TCA cycle intermediates from glutamine, similar to cells cultured in RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These differences in glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle also correlated with the ability of CB-839 to inhibit proliferation, as A549 cell proliferation is inhibited by CB-839 when cells are cultured in ‘RPMI → adult bovine serum’ but is largely unaffected when cultured in ‘adult bovine serum → RPMI’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar dialysis experiments were performed with DMEM and adult bovine serum. Consistent with the RPMI dialysis experiments, ‘adult bovine serum → DMEM’ cultured cells displayed levels of glutamine anaplerosis and CB-839 sensitivity that were similar to cells cultured in adult bovine serum, while ‘DMEM → adult bovine serum’ had increased CB-839 sensitivity, similar to cells cultured in DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these experiments suggest that differences in the small molecule fraction of standard tissue culture media and adult bovine serum largely explain the differences in glutamine anaplerosis and glutaminase inhibitor sensitivity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27713.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differences in the small molecule (&lt;3.5 kDa) fraction between RPMI and adult bovine serum account for differences in glutamine anaplerosis and sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram detailing the generation of <italic>top</italic> ‘Adult bovine serum → RPMI’ and <italic>bottom</italic> ‘RPMI → adult bovine serum’.

We supplemented the adult bovine serum with amino acids, glucose, and pyruvate to match levels found in RPMI or DMEM. Levels of vitamins and micronutrients were added to adult bovine serum at the RPMI or DMEM concentration. Addition of RPMI nutrients (glucose, amino acids, vitamins and micronutrients) to adult bovine serum resulted in increased glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Addition of amino acids alone at RPMI levels to adult bovine serum increased glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle to the same extent as addition of the whole pool of all RPMI nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Addition of amino acids alone at RPMI levels also induced CB-839 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as did addition of amino acids to DMEM levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next sought to identify the amino acid(s) causing this increased use of glutamine. Because DMEM contains fewer amino acids, and causes the same phenotype as RPMI amino acids, we reasoned that the amino acids responsible must be present in DMEM. Therefore, we systematically determined CB-839 sensitivity of cells cultured in adult bovine serum supplemented with these amino acids minus subsets that share common transport mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hediger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hyde et al., 2003</xref>). Adding the DMEM amino acid pool lacking serine, glycine, threonine and cystine to adult bovine serum failed to cause increased sensitivity of cells to CB-839, while omitting other subsets of amino acids had no effect on CB-839 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data argue that one or more of these four amino acids is responsible for the phenotype. Serine, glycine, threonine or cystine were individually increased to DMEM levels in adult bovine serum containing DMEM levels of other amino acids. Only cystine addition triggered sensitivity to CB-839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Addition of cystine alone to adult bovine serum is sufficient to sensitize cells to CB-839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, addition of cystine at RPMI levels to adult bovine serum causes an increase in glutamine labeling of TCA cycle intermediates that is comparable to the labeling pattern observed in cells cultured in adult bovine serum containing levels of all nutrients found in RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cystine levels in adult plasma (~20–50 µM) are 4–10 fold lower than in DMEM or RPMI (~200 µM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that high levels of cystine found in standard tissue culture formulations cause enhanced glutamine anaplerosis and dependence.</p><p>Glutamine derived glutamate has multiple possible fates in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It can contribute to TCA cycle metabolites, but also contributes to other metabolites like glutathione. Previous studies have suggested that glutamine-derived glutathione is essential for cell growth and further that depletion of glutathione upon glutaminase inhibition and subsequent loss of reactive oxygen species (ROS) buffering forms the basis of glutaminase dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biancur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Timmerman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ulanet et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, other studies have found that maintenance of TCA cycle derived metabolite levels, such as nucleotides, forms the basis of glutaminase dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaglio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2016</xref>). We examined whether cystine-induced glutaminase dependence in A549 cells could be specifically ascribed to TCA cycle or glutathione depletion. Both TCA cycle metabolites and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in A549 cells cultured in RPMI and exposed to CB-839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that high cystine-driven use of glutaminase is required for both TCA cycle anaplerosis and maintenance of glutathione. CB-839 treatment also caused increased levels of DCFDA staining, indicating ROS levels increase following glutaminase inhibition, which was reversible by co-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data show that both glutathione depletion and TCA cycle depletion occur upon glutaminase inhibition in the presence of high extracellular cystine.</p><p>We next performed rescue experiments with dimethyl α-ketoglutarate or glutathione monoethyl ester to determine if replenishment of the TCA cycle or glutathione could prevent the anti-proliferative effect of glutaminase inhibition in RPMI which contains high levels of cystine. We also assessed if glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, had similar anti-proliferative effects as glutaminase inhibition with CB-839, and if NAC treatment could reverse the effects of CB-839 treatment. Treatment of cells with dimethyl α-ketoglutarate or glutathione monoethyl ester was able to rescue the proliferation of CB-839 treated A549 cells, albeit to differing extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, assessment of TCA cycle metabolite and GSH levels in cells rescued with dimethyl α-ketoglutarate, showed that this rescued both TCA metabolite pools and GSH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Similarly, glutathione monoethyl ester treatment increased levels of both TCA cycle metabolites and GSH in CB-839 treated cells, although glutathione monoethyl ester was less capable of rescuing both the anti-proliferative effect of CB-839 and metabolite levels at the concentration used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These data are consistent with previous reports showing A549 cells express γ-glutamyl transferase and are able to degrade GSH to replenish glutamate pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, neither α-ketoglutarate or GSH rescue provided definitive insight into whether TCA cycle intermediates or GSH levels are more limiting for proliferation in high cystine upon glutaminase inhibition. However, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 1991</xref>), we found that BSO treatment had no effect on A549 proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) despite GSH depletion to undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). NAC treatment, while able to decrease DCFDA detectable ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), did not rescue cell proliferation following CB-839 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, while we have not identified precisely which glutamate dependent metabolic processes are limiting for proliferation upon glutaminase inhibition in high cystine conditions, these data argue that glutathione depletion and the subsequent increase in ROS alone is not sufficient to explain decreased proliferation of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cystine driven glutamine anaplerosis requires xCT/SLC7A11 expression</title><p>How might exogenous cystine regulate the contribution of glutamine carbon to the TCA cycle? Glutamine metabolism is linked to cystine metabolism via the x<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup> transporter system. This transporter system is composed of the transporter xCT (encoded by <italic>SLC7A11</italic>) and the chaperone 4F2hc/CD98 (encoded by <italic>SLC3A2</italic>), and together they mediate the exchange of glutamate for cystine across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewerenz et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that in the presence of high exogenous cystine, xCT-mediated transport of glutamate might deplete the intracellular glutamate/αKG pool, thus promoting glutamate regeneration from glutamine via glutaminase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To begin to test this, we measured glutamate release and uptake of both glutamine and cystine by A549 cells cultured in RPMI or RPMI containing low levels (10 µM) of cystine. Consistent with the hypothesis that cystine potentiates glutamine anaplerosis by triggering enhanced glutamate secretion via xCT and increased glutamine catabolism, we observed that higher extracellular cystine increased both the glutamine and cystine uptake rates as well as the glutamate release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) in A549 cells. To determine if xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> was required for cystine induced glutamine anaplerosis and dependence, we generated A549 cells with shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of <italic>SLC7A11</italic>, where knockdown was or was not rescued by expression of an shRNA-resistant <italic>SLC7A11</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This labeled glutamine delivery method does not allow us to assess steady state contribution of glutamine carbon to the TCA cycle in tumors; however, glutamine intravenous bolus injections do allow examination of glutamine incorporation into glutamate and downstream metabolites during a pre-steady state, kinetic labeling period and this method has previously been used to corroborate predicted changes in tumor glutamine utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elgogary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tardito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yuneva et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). From measuring glutamine uptake and glutamate release rates under high and low cystine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we surmise that the intracellular pools of glutamine and glutamate turnover more rapidly with increasing extracellular cystine. Thus, a prediction of our model that would be captured by kinetic [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine labeling is that intratumoral labeling of glutamine, as well as glutamate and TCA cycle metabolites, will be higher in the presence of exogenous cystine. Terminal [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine plasma enrichment was similar in cystine-treated and untreated animals, while cystine-treated animals had substantially higher plasma cystine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with increased glutamine catabolism in cystine treated tumors, labeling of glutamine, glutamate and αKG from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]glutamine in tumors was higher in cystine treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that increasing cystine levels in tumors can cause increased glutamine consumption and glutamate release, a phenomenon we have shown using in vitro models leads to enhanced glutamine anaplerosis. These results are consistent with a model where low cystine levels in vivo limit tumor glutamine catabolism and anaplerosis.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27713.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Raising cystine levels increases glutamine metabolism in tumors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) nu/nu mice were treated with 2.4 g/kg cystine by oral gavage, and plasma from these animals was collected at the indicated time points.

We found that non-physiological cystine levels in tissue culture can explain many of the differences in glutamine metabolism between lung cancer cells in vitro and in tumors. The glutamate/cystine antiporter xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> is necessary for the observed cystine-induced glutamine anaplerosis in A549 cells. Thus, high levels of extracellular cystine and the cellular capacity to secrete glutamate in exchange for cystine cooperate to increase glutamine anaplerosis in these cells.</p><p>Increased glutamate secretion in the presence of cystine increases intracellular glutamate turnover, which in turn will increase the kinetic rate of glutamine label incorporation into both glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates. However, there are multiple carbon sources that can contribute to the pool of TCA cycle metabolites, raising the question of why increased glutamate secretion also results in increased anaplerotic contribution of glutamine carbon relative to other nutrients. The enzymology of glutaminase suggests one potential explanation. GLS1 activity is strongly inhibited by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassago et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curthoys and Watford, 1995</xref>) suggesting that the drop in intracellular glutamate driven by high cystine could raise glutaminase activity and increase glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle relative to other pathways. Thus, it could be the action of non-physiological cystine concentrations constantly depleting the intracellular glutamate pool that causes glutamine anaplerosis to become dominant.</p><p>xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression correlates with the ability of cystine to increase glutamine anaplerosis in a panel of cell lines derived from tumors of different oncogenotype and tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This argues that xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression may be necessary for environmental cystine to enhance glutamine anaplerosis regardless of tumor type, and is not a phenomenon limited to NSCLC and A549 cells. Indeed, examination of panels of human breast cancer cell lines have found that xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> promotes glutamate secretion, providing further evidence that xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> can promote glutamine catabolism in cell types beyond NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Timmerman et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these experiments suggest that glutaminase dependence in culture for many cancer cells derived from various tumor types will be strongly influenced by both environmental cystine and xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Therapeutic implications of tissue cystine levels and their relationship to glutamine anaplerosis</title><p>These findings have clear implications for the clinical use of glutaminase inhibitors that are being evaluated in trials to treat a variety of tumor types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02071862">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02071862</ext-link>). First, assessing xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression may help identify patients likely to benefit from these drugs. While many cancer cells are considered to be glutamine addicted, not every cancer cell line requires glutamine for proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cetinbas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Timmerman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</xref>).

However, the genetic and biochemical basis for glutamine dependence remains poorly understood. Thus, understanding the underlying factors that cause increased reliance on glutamine is essential for identifying patients that would likely benefit from clinical glutaminase inhibitors. Identification of high xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression as a marker for glutaminase inhibitor sensitivity may be useful to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from glutaminase inhibitor therapy regardless of genotype. Functional examination of glutamate/cystine exchange by tumor cells using imaging techniques such as xCT-specific PET probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2012</xref>) may also be helpful in selecting tumors that are dependent on glutamine metabolism.</p><p>xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression is known to be governed by the antioxidant response transcription factor NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>). Interest in modulating the antioxidant response pathway has led to the development of a number of NRF2-activating compounds, some of which are already in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Magesh et al., 2012</xref>). xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression triggered by NRF2-activating drugs can sensitize tumors to glutaminase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sayin et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, beyond the use of xCT/<italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression as a marker for glutaminase inhibitor responsiveness, raising tumor cystine levels might also be a way to induce or enhance glutamine addiction. We found that raising tissue cystine levels may increase glutamine anaplerosis in tumors. Therefore, co-administration of cystine with glutaminase inhibitors may enhance response to glutaminase inhibitors. Oral cystine administration can be effective to raise plasma cystine levels in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morin et al., 1971</xref>), arguing that this strategy could be applicable to treating patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tissue culture systems that reflect nutrient availability in vivo can be more representative models of tumor metabolism</title><p>Eagle’s medium and RPMI were formulated to identify the minimal set of nutrients required for mammalian cancer cells and leukocytes to rapidly proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eagle, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore et al., 1967</xref>), not to match physiological levels of nutrients available in vivo. Thus, these media lack certain nutrients available to tumors in vivo and also contain other nutrients in excess to what is found in blood. Several studies examining tumor metabolism in mice and humans have suggested that the way nutrients are used in tumors can be different from what is observed in cell culture. While increased glucose consumption and lactate secretion observed in most cells in culture is also observed in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hensley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marin-Valencia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mashimo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tardito et al., 2015</xref>), glutamine oxidation and anaplerosis can differ between both lung and glial tumors and cell lines derived from these tumors in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marin-Valencia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tardito et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, standard tissue culture can cause some aspects of central carbon metabolism to be misrepresented and the identification of media that better model the environmental conditions in tumors may facilitate better understanding of cancer metabolism.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that altering tissue culture media to better reflect levels of amino acids found in human plasma can allow more accurate modeling of tissue metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tardito et al., 2015</xref>). Culturing glioblastoma cells in serum-like medium (SMEM) results in decreased glutamine utilization and a requirement to net produce glutamine from other carbon sources, similar to what is observed in glioblastoma in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tardito et al., 2015</xref>). The differences between SMEM and standard media formulations that elicited this difference is unknown, but the fact that culturing cells in media with more physiological cystine levels resulted in a change in glutamine metabolism is consistent with our findings.</p><p>In culture systems, the bulk of TCA cycle carbon can be accounted for from glucose and glutamine. However, the sources of anaplerotic TCA cycle carbon in tumors are not fully understood despite the increased contribution of glucose anaplerosis in some settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hensley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>). Adult bovine serum differs from standard media in levels of many nutrients. Thus, additional nutritional differences beyond amino acids may contribute to why glutamine metabolism of A549 cells in serum more closely mimics A549 tumors in vivo and suggests factors other than cystine levels might be involved. Supporting this hypothesis, addition of cystine to adult bovine serum increases A549 incorporation of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle, but not to the same levels observed when the same cells are cultured in RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, A549 cells grown in adult bovine serum are also more resistant to CB-839 than A549 cells grown in RPMI with low levels of cystine (10 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that alternative anaplerotic carbon source(s) are available in adult bovine serum that contribute to further glutaminase independence. Identification of what contributes to the TCA cycle in serum may yield new insight into the anaplerotic carbon sources used by cells in vivo.</p><p>Beyond the contribution of oncogenic mutations to reprogramming cellular metabolism, environment also plays a fundamental role in determining the metabolic program of cancer cells. We find that environmental cystine level is one variable that can alter how nutrients are used by cancer cells. Many studies aim to identify the set of genes required for cancer cell proliferation, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Based on our results, selection of media conditions will be essential to maximize the in vivo relevance of targets identified by screens to find metabolic gene vulnerabilities. Our results motivate further studies to characterize the nutritional content of the tumor microenvironment, and development of tissue culture systems to propagate and study cells under such conditions, as this may help translate metabolic dependencies of cancer cell lines into better cancer therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>All cell lines used in this study were directly obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) (A549: ATCC Cat# CRM-CCL-185, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0023">CVCL_0023</ext-link>; HCT116: ATCC Cat# CCL-247, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link>; 143B: ATCC Cat# CRL-8303, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2270">CVCL_2270</ext-link>; MDAMB231: ATCC Cat# HTB-26, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link>; PC3: ATCC Cat# CRL-1435, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0035">CVCL_0035</ext-link>; NCIH1299: ATCC Cat# CRL-5803, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0060">CVCL_0060</ext-link>; TT: ATCC Cat# CRL-1803, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1774">CVCL_1774</ext-link>; MDAMB468: ATCC Cat# HTB-132, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0419">CVCL_0419</ext-link>; ASPC1: ATCC Cat# CRL-1682, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0152">CVCL_0152</ext-link>; HS578T: ATCC Cat# HTB-126, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0332">CVCL_0332</ext-link>; NCIH226: ATCC Cat# CRL-5826, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1544">CVCL_1544</ext-link>; NCIH1395: ATCC Cat# CRL-5868, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1467">CVCL_1467</ext-link>; MIAPACA2: ATCC Cat# CRM-CRL-1420, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0428">CVCL_0428</ext-link>; AU565: ATCC Cat# CRL-2351, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1074">CVCL_1074</ext-link>; BT474: ATCC Cat# CRL-7913, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0179">CVCL_0179</ext-link>; MCF7: ATCC Cat# HTB-22, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0031">CVCL_0031</ext-link>) and DMSZ (Braunschweig, Germany) (CAL120: DSMZ Cat# ACC-459, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1104">CVCL_1104</ext-link>) or were gifts from other laboratories (PANC1: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0480">CVCL_0480</ext-link>; EVSAT: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1207">CVCL_1207</ext-link>).

First, cells were cultured in large volumes of adult bovine serum (8 mL/35 mm diameter well) to prevent depletion of essential nutrients during the culture. Additionally, the adult bovine serum was replaced with fresh adult bovine serum every 48 hr. Second, passaging serum maintained cells using standard trypsin (0.025%)/EDTA solution to detach cells leads to significant loss of viability.

Briefly, cell lines proliferating in log phase in RPMI medium were trypsinized, counted and plated into six well dishes (Corning Life Sciences) in 2 mL of RPMI medium and incubated overnight. Initial seeding density was 20,000 cells/well for A549 cells, or 50,000 cells for MCF7, AU565 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The next day, a six well plate of cells was trypsinized and counted to provide a number of cells at the start of the experiment. Cells were then washed twice with 2 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and 8 mL of the indicated media premixed with indicated compounds or vehicles was added. This large volume of media was chosen to prevent severe nutrient depletion, especially when adding adult bovine serum medium. Cells were then trypsinized and counted 4 days after adding the indicated medias. Proliferation rate was determined using the following formula: Proliferation rate in doublings/day = [Log2(Final Day 4 cell count/Initial Day 0 cell count)]/4 days. Cells were counted using a Cellometer Auto T4 Plus Cell Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intracellular DCFDA staining</title><p>Measurement of intracellular DCFDA fluorescence was performed using the Abcam DCFDA Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species Detection Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, ab113851) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 25,000 A549 cells were plated in each well of a 96 well plate in 200 µL RPMI without phenol red (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were allowed to attach for 8 hr. Subsequently, the media on the cells was changed to 200 µL fresh media containing DMSO, CB-839 and NAC as indicated. After 24 hr of treatment, the cells were washed twice with 200 µL of 1x Buffer included in the assay kit. Cells were then incubated with 100 µL of 1x Buffer containing 10 µM DCFDA for 45 min. at 37°C. An unstained control was included, and incubated with 100 µL of 1x Buffer alone. After staining, the DCFDA containing solution was removed and cells were resuspended 100 µL of PBS. DCFDA fluorescence was measured using an Infinite M200Pro plate reader (Tecan) in fluorescence mode with excitation at 485 and emission at 535. Cells were then detached with trypsin-EDTA solution and counted using a Cellometer Auto T4 Plus Cell Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience). The ratio of DCFDA signal intensity to cell number was subsequently computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Preparation of cell extracts and immunoblotting</title><p>For immunoblotting analysis, cell lines growing in log phase were trypsinized, counted and plated at a density of 400,000 cells/well of a six well dish.

The following day, cells were washed with 2 mL of PBS and then fed 2 mL of either RPMI or RPMI(10 µM cystine) media. 1 mL of media was immediately removed, spun for 3 min. at 845 g to remove any cells from the media, and then frozen at −80°C for later analysis. Cell number was also determined using a Cellometer Auto T4 Plus Cell Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience). 2 days later, media was harvested and cell number of the culture again determined. Amino acid concentration in the fresh or spent media was determined by GC-MS as described above in Media preparation and analysis. To calculate amino acid consumption rates, cell numbers at the initial and day two time points were used to fit an exponential growth function, and integration of these curves yielded the number of (cell · days) by which the media was conditioned. Changes in amino acid concentration for each culture were normalized to the integrated growth curve of each culture to yield amino acid consumption/release per cell per unit time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell culture isotopic labeling experiments and metabolite extraction</title><p>To determine steady state labeling of polar metabolites by glutamine in cultured cells, cell lines were seeded at an initial density of 200,000 cells/well in a six well dish in 2 mL of RPMI medium.

They identify extracellular cystine as the key feature regulating glutamine-dependent anaplerosis and dependence on the enzyme glutaminase. These activities are enforced through expression of the xCT transporter, which imports cystine in exchange for glutamate. Silencing xCT reduces glutaminase dependence in culture and overexpressing xCT is sufficient to increase sensitivity to the glutaminase inhibitor CB839. Feeding tumor-bearing mice with high doses of cystine alters tumor handling of glutamine, indicating that extracellular nutrient availability can drive metabolic programs within tumors.</p><p>The reviewers were generally quite positive about the paper, but felt that it could be strengthened by addressing a few issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most of the work focuses on a single cell line to establish the mechanism for glutamine dependence. The authors should provide some basic isotope tracing data (e.g. data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) for some of the other cell lines introduced later in the paper. Perhaps the authors could simply derive these data from existing MS analysis such as the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p><p>2) Better characterizing the effect of manipulating glutamine/cystine metabolism would strengthen the paper. Can the authors report the effect of cystine concentration on rates of glutamine/cystine uptake and glutamate release? What is the impact of silencing/overexpressing SLC7A11 on intracellular glutamate/glutathione abundance and extracellular glutamate abundance? In conditions of cystine excess sensitizing cells to CB839, does the drug impact glutathione levels and ROS?</p><p>3) Rescue experiments to reverse the glutaminase-dependent phenotype would be useful. Does cell permeable α-ketoglutrate and/or GSH protect cells from CB839?</p><p>4) The in vivo analysis using 13C-glutamine is interesting, but the data do not entirely fit with the mechanism. Much (although not all, as the authors point out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) of the gain in labeling of glutamate/AKG is transmitted from higher labeling in glutamine in the tumor. This indicates that part of the metabolic impact of cystine feeding is to increase glutamine uptake and/or to reduce de novo glutamine synthesis. Can the authors explain what is going on here?</p><p>5) While the central argument (increased cystine/glutamate exchange drives increased glutamine uptake to replenish intracellular glutamate) is logical, the specific link to anaplerosis seems not to be fully resolved. If glutamate availability is compromised by excessive secretion to import cystine, why does reversing this problem lead to enhanced entry of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle as opposed to simple maintenance of a larger intracellular glutamate pool? Can this be explained in terms of changes in metabolic enzyme expression, or the need to fulfill some demand in the mitochondria?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27713.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Most of the work focuses on a single cell line to establish the mechanism for glutamine dependence.

Perhaps the authors could simply derive these data from existing MS analysis such as the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and have provided data for additional cell lines. We performed glutamine tracing in RPMI and adult bovine serum (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) for six additional cell lines with distinct tissues of origin. The data from these experiments are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Despite their diverse origins, all of the cell lines tested show reduced glutamine labeling of glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates when cultured in adult bovine serum compared to RPMI. These data show that reduced glutamine contribution to glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates occurs in multiple cell lines when cultured in adult bovine serum and is not limited to A549 cells.</p><p><italic>2) Better characterizing the effect of manipulating glutamine/cystine metabolism would strengthen the paper. Can the authors report the effect of cystine concentration on rates of glutamine/cystine uptake and glutamate release?</italic> </p><p>We agree that determining how extracellular cystine levels affect glutamine uptake and glutamate release would provide additional support of our model that cystine uptake promotes glutamine catabolism via promoting glutamate export in an xCT-dependent manner. As suggested by the reviewers, we analyzed glutamine, glutamate and cystine consumption/release rates for A549 (xCT expressing) cells cultured in RPMI with high (208µM) or low (10µM) cystine. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. We find that cells cultured in high cystine consume both glutamine and cystine at higher rates, and release glutamate at a higher rate than cells cultured in low cystine. This is consistent with a model in which extracellular cystine promotes glutamate release, and this glutamate release promotes glutamine consumption to help maintain glutamate and glutamate-derived metabolites under high cystine conditions. We also note that Tardito et al. have previously found that high cystine levels increase glutamine consumption (Tardito et al., 2015) and that Timmerman et al. have previously found cystine consumption correlates with glutamate release (Timmerman et al., 2013).</p><p><italic>What is the impact of silencing/overexpressing SLC7A11 on intracellular glutamate/glutathione abundance and extracellular glutamate abundance?</italic> </p><p>To address this question we measured glutamine uptake rates, glutamate release rates, intracellular glutamate levels, and intracellular glutathione levels in both A549 cells with <italic>SLC7A11</italic> knockdown (or control) and in MCF7 cells with increased <italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression (or control). These experiments were performed in RPMI with high (208µM) or low (10µM) cystine levels. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>. Consistent with previous reports, silencing or inhibiting <italic>SLC7A11</italic> decreases the release rate of glutamate (Briggs et al., 2016; Timmerman et al., 2013) and also decreases the glutamine consumption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also observe that knockdown of <italic>SLC7A11</italic> only significantly affects glutamine consumption and glutamate release at high cystine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, we find that increasing xCT levels in MCF7 cells increases both glutamine consumption and glutamate release, and the extent to which <italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression increases these rates depends on cystine concentrations in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Despite these expected changes in glutamine uptake and glutamate release, there were no consistent changes in intracellular glutathione or glutamate levels upon <italic>SLC7A11</italic> knockdown. Culture in low cystine moderately decreased glutathione levels while increasing intracellular glutamate, regardless of <italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression status. <italic>SLC7A11</italic> overexpression in MCF7 cells did not lead to changes in GSH or glutamate levels in standard RPMI, but in low cystine RPMI, MCF7 cells overexpressing <italic>SLC7A11</italic> did have higher relative glutathione levels.</p><p><italic>In conditions of cystine excess sensitizing cells to CB839, does the drug impact glutathione levels and ROS?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this interesting point. There are numerous studies that suggest that glutamine catabolism is important for maintaining glutathione levels to buffer reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Biancur et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Timmerman et al., 2013; Ulanet et al., 2014). To address this question and determine if in this system glutamine derived glutamate contributed to glutathione and ROS buffering, we measured intracellular levels of TCA cycle metabolites and reduced glutathione (GSH) by LCMS in A549 cells grown in RPMI (a condition where cystine excess sensitizes cells to CB-839) with and without CB-839 treatment. We also measured dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) fluorescence in A549 cells with and without CB-839 treatment and with n-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment, as a proxy measurement for cellular ROS levels. We find that, in this high cystine condition, CB-839 not only depletes TCA cycle metabolites, but also depletes GSH and increases DCFDA signal. These results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. These data prompted us to perform further studies (described below) to determine if glutathione depletion was sufficient to prevent cellular proliferation, and if ROS scavenging by NAC would be able to reverse the anti-proliferative effect of CB-839 in high cystine cultures. In short, attempts to rescue the anti-proliferative effect of CB-839 in high environmental cystine by addition of TCA cycle intermediates or glutathione failed to show that depletion of either of these metabolites was specifically responsible for the toxicity of CB-389/high cystine. However, we did find that neither glutathione depletion nor accumulation of ROS that can be scavenged by NAC are sufficient to account for why CB-839 is toxic in the presence of high cystine.</p><p><italic>3) Rescue experiments to reverse the glutaminase-dependent phenotype would be useful. Does cell permeable α-ketoglutrate and/or GSH protect cells from CB839?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these experiments, as they are certainly of interest to help differentiate if TCA cycle anaplerosis or glutathione synthesis limits cell proliferation under conditions where cystine potentiates the effect of glutaminase inhibitors. We determined that both cell permeable α-ketoglutarate (aKG) and GSH could protect cells from glutaminase inhibition when cultured in RPMI (high cystine), albeit to different extents at the concentrations we tested. We performed metabolite analysis of treated cells, and found that aKG rescues both TCA cycle metabolite levels and GSH levels upon CB-839 treatment. We also found that GSH restores TCA cycle metabolite levels to the same extent that it rescues GSH levels in CB-839 treated cells. Thus, unfortunately, rescue with either aKG or GSH rescues both TCA cycle intermediates and GSH in cells and makes it impossible to differentiate if GSH depletion, TCA cycle intermediate depletion, or both explains the effect of glutaminase inhibitors on cell proliferation in high cystine.</p><p>To provide further insight into this important issue, we tested whether NAC could protect cells from CB-839, and if depletion of GSH with the GCL inhibitor BSO would be sufficient to prevent proliferation of A549 cells in RPMI. We found that NAC failed to rescue the proliferation of CB-839 treated A549 cells in RPMI (with high cystine). We also found that BSO treatment, while reducing glutathione levels below that seen with CB-839 treatment, had no effect on cell proliferation. Thus, while we cannot distinguish whether GSH or TCA cycle intermediate depletion limits proliferation following glutaminase inhibition in high cystine conditions, we can conclude that glutathione depletion and the subsequent increase in ROS are not sufficient to prevent proliferation.</p><p>All of the above results are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The</italic> in vivo <italic>analysis using 13C-glutamine is interesting, but the data do not entirely fit with the mechanism. Much (although not all, as the authors point out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) of the gain in labeling of glutamate/AKG is transmitted from higher labeling in glutamine in the tumor. This indicates that part of the metabolic impact of cystine feeding is to increase glutamine uptake and/or to reduce</italic> de novo <italic>glutamine synthesis. Can the authors explain what is going on here?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this issue, and apologize for not adequately explaining the experiment. For technical reasons, the in vivo tracing experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> could not be performed using steady-state infusion as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (delivery of cystine by oral gavage leads to loss of the catheters needed for steady-state infusion of metabolites). Thus, we instead performed three I.V. bolus injections of (U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>)glutamine in the cystine treated or untreated mice as has been previously published (Elgogary et al., 2016; Lane et al., 2015; Tardito et al., 2015; Yuneva et al., 2012). Because bolus injections were used, the tracer will not reach steady state, and labeling has to be interpreted as a kinetic rather than a steady state labeling experiment. Therefore, the increase in glutamine labeling between the cystine treated and untreated mice do not necessarily represent a difference in the fraction of glutamine that tumors ultimately derive from extracellular glutamine versus other sources at steady state. Because this is a kinetic labeling experiment, the increased label may also be due to differences in the time that it takes cells to turn over and replace their glutamine pool in cystine treated versus untreated animals. We speculate that since cells exposed to extracellular cystine secrete glutamate and consume glutamine faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), they will turn over and replace their intracellular pool of glutamine with the supplied tracer faster than cells in the absence of high extracellular cystine. We note that TCA cycle labeling from labeled glutamine is higher in the cystine treated animals, but this experiment does not directly test whether increasing cystine levels in vivois sufficient to increase the steady state contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle. Nevertheless, this experiment presents kinetic labeling patterns that are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>To ensure others do not misinterpret the experiment, we have revised the Results section discussing this experiment to: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) explicitly state in the results and figure that this experiment is a kinetic rather than steady state experiment (we include a schematic in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> detailing how the experiment was done), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) specifically discuss the possibility that the higher labeling of glutamine following cystine treatment is due to differences in glutamine turnover rate upon cystine administration, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) make clear that this experiment does not explicitly show higher contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle with cystine administration, but provides kinetic labeling that is consistent with this being the case, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) we have removed the data presented in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, as we fear this data normalization may mislead readers to interpret this these data as if it were a steady state labeling experiment.</p><p><italic>5) While the central argument (increased cystine/glutamate exchange drives increased glutamine uptake to replenish intracellular glutamate) is logical, the specific link to anaplerosis seems not to be fully resolved. If glutamate availability is compromised by excessive secretion to import cystine, why does reversing this problem lead to enhanced entry of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle as opposed to simple maintenance of a larger intracellular glutamate pool? Can this be explained in terms of changes in metabolic enzyme expression, or the need to fulfill some demand in the mitochondria?</italic> </p><p>We think the reviewers are asking two questions here. The first question is whether cystine indeed forces glutamine to be catabolized anaplerotically. The second question is if glutamate availability is compromised by increased secretion to import cystine, why does reversing this problem lead to decreased (we believe the reviewers meant to say decreased here as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> that lower cystine levels lead to decreased glutamine labeling of the TCA cycle) entry of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle as opposed to simple maintenance of a larger intracellular glutamate pool?</p><p>To address the first question, we have shown that glutaminase inhibition of A549 cells cultured in RPMI (where high cystine potentiates glutamate release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>)) does reduce levels of TCA cycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). There is also a higher level of TCA cycle labeling from glutamine in A549 cells cultured in RPMI versus serum or RPMI with low cystine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Collectively, we interpret these results to suggest that high environmental cystine increases the anaplerotic use of glutamine to maintain TCA cycle metabolite levels. We also note that both aKG and GSH rescue levels of TCA cycle intermediates when cells are exposed to glutaminase inhibitors in high cytine (see point 3 above).</p><p>Regarding the second question, “If glutamate availability is compromised by excessive secretion to import cystine, why does reversing this problem lead to decreased entry of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle as opposed to simple maintenance of a larger intracellular glutamate pool?” We would like to clarify that we do not mean to imply that cystine levels affect TCA cycle pool sizes, the rate of glutamate entry into the TCA cycle, or the anaplerotic demand of cells and mitochondria. Instead, we interpret our steady state labeling experiments to suggest that under high cystine conditions, the TCA metabolites pools (of whatever size they may be and at whatever speed they are kinetically labeled) are derived to a greater extent from glutamine than under low environmental cystine levels. This leads us to question, instead, why high cystine-driven glutamate release specifically increases the contribution of glutamine to the glutamate and TCA cycle metabolite pools. We speculate this could be due to the enzymology of glutaminase and have included a section in the Discussion specifically addressing this point:</p><p>“Increased glutamate secretion in the presence of cystine increases intracellular glutamate turnover, which in turn will increase the kinetic rate of glutamine label incorporation into both glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates. However, there are multiple carbon sources that can contribute to the pool of TCA cycle metabolites, raising the question of why increased glutamate secretion also results in increased anaplerotic contribution of glutamine carbon relative to other nutrients. The enzymology of glutaminase suggests one potential explanation. GLS1 activity is strongly inhibited by glutamate (Cassago et al., 2012; Curthoys and Watford, 1995) suggesting that the drop in intracellular glutamate driven by high cystine could raise glutaminase activity and increase glutamine contribution to the TCA cycle relative to other pathways. Thus, it could be the action of non-physiological cystine concentrations constantly depleting the intracellular glutamate pool that causes glutamine anaplerosis to become dominant.”</p><p>We hope this discussion clarifies the interpretation of our steady state glutamine tracing experiments, and addresses the reviewers’ questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
