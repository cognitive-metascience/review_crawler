These RNAs, which bind to targeted mRNAs via limited base pairing interactions, act to reduce protein production from those mRNAs. Considerable evidence indicates that miRNAs destabilize targeted mRNAs by recruiting enzymes that function in normal mRNA decay and mRNA degradation is widely thought to occur when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state. Nevertheless, when examined, miRNA targeted mRNAs are invariably found to be polysome associated; observations that appear to be at face value incompatible with a simple decay model. Here, we provide evidence that turnover of miRNA-targeted mRNAs occurs while they are being translated. Cotranslational mRNA degradation is initiated by decapping and proceeds 5’ to 3’ behind the last translating ribosome. These results provide an explanation for a long standing mystery in the miRNA field.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12880.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12880.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA encodes instructions to make proteins. The DNA is first copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that are then “translated” into proteins by large particles known as ribosomes. MicroRNAs are a type of very small RNA molecule that can reduce the amount of protein produced from mRNAs in animals and other eukaryotic organisms. However, the mechanism by which microRNAs achieve this has been unclear.</p><p>Many groups of researchers have shown that microRNAs promote the degradation of particular mRNAs. Others have shown that the mRNAs that are targeted by microRNAs are generally bound to active ribosomes. Since the degradation of mRNAs is widely believed to occur away from the ribosomes, these two sets of observations have been considered to be incompatible with each other. Tat et al. set out to resolve this paradox by studying how microRNAs work in fruit fly cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that microRNAs do indeed promote the degradation of the mRNAs they bind to and that these mRNAs are exclusively associated with active ribosomes. Furthermore, this process uses the same cellular machinery that is used for the normal destruction of mRNAs. MicroRNAs help to recruit this machinery to their target mRNAs and thereby enhance mRNA break down.</p><p>Tat et al.’s findings provide an explanation for a longstanding puzzle in microRNA research. However, although this mechanism is widely used, it does not appear to apply to all mRNAs targeted by microRNAs, so a future challenge is to understand how these other mRNAs are broken down.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12880.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12880.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microRNAs</kwd><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>cotranslation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008564</institution-id><institution>School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INS693040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsen</surname><given-names>Timothy W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005808</institution-id><institution>Vietnam Education Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tat</surname><given-names>Trinh To</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MicroRNAs stimulate the decay of targeted mRNAs while they are associated with translating ribosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>microRNAs, a large family of regulatory molecules discovered over twenty years ago, have been shown to exert pervasive effects on a wide array of biological processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameres and Zamore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>). It has become clear that a majority of mRNAs are targeted by miRNAs via limited base pairing interactions between the miRNAs and miRNA responsive elements (MREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Although there are exceptions, most MREs are located in 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). The current consensus view of miRNA-mediated gene regulation is that it involves post-transcriptional down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs. Repression by miRNAs is largely attributable to mRNA destabilization and several lines of evidence indicate that this destabilization involves recruitment of factors which participate in normal mRNA decay pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichhorn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eulalio et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). These factors include deadenylases and decapping enzymes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chekulaeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rehwinkel et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although much has been learned regarding the biological functions of mRNAs and their mechanism(s) of action, there is one aspect that has largely eluded explanation; i.e. the interplay between the translation machinery and miRNA-mediated repression. In very early studies, the first miRNA targeted mRNAs were found to be fully associated with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seggerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wightman et al., 1993</xref>). These observations have been reproduced numerous times over the years; whenever the subcellular localization of mRNA targets has been examined, those mRNAs are found to be exclusively on polysomes and unambiguous evidence has indicated that these polysomes are engaged in active translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nottrott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2006</xref>). Complementing these studies are several studies indicating that a substantive fraction of miRNAs themselves is also associated with actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maroney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). Other observations, including the fact that MREs are less effective when present in open reading frames and the presence of a so-called ribosome shadow (absence of MREs in the 3’ UTR just downstream of stop codons) are consistent with an interaction between miRNA-effector complexes and translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). In sum, this body of evidence has led to the development of the hypothesis, which still persists in the literature, that miRNAs regulate translation in some way during the elongation phase but this hypothesis has been recalcitrant to mechanistic proof.</p><p>It is difficult to reconcile the large body of evidence that shows that miRNA targeted mRNAs are associated with translating ribosomes with the equally compelling body of evidence that indicates that most miRNA-mediated downregulation occurs through mRNA destabilization. The conundrum is that the prevalent view of mRNA decay holds that decay occurs when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state, perhaps in subcellular aggregates known as P bodies, sites of concentrated RNA degradative activities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we provide a solution to this longstanding puzzle by demonstrating that miRNA-mediated mRNA decay occurs cotranslationlly. Decay is initiated by mRNA decapping while targeted mRNAs are polysome bound and proceeds 5’ to 3’ following the last translating ribosome. These observations provide a unifying explanation for a large amount of what has been thought to be disparate experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We are not aware of any study in which both miRNA targeted mRNA stability and subcellular localization (i.e. polysome association) were analyzed. To address this gap and to avoid potential pitfalls associated with transient transfection approaches, we elected to study stable cell lines expressing miRNA targeted mRNAs and relied on endogenous miRNAs to repress them. Because miRNA targeted mRNAs are particularly well characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stark et al., 2003</xref>), we chose to analyze <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNAs encoding the proapoptotic proteins, reaper and hid. The reaper mRNA contains one microRNA recognition element (MRE) for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> miR-2 family of miRNA (miRs 2a, 2b, 2c, 6, 11, 13a, 13b, 308) in its 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jovanovic and Hengartner, 2006</xref>). The hid mRNA contains five MREs for the miRNA, bantam, in its 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennecke et al., 2003</xref>). To avoid the issue that overexpression of either the reaper or hid proteins would promote apopotosis, the entire 3’ UTRs of both mRNAs were appended to the firefly luciferase coding sequence and 5’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two versions of each 3’ UTR, one containing wild type MREs and one containing mutant MREs were used in the construction of four stable <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell lines. Cell lines were judged to be stable when no loss of cells was observed in the presence of the drugs used for their selection and when luciferase levels remained constant over several cell doublings. Reaper constructs were under control of the inducible metallothionine promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bunch et al., 1988</xref>) while the hid constructs were under control of the constitutive actin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelichio et al., 1991</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Destabilization of reaper and hid reporter mRNAs by endogenous miRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of reporter mRNAs analyzed; WT denotes mRNAs with wild type MREs and MT denotes mRNAs where the MREs were inactivated by mutation.

For optimization of transfection conditions a double stranded siRNA of the same design was used to target the Firefly luciferase coding sequence. Titrations of dsRNA, plasmid and transfection reagent (Mirius Transit-X2) were performed to optimize expression and knockdown conditions as assayed by Luciferase readings in cells cotransfected with Firefly siRNA. For half life measurement, S2 cells were co-transfected with reporter and dsRNA in 10 cm plates at a starting density of 2X10<sup>6</sup>/ml. 24 hr after transfection, cells were removed from plates, distributed on 6 well plates and 0.1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added for an additional 16 hr at which point 5 µg/ml Actinomycin D was added, media was removed at the indicated times and cells were lysed with Trizol. Because of the low abundance of transfected reporter RNAs, the analysis of RNA half life was done by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maroney et al., 2006</xref>). cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 µg total RNA using random primers and Superscript II. PCR reactions were first titrated for linearity using a series of cDNA dilutions and cycle numbers.

Importantly the reaper reporter mRNA containing the wild type MRE had the same half life at all levels of expression; a result which indicated that miR-2 family miRNAs were well in excess of the targeted mRNA and that the reaper MRE was likely to be fully occupied at steady state (data not shown). Therefore a four fold enhancement of decay was the maximum effect that could be exerted by microRNAs on this mRNA target.</p><p>Parallel analysis of the hid constructs revealed a similar microRNA-mediated effect on mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The hid reporter mRNA with five wild type MREs had a half life of approximately 7.5 min whereas the mRNA with the mutant MREs had a half life longer than forty minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A Bantam mimic analogous to the miR2 mimic described above caused marked destabilization of the reporter containing mutant Bantam sites, confirming that the observed effect on mRNA stability was miRNA-mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We concluded from those experiments that for these two targeted mRNAs, endogenous miRNAs caused substantive destabilization.</p><p>We then assessed the subcellular localization of all four mRNAs using sedimentation velocity sucrose gradients and Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Remarkably, fractionation of cytoplasmic extracts in this manner revealed that all detectable mRNAs for all four of the constructs cosedimented with polysomes, an observation that suggested that the mRNAs were associated with translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that polysome associated mRNA accounted for most or all mRNAs present in the cell, we performed an “accounting” experiment analogous to that we previously reported for miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maroney et al., 2006</xref>) We found that the vast majority of reporter mRNAs was indeed associated with polysomes and that there was negligible mRNA loss during extract preparation or gradient fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) compare lanes total and gradient. To determine if polysome associated mRNAs were actually being translated, cells were treated with either emetine, an irreversible inhibitor of translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinboye and Bakare, 2011</xref>), or Harringtonine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis that binds to the A site of initiating ribosomes only and thereby prevents formation of the first peptide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fresno et al., 1977</xref>). Because Harringtonine inhibits formation of only the first peptide bond; ribosomes that are already elongating continue to translocate through the open reading frame and eventually terminate and disassociate from the mRNA. As elongating ribosomes clear the mRNA, polysomes become smaller and the mRNA shifts to lighter fractions of the gradient; newly initiating messages accumulate in the monosome region (80S). Extracts prepared from Harringtonine treated cells were sedimented on sucrose gradients and fractions were analyzed by Northern blotting. These analyses revealed that all four mRNAs shifted to lighter fractions; a result which indicated that all four mRNAs were associated with actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with other earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maroney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2004</xref>), both endogenous bantam and a representative member of the miR-2 family (miR-13b) showed similar sedimentation behavior as these targeted mRNAs; i.e. a substantive amount of each miRNA sedimented with polysomes and shifted to lighter fractions upon Harringtonine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Endogenous mRNAs encoding the ribosomal protein L32 (RP49) and polyA binding protein (PABP) were, as expected, also present on translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At this point in our analysis it was clear that endogenous miRNAs were causing marked destabilization of targeted mRNAs, yet all detectable mRNAs were associated with actively translating ribosomes.</p><p>How was microRNA-mediated enhanced mRNA decay compatible with active translation of the targeted mRNAs? We considered two possible scenarios. In the first, translational initiation was somehow blocked on targeted mRNAs. After elongating ribosomes cleared the mRNA, the ribosome free mRNA was degraded so quickly that it could not be detected. The second scenario was that decay was occurring while the mRNAs were being translated; i.e. in a ribosome bound state. A clue to distinguish between these possibilities came from examination of long exposures of the Northern blot across polysome gradients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We observed a family of hybridizing species that were smaller than full length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We speculated that these species might have resulted from partial degradation of the mRNA. If this was the case, we predicted that such fragments would become enriched relative to full length mRNA if new synthesis of mRNA was prevented. Accordingly, we stopped ongoing transcription with Actinomycin D and incubated cells for approximately one mRNA half life in order to allow for partial decay of pre-existing mRNA; translation was then arrested with emetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cotranslational decay of reaper reporter mRNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of probes used for detection of reaper reporter mRNA.

Upon analysis by Northern blotting, we observed a striking accumulation of truncated mRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These fragments were detected with a probe which hybridized to the 3’ region of the open reading frame but were not observed when a probe which hybridized to the 5’ region of the reading frame was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparable fragments were greatly underrepresented when the same analysis was performed on the reaper reporter mRNA containing the mutated MRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We concluded from this that the fragments represented mRNA decay intermediates degraded from the 5’ end of the mRNA.

Because the hid 3’ UTR was so long (3kb) relative to the coding region the results were less clear cut than with the reaper constructs. Nevertheless, ribosome associated decay fragments derived from mRNAs containing wild type MREs accumulated in great excess to those derived from the mRNA containing mutant MREs.</p><p>Having shown that miRNA-mediated mRNA destabilization was cotranslational, we wished to determine the pathway by which this mRNA decay occurred. Because decay intermediates were truncated from the 5’ end it seemed likely that they were derived from decapped mRNAs. To determine if decapping was required for decay, the decapping factors DCP1 and 2 were knocked down by RNAi. The reaper reporter mRNA containing the wild type MRE was markedly stabilized in cells wherein decapping was compromised, a result that indicated that removal of the cap was an important step in initiating targeted mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that decapping is contingent upon prior deadenylation of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eulalio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref>). It has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that miRNAs bound to Ago1 recruit GW182; a protein that in turn recruits the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chekulaeva et al., 2011</xref>). This complex deadenylates mRNA and in some way, perhaps by direct recruitment, facilitates mRNA decapping by Dcp1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rehwinkel et al., 2005</xref>). To determine if the cotranslational decay we observed followed this pathway, we examined the adenylation status of miRNA-targeted mRNAs. Using a polyA tail length assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rio et al., 2011</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, we observed what appeared to be “bands” for both reaper reporter and hid reporter tails. Since these “bands” migrated at the size expected for deadenylated mRNAs this result suggested that deadenylated species accumulated in polysome associated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To confirm this interpretation the “band” from the reaper reporter was excised and sequenced. The results confirmed this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, control non-microRNA targeted mRNA displayed normal polyA tails. The presence of deadenylated mRNAs in polysome fractions strongly suggested that accelerated decapping was a consequence of accelerated deadenylation.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cotranslational miRNA-mediated decay involves mRNA deadenylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depiction of the polyA tail length assay to measure the length of a polyA tail.

To determine if the cotranslational decay we observed depended upon an enzyme that leaves 5’ phosphorylated termini, we used a ligation strategy designed to detect RNAs which terminated in a 5’ phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Unlike most splinted ligation assays which require precise juxtaposition of 5’ and 3’ ends and use DNA ligase as the sealing enzyme, we used a bridge oligonucleotide that brought a “reporter” oligonucleotide with a free 3’ hydroxyl into proximity of mRNA fragments with 5’phosphate termini and used RNA ligase 1 as the sealing enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To validate this assay we sought to identify substrates that would provide both positive and negative controls. We reasoned that a fully capped mRNA could provide the negative control. We chose to analyze the mRNA encoding ribosomal protein L32, RP49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because the RP49 mRNA has a very long half life (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we anticipated that it would be essentially all capped at steady state. Consistent with this, only trace amounts of ligation products diagnostic of decapped RP49 mRNA were present in total RNA. However, after treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), an enzyme that removes the cap, a robust signal for decapped RP49 was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We then used the ligation assay to analyze the reaper reporter mRNA. In this case we set up the assay to detect any 5’ phosphorylated mRNA fragments containing a 5’ terminal phosphate present in the region of the reaper reporter mRNA ranging from its transcription start site to just downstream of the AUG initiation codon. Here, we observed strong signals in the absence of TAP a result indicating that decapped mRNAs were present at steady state. Only the band corresponding to the mRNA start site was enhanced by TAP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, detection of these fragments was ligase dependent and just a trace of fragments were detected in RNA prepared from cells in which DCP 1 and 2 were knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When the assay was used to detect decay fragments across a polysome gradient we observed signal throughout the polysome region of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and see Discussion). Cloning of bands denoted by asterisks showed that their 5’ ends mapped at or near the transcription start site and near the translation initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results demonstrated that the decay fragments we observed had resulted from decapping of the reporter mRNA while it was polysome bound.</p><p>We conclude that cotranslational miRNA mediated mRNA destabilization employs the canonical mRNA decay machinery. This destabilization is accelerated relative to non-targeted mRNAs almost surely due to Ago1 recruitment of GW182 which in turn recruits the deadenylase machinery. Following deadenylation, mRNAs are decapped thereby yielding substrates for XRN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pathway of miRNA-mediated cotranslational mRNA decay.</title><p>Schematic summary of the model which emerged from the data; for details see the text.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12880.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12880.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12880-fig6-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have provided evidence that miRNAs promote enhanced mRNA decay while the mRNA targets are engaged with actively translating ribosomes. While we have analyzed only two miRNA targets, we think it likely that these observations will be broadly relevant. In cases where the subcellular localization of miRNA targets have been studied, they have invariably been found to be polysome associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seggerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wightman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nottrott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, miRNAs themselves have been shown to be polysome associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maroney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). Our observations are also consistent with a large body of transcriptome wide analyses obtained from studies primarily in mammalial systems that have shown that mRNA destabilization is the primary if not sole effect of miRNA-mediated down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichhorn et al, 2014</xref>). They are also consistent with studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells that have shown that miRNA effector complexes as well as general decay enzymes including deadenylases and decapping factors are ribosome associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antic et al., 2015</xref>). While cotranslational miRNA-mediated mRNA decay rationalizes a very large body of published results, there are some observations that are difficult to reconcile with this unifying model of miRNA-mediated action. For example one study in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell free system showed that miRNA-targeted mRNAs were deadenylated and translationally repressed but not degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Another example, also from <italic>C. elegans,</italic> used ribosome profiling in vivo to show that miRNA mediated regulation in some cases correlated with mRNA abundance but in other cases did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stadler et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, there are also examples of <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNA targeted mRNAs which appear to be regulated at the level of translation and not stability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006b</xref>). These examples might indicate that some specific mRNPs are subject to distinct regulatory pathways. Future studies may elucidate mRNP specific factors that mediate these effects.</p><p>Cotranslational mRNA decay was shown several years ago for a selected group of mRNAs in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, studies have shown that such decay is the dominant if not sole pathway for normal mRNA decay in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings extend these observations to higher eukaryotes and suggest that cotranslational decay may be a widespread phenomenon.</p><p>Our results do not speak specifically to how mRNA decay is triggered. In that regard there has been a longstanding debate in the field as to whether inhibition of translation initiation is a prerequisite for miRNA-mediated enhanced decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Djuranovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichhorn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed over the years a large variety of different inhibition scenarios have been proposed including mRNA sequestration from the translation apparatus and inactivation of an array of initiation factors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mathonnet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chendrimada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiriakidou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukaya et al., 2014</xref>), the latest being eIF4AI and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meijer et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately none of these mechanisms including eIF4AI and II (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galicia-Vázquez et al., 2015</xref>) has received sustained experimental support and it is currently unclear how or if initiation of translation is truly impaired in a microRNA-mediated fashion.</p><p>Independent of miRNA-mediated mRNA decapping, mRNAs decap in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>). For general mRNA decapping, translational initiation is also believed to be in competition with the DCP2/1 holoenzyme. Importantly, despite this well accepted notion that initiation and decapping compete, it remains to be established how, when, or even if dissolution of the translational initiation complex occurs prior to DCP2/1-mediated cleavage. Thus the events triggering decapping are still murky but may include recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, however, since eIF-4F requires a cap to stimulate translation, decapping itself clearly and dramatically limits any further ribosome association and thus can itself be thought of as a potent and irreversible inhibitor of translation initiation.</p><p>The first report of inhibition of initiation of translation came from polysome analysis where it was shown that an miRNA targeted mRNA migrated on lighter polysomes than a control mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pillai et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, however, all of the targeted mRNA was associated with ribosomes; there was no mRNA sedimenting in the RNP region of the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pillai et al., 2005</xref>). These results were interpreted to mean that miRNAs repressed translation initiation. We too observe that targeted mRNAs migrate on lighter polysomes than untargeted mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, we suggest an alternative explanation for this phenomenon. It seems possible that the act of decapping itself could account for the altered sedimentation of targeted mRNAs. If decapping is a prerequisite for but not rate limiting for mRNA decay, decapped but not degraded mRNAs could persist. Because already engaged ribosomes would continue to elongate and eventually terminate, decapped but intact mRNAs would shift to lighter polysomes as elongating ribosomes clear the mRNA. We note that this notion is not entirely speculative. We have observed decapped mRNAs with 5’ termini that map both near the start site of the mRNA and near the translational initiation codon. Importantly, these RNAs, which would appear to be full length, are detected throughout polysomes of different sizes both large and small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These observations indicate that 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic decay is not obligatorily coupled to decapping because if such coupling existed we would not observe full length decapped mRNA. It seems possible the concentration of degradation fragments near the initiation AUG could result from the buildup of ribosomes near the beginning of the open reading frame as observed in ribosome profiling studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that decapping while a prerequisite for mRNA decay is not likely to be rate limiting for decay itself; exonucleolytic digestion by XRN1 is likely to be rate limiting.</p><p>In sum, we have provided an explanation for a longstanding mystery in the miRNA field and have suggested a plausible model for miRNA action that is consistent with a large body of experimental results obtained in numerous laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligonucleotides and construct design</title><p>All oligonucleotides used in this work were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and their sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>PCR products containing full-length 3’ UTRs of reaper and hid transcripts were amplified from S2 genomic DNA using overlapping PCR.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Cotranslational microRNA mediated messenger RNA destabilization&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Erik Sontheimer and Douglas Black, who is a member of our board of Reviewing editors. The evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tat et al. examine the mechanisms of genetic repression by miRNA's, presenting evidence supporting the model that miRNA binding to mRNAs represses expression during active translation on polysomes by inducing mRNA deadenylation and decapping. Reporter genes are constructed containing the reaper and hid 3' UTR's attached to firefly luciferase. These are stably expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells that contain the endogenous miRNA's miR-2 and Bantam, which target reaper and hid respectively. The authors show that mutating the miR-2 and Bantam miRNA responsive elements (MREs) in these reporters leads to a substantial stabilization of the reporter transcripts. They find that virtually all of the reporter mRNA and a large fraction of the miRNAs are associated with polysomes. The wild type but not the MRE-mutant mRNAs give rise degradation products that are also associated with polysomes and which are missing sequences from their 5' ends. The authors show that the reaper and hid reporters, as well as the endogenous reaper transcript, but not other endogenous transcripts, produce polysomal deadenylated products. Finally, they show using a 5' ligation assay that the reaper and hid reporter transcripts on polysomes are partially decapped and exo-nucleolytically trimmed from their 5' ends. These data support a model where miRNAs lead to mRNA decay during translation, without a prior step of removing the targets from the pool of actively translating mRNAs.</p><p>The paper is clearly written and the presented experiments are well executed. A great deal of disparate data has been published on the mechanisms by which miRNAs repress expression of their target mRNAs, with some conclusions seeming to be incompatible. It was agreed by all the reviewers that this work could help clarify important questions in the field. However, the reviewers pointed to several major experiments that were needed to solidify the findings. Questions were also raised regarding how broadly the results could be interpreted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments rely on endogenous miRNAs that are thought, but not shown to be present in the S2 cells. The only data linking particular miRNAs to the effects observed are mutations in the miRNA binding sites. These mutations could alter a variety of 3' UTR mediated regulatory processes. The authors need to demonstrate that miR-2 and Bantam mediate all the decay processes observed by blocking their action with antagomirs.</p><p>2) The arguments in the paper depend on all the mRNA being on polysomes and thus being the major contributor to the mRNA half-life measured on total RNA. The authors should confirm this by measuring how much mRNA is lost prior to the polysome gradient and how much is pelleted in these gradients. Is there a pool of mRNA sequestered in high molecular weight structures (such as P-bodies) that is not seen on the polysomes but nevertheless contributes to decay rate measurements?</p><p>3) The differential decay of the wild type and mutant RNAs is observed in different stable cell lines for each reporter. This could arise from variation in these cell lines affecting mRNA stability. The authors should assess the stability of reporter and endogenous transcripts in multiple clones of each reporter to control for this. Alternatively, both mutant and wild-type reporters could be measured in the same cell line.</p><p>4) The paper is written from the point of view that there will be one pathway of translational repression and decay induced by miRNAs. The authors should discuss the possibility that different mRNAs could show different pathways, or the different mechanisms could be balanced differently in different systems. Such a discussion would include several references already given, but also papers by Wu et al. 2010 (PMID:21095586) and Stadler et al. 2012 (PMID:22855835), showing that in some cases mRNA abundance can be stable while protein expression is reduced by a miRNA. In support of cotranslational deadenylation and decapping, they might also reference Antic et al. 2015 (PMID:25918245).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12880.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The experiments rely on endogenous miRNAs that are thought, but not shown to be present in the S2 cells.</italic> </p><p>We did directly show the presence of miRNA 13b and bantam in the cells we used, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; perhaps the reviewers overlooked the content of these figures.</p><p><italic>The only data linking particular miRNAs to the effects observed are mutations in the miRNA binding sites. These mutations could alter a variety of 3' UTR mediated regulatory processes. The authors need to demonstrate that miR-2 and Bantam mediate all the decay processes observed by blocking their action with antagomirs.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a direct demonstration that the effects we observed were the result of miRNA-mediated action would strengthen the results. Nevertheless, the use of antagomirs to miR-2 family miRNAs was not practical for two reasons. First, the family is comprised of eight members whose only common sequence is the seed itself. Accordingly eight distinct antagomirs would have had to be used simultaneously. Second, inactivation of miR-2 family of miRNAs would lead to derepression of endogenous reaper. Production of reaper proteins would promote apoptosis and thus would complicate any interpretation of results. The same is true for Bantam and hid.</p><p>To address the concern we used an alternative strategy first introduced by the Steitz lab. We constructed mimic miRNAs complementary to the nucleotides changed in the mutant reaper and hid MREs. Because of low transfection efficiency, it was not possible to use the stable cell lines. Accordingly we cotransfected mimic miRNAs with the same plasmids used to make the stable cell lines. The presence of mimic miRNAs substantively reduced the half life of reporters containing mutant MREs while a control mimic miRNA did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1 —figure supplement 2</xref>). The determined half lives were not identical to these obtained in the stable cell lines perhaps because of altered kinetics in transiently transfected cells.</p><p> <italic>2) The arguments in the paper depend on all the mRNA being on polysomes and thus being the major contributor to the mRNA half-life measured on total RNA.

Is there a pool of mRNA sequestered in high molecular weight structures (such as P-bodies) that is not seen on the polysomes but nevertheless contributes to decay rate measurements?</italic> </p><p>In response to this concern we did an “accounting experiment” analogous to one we published before. This experiment showed that the vast majority of reporter mRNAs are associated with polysomes and that negligible amounts of these RNAs are present in the pellet of the sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2 —figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The differential decay of the wild type and mutant RNAs is observed in different stable cell lines for each reporter. This could arise from variation in these cell lines affecting mRNA stability. The authors should assess the stability of reporter and endogenous transcripts in multiple clones of each reporter to control for this. Alternatively, both mutant and wild-type reporters could be measured in the same cell line.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this comment but note that we were not using clonal cell lines. Moreover the experiment with the mimic miRNAs described above rules out the possibility that cell type specific factors could influence mRNA half lives that we determined.</p><p><italic>4) The paper is written from the point of view that there will be one pathway of translational repression and decay induced by miRNAs. The authors should discuss the possibility that different mRNAs could show different pathways, or the different mechanisms could be balanced differently in different systems. Such a discussion would include several references already given, but also papers by Wu</italic> et al. <italic>2010 (PMID:21095586) and Stadler</italic> et al. <italic>2012 (PMID:22855835), showing that in some cases mRNA abundance can be stable while protein expression is reduced by a miRNA. In support of cotranslational deadenylation and decapping, they might also reference Antic</italic> et al. <italic>2015 (PMID:25918245).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this comment and note that in the revised Discussion we cite several examples from the literature that are in apparent conflict with our one pathway model. We also cite Antic et al. whose results are totally compatible with ours. We cannot at present explain the apparent translational inhibition observed by others for some specific miRNAs. Time and future experiments will tell if these outliers are meaningful.</p></body></sub-article></article>
