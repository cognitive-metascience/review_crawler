Mechanisms contributing to SUDEP involve disruption of cardiac and/or respiratory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Massey et al., 2014</xref>); the relative contribution of each may vary depending on multiple pathological factors including severity of symptoms and underlying cause of epilepsy. With regard to SUDEP in DS, most work implicates cardiac failure caused by seizure-induced parasympathetic suppression of cardiac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kearney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalume et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gataullina and Dulac, 2017</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests respiratory dysfunction precipitates cardiac failure and contributes to mortality in DS. For example, DS patients showed peri-ictal breathing problems including hypoventilation and apnea prior to the manifestation of bradycardia, a slower than normal heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with DS also exhibited a blunted ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). This finding suggests that respiratory dysfunction, possibly at the level of respiratory chemoreceptors (neurons that regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>), contributes to the pathology of DS. Despite this physiological significance, mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS or epilepsy in general are not well understood. Leading hypotheses propose that seizure activity disrupts respiratory control by a feed-forward mechanisms involving spreading depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiba and Noebels, 2015</xref>) or activation of inhibitory subcortical projections to brainstem respiratory centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dlouhy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lacuey et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the latter possibility, there is evidence that activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal and medullary raphe regions in rats are suppressed during ictal and post-ictal periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhan et al., 2016</xref>). Serotonin is a potent modulator of breathing and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richerson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchanan and Richerson, 2010</xref>); therefore, it is possible that loss of this drive during seizures contributes to SUDEP. This possibility is supported by evidence that pharmacological augmentation of serotonergic signaling can prevent seizure-induced respiratory arrest in a mouse model of epilepsy and may improve seizure control in DS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tupal and Faingold, 2019</xref>). However, some epilepsy patients show breathing abnormalities under baseline inter-ictal conditions including a reduced ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., chemoreflex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sainju et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting factors other than seizure activity compromise respiratory control. Based on this, we consider a yet unexplored possibility that epilepsy-associated mutations may directly affect brainstem respiratory centers to compromise breathing under inter-ictal conditions, and thus serve as a common substrate for both seizures and respiratory dysfunction.</p><p>Most DS cases (70–95%) are caused by mutations in the <italic>Scn1a</italic> gene (MIM#<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/182389">182389</ext-link>), which encodes the pore-forming subunit of a voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel (Nav1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meisler and Kearney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujiwara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catterall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2012</xref>). Approximately 700 different <italic>Scn1a</italic> pathological variants have been identified in DS patients, the majority of which are missense or frameshift mutations that result in loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parihar and Ganesh, 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, conventional <italic>Scn1a</italic> knockout mouse models (on a mixed C57B/6 background) recapitulate characteristic features of DS, including motor problems, seizures and premature death, in a remarkably titratable manner. For example, homozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic> knockout mice develop ataxia and die at 15 days postnatal, whereas heterozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic> deficient mice show seizure activity and early mortality starting at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>). The cellular basis for many features of DS including seizures and premature death appears to involve disinhibition, as global deletion of <italic>Scn1a</italic> suppresses activity of inhibitory but not excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutton et al., 2013</xref>), and conditional deletion of <italic>Scn1a</italic> from forebrain inhibitory neurons results in a DS-like phenotype similar to global <italic>Scn1a</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, most studies have used global or inhibitory neuron-specific <italic>Scn1a</italic> deletions to model DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2012</xref>), with few studies focusing on other high-priority genetic risk factors like <italic>Scn1a</italic> missense mutations, which represent ~40% of DS-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Depienne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parihar and Ganesh, 2013</xref>). Thus, the extent to which expression of <italic>Scn1a</italic> loss-of-function mutations recapitulate features of DS remains unclear. Furthermore, despite the lethality associated with <italic>Scn1a</italic> mutations, nothing is known regarding how loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> affects brainstem respiratory centers.</p><p>The main goal of this study was to provide the first detailed characterization of breathing in a <italic>Scn1a</italic> missense mutation mouse model of DS. We modeled DS by expressing a loss-of-function missense mutation (A1783V) conditionally in inhibitory neurons (referred to as <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice). The A1783V variant is a DS mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lossin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klassen et al., 2014</xref>) predicted to result in loss of function by increasing Nav1.1 voltage-dependent inactivation. We found that <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice (on a 90% C57BL6/J: : 10% 129/SvJ background) exhibited spontaneous seizure activity and premature death starting at ~2 weeks of age, thus confirming this is a model of SUDEP in DS. At this same developmental time point, <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice hypoventilate, exhibit frequent apneas under baseline conditions, and show a reduced ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. This respiratory phenotype is similar to what has been described DS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). At the cellular level in a key brainstem respiratory chemoreceptor region known as the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), we found that inhibitory neurons expressing the A1783V pathological variant show less spontaneous activity and a diminished ability to maintain firing during sustained depolarization. This is consistent with the possibility that the A1783V channel mutant disrupts channel expression or function by increasing voltage dependent inactivation. Also consistent with a brainstem disinhibition mechanism, we found that basal activity and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitivity of excitatory chemosensitive RTN neurons was enhanced in slices from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice. These results show that RTN chemoreceptor function is altered in this DS model and may contribute to premature death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice have spontaneous seizures and die prematurely</title><p>To generate mice that heterologously express the <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V pathological variant conditionally in inhibitory neurons (<italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice), we crossed floxed stop <italic>Scn1a<sup>A1783Vfl/+</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Scn1a<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>) with those that express Cre recombinase targeted to <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, the gene that encodes the vesicular GABA transporter Vgat, to generate a <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup><italic>:TdT<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup>) line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also observed numerous bright fluorescent puncta, which corresponded to <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript in the soma of Vgat<sup>+</sup> cells and, to a lesser extent, in Vglut2<sup>+</sup> cells in slices from control mice (F<sub>3,321</sub> = 24.07, p&lt;0.0001). In slices from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice, we found a modest reduction in <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript in Vgat<sup>+</sup> but not Vglut2<sup>+</sup> cells (F<sub>3,321</sub> = 24.07, p&lt;0.05; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Together with our sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aiii</xref>), these results suggest that the A1783V pathogenic variant is expressed by brainstem inhibitory neurons but possibly at slightly reduced levels compared to control. Therefore, cellular and behavioral phenotypes associated with <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice (see below) may involve either reduced expression, impaired channel function, or both. In a separate experiment to validate cell-type-specific Cre expression, we confirmed that all TdT<sup>+</sup> cells expressed Vgat, but not Vglut2, mRNA (not shown).</p><p>Based on previous evidence showing that heterozygous deletion mutations can give rise to severe forms of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) and since <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice express <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript, we expect <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice to exhibit a mild epilepsy-like phenotype. Contrary to this expectation, <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice show a severe SUDEP-like phenotype. <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice were born in the expected ratios, were viable, and by ~15 days postnatal, were similar in terms of body weight (T<sub>46</sub> = 1.62, p=0.11) and temperature (T<sub>26</sub> = 0.77, p=0.44) as their <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). However, <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> pups show seizure-like behavior by ~2 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). More specifically, based on the Racine seizure-behavior scoring paradigm, only 22.7% of <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control mice (N = 22) showed seizure-like behavior, which mainly manifested as head-bobbing (category 1). By contrast, 77.3% of <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice (N = 22) showed severe seizure behavior, including forelimb tremor (category 3), rearing alone (category 4) or in conjunction with falling over, and full-body tonic-clonic seizure (category 5). Unlike <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup>control animals, several of the mutant mice exhibited behavioral arrest that may reflect absence seizure-like activity. Furthermore, since febrile seizures are considered a hallmark of DS, we also characterized the susceptibility of <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup>control and <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> pups (mixed sex, 12–14 days old) to heat-induced seizures. When core body temperature was increased from 37°C to 42.5°C (0.5°C increments every 2 min) all <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice (N = 9) developed tonic-clonic seizures (category 5) at an average body temperature of 41.1 ± 0.2°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Conversely, none of the <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+-</sup> litter mate controls (N = 10) showed seizure activity up to the cut-off temperature of 42.5°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results differ somewhat from previous work that showed heterozygous <italic>Scn1a</italic> knockout mice do not develop temperature-induced seizures until ~18 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>).

We allowed mice 12 hr to recover after implanting them with the ECoG head stage.

Based on this, we define epileptic spike activity for this model as abrupt onset polyspiking events with greater than twice baseline amplitude, minimum duration of 14 ms, and that occur in conjunction with seizure activity (category 3–5). Based on this criteria, <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control mice show epileptic spike activity with a frequency 9.167 ± 3.9 events/2 hr and of 0.25 ± 0.1 events/2 hr, respectively (T<sub>5</sub> = 2.28, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bii</xref>).

To test this, we characterized the firing activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons in slices from <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control and <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice during exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> levels ranging from 3% to 10%.

We considered neurons that are spontaneously active in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and responded to 10% CO<sub>2</sub> with at least a 1.0 Hz increase in firing rate to be chemosensitive. Chemosensitive RTN neurons also have been shown to express the transcription factor Phox2b; therefore, at the end of each experiment, we filled all recorded cells with Lucifer yellow for later immunohistochemical confirmation of Phox2b expression. Chemosensitive RTN neurons in slices from <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control mice had an average basal activity of 1.3 ± 0.4 Hz under control conditions (5% CO<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.3). These cells were strongly inhibited by decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> to 3% (pHo = 7.6) (1.02 ± 0.3 Hz) and showed a linear firing increase in response to 7% (pHo = 7.2) (2.4 ± 0.5 Hz) and 10% CO<sub>2</sub> (pHo = 7.0) (2.8 ± 0.4 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B–C</xref>).

The most common cause of death for this patient population is SUDEP, a leading cause of which is respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Surges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryvlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy and Seyal, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dlouhy et al., 2016</xref>). However, mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in epilepsy and SUDEP are largely unknown. This is particularly true in the context of DS, where patients have an exceedingly high mortality rate and commonly exhibit life-threatening respiratory problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), yet little is known regarding how loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> function impacts brainstem respiratory centers. The results presented here address this knowledge gap by showing that expression of the a DS-associated <italic>Scn1a</italic> variant A1783V in inhibitory neurons resulted in both spontaneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and heat-induced seizures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) as well as pre-mature death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, this mouse model presents with a respiratory phenotype reminiscent of that exhibited by DS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Perhaps not surprising, we found that loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> function in inhibitory neurons in the RTN diminished activity in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) but, importantly, also enhanced baseline activity and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of glutamatergic chemosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest that disruption of <italic>Scn1a</italic> in inhibitory neurons can alter normal activity of brainstem respiratory centers and so may contribute to pathological features of DS including disordered breathing associated with SUDEP.</p><p>By ~2 weeks of age, <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice show respiratory abnormalities characterized by hypoventilation, increased apneas and diminished ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This phenotype is similar to that observed in DS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, these breathing problems occurred in conjunction with a marked increase in mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), thus correlatively supporting the possibility that respiratory dysfunction contributes to premature death in DS. Although mechanisms contributing to respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown, previous work showed that loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> from inhibitory neurons in the forebrain, but not the brainstem where respiratory control centers are located, resulted in premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest respiratory dysfunction in DS is a secondary consequence of cortical seizure activity propagating to and disrupting brainstem function.</p><p>There are numerous direct and indirect projections from the cortex to brainstem respiratory centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shea, 1996</xref>) that may serve as the anatomical substrate for seizure-induced respiratory dysfunction. For example, recent work in humans showed that apnea and arterial oxygen desaturation occurred when cortical seizure activity spread to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dlouhy et al., 2015</xref>) and presumably activated descending inhibitory projections to brainstem respiratory centers. However, SUDEP can also occur in epilepsy patients in the absence of an overt seizure or outside the peri-ictal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lhatoo and Shorvon, 1998</xref>) and some epilepsy patients exhibit breathing problems including a suppressed ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sainju et al., 2019</xref>), thus suggesting factors other than acute seizures disrupt respiratory control and predispose individuals to SUDEP. For example, it is possible that repeated bombardment of brainstem respiratory centers by frequent cortical seizure events alters cellular or neural network function, leading to progressive respiratory disruption and increased SUDEP propensity. Consistent with this possibility, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (a common type of focal epilepsy) show widespread alterations in neural network activity including at the level of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Englot et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether elements of respiratory control are compromised by repeated seizure activity in a similar manner.</p><p>Our results show that <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript is highly expressed by brainstem inhibitory neurons and to a lesser extent by glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>); therefore, loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> function conceivably will also directly impact brainstem inhibitory neurons independent of descending seizure activity. Consistent with this possibility and analogous to cortical inhibitory neurons in <italic>Scn1a<sup>-/+</sup></italic> knockout models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>) and induced pluripotent stem cells derived from DS patients with an <italic>Scn1a</italic> truncation mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higurashi et al., 2013</xref>), we found that inhibitory neurons in the RTN region expressed the <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V pathological variant produced fewer action potentials in response to sustained depolarizing current injection and were more prone to depolarization block compared to inhibitory neurons from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). These results suggest that loss of Scn1a might suppress inhibitory tone in brainstem respiratory centers including the RTN where inhibitory neurons appear to interact with and regulate the activity of excitatory chemosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ott et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed this possibility at the cellular level by showing that baseline activity and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent output of RTN chemoreceptors in slices from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice was enhanced compared to RTN chemoreceptors in slices from <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>cre/+</sup> control mice, thus demonstrating that RTN chemoreceptor function is potentiated in this DS model. Although increasing RTN chemoreceptor drive is expected to increase baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, this response is dependent in inhibitory neurotransmission. For example, the frequency response elicited by photo-activation of RTN chemoreceptors in vitro was eliminated by systemically blocking inhibition with picrotoxin and strychnine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cregg et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, although RTN chemoreceptor function is perturbed in <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice, it is likely that other respiratory elements also contribute to the observed hypoventilation phenotype. For example, evidence suggests serotonergic neurons in the dorsal and medullary raphe, which modulate breathing in response to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richerson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchanan and Richerson, 2010</xref>) are inhibited during and after seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhan et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, loss of serotonergic signaling has been shown to increase the likelihood of seizure-induced respiratory arrest in a mouse model of epilepsy, whereas administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors does the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tupal and Faingold, 2019</xref>). Therefore, disruption of serotonergic signaling may contribute to breathing problems in <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice. Another possibility worth noting is that loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> function may compromise inspiratory rhythm generation by the pre-bötzinger complex. This is notable because loss of inhibitory tone within this region has been shown to decrease respiratory frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>) and the breathing phenotype in <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions preferentially involves diminished respiratory frequency but otherwise normal tidal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). There are certainly several other possible mechanisms by which loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> may contribute to breathing problems in DS. Results presented here represent a first step towards understanding the cellular basis of disordered breathing in this disease.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of <italic>Scn1a</italic> missense mutations in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parihar and Ganesh, 2013</xref>), few studies have characterized the pathophysiology associated with specific mutant alleles. This is particularly important for the development of patient-directed therapies because the aberrant products of <italic>Scn1a</italic> missense mutations are potentially expressed, thus representing a novel therapeutic target that is absent from haploinsufficient models of DS. Here, we show that expression of the <italic>Scn1a</italic> pathological variant A1783V in inhibitory neurons results in seizures and premature death on an accelerated time scale compared to haploinsufficient DS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2012</xref>). Inhibitory neurons from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice showed a modest reduction in channel transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that may contribute to loss of inhibitory tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); however, transcript containing the A1783V variant was expressed in tissue from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the repetitive firing characteristics of inhibitory neurons from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice is consistent with loss of function due to increased Nav1.1 channel inactivation. For example, genotype differences in the action potential amplitude and rate of depolarization were diminished under experimental conditions designed to remove Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation. Therefore, an effective treatment for <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V-associated pathology might be to selectively potentiate Nav1.1 channel activity by slowing voltage-dependent inactivation. However, future experiments are required to test this possibility.</p><p>In sum, our results show that expression of <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V in inhibitory neurons results in clinical features of DS including spontaneous seizures and respiratory dysfunction. At the cellular level, brainstem inhibitory neurons in the RTN of slices from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> are less excitable whereas glutamatergic chemosensitive neurons are more excitable. Thus, our findings indicate that RTN chemoreceptors are a potential substrate for respiratory dysfunction in DS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Fifteen day old mice (~7 g) were individually placed into a chamber and allowed 2 hr to acclimate prior to the start of an experiment. Respiratory activity was recorded using Ponemah 5.20 software (DSI) for a period of 15 min in room air followed by exposure to graded increases in CO<sub>2</sub> from 0% to 7% CO<sub>2</sub> (balance O<sub>2</sub>). Body temperature was measured before and after each experiment and although body temperature tended to drop ~1 °C by the end of an experiment, there were no genotype difference in the degree of cooling (p=0.37). Parameters of interests include respiratory frequency (F<sub>R</sub>, breaths per minute), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>, measured in mL; normalized to body weight and corrected to account for chamber and animal temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure), and minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>, mL/min/g). A 20 s period of relative quiescence after 2 min of exposure to each condition was selected for analysis. Spontaneous apneic events, conservatively defined as three or more missed breaths not preceded by a sigh or augmented breath, were analyzed off-line. All experiments were performed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to minimize potential circadian effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Acute slice preparation and in vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Slices containing the RTN were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulkey et al., 2007</xref>). In short, rats were anesthetized by administration of ketamine (375 mg/kg, I.P.) and xylazine (25 mg/kg; I.P.) and rapidly decapitated; brainstems were removed and transverse brain stem slices (300 μm) were cut using a microslicer (DSK 1500E; Dosaka) in ice-cold substituted Ringer solution containing the following (in mM): 260 sucrose, 3 KCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, and one kynurenic acid.

Recordings were obtained at room temperature (~22° C) with patch electrodes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Molliston, MA) on a two-stage puller (P-97; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) to a DC resistance of 5–7 MΩ when filled with a pipette solution containing the following (in mM): 125 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 3 Na-GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 Na-phosphocreatine (uM), 0.2% Lucifer yellow (pH 7.30). Electrode tips were coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning, Midland, MI).</p><p>The firing response of chemosensitive RTN neurons to CO<sub>2</sub>(3–10% CO<sub>2</sub>) was assessed in the cell-attached voltage-clamp configuration (seal resistance &gt;1 GΩ) with holding potential matched to the resting membrane potential (V<sub>hold</sub> = −60 mV) and with no current generated by the amplifier (<italic>I</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0 pA). Firing rate histograms were generated by integrating action potential discharge in 10 to 20 s bins using Spike 5.0 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000903">SCR_000903</ext-link>).

Repetitive firing responses to 1 s depolarizing current steps from 0 to 300 pA (Δ 20 pA increments) were characterized from an initial holding potential of −80 mV. Action potential amplitude, threshold (dV/dT &gt; 10 mV/mS) and the maximum rate of depolarization obtained from the peak of the first time derivative of the action potential were characterized for spontaneous spikes measured under resting conditions (holding current = 0 pA) and for the first spike elicited after delivering a positive (+200 pA) or negative (−100 pA) 1 s current step. All whole-cell recordings had an access resistance (Ra) &lt;20 MΩ, recordings were discarded if Ra varied &gt;10% during an experiment.

We also video recorded all experiments to correlate animal behavior with EcoG recordings. Only spike wave discharge (SWD) activity that occurred in conjunction with observable seizure behavior was included in the analysis. Any data including movement artifacts were excluded from analysis. The same criteria for seizure events were used for both mutant mice and control group. The full duration of each seizure event was segmented and then down sampled from 600 Hz to 100 Hz to focus on the frequency range of interest (0–50 Hz) prior to performing the power spectral analysis in Matlab (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>). Frequency ranges of EcoG signals are defined as follows: delta, δ (1–5 Hz), theta, Θ (6–8 Hz), alpha, α (9–16 Hz), beta, β (17–36 Hz), and gamma, γ (37–50 Hz). Frequency analysis results were normalized to the maximum frequency amplitude at each event. For each frequency range, maximal amplitude and area under each frequency range were calculated to report the spectral power. To show the time-varying frequency distribution, time frequency analysis using Hilbert and Morlet transformations were also performed using Brainstorm 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tadel et al., 2011</xref>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001761">SCR_001761</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Seizure behavior scoring</title><p>We video monitored mice for 1 hr after placing them individually in a cage and giving them access to food and water ad lib.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disordered breathing in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jan-Marino Ramirez as the Reviewing Editor, and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder largely due to heterozygous mutation of SCN1A encoding Nav1.1; patients exhibit temperature-sensitive seizures with onset in infancy, ataxia, developmental delay, features of autism spectrum disorder, and SUDEP, and <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice recapitulate the core features of the disorder. In fact, DS may have the highest SUDEP rate among the epilepsies. However, the mechanisms of SUDEP remain unknown.</p><p>Kuo and colleagues used a recently developed transgenic mouse carrying a floxed stop <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V allele to generate a mouse model of DS with the disease-causing <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V mutation restricted to inhibitory neurons. Using electrophysiology and plethysmography, the authors show disordered breathing and abnormal function of neurons in the respiratory brainstem in this model. The cellular neurophysiology in a challenging preparation is of the highest quality and it is complemented by a careful characterization of the respiratory physiology. The authors show that mice expressing <italic>Scn1a</italic>-p.A1783A in interneurons show decreased respiratory rate, lower tidal volume, and lower minute ventilation, with an impaired capacity to increase respiration in response to C02. Inhibitory interneurons in the RTN, which are shown to express Nav1.1, reveal lower spontaneous firing rates and decreased firing frequency in response to depolarizing current injections despite identical passive membrane properties. The authors also demonstrate an enhanced activity of glutamatergic chemosensory neurons in the RTN, presumably as a result of the disinhibition. These findings demonstrate that the SCN1A A1783V mutation, which is linked to DS in humans, causes epilepsy, SUDEP, and respiratory dysfunctions in mice, even when restricted to inhibitory interneurons alone. The reviewers raised several concerns that require further clarification as specified in the essential revisions as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One major issue with this manuscript is the studied mouse and its genetic background. First, this <italic>Scn1a</italic>-p.A1783A line has not previously been published, at least so far as this reviewer is aware. The authors state repeatedly that the phenotype of this line is similar to other lines, but the mortality rate appears to be much more severe, and the mechanism of death is unclear and seems likely to be different. Added burden is placed on the authors to characterize this line, and rigor is required with regard to maintenance of consistent mouse genetic background. Do the mice have temperature-sensitive seizures? The EEG data is confusing with regard to what the authors are calling seizures vs. interictal discharges. The authors need to apply a widely accepted definition of a mouse EEG seizure and just tell us what the seizure frequency is. Why are the wild-type control mice having seizures?</p><p>2) It is well known that mouse behavioral phenotypes, including epilepsy, and in particular, the phenotype of <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, is dependent upon mouse genetic background. Here, the authors use conditional <italic>Scn1a</italic>-p.A1783A mice crossed to a VGAT-Cre driver line. These VGAT-Cre mice are on a mixed C57:129S6 background. For a subset of experiments, it appears that the authors cross this mouse to a tdTomato reporter strain, which is on a C57 background. Hence, the <italic>Scn1a</italic>-p.A1783A/VGAT-Cre mice are on a different background than the <italic>Scn1a</italic>-p.A1783A/VGAT-Cre.tdT mice. This needs to be clearly stated and may require additional controls. Already, the abstract indicates that mice used in this study had a mixed background, but then this issue is not elaborated upon in the text.</p><p>3) Figure 1F suggests that the A1783V allele does not express, only the WT allele does. If so, it is unclear how the A1783V variant will contribute to the loss-of-function via impairment of channel inactivation as described in Figure 5, considering that the protein is absent. Is the <italic>Scn1a</italic> A1783V partially expressed? A discussion of this issue will be important. The electrophysiological changes observed could be associated with either or both reduced expression or impaired inactivation of the channel.</p><p>4) It is unclear why control mice exhibit behavioral and EEG seizures (Figure 2). Is the A1783V mutation activated in the absence of Cre recombinase in some cases?</p><p>5) The reviewers do not agree with the authors' assertion that &quot;this mouse model presents with a respiratory phenotype strikingly similar to that exhibited by DS patients.&quot; A peri-ictal respiratory phenotype has been shown in some DS patients. Here, the authors show a dramatic baseline respiratory phenotype and 100% early death that may be from non-seizure related causes. Thus the authors need to clarify these differences and should alter their statement, accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43387.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One major issue with this manuscript is the studied mouse and its genetic background.

In particular, we crossed homozygous Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup>/Jreportermice (Ai14; JAX no. 007914) on a C57BL/6J background with homozygous Vgat<sup>Cre</sup> mice (JAX no. 016962) on a mixed background of 75% C57BL6/J: : 25% 129/SvJ to produce Vgat-Cre.tdT double-heterozygous mice with a 85% C57BL6/J: : 15% 129/SvJ background. These mice were crossed with Scn1a<sup>A1783Vfl/+</sup> (Jax no. 026133) maintained on a pure C57BL/6J background to produce experimental animals with a genotype of <italic>Vgat<sup>cre+/-</sup>::TdT<sup>+/-</sup>::Scn1a<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>(<italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic>) and control animals of the following genotypes <italic>Vgat<sup>cre-/-</sup>::TdT<sup>+/-</sup>::Scn1a<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>(<italic>Scn1a<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>) and <italic>Vgat<sup>cre+/-</sup>::TdT<sup>+/-</sup>::Scn1a<sup>+/+</sup> (Vgat<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>). Experimental and control mice had a common background of 90% C57BL6/J: : 10% 129/SvJ. The proportion of each background stain was determined by Genome Scan Analysis performed by the Jackson Laboratory. These details have been added to the text and we included a breeding scheme as Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the mice have temperature-sensitive seizures?</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion! We have characterized febrile seizure propensity in Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup> mice and Vgat<sup>cre+/-</sup> litter mate controls (mixed sex P12-14). We found that all Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup> mice (n=9) develop tonic-colonic seizures at an average body temperature of 41.09 ± 0.19 ◦C. Conversely, none of the Vgat<sup>cre+/-</sup> litter mate controls (n=10) show seizure activity up to the cut-off temperature of 42.5◦C. These new results have been included as a new Table 2 and discussed in the text. We also added these experimental details to the Materials and methods. Note that unfortunately our colonies have had very few litters recently and so we are unable to report febrile seizure activity in <italic>Scn1a<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>control animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The EEG data is confusing with regard to what the authors are calling seizures vs. interictal discharges. The authors need to apply a widely accepted definition of a mouse EEG seizure and just tell us what the seizure frequency is. Why are the wild-type control mice having seizures?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for this confusion. In the original version of this manuscript, we included any large amplitude spike activity in our analysis and in doing so unintentionally included behavioral artifacts. We have now redefined seizure-like ECoG activity as poly-spike bursts rather than spike wave discharges because the latter term is typically used to refer to absence seizure activity (PMID: 24861780). We have reanalyzed our data found that poly-spike activity that lasted a minimum of 14 ms consistently occurred in conjunction with obvious seizure activity (Racine score &gt; 3). Based on this, we define epileptic spike activity for this model as abrupt onset poly-spiking events with greater than twice baseline amplitude, minimum duration of 14 ms, and that occur in conjunction with seizure activity (category 3-5). Based on this criteria, the majority of <italic>Vgat<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>control animals did not show any seizure like activity. However, we did observe three Vgat<sup>cre/+</sup> control mice that each showed one epileptic event. The reason for this is unclear but may involve potential confounding effects caused by surgical placement of the electrodes or unanticipated background strain issues. In any case, the background stain was consistent for all experimental and control animals.</p><p>We have modified the Results section to make these points more clear. We also added a new panel to Figure 2 (panel Bi) to illustrate the duration distribution of all poly-spike events of each mouse included in this analysis. This new analysis strengthened our conclusion that <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic>mice have a severe seizure phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is well known that mouse behavioral phenotypes, including epilepsy, and in particular, the phenotype of Scn1a+/- mice, is dependent upon mouse genetic background.

The proportion of each stain was determined by Genome Scan Analysis performed by the Jackson Laboratory. We have also added a supplementary figure to illustrate the breeding scheme (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F suggests that the A1783V allele does not express, only the WT allele does. If so, it is unclear how the A1783V variant will contribute to the loss-of-function via impairment of channel inactivation as described in Figure 5, considering that the protein is absent. Is the Scn1a A1783V partially expressed? A discussion of this issue will be important. The electrophysiological changes observed could be associated with either or both reduced expression or impaired inactivation of the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. New sequencing results show that <italic>Scn1a</italic> transcript containing the A1783V mutation was detectable in 8 of 20 (40%) sequences tested, thus confirming at the mRNA level that the mutant channel is expressed in experimental animals (<italic>Scn1a<sup>Δ26</sup></italic>). These new results have been added to Figure 1. However, our fluorescent in situ hybridization results shown in Figures 1B-C suggest inhibitory neurons from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic> mice have slightly reduced levels of Scn1a transcript. Therefore, as suggested by the reviewer, we have modified the text to make clear that diminished channel expression or expression of channel with altered properties may contribute to the electrophysiological changes observed in slices from Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup> animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unclear why control mice exhibit behavioral and EEG seizures (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>See our second response to concern 1 above. In short, we provide a complete description of seizure like behavior and ECoG activity for Vgat<sup>cre/+</sup> and Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup> lines. Based on standard criteria, we found that control animals showed minimal seizure-like activity both in terms of behavior (Table 1) and poly-spike activity (Figure 2). We cannot say the Vgat<sup>cre/+</sup> controlswere completely devoid of seizure like behavior and factors including trauma during electrode placement or background strain specific issues may be contributing factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the A1783V mutation activated in the absence of Cre recombinase in some cases?</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point! We failed to detect any mutant transcript in 20 samples from <italic>Scn1a<sup>A1783Vfl/+</sup></italic>tissue. As a positive control, we did detect A1783V in samples from <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic>. Therefore, these results suggest there is minimal leaky mutant expression in the absence of cre. These new results have been added to Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reviewers do not agree with the authors' assertion that &quot;this mouse model presents with a respiratory phenotype strikingly similar to that exhibited by DS patients.&quot; A peri-ictal respiratory phenotype has been shown in some DS patients.

Thus the authors need to clarify these differences and should alter their statement, accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, DS patients show baseline respiratory problems including hypoventilation, apnea and a diminished ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (PMID: 29329111). This phenotype is similar to what we report for <italic>Scn1a<sup>ΔE26</sup></italic>(Figure 3). However, as noted by the reviewer, our model develops DS like pathological features including spontaneous and febrile seizures as well as premature death at an earlier developmental time point than other DS models. We have clarified this in the text and altered our statements accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
