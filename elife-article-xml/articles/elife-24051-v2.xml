To identify a compound targeting the ppGalNAc-T3 isozyme, we screened libraries to find compounds that act on a cell-based fluorescence sensor of ppGalNAc-T3 but not on a sensor of ppGalNAc-T2. This identified a hit that subsequent in vitro analysis showed directly binds and inhibits purified ppGalNAc-T3 with no detectable activity against either ppGalNAc-T2 or ppGalNAc-T6. Remarkably, the inhibitor was active in two medically relevant contexts. In cell culture, it opposed increased cancer cell invasiveness driven by upregulated ppGalNAc-T3 suggesting the inhibitor might be anti-metastatic. In cells and mice, it blocked ppGalNAc-T3-mediated glycan-masking of FGF23 thereby increasing its cleavage, a possible treatment of chronic kidney disease. These findings establish a pharmacological approach for the ppGalNAc-transferase family and suggest that targeting specific ppGalNAc-transferases will yield new therapeutics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24051.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24051.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chronic kidney disease and cancer are two major diseases where a beneficial treatment might be achieved with drugs targeting the enzyme ppGalNAc-transferase-3, which carries out O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex. In chronic kidney disease, patients suffer, often fatally, from high levels of the hormone FGF23. A treatment that inhibits ppGalNAc-transferase-3 could help because ppGalNAc-transferase-3 stabilizes FGF23 and prevents formation of an inhibitory form. In cancer, metastasis is by far the greatest cause of death. A drug blocking ppGalNAc-transferase-3 could oppose the pro-metastatic effects of the unusually high levels of GalNAc-transferase-3 that are present in certain cancers.</p><p>These were untested ideas because no drug-like molecules had yet been identified that are effective against any ppGalNAc-transferase.</p><p>To identify a compound selectively acting on ppGalNAc-transferase-3, Song and Linstedt engineered cells to become fluorescent upon inhibition of either ppGalNAc-transferase-3 or the closely related ppGalNAc-transferase-2. After screening more than 20,000 compounds they found one that selectively blocked ppGalNAc-T3 and further tests confirmed its activity, making it the first drug-like inhibitor targeting a member of the ppGalNAc-transferase enzyme family. This allowed initial tests of the ideas outlined above and, encouragingly, the identified compound reduced FGF23 in both tissue culture cells and mice and it prevented metastasis-like behavior in cultured breast cancer cells.</p><p>An important next step is to test the compound and improved versions of the compound in animal models of chronic kidney disease and cancer metastasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24051.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24051.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>O-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>drug-like inhibitor</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>FGF23</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21DE026714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linstedt</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first inhibitor identified against an iso-enzyme that initiates O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex promises new therapeutic approaches for cancer and chronic kidney disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycosylation, which fine-tunes the function of proteins, is the most abundant and diverse posttranslational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schjoldager and Clausen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Post et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>). Despite many documented roles in health and disease, the enzymes that mediate mucin-type O-glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus have yet to be discovered as druggable targets. The initiating enzymes, a family of 20 ppGalNAc-transferase isozymes, determine which substrates are modified and at which sites. Significant questions remain regarding their specificity, regulation, targets and functions and the lack of a pharmacological approach has been a critical limitation. The only confirmed inhibitor of mucin-type O-glycosylation, benzyl-N-acetyl-α-galactosaminide, blocks elongation rather than initiation and requires millimolar concentrations that can be toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Patsos et al., 2009</xref>). Not only are pan-specific modulators of the ppGalNAc-transferases lacking, there is nothing isoform-specific. The latter will be essential to restrict effects to particular pathways and could possibly lead to a new basis for therapeutics conceptually related to the widespread use of drugs targeting individual protein kinases.</p><p>ppGalNAc-T3 serves as an important test case as it is implicated in at least two medically important pathways: cancer metastasis and stabilization of FGF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chefetz and Sprecher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schjoldager et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohsaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brockhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2007</xref>). ppGalNAc-T3 is overexpressed in cancerous tissue often correlating with shorter survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brockhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mochizuki et al., 2013</xref>). Knockdown of ppGalNAc-T3 expression in cultured ovarian cancer cells inhibits their invasive capacities arguing that ppGalNAc-T3 has potential as a therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). ppGalNAc-T3 mediates glycan-masking of FGF23 in bone as part of a control mechanism determining the form of FGF23 that is secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tagliabracci et al., 2014</xref>). When present, the added O-glycan blocks FGF23 cleavage by the furin protease resulting in secretion of intact FGF23 that activates FGF23 receptor complexes at the kidney and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rowe, 2015</xref>). In contrast, non-glycosylated FGF23 is cleaved and the cleaved C-terminal product competitively blocks these same receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>). Significantly, elevated intact FGF23 occurs in chronic kidney disease and upon kidney transplant where it is directly linked to poor prognosis due to its effects on renal phosphate reabsorption and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eckardt and Kasiske, 2009</xref>). Many studies have concluded that therapeutic control over FGF23 would be transformative in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Degirolamo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukumoto, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Isakova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith, 2014</xref>).</p><p>As a step toward testing whether biologic discoveries and new therapeutics will result from developing small molecule modulators that control the activity of specific ppGalNAc-transferases we initiated high throughput cell-based screening of compound libraries. An inhibitor of ppGalNAc-T3 was identified and found to block breast cancer cell invasiveness as well as secretion of intact FGF23 promising new therapeutic approaches for cancer and chronic kidney disease, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>HEK cell lines were engineered to express fluorescent sensors that are specific to ppGalNAc-T2 or ppGalNAc-T3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>). For each sensor, glycosylation of its isozyme-specific target site prevents furin protease from removing a blocking domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, fluorescence increases upon ppGalNAc-transferase inhibition because removal of the blocking domain allows dimerization of a fluorogen activating protein domain so that it binds and activates the fluorescence of malachite green. They are ratiometric because the sensor backbone contains a green fluorescent protein as an internal control for expression. Each sensor showed clear activation after mutation of its glycan acceptor sites and these mutated constructs served as positive controls in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ∆glycan). The T3 sensor exhibited a background level of activation due to incomplete glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>) but this was considered advantageous for the possible identification of enzyme activators along with the desired inhibitors. Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>), sensor expression in HEK cell lines depleted of either ppGalNAc-T2 or T3 via zinc finger nuclease editing resulted in specific activation of the corresponding sensor confirming their isozyme selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, HEK∆T2, HEK∆T3). Our screen included compounds based on structural diversity (21,710 compounds in total) with 6 hr treatments at 10 µM prior to flow cytometry to assay MG and GFP fluorescence on a cell-by-cell basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Each compound was tested in duplicate and against both sensors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Because each sensor requires essentially identical cellular reactions- the only difference being which ppGalNAc-transferase isoform modifies the sensor- most off-target hits (such as sugar nucleotide transporters, extending enzymes, or furin) will alter both sensors, whereas directly acting, isoform-specific candidates will be sensor-specific. Using cut-off parameters for the MG/GFP ratios that excluded &gt;99% of the compounds (Q ≥ 3 or Q ≤ −2.5), the screen yielded 72 sensor-specific hits with 18 increasing and 35 decreasing the T2 sensor fluorescence and 11 increasing and 8 decreasing the T3 sensor fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screen for modulators of ppGalNAc-T2/T3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram showing sensor design and the linker sequences used.

A second stage reaction (UDP-Glo) then converted the accumulated UDP product to ATP and then, via luciferase, to light. This resulted in 20 candidates that either reduced or increased the luminescence by a factor ≥50% relative to vehicle-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Of these, one compound (#1614) stood out as a strong and selective inhibitor of ppGalNAc-T3 and became the focus of this phase of the study. The compound is a quinoline of no known activity that we now refer to as ppGalNAc-T3 Inhibitor 1 or T3Inh-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset).</p><p>Importantly, T3Inh-1 exhibited no toxicity and did not affect HEK cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, a 24 hr treatment did not affect staining intensity by the lectins Concanavalin A (ConA), Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Sambucus Nigra (SNA) or Vicia Villosa (VVA), which bind branched alpha-mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, or terminal GalNAc, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The results were similar for both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), where T3Inh-1 decreased the Vmax and increased the Km (Table 1) indicating a mixed-mode of inhibition in which the inhibitor most likely binds both free enzyme to reduce substrate binding and enzyme-substrate complexes to reduce turnover. Implied in this model of action is direct binding to the enzyme typically at an allosteric site. To test for direct binding, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ppGalNAc-T3 was determined in the presence of increasing T3Inh-1 concentrations. At all concentrations, the compound itself yielded miniscule signals, whereas the compound had a profound and dose-dependent effect on the ppGalNAc-T3 emission spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results confirmed direct binding with an apparent Kd of 17 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The similarity in concentration dependence of sensor activation in cells, in vitro inhibition and direct binding argues that T3Inh-1 acts directly on cellular ppGalNAc-T3 and inhibits its activity.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.017</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Inhibition by T3Inh-1 at varying substrate concentrations.

As mentioned, overexpression of ppGalNAc-T3 is linked to cancer cell invasiveness as well as poor outcomes in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brockhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mochizuki et al., 2013</xref>). Although no linkage to breast cancer has been reported, our analysis of publically available data for 1117 breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szász et al., 2016</xref>) using Kaplan-Meier survival plots shows that high expression of ppGalNAc-T3 correlates with poor patient overall and metastasis-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Therefore, we carried out migration and invasion assays with the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231, which expresses a relatively high level of ppGalNAc-T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), in the absence or presence of 5 µM T3Inh-1. Cells were cultured on uncoated (to assay migration) or Matrigel-coated (to assay invasiveness) Bioboat filters for 24 or 48 hr and those cells that moved to the underside of the filters were imaged and quantified. T3Inh-1 was strikingly effective, inhibiting migration by &gt;80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and invasion by 98% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) while causing no discernable effect on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To confirm that the effect was due to ppGalNAc-T3, the same experiment was carried out using MCF7 cells, which is a breast cancer cell line that expresses relatively low levels of ppGalNAc-T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Critically, invasion by MCF7 cells was significantly increased by transfection with ppGalNAc-T3 and this increase was strongly blocked by T3Inh-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although O-glycosylation has been connected to cancer migration and invasion there is little evidence that it could be targetable for clinical purposes. Our results provide a ‘proof of concept’ and a strong starting point for developing the necessary tools.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.018</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>T3Inh-1 inhibits cell invasion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell migration through uncoated filters was determined for the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line grown in the absence or presence of 5 µM T3Inh-1.

If so, we expected reduced secretion of intact FGF23. HEK cells co-expressing transfected FGF23 and ppGalNAc-T3 were treated with increasing concentrations of T3Inh-1 and secreted FGF23 was assayed by immunoblot. There was a clear dose-dependent loss of intact FGF23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and an increase in the ratio of cleaved/intact yielding a half-max of 14 µM for this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For an unknown reason, perhaps related to its instability in media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2006</xref>), the cleaved fragment did not show a corresponding increase. Rather, its recovery varied with the average over three experiments yielding a relatively small increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). As expected, intact and cleaved FGF23 showed no change in cell lysates even for cells with lysosomal degradation inhibited by chloroquine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) arguing that T3Inh-1 affected cleavage just prior to secretion and did not affect FGF23 expression or cause intracellular routing to lysosomes. Importantly, we also tested the effect of T3Inh-1 on cleavage of ANGPTL3, which is controlled by ppGalNAc-T2-mediated glycan masking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schjoldager et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>). Secreted intact ANGPTL3 remained high at all concentrations, confirming the selectivity of T3Inh-1 towards ppGalNAc-T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Reasoning that we might be able to see a similar effect on secreted FGF23 in an animal model, mice were injected intraperitoneally with T3Inh-1 and serum levels of cleaved FGF23 were determined. Three groups (0, 25 and 50 mg/kg T3Inh-1) of mice received either one or two injections separated by 24 hr, followed by blood collection after another 24 hr. There were no apparent ill effects on animal health. An ELISA assay with antibodies against the N- and C-terminal portions of FGF23 was used to determine the ratio of cleaved/intact FGF23 in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, T3Inh-1 caused a robust and statistically significant increase in this ratio at the tested 25 and 50 mg/kg concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These findings support the further development of T3Inh-1 toward mitigating the effects of elevated FGF23 signaling in chronic kidney disease patients.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.024</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>T3Inh-1 increases cleavage of FGF23.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot of media collected from cells after a 6 hr period in the presence of the indicated concentrations of T3Inh-1.

The compound binds directly conferring a mixed-mode of inhibition and is equally active in vitro and in cells. Its discovery paves the way for structural studies that will contribute to our understanding of the enzyme reaction mechanism and guide rational design of modified versions of T3Inh-1 to improve its binding affinity and efficacy. Forthcoming tests of disease models, possibly employing higher affinity versions, may strengthen the case for therapeutic uses of T3Inh-1. It is difficult to predict possible side effects because a full list of ppGalNAc-T3 substrates is not yet available. However, the known effects of its knockout in the mouse model are all attributed to FGF23 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ichikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, use of T3Inh-1 to reduce intact FGF23 (and increase the inhibitory cleaved fragment) to treat chronic kidney disease may have limited side effects. Clearly, the issue of multiple substrates has not been a major concern in successful therapies targeting protein kinases. To conclude, we anticipate rational design aided by T3Inh-1, as well as further screening using isozyme-specific sensors, to result in a panel of both isozyme- and pan-specific modulators targeting ppGalNAc-transferases. As individual ppGalNAc-transferase isozymes are associated with unique diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schjoldager and Clausen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Post et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>), the result would be a new class of therapeutics capable of treating an array of differing diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines and antibodies</title><p>HEK cell lines were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>).

Positive controls were cell lines expressing matched sensors with the glycosylation site mutated (∆glycan), specifically T<sub>225</sub>G/T<sub>226</sub>G and T<sub>178</sub>G for the T2 and T3 sensors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Cells (50,000/well) were seeded in flat bottom 96-well-plates (Corning, NY, Cat#3997) and grown for 24 hr. Compounds (the diversity set from ChemBridge Corporation [Chicago, IL] and the approved oncology drugs set V and the diversity set II from the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program) were then added to achieve a 10 µM final concentration. After 6 hr, the medium was aspirated and the cells were released by adding 100 µl 5 mM EDTA/PBS containing 110 nM MG dye (Sharp Edge Labs, Pittsburgh, PA) for 5 min at 37°C. The plates were then transferred to an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) where GFP and MG fluorescence was measured using 488 nm and 640 nm for 10,000 cells per well. Data analysis used FlowJo software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flowjo.com">www.flowjo.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008520">SCR_008520</ext-link>). For each well the geometric means of the MG and GFP signals were used to compute the MG/GFP ratio. Each compound was analyzed in two wells and the average of the two resulting ratios (R) was recorded. Each daily run included at least 16 wells of vehicle-only controls (sensor-expressing cells treated with a matching DMSO concentration [Fisher Scientific, Cat#BP231-100]) and a similar analysis was used to calculate their average MG/GFP ratio (R<sub>Neg</sub>) and its standard deviation (SD<sub>Neg</sub>). The Q value of each compound (as well as the untreated ∆glycan positive controls) was calculated by using the following equation: Q=(R-R<sub>Neg</sub>)/SD<sub>Neg.</sub> Background fell within the range −2.5 ≤ Q ≤ 3 and the average Q<sub>∆glycan</sub> was 135 and 38 for the T2 and T3 sensors, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Secondary screen</title><p>Glycosylation assays using recombinant ppGalNAc-T2 and ppGalNAc-T3 were carried out using the UDP-Glo Glycosyltransferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, Cat#V6962), according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.

The negative control was vehicle only (same reaction mixture with a matched percentage of DMSO instead of compound), whereas background was from the reaction carried out without enzyme and DMSO instead of compound. All reactions were incubated at 37°C in a water bath for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. Aliquots (5 µl) were then added to a 384-well plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat#164610) to which 5 µl of UDP Detection Reagent was also added. Duplicate measures were made for all reactions. After 1 hr at room temperature the luminescent signals were determined using a Tecan Infinite M1000 (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) with integration time set to 1000 ms. The background-subtracted average for each compound was expressed as a percentage of the negative control (taken as 100%).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Christopher G Burd (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Song and Linstedt report the results of a small molecule screen designed to identify modifiers of the GalNAc-T2 and GalNAc-T3 GalNAc-transferases. The screen implemented clever, previously published and validated, cell-based assays that report GalNAc-T2 and GalNAc-T3 dependent modifications that generate fluorescent signals. A compound that inhibits GalNAc-T3, termed &quot;T3Inh-1&quot;, was identified and characterized. Evidence is presented that T3Inh-1 inhibits GalNAc-T3 activity by binding to the lumenal portion of the enzyme. Assays of migration and invasion using cultured MDA-MB231 cells indicate that T3Inh-1 inhibits these properties of the cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion regarding the specificity of T3Inh-1 for Galnt3 is not adequately supported. The effect of T3Inh-1 on the in vitro activity of purified Galnt6, which is more closely related to Galnt3 than to Galnt2 (see: Revoredo et al., 2016), should be included in the manuscript in order to more thoroughly validate the specificity of T3Inh-1.</p><p>2) The cell-based fluorescence lectin binding data does not adequately support the authors' conclusion that T3Inh-1 has no significant effects on synthesis of the major classes of glycans. For example, GSII is not appropriate since few complex N-glycans terminate with GlcNAc. Lectins that detect terminal Gal or sialic acid and differential N-glycan branching, as well as missing O-GalNAc glycans should be investigated. A broader range of lectins needs to be implemented and the cells should be exposed to increasing concentrations of T3Inh-1 for at least 24 and 48 hours. It is recommended that changes in glycosylation should be determined by a more quantitative approach than that presented in the manuscript, such as quantitative flow cytometry.</p><p>3) Regarding the effects of T3Inh-1 of FGF23 cleavage and signaling, a concern lies with the presentation and interpretation of the FGF23 processing assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As the authors point out that loss of modification of FGF23 by GalNAc-T3 should result in a T3Inh-1 dose-dependent increase in the amount of cleaved product. The data that tests this, however, show a dose-dependent decrease in the amounts of the intact protein, but the amounts of the cleaved product remain essentially constant (or perhaps it decreases a bit?). The authors need to explain how these data support their conclusion that T3Inh-1 increases cleavage of FGF23, rather than elicits some other outcome, such as failure to secrete the intact protein and/or degradation of the intact protein. The authors state, but do not show, that FGF23 levels in cell lysates were unaffected by T3Inh-1; the reviewers feel these data should be shown because it might be insightful for determining how T3Inh-1 causes the observed change in the ratio of cleaved/uncleaved protein. Perhaps the unglycosylated, intact form is retained and/or degraded within the cell, but the cleaved form is not. Better yet would be a pulse-chase assay of radiolabeled FGF23, which would directly test the authors' hypothesis that the intact form is unstable/degraded in the culture medium. Related, the authors interpret change in the ratio of cleaved/uncleaved protein to reflect a net change in &quot;signaling activity&quot; (Results section), but no assays of signaling activity are reported. The text should be modified to accurately reflect this.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Inhibitor of GalNAc-T3-mediated O-glycosylation blocks cancer cell invasiveness and lowers FGF23 levels&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. All of these points can be addressed by revisions to the text.</p><p>1) The authors must use the established nomenclature throughout the text and in all figures. The enzymes that add GalNAc to protein are called polypeptide GalNAc-transferases. The shorthand for each of the 20 members of the family is ppGalNAcT-1 etc, and the genes are named GALNT1 etc. The leaving out of polypeptide by the authors confuses the enzymes under study with GalNAcTs which transfer GalNAc to other sugars, a totally distinct class of enzyme.</p><p>2) Regarding the new lectin binding assay, the authors should qualify their conclusions by stating that no major change in the binding of lectins that detect N- or O-glycans was induced by inhibitor treatment. The lectin binding assay, though acceptable, is not standard practice for the field (flow cytometry is). Additionally, the sensitivity of the fluorescence assay is not clear since there are no positive controls with altered N- or O-glycans. There are many other types of glycans that would not be detected by the lectins used in their assay. The amount of time that cells were incubated with inhibitor before lectin binding was assayed must be indicated.</p><p>3) The authors should explain the origin of the band at ~25 kD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. This gel does not show a visible increase in the ~15 kD cleavage product which is very abundant at time zero. More explanation of these data is warranted.</p><p>4) The Materials and methods should include precise details regarding origin, clone name, catalogue number and dilution used for each antibody or reagent and precise conditions of use in the relevant experiment. For example the source of GPP130 is given as the reference for Puri, Bachert, Fimmel and Linstedt, 2002, which is not sufficient. Enough information should be provided so that precise replication of each experiment is possible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24051.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The conclusion regarding the specificity of T3Inh-1 for Galnt3 is not adequately supported.

Gratifyingly, there was no detectable activity despite the full and expected potency against GalNAc-T3 in parallel assays.</p><p><italic>2) The cell-based fluorescence lectin binding data does not adequately support the authors' conclusion that T3Inh-1 has no significant effects on synthesis of the major classes of glycans. For example, GSII is not appropriate since few complex N-glycans terminate with GlcNAc.

It is recommended that changes in glycosylation should be determined by a more quantitative approach than that presented in the manuscript, such as quantitative flow cytometry.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we expanded our survey of lectin staining to include Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Sambucus Nigra (SNA), which recognize most major surface glycans. Additionally, the assay was made more rigorously quantifiable by using a plate reader allowing determinations from thousands of cells (n=3 independent trials). These data are present as a new figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. There was no significant diminishment of staining for any lectin tested supporting our conclusion that T3Inh-1 is selective against GalNAc-T3 rather than acting as a general inhibitor of glycosylation enzymes.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the effects of T3Inh-1 of FGF23 cleavage and signaling, a concern lies with the presentation and interpretation of the FGF23 processing assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As the authors point out that loss of modification of FGF23 by GalNAc-T3 should result in a T3Inh-1 dose-dependent increase in the amount of cleaved product. The data that tests this, however, show a dose-dependent decrease in the amounts of the intact protein, but the amounts of the cleaved product remain essentially constant (or perhaps it decreases a bit?). The authors need to explain how these data support their conclusion that T3Inh-1 increases cleavage of FGF23, rather than elicits some other outcome, such as failure to secrete the intact protein and/or degradation of the intact protein. The authors state, but do not show, that FGF23 levels in cell lysates were unaffected by T3Inh-1; the reviewers feel these data should be shown because it might be insightful for determining how T3Inh-1 causes the observed change in the ratio of cleaved/uncleaved protein. Perhaps the unglycosylated, intact form is retained and/or degraded within the cell, but the cleaved form is not. Better yet would be a pulse-chase assay of radiolabeled FGF23, which would directly test the authors' hypothesis that the intact form is unstable/degraded in the culture medium. Related, the authors interpret change in the ratio of cleaved/uncleaved protein to reflect a net change in &quot;signaling activity&quot; (Results section), but no assays of signaling activity are reported. The text should be modified to accurately reflect this.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref> has been added to address issues concerning the intact and cleaved bands of FGF23. The main question is why the loss of intact FGF23 does not appear to be accompanied by a quantitatively comparable increase in the cleaved fragment. There is previous evidence that the cleaved FGF23 fragment is difficult to recover in cultured cell media samples (Kato et al., 2006). Also, note that even in ∆T3 cells the cleaved fragment is relatively under- represented in the media. It also bears mentioning that we do detect a strong increase in this cleaved FGF23 fragment in the serum of injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, the new figure presents the data more thoroughly and shows that for the quantified data the discrepancy is minor. First we present an additional representative blot from the 3 identical trials (panel A of the figure) to illustrate that there was some variation in our recovery of the cleaved fragment. This blot better represents the slight increase that the quantified data show. This quantified data, showing the increase on average in cleaved FGF23 and the loss of intact, is presented in panel B. Taken together with the data in the main body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>) this provides a comprehensive representation of the result we obtained. Indeed, in data not shown, the experiment was carried out for an additional cell type and with different parameters and, in each case, yielded the same result: a significant loss of intact and a slight increase of cleaved FGF23. In part C-E, we have now added our data for the cell extracts. Neither the intact nor cleaved FGF23 showed a significant change (C-D). Also, panel E compares cells extracts from untreated and chloroquine-treated cells (to block lysosomal degradation). Chloroquine did not cause any accumulation. All together the data in cells and mice argue against changes in expression, sorting, or degradation and support the conclusion that T3Inh- 1 increases FGF23 cleavage.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.
