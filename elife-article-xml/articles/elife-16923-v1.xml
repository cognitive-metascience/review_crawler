beneficial or neutral in females but harmful in males. Although a few male-harming mtDNA mutations have been identified, consistent with this ‘Mother’s Curse’, their effect on females has been largely unexplored. Here, we identify COII<sup>G177S</sup>, a mtDNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase II, which specifically impairs male fertility due to defects in sperm development and function without impairing other male or female functions. COII<sup>G177S</sup> represents one of the clearest examples of a ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutation in animals and suggest that the hypomorphic mtDNA mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might specifically impair male gametogenesis. Intriguingly, some <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nuclear genetic backgrounds can fully rescue COII<sup>G177S</sup> -associated sterility, consistent with previously proposed models that nuclear genomes can regulate the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16923.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16923.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell compartments called mitochondria are responsible for producing much of the energy that animal and plant cells need. Most of the proteins in mitochondria are produced from genes found in another compartment called the nucleus. However, some mitochondrial proteins are made from genes found in the mitochondria themselves.</p><p>Unlike the genes in the nucleus, which animals and plants inherit from both their mother and father, the mitochondrial “genome” is only passed on along the female line. Therefore, males represent an evolutionary dead-end for mitochondrial genes. Evolutionary theory predicts that this should result in the evolution and spread of mutations that can be harmful to males, providing they do not reduce the ability of females to survive and reproduce. Although such ‘male-harming’ mutations have been well studied in plants, it is less clear how common they are in animals.</p><p>Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al. used fruit flies as a model system to identify and characterize male-harming mutations in the mitochondrial genome. The experiments isolated a mitochondrial genome with a single mutation in a gene that encodes an enzyme called cytochrome oxidase II. The mutation is said to be “hypomorphic” because it lowers the activity of the gene. The fertility of male flies with this mutation rapidly declined as they aged. However, the mutation did not appear to lower the fertility of female flies. In fact, apart from the lower male fertility, the mitochondrial mutation did not seem to affect any other traits in males or females.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that this hypomorphic mutation specifically impairs the development of sperm. Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al. also found that the effect of the mutation on the fertility of the males depended on the genes in the nucleus of their cells, as some nuclear genomes were able to partially or completely suppress the mutation. This supports previous findings that the effect of mitochondrial mutations in animals and plants may be complex and can be strongly influenced by the genes in their nucleus.</p><p>Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al.’s findings suggest that sperm development is particularly susceptible to defects in mitochondria, and that hypomorphic mutations may represent a broader category of ‘male-harming’ mutations in animals. A future challenge will be to find out whether such mutations occur in humans and whether they are associated with infertility in men.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16923.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16923.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>male fertility</kwd><kwd>sperm development</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>genetic suppressors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Maulik R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AG045021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Heiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pallanck</surname><given-names>Leo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

This symbiosis gave the eukaryotic cell the ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). In modern eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation is carried out by the electron transport chain, which comprises subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Oxidative phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in many eukaryotes and is responsible for meeting most cellular energy demands. In humans, dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation is associated with many diseases including cancer, diabetes, infertility, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wallace, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Despite the appearance of a symbiotic relationship, the evolutionary interests of mitochondria can be in conflict with those of nuclear genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Partridge and Hurst, 1998</xref>). This conflict arises from the differences in transmission between the two genomes. Whereas the nuclear genome is transmitted in a Mendelian fashion through both sexes, mtDNA is exclusively maternally inherited in most metazoans. Indeed, there are elaborate mechanisms to prevent the inheritance of sperm mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Rawi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sato and Sato, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeLuca and O'Farrell, 2012</xref>). Due to this uniparental inheritance, natural selection for mtDNA fitness can operate in females but not in males. As a result of this relaxed selection, 'male-harming' mtDNA mutations are expected to accumulate as long as they are beneficial, neutral or nearly neutral in females, a scenario referred to as the ‘Mother’s Curse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank and Hurst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gemmell et al., 2004</xref>). However, since decreased male fitness is detrimental for the evolutionary success of the nuclear genome, outbred populations subject to accumulation of male-harming mtDNA mutations can rapidly evolve nuclear genome-encoded suppressors to restore male fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dowling et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, evolutionary theory predicts a conflict-driven molecular arms race between mtDNA and the nuclear genome.</p><p>These evolutionary predictions have spurred interest into the molecular basis of how mtDNA mutations can manifest as specifically ‘male-harming’ particularly since mitochondrial function would be expected to be similar in most organs of both sexes. One of the best-understood examples of such ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutations are <italic>cytoplasmic male sterility (cms)</italic> mutants described in many plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chase, 2007</xref>). Such <italic>cms</italic> mtDNA can induce male sterility in hermaphroditic plants that can be cross-pollinated. By reallocating resources for pollen production instead for production of seeds, <italic>cms</italic> mtDNA increase female fitness – and consequently increase their own fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budar et al., 2003</xref>). Molecular characterization of <italic>cms</italic> mutants shows that their ‘male-harming’ (and female-beneficial) properties are caused by novel chimeric genes that are created via recombination between mtDNA molecules. Nuclear-encoded suppressors of <italic>cms</italic> belong to the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family and use RNA editing to effectively neutralize these male-harming chimeric genes in mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chase, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castandet and Araya, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Animal mtDNA genomes are relatively small compared to those in plants, and the presence of novel chimeric genes is extremely rare in animal mtDNA. Despite these limitations, there is evidence that mutations in animal mtDNA genes might be male-harming. For example, mtDNA haplogroup T in humans is associated with reduced sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2000</xref>). Polymorphisms in mtDNA that cause this phenotype are hypothesized to be significant contributors to untreatable male subfertility, known to affect 7–10% of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker, 1994</xref>). Recent findings implicate mtDNA variation as a significant contributor to shorter male lifespans in many taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clancy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2012</xref>). Although the phenotypic consequences of these mtDNA mutations are severe in males, it remains unclear whether they are benign in females, <italic>i.e.,</italic> whether they are specifically ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutations as predicted by the Mother’s Curse hypothesis.</p><p>Indeed, in spite of the theoretical predictions, male-harming mtDNA mutations have proven difficult to detect in animals. Several factors account for this difficulty. First, in natural populations, there can be significant indirect selection on mtDNA to maintain male fitness when the fitness of females is dependent on related males (those with the same mtDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wade and Brandvain, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hedrick, 2012</xref>). Such indirect selection against male-harming mtDNA mutations may be especially stringent in populations with high rates of inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wade and Brandvain, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hedrick, 2012</xref>). Such indirect selection for male fitness might keep male-harming mtDNA mutations at low frequencies in natural populations, making them difficult to detect without deep surveys of natural polymorphism.</p><p>A second factor that may impede the discovery of male-harming mtDNA mutations in natural populations is their suppression by nuclear genome-encoded loci, which are under stringent selective pressure to restore male fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dowling et al., 2008</xref>). Effects of detrimental mtDNA variants could thus only be evident if they were separated from their nuclear-encoded suppressors. With this goal, many researchers have created combinations of nuclear and mtDNA genomes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, either from different strains or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maklakov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rand et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dowling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montooth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correa et al., 2012</xref>). Such combinations have revealed instances of dramatic incompatibility, even within species, which results in male but not female lifespan defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2012</xref>). Variation in mtDNA also affects sperm competitiveness in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yee et al., 2013</xref>). While these elegant experiments have revealed mtDNA-dependent affects on male lifespan and fertility, they did not comprehensively assess affects on female life-history traits; it is thus unclear whether these mutations are specifically male-harming. One further limitation of such mtDNA ‘swaps’ is that introduced mtDNA often have several co-inherited mutations. This linkage of different mutations makes it nearly impossible to implicate single mutations as being causal for the incompatibility or to understand their biological mechanism. An exception is a single point mutation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mtDNA that has been causally linked to male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent demonstration of this mtDNA haplotype’s negative pleiotropic effects on fertility and aging, both within and between sexes suggests it is not a specifically male-harming mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camus et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we currently lack clear examples of specifically male-harming mtDNA mutations in animals. This has also left unanswered the larger question of molecular mechanisms by which mtDNA mutations can manifest their ‘male-harming’ phenotypes.</p><p>Here, we isolated a mtDNA variant that harbors a single non-synonymous change in subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (COII<sup>G177S</sup>). We find that COII<sup>G177S</sup> males have an age– and temperature–dependent decrease in fertility. This decrease in fertility is correlated with a drop in COII enzymatic activity, which remarkably does not result in defects in any other male or female phenotypic traits we measured. Cellular characterization reveals decreased sperm production and function in the mutant males. By combining evolutionary principles with detailed functional characterization, our study thus provides one of the clearest examples of a male-harming mtDNA mutation in animals, and provides insights into the stringent requirements for optimal mtDNA function in sperm development. We further show that the fertility defect in COII<sup>G177S</sup> males can be completely suppressed by diverse nuclear backgrounds derived from various <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains, as predicted by the theory of cyto-nuclear genetic conflict.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recovery of a male-harming mtDNA mutation</title><p>To isolate male-harming mtDNA mutations, we devised an experimental evolution strategy that was partly inspired by previous strategies to decouple male versus female evolution in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rice, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice, 1998</xref>). In our strategy, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females are prevented from mating with their male siblings. Instead, virgin females are mated to naïve males from an external stock every generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This strategy is predicted to eliminate indirect selection against male-harming mtDNA mutations because the fitness of the population is not dependent on the males carrying the mtDNA mutations; mtDNA are effectively absolved from supporting male fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wade and Brandvain, 2009</xref>). Moreover, continuous replacement of a large fraction of the nuclear genome every generation via crosses to external males practically eliminates the likelihood of evolution of nuclear suppressors during the course of the experiment. In contrast, selection of mtDNA function for female fitness is stringently maintained over the entire course of the experiment. Thus, we anticipated this experimental evolution strategy might provide a permissive environment for accumulation and phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations that are beneficial, neutral, or nearly neutral (only slightly deleterious) in females but cause defects in males.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An experimental evolution strategy to recover male-harming mtDNA mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In 12 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines undergoing experimental evolution, 300 virgin female progeny in every generation were prevented from mating with sibling males (shown as being ‘crossed out’) and instead were mated with 100 males from the original stock.

In 12 of these lines (experimental lines), virgin females were collected every generation and mated with males from the original stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Female flies were subjected to this mating scheme continuously for 35 generations over approximately 70 weeks. For the remaining 6 lines (coevolving lines), we allowed sibling males to mate with the females over the course of 35 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on published mtDNA mutation rate of 6.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> per site per fly generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haag-Liautard et al., 2008</xref>), we anticipated that multiple mutations per mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across the 18 lines. Any mtDNA mutations fixed at the end of the experiment must have either been pre-existing heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations that went to fixation (although the rate of fixation of such heteroplasmic mutations would be slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Solignac et al., 1987</xref>]) or arose <italic>de novo</italic> in the experimental lines.</p><p>After 35 generations, we subjected flies to phenotypic analyses to assess whether any male-harming mutations had been sampled in the course of our experimental evolution strategy. To assess male viability, we first measured sex ratio in crosses between females with mtDNA subjected to experimental evolution (either ‘experimental’ or ‘coevolving’ lines) and control males (original <italic>w1118</italic> stock maintained as a separate population). We did not observe a change in male to female ratio in any of the 18 lines, suggesting that any mutations in mtDNA acquired over the 35 generations did not alter male viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we measured male fertility by mating males derived from the starting, experimental, and coevolving lines with females from the original stock. For 17 of 18 lines, we did not detect any significant differences in male fertility. However, we found that males from experimental line 7 (hereafter referred to as ‘EL7’) sired significantly fewer progeny compared to males from all the other experimental, coevolved and original lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, EL7 females do not have any significant decline in fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggested the possibility of a male-harming mtDNA mutation in the EL7 line that was not deleterious to female fertility. We investigated whether the decline in male fertility we observed manifested over the entire adulthood of EL7 male flies. We found no obvious reduction in male fertility over the first few days of adulthood (note that F1 progeny do not emerge until day 12) in EL7 compared to the other experimental or control lines. Instead, we observed that the reduction in male fertility was age-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Our findings are consistent with previous observations in which mitochondrial dysfunction is more severe in aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tower, 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A single experimental line with male-specific fertility defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We measured average sex ratio of progeny by mating five females from each of the original, experimental, or coevolving lines, with three males from the original stock.

First, a population can consist of homoplasmic (carrying genetically identical mtDNA) wildtype and mutant individuals. Alternatively, the two mtDNA can be present in the same individual in a state of heteroplasmy. Sanger sequencing of single individuals from our original line revealed the presence of heteroplasmic individuals as well as flies that were homoplasmic wildtype and mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, 59% reflects the average combined frequency of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation from both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic mutant flies in the population.</p><p>The mutant allele’s 59% frequency among reads from the original stock suggested that the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation was present before initiation of the experimental lines. If this model is correct, we would expect that the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation should also be found in some of the other control and experimental lines in addition to EL7. Indeed, we found this to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, EL7 is unique in being the only population in which the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation is nearly fixed, whereas it varies from 0% to more than 50% in other experimental populations, which do not suffer any overt signs of male sterility at least at a population-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation causes defects in male fertility but only when present at very high levels. Our findings are consistent with similar observations in pathogenic mtDNA variants in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sobenin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that EL7 nearly fixed a mtDNA mutation that was already pre-existing provided another opportunity to test the association of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation with decrease in male fertility. We reasoned that homoplasmic mutant males re-isolated from the original stock should also have reduced fertility despite the fact that these males have not undergone 35 generations of experimental evolution like EL7. Consistent with this expectation, we were able to re-isolate homoplasmic COII<sup>G177S</sup> males, which sire fewer progeny compared to homoplasmic wildtype males derived from the same original stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (mutant and wildtype lines re-established from single females). These data demonstrate that the homoplasmic COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation is necessary and sufficient to explain the observed decreased male fertility in EL7 males. These re-isolated COII<sup>G177S</sup> homoplasmic mutant mtDNA males also recapitulated the age-dependent decline in male fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Males with COIIG177S mutation have decreased fertility at elevated temperatures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To measure male fertility, we compared the fertility of males homoplasmic for either wildtype or COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA reestablished from the original stock.

Under this strategy, mtDNA is sequenced at very high depth of coverage, labeling individual DNA molecules and sequencing each one multiple times in order to distinguish true mutations from sequencing errors. This strategy allows for sensitive evaluation of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. We found no evidence for wildtype mtDNA sequence in a pool of flies that we had re-isolated to enrich for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA (0 duplex consensus reads out of &gt;7000). In contrast, we found no evidence for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA in flies (0 reads out of &gt;7000) that we had re-isolated from the same original w1118 stock to enrich for wildtype mtDNA. We were cognizant that although the pooled COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant flies showed no evidence of wild-type sequence, some heteroplasmy may nevertheless persist in individual flies. We therefore also sequenced 7 individual flies from the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA pool to high depth of coverage. For six flies, we found no reads (out of &gt;8,000) corresponding to wildtype mtDNA, whereas in one fly we uncovered seven out of &gt;11,000 reads corresponding to wildtype mtDNA (&lt;0.1%).

Future work will be needed to determine the effectiveness of our experiment evolution scheme in recovering male-harming mutations, perhaps aided by experimentally increasing mtDNA mutation rates.

Hence, we decided to further characterize the cellular and molecular basis underlying its detrimental effects. Previous experiments have shown that the phenotypic effects of mtDNA mutation can be exacerbated with increased stress, including higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoekstra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, we found that this defect manifests in both old and young males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, higher temperature provides a more sensitized condition to evaluate the various consequences of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoekstra et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants have impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity</title><p>Next, we investigated the molecular consequences of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation. COII is a subunit of cytochrome C oxidase (COX), which oxidizes the reduced form of cytochrome c. The glycine residue at position 177 is found in a loop of COII’s structure where it comes in very close proximity to subunit I of the enzymatic complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Based on the fact that G177 is highly conserved across metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we hypothesized that the G177S mutation affects either an intrinsic function of COII or its interaction with other proteins in complex IV of the electron transport chain. To understand the biochemical consequences of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation, we measured COX activity from whole fly lysates of flies grown at 25°C. Although the COX activity in COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant flies was slightly lower than flies with wild-type mtDNA, this defect was not statistically significant, even in old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We therefore measured COX activity from flies raised at 29°C where male fertility is most significantly impaired. Our analyses revealed an approximately 20% decrease in COX enzymatic activity in COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants grown at 29°C in both male and female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Given that the activity of the electron transport chain is coupled to ATP synthesis, we also measured ATP levels at 29°C. In contrast to COX activity, we did not observe a decrease in ATP levels in the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, we did observe a mild but significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, impaired COX activity and reduced ROS levels, but not ATP production, appear to correlate with loss of male fertility.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Biochemical consequences of COIIG177S mtDNA mutation.</title><p>We measured COX activity from young (3–4 days) or old (21 days) flies raised at 25°C (<bold>A</bold>), or young flies raised at 29°C (<bold>B</bold>).

We therefore carried out similar experiments in aged males at 25°C, which also had displayed a reduction in fertility. Just like young COII<sup>G177S</sup> males at 29°C, we found that aged COII<sup>G177S</sup> males at 25°C also had reduced seminal vesicle size compared to aged males with wildtype mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the seminal vesicle sizes of young males with wildtype mtDNA were the same, whether they were raised at 25°C or 29°C.Together, our results suggest that the decreased male fertility and reduced seminal vesicle size is not due to a confounding effect of higher temperature, but rather the result of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation.</p><p>Examining the male infertility phenotype further, we found that mitotracker green, a mitochondrial membrane potential-independent dye, preferentially stains immotile sperm whereas mitotracker CMXRos, a mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dye, preferentially stains motile sperm in wild type testes.

Hence, the restoration of fertility that we observe could simply reflect greater tolerance to high temperature independent of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA. To address this possibility, we measured total fertility of males until 21 days of age at 25°C. We found that the Oregon R nuclear background suppresses not only the young male sterility at 29°C but also male fertility at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the Oregon R nuclear background encodes a <italic>bona fide</italic> suppressor of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA-mediated male infertility. We currently don’t know the identity of the suppressor loci or whether these are specific only to the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation. For instance, these suppressors might employ a general mechanism that allows for rescue of male fitness defects caused by other mtDNA mutations.

We found that DGRP line 861 was able to completely restore male fertility and most other lines were able to at least partially restore male fertility in males carrying COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that genetically dominant nuclear suppressors of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> male fertility defects are widespread in natural populations. The different penetrance of the rescue also suggests that the suppression of COII<sup>G177S</sup> associated male infertility is likely to involve multiple loci.</p><p>We examined in more detail the cellular basis of ‘rescued’ male fertility in OregonR-w1118 heterozygous males bearing the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA. We found that sperm development and motility were partially rescued in young males raised at 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) and aged males at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7 —figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the restoration of fertility that we previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). We also evaluated the biochemical consequence of such nuclear suppression of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA’s male sterility to distinguish between two possible mechanisms of suppression. Under the first alternative, restoration of fertility in COII<sup>G177S</sup> males might be due to higher baseline COX activity in the suppressor background, which can compensate for the hypomorphic COII<sup>G177S</sup> and therefore be sufficient for sperm development and motility. Under this scenario, there would still be a difference in COX activity between wildtype and COII<sup>G177S</sup> flies. A second alternative is that there is no difference in COX activity in flies carrying wildtype or COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA. When we measured COX activity in the suppressed nuclear background, we found the second scenario to be true <italic>i.e.,</italic> COX activity is the same in wildtype and COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA-bearing males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). This result was also observed for three additional suppressor lines we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that in the suppressed background, COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA is as functionally effective as wildtype mtDNA and is indicative of a compensatory mechanism that does not rely simply on higher baseline levels of COX activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16923.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>w1118/OreR heterozygous males carrying COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA show rescued sperm development and COX activity.</title><p>Representative DAPI stained images of the late needle stage of sperm development from w1118/w1118 males carrying either wildtype mtDNA (<bold>A</bold>), or COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA (<bold>B</bold>) compared to heterozygous w1118/OreR males carrying COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA (<bold>C</bold>).

Remarkably, the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) does not abide by this rule since it is inherited and phenotypically manifests in both sexes, but is exclusively transmitted through females in most animals and plants. Thus, the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA is decoupled from its transmission in males. Consequently, natural selection is ineffective at directly removing mtDNA mutations that are specifically harmful to males but not females. While the mtDNA phenotype/transmission decoupling clearly predicts existence of male-harming mutations (Mother’s Curse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank and Hurst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gemmell et al., 2004</xref>), a systematic study of such mutations and their underlying mechanisms is hampered by the relative paucity of such mutations in animals.</p><p>We devised an experimental evolution scheme intended to absolve mtDNA of supporting male function while both maintaining selection on female mtDNA function as well as reducing the possibility of nuclear suppression of male-harming mtDNA. While we did recover a <italic>bona fide</italic> male-harming COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation via this scheme, we were subsequently surprised to discover that this was a pre-existing mtDNA mutation that was already present at moderate frequencies in our starting laboratory strain of w1118. It is possible that the experimental evolution scheme might have created the permissive conditions that allowed this mtDNA mutation to rise to fixation in one strain. However, the fact that it did not rise to fixation in the other experimental populations means that we cannot conclude that the experimental strategy itself was causally important for the fixation of this male-harming mtDNA mutant. Future work on fine-tuning the strategy can address its effectiveness. For example, the scheme can be improved by increasing mtDNA mutation rates to improve sampling of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, perhaps by employing a mutator mtDNA polymerase before initiating the experimental evolution scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trifunovic et al., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, random chemical mutagenesis might also be readily applied here in our scheme. Although such chemical mutagenesis will affect both mtDNA and nuclear genomes initially, backcrossing to ‘original stock’ males in our scheme will rapidly replace most mutated nuclear genes with wildtype versions, while enabling the transmission of mtDNA mutations that do not affect female fitness. Finally, combining the crossing scheme we propose with the targeted restriction endonuclease strategy to generate mtDNA mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) might be a facile means to discriminate specifically ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutations from those that grossly impair mtDNA function.</p><p>Our phenotypic assays did not provide any evidence for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation being beneficial in females. Furthermore, the mutation rose to high frequency in only one out of the twelve experimental lines, suggesting that the mutation is likely neutral or nearly neutral in females and therefore became nearly fixed through drift rather than selection. These data are consistent with the ‘selective sieve’ model, which predicts that even mutations that are neutral or nearly neutral in females but deleterious in males might be common because they cannot be effectively removed by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innocenti et al., 2011</xref>). Our survey of the sequenced genomes from a large panel of 290 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains and isofemale lines did not reveal any other lines besides our w1118 stock that harbored COII<sup>G177S</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, COII<sup>G177S</sup> might be rare in natural populations.</p><p>The homoplasmic COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation results in a 20% decline in COX activity at 29°C. Remarkably, we observed no phenotypic effects of this decline in COX activity on other phenotypic traits in both males and females, even at high temperatures. The COX activity decline specifically impaired sperm production and function. This establishes COII<sup>G177S</sup> as one of the first <italic>bona fide</italic> male-harming mtDNA mutations in animals. We considered the possibility that the phenotypic effects we have observed on male fertility are attributable to linked but unassayed changes in the 4-kb long AT-rich D loop control region of mtDNA. Indeed, the D-loop is one of the most rapidly evolving segments of mtDNA in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but its highly repetitive nature challenges sequence characterization. However, our analyses allow us to directly implicate the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation as being causally linked to the phenotypes we have observed. Not only do we observe a perfect correlation of the male fertility phenotype with the reduction of COX activity, but we also observe a near complete restoration of male fertility upon replenishment of COX activity in the suppressor strains.</p><p>Surprisingly, the decline in COX activity in COII<sup>G177S</sup> flies was not associated with a corresponding decline in ATP production. Since we were unable to reliably measure either COX activity or ATP production in testes, we cannot rule out the possibility that ATP production is specifically impaired in the male germline. However, our findings suggest a different molecular consequence of lowered COX activity may be responsible for defects in sperm development; we did observe decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutants. Our findings suggest that perhaps alterations in ROS levels might underlie the defects we see in sperm production and function. ROS have been shown previously to act as a signaling molecule to control the cell cycle checkpoint as well as the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors during development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>). These data leave open the possibility of ROS similarly acting as a signaling factor during sperm development.</p><p>We hypothesize that male fertility may be a common target of male-harming mtDNA mutations because the reproductive tissues are highly sexually dimorphic. This hypothesis is consistent with previous data, which showed that naturally occurring variation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mtDNA largely affects expression of male-expressed genes in the testis and the accessory gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innocenti et al., 2011</xref>). Two separate mutations in mtDNA are known to cause male sterility in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). A single amino acid mtDNA mutation (A278T) in Cytochrome B of complex III renders males sterile; the primary defect appears to be at the level of spermatid individualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, a single amino acid mutation in Cytochome Oxidase I (R301L) causes male sterility primarily due to a sperm storage defect. However, the effects of these mutations on female fitness have not yet been comprehensively addressed so we cannot attribute them to be specifically ‘male-harming’.</p><p>How might mtDNA function be different in testis compared to other tissues? It is possible that the testis has a differential requirement for COX activity. According to this hypothesis, although all tissues suffer from the relative reduction in COX activity, testis function is specifically impacted because it has a lower threshold of tolerance for a relative reduction in COX activity. In particular, COX activity might be required to facilitate the dramatic morphological changes that mitochondria undergo during sperm development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuller, 1998</xref>). If this hypothesis is correct, mildly hypomorphic mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup> might generally impair male fertility and thus represent a common mechanism of male-harming mtDNA mutations. Alternatively, the existence of a number of nuclear-encoded testis-specific components of the electron transport chain, including subunits of cytochrome C oxidase, provide a number of interacting partners that might exhibit testis-specific genetic incompatibility with the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tripoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallach et al., 2010</xref>). Since we were unable to reliably measure COX activity in dissected testes of wildtype and mutant flies, we are unable to address whether the decrease in COX activity is more severe in testes than other tissues.</p><p>Our study has identified one mtDNA mutation, COII<sup>G177S</sup>, whose phenotypic effects appear to be restricted to the male germline. However, other forms of sexual dimorphism might lead to sex-specific phenotypic manifestations of other mtDNA mutations beyond reproductive tissues. For instance, there is already evidence that mtDNA might harbor mutations that affect aging and lifespan, which is highly dimorphic between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camus et al., 2012</xref>). At the molecular level, COX activity was shown to be differentially affected in male versus female flies based on their mtDNA haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sackton et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, almost 90% of the transcriptome in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is differentially expressed between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayroles et al., 2009</xref>). Amongst those differentially expressed genes, male-biased transcripts are enriched for mitochondrial energy metabolism, thus providing ample opportunities for sex-specific effects of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayroles et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with the nuclear background exerting an effect on the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutants, we found that the COII<sup>G177S </sup>-mediated sterility was suppressed in many of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nuclear backgrounds tested. Thus, our study not only shows the existence and biological basis of a male-harming mutation, but also demonstrates importance of the intimate relationship between nuclear and mtDNA genomes for the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.</p><p>Our finding that the phenotypic consequences of a specific male-harming mtDNA mutation are dependent on the nuclear genome also re-emphasizes the exciting possibility of uncovering the genetic basis of nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities and the molecular basis of buffering by nuclear genomes. Such buffering provides an important insight into the genetic basis of human mtDNA disease in which male-harming mtDNA mutations might initially increase in frequency in a 'suppressor' background while avoiding any negative fitness consequences. The phenotypic consequences of male-harming mtDNA mutations would only be exposed in a naïve nuclear genetic background upon introduction into new populations or even (in the laboratory setting) new species. Such nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities have been proposed to potentially serve as the basis of speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton and Barreto, 2012</xref>). Although only a few such nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities have been mapped in molecular detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ellison and Burton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meiklejohn et al., 2013</xref>), studies in which mtDNA swaps were made within and between species have revealed that many such incompatibilities exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">James and Ballard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sackton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ellison and Burton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montooth et al., 2010</xref>). Future genetic mapping experiments will help identify the nature and mechanism of nuclear suppression of COII<sup>G177S</sup> and reveal whether they are specific or general suppressors of COII<sup>G177S</sup> and other male-harming mtDNA mutations. Strategies such as the one we have outlined here, together with new advances in manipulating mtDNA genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), provide an exciting means to uncover the dark side of one of the most ancient symbioses on the planet.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> maintenance and strains</title><p>All <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains were maintained on standard molasses-cornmeal medium at 25°C.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Experimental evolution uncovers a male-harming mitochondrial mutation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing Editor and two peer reviewers and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the reviewers' comments below, one of the primary concerns was that your claim of establishing a novel experimental evolution scheme to isolate male-harming mitochondrial DNA mutations is not supported by data. Without more compelling evidence for this scheme, the current manuscript is not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition, the link between the genotype of the missense mitochondrial mutation (COII<sup>G177S</sup>) and phenotype described is complicated by the fact that the phenotype requires high temperature. Finally, in light of these concerns, the effect of nuclear modifiers was of great interest, but it would require further development, such as identification and characterization, to elevate the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>One major concern is the claim that the experimental model was &quot;successful&quot; in isolating the male-specific phenotype. As the allele already existed in the parental stock, it may simple be that the authors were able to – by chance alone – fix the allele in 1-in-18 lines, and not due to the breeding scheme. Some added detail as to the state of the allele in the other lines would help us to determine if the breeding scheme can actually be said to be successful in driving the emergence of this phenotype, or if the experiment was simply very lucky to catch this one allele. Some additional arguments in support of their method would be very helpful.</p><p>The allele in question appears to have been present in the parental stock, and was isolated to homoplasmy in 1 of the 18 experimental lines. Is it possible for the authors to test the dynamics of the heteroplasmic transmission in the other 17 lines? While the authors are unable to detect any defects aside from the male fertility, if the transmission of the allele is consistent with neutral drift, the authors would clearly demonstrate that the allele had no fitness effects until fixed in the population and would very strongly support the claim of a specific phenotype. However, evidence of negative selection would show the some difficult-to-detect deficiency in the flies with the allele, and a positive selection signal would set up an interesting scenario of the allele being beneficial to the population, but detrimental to male fertility when fixed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an important issue in biology and describes a potentially interesting male semi-sterile mutation. The reported results can be divided into three areas. In the first, the manuscript describes a strategy described as &quot;a novel experimental evolution scheme in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to recover male-harming mutations&quot;. In the second, the phenotype of the temperature-enhanced sterility of the one mutation recovered is characterized. In the third, modification of the sterility affects by nuclear background is described. As discussed below, I found that the first part to harbor significant potential interest, but felt that the paper did not support the efficacy of the practice that it advocated. Nonetheless, they retrieved a male harming mutant, and second part of the manuscript describes its characterization. While this is an interesting mutant that fits the bill of a male harming mutant, I was somewhat uncertain about the value of the details of the phenotypic characterization. It seemed to me the details of the phenotype are likely to depend on the use of a high temperature to increase the expressivity of the defect. The analysis of enhancers in the third part of the paper is of great interest, but it was not advanced to level that gives us any insight into the nature of the interactions. In this regard, I was again concerned about the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype. No attempt was made to disambiguate the influence of genetic background effects on the temperature range of fertility from a specific effect on the mutation, leaving a nagging suspicion that the effect of the nuclear background might not be very specific.</p><p>The strategy that was presented as a method to allow accumulation of male-harming mutations without hypothetical secondary counter selection due to male sterility was to simply out cross the females to an independent population of males. There are several issues with the claimed importance of this strategy and questions regarding its effectiveness that the manuscript fails to address.</p><p>One tangential, but in my mind important, consideration is that outcrossing may be an experimental condition in the laboratory but it is standard in the wild. If the rationale were correct, the inbreeding of confined laboratory stocks should be protecting them from the emergence of male harming mutants. In this regard, it would be interesting to compare the frequency of male harming mtDNA mutations in well-mixed wild populations, to the frequency in the confined breeding populations of laboratory flies. According to the rationale, one might expect a substantial frequency of male harming mutants in wild populations that then fail when established as more inbred laboratory stocks.</p><p>But the most important question is whether the paper shows that the strategy was effective. I was not convinced that it did. The only recovered mutation was in the starting population at a very high level. The paper suggests in its wording that this was a fleeting thing caught by the breeding strategy: e.g. It is suggested that &quot;the mutant allele likely arose de novo in the original stock and transiently existed in a state of heteroplasmy before approaching homoplasmy in EL7&quot;, and &quot;we devised an experimental evolution scheme to absolve mtDNA of supporting male function while both maintaining selection on female mtDNA function as well as reducing the possibility of nuclear suppression or male-harming mtDNA. Our scheme uncovered a COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation[…]&quot;. The idea of fleeting mutation present in the original stock that was captured by the &quot;experimental evolution scheme&quot; might support the idea that it was effective. However, it seems very unlikely that the mutation was fleeting and there is no evidence that the scheme was needed to capture it. Even rare changes can go to fixation in small populations and one out six assayed flies in the starting population was homoplasmic for the mutation. Over 35 generations (plus an unspecified number of generations of additional crosses in which the flies were allowed to self) drift will lead to dramatic fluctuations in the abundance of the homoplasmic line and to random fixation. Fixation of an already abundant mutation in one of 18 lines is no surprise and there is no foundation for a conclusion that this possibility was enhanced by the &quot;experimental evolution scheme&quot;.</p><p>The only data mentioned to support the idea that the mutation was present transiently in the original stock were not shown and the quoted finding does not seem directly relevant: &quot;heteroplasmic flies were eventually lost over the course of a year from the original stock after their initial detection; later analyses revealed the population now only consists of individuals carrying homoplasmic wildtype or mutant mtDNA.&quot; The loss of the heteroplasmic flies is only indirectly relevant. Since the mutant persisted in the population as homoplasmic flies there is no indication that its presence was transient. Additionally, based on Solignac's (1984) detailed description of the gradual and statistical segregation of mtDNA genotypes one can make inferences about the behavior of a mutation in a stock – whether it is drifting randomly or is affected by selection. The only data shown regarding the distribution of heteroplasmy was an analysis of six flies of the original population. This is woefully inadequate for any detailed consideration of levels of heteroplasmy. A more thorough analysis might have revealed whether there was any constraint limiting the propagation of the mutant allele in the original stock, since such constraints, by selecting for different progeny classes, will alter the unbiased statistical changes in the distribution of heteroplasmy levels. Demonstration that a constraint existed would provide some foundation for the proposal that the &quot;experimental evolutionary scheme&quot; would have consequence-relief of this constraint. The crosses presented in this manuscript could have simply provided opportunity for random drift to fix an abundant pre-existing mutation. To make the claims regarding the &quot;experimental evolutionary scheme&quot;, the manuscript would have to dismiss this null hypothesis and demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. At present, the appearance of one line out 12 with a mutant in the experimental sample and none in the 6 control lines is far from enough to argue that the outcrossing was essential to the recovery of the mutation.</p><p>The “experimental evolutionary scheme&quot; was designed to bypass the influence of indirect counter selection due to reduced fertility of the males: but to what extent does such a selection influence outcome? It appears that the heteroplasmic male flies are fertile (not tested, but failure to see fertility depression in lines with high levels of mutant genomes suggest that mutant genomes can be carried without a phenotype) and hence that no such counter selection would operate early after the appearance of the mutant allele (when it is rare and heteroplasmic). The persistence of mutant flies (perhaps heteroplasmic, but untested) in three of the six coevolving/control lines suggests the absence of a significant counter selection preventing their maintenance. Consequently, male sterility could only come into play, if at all, very late after the mutation rose to be a dominant allele with frequent production of homoplasmic derivatives, and since the male sterility phenotype is weak at the temperatures used for propagation, it would not be surprising that secondary selection due to male fertility could prevent fixation of the mutant. Furthermore, since the scheme did not use unrelated males for outcrosses but used males from the starting population, which apparently harbored the mutant for many generations (many generations are essential to produce homoplasmic flies), these males might already have carried suppressors of the phenotype. Thus, I do not think that manuscript offers support for claim that an effective scheme for recovery of male-harming mutations is described. I would like to see direct evidence that it is effective and efficient.</p><p>The second component of the manuscript, the description of the phenotype of the male sterile mutation is detailed but I was not impressed that it gave us much insight into the defects and their connection to the mutation. One obfuscating issue is the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype of an otherwise weak expressivity of the mitochondrial mutation. The highest temperature at which flies can be cultivated is generally limited by male sterility (e.g. David JR et al., 2005). For laboratory stocks, this highest temperature is usually taken as 29°C but populations tend to show differences in the temperature range across which they will grow-perhaps not surprisingly as environmental variables and adaptation would select for different ranges. At the temperature limit, defects in sperm development are usually seen as responsible for sterility (e.g. Rohmer C, et al., 2004). Interactions between nucleus, mitochondria and temperature have been described as affecting male sterility (Hoekstra et al., 2013). The manuscript shows an interaction of temperature and the mitochondrial mutation, but the study of the phenotype leaves an uncertainty whether the phenotype described is primarily that of the mutant or that produced at high temperature. That is, one might imagine that the mutation might sensitize the flies so that the high temperature defect shows up at 29°C, or one can imagine that 29°C increases the expressivity of the mutant phenotype, or something in between. In this regard, it would be nice to know if the sterile phenotype of <italic>w1118</italic> wild type flies when raised at temperatures beyond 29°C, resembles or is distinct from the phenotype as seen in the mutant at 29°C.</p><p>The analysis of nuclear interactions is potentially exciting, but the reported analysis represents a first step. The loci responsible are not mapped or otherwise identified. Sequenced strains are analyzed but no mention is made of any finding emanating from this. I worry that modification might be the result of modification of temperature sensitivity. The things underlying this concern are that the maximal temperature of male fertility commonly vary between strains, genetic backgrounds that modified the reported phenotype are remarkably common, and the data shown for 29°C in the supplement of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows that <italic>w1118</italic> is unusually weak even at the temperature selected as widely permissive. If the temperature is raised to say 31°C, the wild type <italic>w1118</italic> stock is likely to be male sterile: I would like to know whether temperature tolerance is increased (i.e. this male sterility expected for the wild-type <italic>w1118</italic> strain is suppressed) by out crossing of the wild type to the same strains that suppressed the mutant. This control might reveal that the recorded affects are due to expected widespread differences in thermo-tolerance. This concern that the modification may be due to a more generic affect is partly alleviated by the reported increase in Cox activity in suppressed mutant backgrounds.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A mitochondrial DNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase specifically impairs male fertility in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their final submission the authors should address better previous criticism influenced by the fact the supposed approach to isolate male harming mutants was the most innovative part of the original submission. The new version is hence weaker, but still a nice report and should be published at <italic>eLife</italic>. Of two previous criticisms, the bigger one is that the data are not sufficient to document homoplasmy. While this could be serious flaw, it is very likely that the line is close to homogeneous and if it were not and the authors sampled flies that were heteroplastic in their tests of fertility they would have seen phenotypic variation. If the authors answer in this way, and put more guarded statements in their discussion, we would be satisfied on this account. The are other issues, on the phenotypic analysis which are more about making things more clear, particularly aspects that are buried in the supplementary data. Eliminating some unfounded discussion will bring more sharpness, but this is something that the authors are best placed to address. These are detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The presentation of the data has been changed substantially, while the data remain much the same. The change in the presentation has resolved one of the central concerns about the previous version of the manuscript that presented a crossing scheme as an effective selection for male harming mutations. The critiques, certainly mine, argued that this was not supported by the data and that the mitochondrial mutation preexisted and was uncovered by chance. The present draft still argues that this scheme should be effective, which I severely doubt based on pragmatics of mutation frequency and infrequent segregation of homoplasmic lines. I think that the unsubstantiated sentence in the current version saying that &quot;we reasoned that multiple mutations per mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across 18 lines&quot; should be eliminated or justified.This is completely untenable as shown by the mathematical analysis of the number of generations required for lines to progress to homoplasmy (See Solignac). Nonetheless, the major change in presentation has corrected the biggest problem with the previous submission.</p><p>The question now is, what is the merit of the present manuscript. The authors do report a maternally inherited partial male sterility trait that is linked with an SNP mt:CoII. The recognized SNP may well be the cause of the phenotype, but the possibility of linked changes in the unsequenced 4kb regulatory region was not eliminated (note that this is the region that changes the most rapidly and spontaneous variants of this region have been shown to arise in laboratory stocks – see Rand). Furthermore, identification of a mitochondrial DNA mutation altering an electron transport component that causes male sterility is not entirely novel (see Xu). The manuscript does report a fairly detailed effort to characterize the defect and shows suppression of this defect in crosses that introduce different nuclear backgrounds. In this regard, it goes beyond other reports that argued for nuclear modification of phenotypes caused by mitochondrial mutations. In our opinion these findings are of interest and could constitute a significant advance. We are however, left with some hesitancy because the merit ought to lie in the rigor in of the documentation of the principles, and we see some shortcomings.</p><p>One concern is that the data are not sufficient to rigorously demonstrate the genetic homogeneity of the lines examined. The details are below, but this view can be summarized as follows: the original plan treated the crosses as if they were a selection that would yield a pure male harming mutation, and suitable measures where not take to ensure the genetic homogeneity of the stock that was retrieved. Given the number of mt genomes carried by flies, a high sensitivity of detection of a rare allele (in a range approaching 0.1%) and analysis of single flies is needed to rigorously demonstrate homoplasmy.</p><p>A second issue concerns data on fertility demonstrating that in an early first mating the males exhibited no (at 25°C) or weak (29°C) deficits in fertility. At least in reading the text, the subsequent analyses did not seem to take this fully into account. Many of my concerns here could be dealt with by better reference to supplementary material and more careful wording.

While we obtained the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation via our experimental evolution scheme, our subsequent experiments were able to determine that this was a pre-existing heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation that manifested its male infertility only upon fixation in one of the experimental lines (el7). For the purposes of the current manuscript, we now describe the experimental evolution scheme simply to detail how we found a specifically male-harming mtDNA mutation. We also acknowledge that this mutation might have been obtainable without the scheme with a priori knowledge of the heteroplasmy (which we did not have), and that significantly more work is needed to determine whether the scheme will be effective. We have accordingly significantly edited our manuscript, including changing the title.</p><p><italic>In addition, the link between the genotype of the missense mitochondrial mutation (COII<sup>G177S</sup>) and phenotype described is complicated by the fact that the phenotype requires high temperature.</italic> </p><p>One of the reviewers raised the concern that the male fertility defects caused by the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation might be confounded by the use of high temperature. We performed mutant characterization in the original submission at high temperature because the fertility phenotype is more pronounced in young males at high temperature. However, we agree with the reviewer concerns and have now performed additional experiments to address these points. We also showed in the original submission that the fertility phenotype is also present at 25°C but it manifests in older males. We now show that the cellular phenotype of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation is similar in older males at 25°C to the phenotype in young males at 29°C. We further show that sterility of young males at 29°C is suppressed by a nuclear background (OregonR) in a manner similar to the suppression of old males at 25°C. Thus, we feel that we have completely addressed with our new experiments the reviewer concerns that our sterility phenotype and its suppression are confounded by a requirement of high temperature. It bears reiterating that we performed many life-history trait measurements at both 25°C and 29°C; male fertility was the only phenotype affected suggesting that the sterility defect associated with COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA is highly specific.</p><p><italic>Finally, in light of these concerns, the effect of nuclear modifiers was of great interest, but it would require further development, such as identification and characterization, to elevate the manuscript.</italic></p><p>There are two points to be made here. First, the abundance of nuclear suppressor(s) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> directly bears out the predictions of the theory of mito-nuclear genetic conflict and reinforces our finding that COII<sup>G177S</sup> is a male-harming mtDNA mutation.. Second, we would love to know the genetic identity of the suppressor. But the reviewer is doubtless aware that this is a significant endeavor involving at least a few years of work. The best demonstration of this suppressor mapping was a recent paper (Meikeljohn et al. PLOS Genetics 2013), which found a nuclear-encoded tRNA synthetase that epistatically interacts with and suppresses a mitochondrial tRNA mutation. This work appeared three years after the original observation of the incompatibility (Montooth et al. Evolution 2010). Furthermore, the identity of this suppressor mutation was suggested by the very nature of the mtDNA mutation in a tRNA gene. Our preliminary experiments and the fact that we see both partial and completely restoration of fertility suggest that the suppression involves multiple genetic loci, whose identification will require 2-3 years of additional work. We intend to aggressively pursue this, but we feel that lack of this identification does not affect the novelty or importance of our findings in the current study.</p><p><italic>Isolation of a bona fide male-harming mtDNA mutation</italic></p><p>Although this is not a point explicitly mentioned by the editor, we would like to reinforce our claim that the identification of a specifically male-harming mtDNA mutation is novel and to our knowledge unprecedented in animals. The closest that any studies have come to characterization of ‘male-harming’ mtDNA variants are the elegant series of experiments performed by the group of Damian Dowling, who showed that mtDNA haplotypes from different <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains affect aging in males but not females (Camus et al. 2012 Current Biology), and competitive male fertility (Yee et al. 2013 Current Biology). These studies did not comprehensively test the role of all mtDNA haplotypes on female fitness. Just to highlight the novelty of our finding, while our paper was under review at <italic>eLife</italic>, one mtDNA haplotype that was previously shown to deleteriously affect competitive male fertility was also shown to decrease female lifespan (Camus et al., 2015 Current Biology); such a mutation could not be considered specifically ‘male-harming’. In contrast, our work examined the impact of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation on both males and females in the context of fertility, lifespan, neurological function, and stress resistance, each at normal and elevated temperatures, and in young and old individuals. Hence, we can conclude with significantly greater confidence than any other study published so far that a single mtDNA variant in metazoans can be specifically detrimental to males but neutral in females. We believe that this comprehensive characterization of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation is the most novel and impactful finding of our manuscript. We have now revised our manuscript to emphasize this point.</p><p>We hope the reviewers will agree that the revised manuscript addresses all of their concerns, most of which arise from our initial claim regarding the ‘success’ of the experimental evolution strategy. We further hope the reviewers will agree that our demonstration of COII<sup>G177S</sup> as a specifically male-harming mtDNA mutation in animals is highly significant and impactful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>One major concern is the claim that the experimental model was &quot;successful&quot; in isolating the male-specific phenotype. As the allele already existed in the parental stock, it may simple be that the authors were able to – by chance alone – fix the allele in 1-in-18 lines, and not due to the breeding scheme. Some added detail as to the state of the allele in the other lines would help us to determine if the breeding scheme can actually be said to be successful in driving the emergence of this phenotype, or if the experiment was simply very lucky to catch this one allele. Some additional arguments in support of their method would be very helpful.</italic></p><p>As discussed earlier, we agree with the reviewer. We now acknowledge that although we obtained the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation via the experimental evolution scheme, it may have been possible to fix this allele to homoplasmy without our breeding scheme. We have significantly revised the beginning of the manuscript to reflect this acknowledgement, and to emphasize our recovery of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation, which appears to be specifically detrimental to males and is the most significant finding of our work.</p><p><italic>The allele in question appears to have been present in the parental stock, and was isolated to homoplasmy in 1 of the 18 experimental lines. Is it possible for the authors to test the dynamics of the heteroplasmic transmission in the other 17 lines? While the authors are unable to detect any defects aside from the male fertility, if the transmission of the allele is consistent with neutral drift, the authors would clearly demonstrate that the allele had no fitness effects until fixed in the population and would very strongly support the claim of a specific phenotype. However, evidence of negative selection would show the some difficult-to-detect deficiency in the flies with the allele, and a positive selection signal would set up an interesting scenario of the allele being beneficial to the population, but detrimental to male fertility when fixed.</italic></p><p>We do not have longitudinal data from all our experimental and coevolved lines, but the data we do have suggests that the fixation of the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation did not occur until at least 25 generations through our experiment. Since our experimental lines would be expected to be homogeneous at the nuclear level given our backcrossing scheme, our findings that the viability and fertility of the EL lines (except EL7) are like wildtype despite being highly variable for the COII<sup>G177S</sup> heteroplasmic mutation lead us to favor the conclusion that the mutation is neutral, not beneficial, to the population, but is detrimental to male fertility on homoplasmy.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>This manuscript addresses an important issue in biology and describes a potentially interesting male semi-sterile mutation. The reported results can be divided into three areas. In the first, the manuscript describes a strategy described as &quot;a novel experimental evolution scheme in Drosophila melanogaster to recover male-harming mutations&quot;. In the second, the phenotype of the temperature-enhanced sterility of the one mutation recovered is characterized. In the third, modification of the sterility affects by nuclear background is described. As discussed below, I found that the first part to harbor significant potential interest, but felt that the paper did not support the efficacy of the practice that it advocated. Nonetheless, they retrieved a male harming mutant, and second part of the manuscript describes its characterization. While this is an interesting mutant that fits the bill of a male harming mutant, I was somewhat uncertain about the value of the details of the phenotypic characterization. It seemed to me the details of the phenotype are likely to depend on the use of a high temperature to increase the expressivity of the defect. The analysis of enhancers in the third part of the paper is of great interest, but it was not advanced to level that gives us any insight into the nature of the interactions. In this regard, I was again concerned about the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype. No attempt was made to disambiguate the influence of genetic background effects on the temperature range of fertility from a specific effect on the mutation, leaving a nagging suspicion that the effect of the nuclear background might not be very specific.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The strategy that was presented as a method to allow accumulation of male-harming mutations without hypothetical secondary counter selection due to male sterility was to simply out cross the females to an independent population of males. There are several issues with the claimed importance of this strategy and questions regarding its effectiveness that the manuscript fails to address.</italic> </p><p> <italic>One tangential, but in my mind important, consideration is that outcrossing may be an experimental condition in the laboratory but it is standard in the wild. If the rationale were correct, the inbreeding of confined laboratory stocks should be protecting them from the emergence of male harming mutants. In this regard, it would be interesting to compare the frequency of male harming mtDNA mutations in well-mixed wild populations, to the frequency in the confined breeding populations of laboratory flies. According to the rationale, one might expect a substantial frequency of male harming mutants in wild populations that then fail when established as more inbred laboratory stocks.</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting suggestion and indeed, the main topic of a paper (Wade &amp; Brandvain 2008 <italic>Evolution</italic>) that predicts exactly what the reviewer suggests – i.e. inbreeding selects against male-harming mtDNA mutations due to indirect selection. Indeed, this theoretical claim served as the rationale for our experimental evolution strategy. We took the predictions from this theoretical study and used it to motivate our scheme to isolate male-harming mtDNA mutations. The reviewer makes an interesting suggestion that we plan to follow up on by making use of the DGRP collection in the future. However, that work would be a significant undertaking that is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p> <italic>But the most important question is whether the paper shows that the strategy was effective. I was not convinced that it did. The only recovered mutation was in the starting population at a very high level. The paper suggests in its wording that this was a fleeting thing caught by the breeding strategy: e.g. It is suggested that &quot;the mutant allele likely arose</italic> de novo <italic>in the original stock and transiently existed in a state of heteroplasmy before approaching homoplasmy in EL7&quot;, and &quot;we devised an experimental evolution scheme to absolve mtDNA of supporting male function while both maintaining selection on female mtDNA function as well as reducing the possibility of nuclear suppression or male-harming mtDNA. Our scheme uncovered a COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation[…]&quot;. The idea of fleeting mutation present in the original stock that was captured by the &quot;experimental evolution scheme&quot; might support the idea that it was effective. However, it seems very unlikely that the mutation was fleeting and there is no evidence that the scheme was needed to capture it. Even rare changes can go to fixation in small populations and one out six assayed flies in the starting population was homoplasmic for the mutation. Over 35 generations (plus an unspecified number of generations of additional crosses in which the flies were allowed to self) drift will lead to dramatic fluctuations in the abundance of the homoplasmic line and to random fixation. Fixation of an already abundant mutation in one of 18 lines is no surprise and there is no foundation for a conclusion that this possibility was enhanced by the &quot;experimental evolution scheme&quot;.</italic> </p><p>As we have responded to (points 1 and 5 above), we agree with the reviewer’s concern. We have significantly revised the manuscript to remove any reference to the ‘success’ of our experimental evolution strategy but simply to state that this is how we obtained the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation. We remain confident that the mutation we did obtain is specifically male-harming and therefore its characterization important and, to our knowledge, unprecedented. As the reviewers point out, the effectiveness of the experimental evolution approach has yet to be rigorously tested. A full proof-of-principal test of the strategy will be the focus of future work.</p><p><italic>The only data mentioned to support the idea that the mutation was present transiently in the original stock were not shown and the quoted finding does not seem directly relevant: &quot;heteroplasmic flies were eventually lost over the course of a year from the original stock after their initial detection; later analyses revealed the population now only consists of individuals carrying homoplasmic wildtype or mutant mtDNA.&quot; The loss of the heteroplasmic flies is only indirectly relevant. Since the mutant persisted in the population as homoplasmic flies there is no indication that its presence was transient. Additionally, based on Solignac's (1984) detailed description of the gradual and statistical segregation of mtDNA genotypes one can make inferences about the behavior of a mutation in a stock – whether it is drifting randomly or is affected by selection. The only data shown regarding the distribution of heteroplasmy was an analysis of six flies of the original population. This is woefully inadequate for any detailed consideration of levels of heteroplasmy. A more thorough analysis might have revealed whether there was any constraint limiting the propagation of the mutant allele in the original stock, since such constraints, by selecting for different progeny classes, will alter the unbiased statistical changes in the distribution of heteroplasmy levels. Demonstration that a constraint existed would provide some foundation for the proposal that the &quot;experimental evolutionary scheme&quot; would have consequence-relief of this constraint. The crosses presented in this manuscript could have simply provided opportunity for random drift to fix an abundant pre-existing mutation. To make the claims regarding the &quot;experimental evolutionary scheme&quot;, the manuscript would have to dismiss this null hypothesis and demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. At present, the appearance of one line out 12 with a mutant in the experimental sample and none in the 6 control lines is far from enough to argue that the outcrossing was essential to the recovery of the mutation.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct in their argument that knowing the status of the heteroplasmy in the stock would have been important at the onset of the experiment. The best we can do is infer the heteroplasmy status in the stock at a time when we were evaluating and discovering the focal mtDNA mutation. We would be quite happy to characterize additional flies from the ancestral stock except that recognizing that this characterization is occurring &gt;50 generations after the beginning of our experiment, the main point we wished to emphasize is that there was heteroplasmy in the original stock. We hope elimination of sentences regarding the transient nature of the heteroplasmy will minimize any confusion and avoid us overstating that we understand the dynamics of this particular mutation. While we agree that following the dynamics of this heteroplasmy would be very interesting, and would help bolster our claim of a “constraint-release” afforded by the experimental evolution scheme, such detailed characterization is beyond the scope of our paper. Even such a conclusion would be limited by the fact that the mutation became fixed in only 1 out of 12 experimental lines. Instead, we focus the bulk of the manuscript on what makes the mutation specifically male-harming.</p><p> <italic>The “experimental evolutionary scheme&quot; was designed to bypass the influence of indirect counter selection due to reduced fertility of the males: but to what extent does such a selection influence outcome? It appears that the heteroplasmic male flies are fertile (not tested, but failure to see fertility depression in lines with high levels of mutant genomes suggest that mutant genomes can be carried without a phenotype) and hence that no such counter selection would operate early after the appearance of the mutant allele (when it is rare and heteroplasmic). The persistence of mutant flies (perhaps heteroplasmic, but untested) in three of the six coevolving/control lines suggests the absence of a significant counter selection preventing their maintenance. Consequently, male sterility could only come into play, if at all, very late after the mutation rose to be a dominant allele with frequent production of homoplasmic derivatives, and since the male sterility phenotype is weak at the temperatures used for propagation, it would not be surprising that secondary selection due to male fertility could prevent fixation of the mutant. Furthermore, since the scheme did not use unrelated males for outcrosses but used males from the starting population, which apparently harbored the mutant for many generations (many generations are essential to produce homoplasmic flies), these males might already have carried suppressors of the phenotype. Thus, I do not think that manuscript offers support for claim that an effective scheme for recovery of male-harming mutations is described. I would like to see direct evidence that it is effective and efficient.</italic></p><p>The reviewer makes several good points here, which we address on-by-one. First, we can conclude with significant confidence that there are no suppressors of the sterility phenotype in the ancestral stock used to backcross. This is the same stock we did all our experiments to characterize the infertility and any suppressors would have been immediately evident. This is in spite of the fact that the mutation was present in this stock.</p><p>Second, the reviewer is doubtless aware that the presence of a cytoplasmically inherited male-harming mtDNA mutation would still be tolerated in the presence of the wildtype allele since only indirect selection acts on the mutant mtDNA. Nevertheless, we completely agree with the reviewer that the scheme we have proposed cannot be deemed essential for obtaining the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation. We also agree with the reviewer that our findings show that the phenotype of COII<sup>G177S</sup> only manifests when present at high levels of heteroplasmy, and that such penetrance issues will affect the detailed design of any experimental evolution strategy. To address the reviewer concerns, we have greatly de-emphasized the significance of the experimental evolution strategy and instead focus on the significance of finding and characterizing a male-harming mtDNA mutation.</p><p><italic>The second component of the manuscript, the description of the phenotype of the male sterile mutation is detailed but I was not impressed that it gave us much insight into the defects and their connection to the mutation. One obfuscating issue is the use of high temperature to enhance the phenotype of an otherwise weak expressivity of the mitochondrial mutation. The highest temperature at which flies can be cultivated is generally limited by male sterility (e.g. David JR et al., 2005). For laboratory stocks, this highest temperature is usually taken as 29°C but populations tend to show differences in the temperature range across which they will grow-perhaps not surprisingly as environmental variables and adaptation would select for different ranges. At the temperature limit, defects in sperm development are usually seen as responsible for sterility (e.g. Rohmer C, et al., 2004). Interactions between nucleus, mitochondria and temperature have been described as affecting male sterility (Hoekstra et al., 2013). The manuscript shows an interaction of temperature and the mitochondrial mutation, but the study of the phenotype leaves an uncertainty whether the phenotype described is primarily that of the mutant or that produced at high temperature. That is, one might imagine that the mutation might sensitize the flies so that the high temperature defect shows up at 29°C, or one can imagine that 29°C increases the expressivity of the mutant phenotype, or something in between. In this regard, it would be nice to know if the sterile phenotype of w1118 wild type flies when raised at temperatures beyond 29°C, resembles or is distinct from the phenotype as seen in the mutant at 29°C.</italic></p><p>We take advantage of the fact that the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation affects male fertility in both age- and temperature- dependent fashion. We now show that the age-dependent infertility (performed at 25°C) is exactly what we would predict using additional cytological analysis of seminal vesicles, which we have shown is an accurate surrogate for male fertility. We find that the seminal vesicle size of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant males is reduced compared to those with wildtype mtDNA, similar to what we found with young males raised at 29°C. Moreover, while <italic>w1118</italic> males with wildtype mtDNA also show impairment at 29°C, their seminal vesicle sizes are not significantly reduced. Our additional experiments show that the infertility defect cannot be solely explained as a confounding factor with temperature, and that the temperature-dependent reduction of fertility in wildtype <italic>w1118</italic> males is distinct from COII<sup>G177S</sup>-dependent defect at 29°C. We hope that our additional experiments should satisfy the reviewer’s concerns regarding this criticism. Moreover, we must emphasize again that this is, to the best of our knowledge, the most detailed characterization of the phenotypic consequences of multiple life-history traits (aging, fertility, neural function) in young and old males and females, at two different temperatures.</p><p><italic>The analysis of nuclear interactions is potentially exciting, but the reported analysis represents a first step. The loci responsible are not mapped or otherwise identified. Sequenced strains are analyzed but no mention is made of any finding emanating from this. I worry that modification might be the result of modification of temperature sensitivity. The things underlying this concern are that the maximal temperature of male fertility commonly vary between strains, genetic backgrounds that modified the reported phenotype are remarkably common, and the data shown for 29°C in the supplement of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows that w1118 is unusually weak even at the temperature selected as widely permissive. If the temperature is raised to say 31°C, the wild type w1118 stock is likely to be male sterile: I would like to know whether temperature tolerance is increased (i.e. this male sterility expected for the wild-type w1118 strain is suppressed) by out crossing of the wild type to the same strains that suppressed the mutant. This control might reveal that the recorded affects are due to expected widespread differences in thermo-tolerance. This concern that the modification may be due to a more generic affect is partly alleviated by the reported increase in Cox activity in suppressed mutant backgrounds.</italic> </p><p>The main conclusion we wish to draw from the nuclear suppressor findings is that there is a significant nuclear genetic variation to suppress the male-harming effects of mtDNA mutations like COII<sup>G177S</sup>. We seriously considered the reviewer’s criticism that this could also be a pleiotropic effect due to the high temperatures we used to fully manifest the male infertility. Once again, using aged males, we show that the heterozygous OregonR nuclear background completely rescues (old) male fertility defects at 25°C that are caused by the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutation and that this fertility rescue is associated with suppression of the decrease in seminal vesicle size. Together with our earlier presented data, our findings strongly suggest that the OregonR nuclear genome harbors a ‘true’ suppressor of the COII<sup>G177s</sup>-dependent male fertility defect and its mechanism of suppression is likely the same at 25°C and 29°C. We hope that our revised manuscript emphasizing our detailed characterization of how a hypomorphic mtDNA mutation can cause male-specific impairment will be viewed favorably by the reviewer. While we share the reviewer’s excitement about the potential mapping of these nuclear suppressors, we point out that this is not a trivial undertaking. The first author hopes to identify and characterize the nuclear suppressor mutation(s) in a future study which will take at least a few more years.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>In their final submission the authors should address better previous criticism influenced by the fact the supposed approach to isolate male harming mutants was the most innovative part of the original submission. The new version is hence weaker, but still a nice report and should be published at eLife. Of two previous criticisms, the bigger one is that the data are not sufficient to document homoplasmy. While this could be serious flaw, it is very likely that the line is close to homogeneous and if it were not and the authors sampled flies that were heteroplastic in their tests of fertility they would have seen phenotypic variation. If the authors answer in this way, and put more guarded statements in their discussion, we would be satisfied on this account. The are other issues, on the phenotypic analysis which are more about making things more clear, particularly aspects that are buried in the supplementary data. Eliminating some unfounded discussion will bring more sharpness, but this is something that the authors are best placed to address. These are detailed below.</italic></p><p>With new experiments (detailed below), we now show that the strains we analyzed are near homoplasmy (100% or 99.9%). We also address the other concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The presentation of the data has been changed substantially, while the data remain much the same. The change in the presentation has resolved one of the central concerns about the previous version of the manuscript that presented a crossing scheme as an effective selection for male harming mutations. The critiques, certainly mine, argued that this was not supported by the data and that the mitochondrial mutation preexisted and was uncovered by chance. The present draft still argues that this scheme should be effective, which I severely doubt based on pragmatics of mutation frequency and infrequent segregation of homoplasmic lines. I think that the unsubstantiated sentence in the current version saying that &quot;we reasoned that multiple mutations per mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across 18 lines&quot; should be eliminated or justified.This is completely untenable as shown by the mathematical analysis of the number of generations required for lines to progress to homoplasmy (See Solignac). Nonetheless, the major change in presentation has corrected the biggest problem with the previous submission.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers express concern over our statement that multiple mtDNA mutations might be sampled over 35 generations across 18 lines. Note that we intentionally used the word ‘sampled’ to distinguish mutations that arise versus those that arise and drive to homoplasmy. In addition, while mtDNA segregation can take many generations to reach homoplasmy, dramatic instances of rapid shifts in heteroplasmy have also been observed in humans, cows, and flies (Brown et al., 2001; Hauswirth &amp; Laipis, 1982; Olivo et al., 1983; Matsuura et al., 1990; Matsuura et al., 1991; Koehler et al., 1991; Jenuth et al., 1996; Matsuura et al., 1997; Sato et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012; Freyer et al., 2012; Sharpley et al., 2012; Ma, Xu &amp; O’Farrell, 2014; Ma &amp; O’Farrell, 2015; Ma &amp; O’Farrell, 2016). Nevertheless, to avoid any ambiguity, we now state that this period may not be necessary to drive mtDNA mutations to near homoplasmy and now cite the Solignac reference (Solignac et al. Genetics 1987).</p><p><italic>The question now is, what is the merit of the present manuscript. The authors do report a maternally inherited partial male sterility trait that is linked with an SNP mt:CoII. The recognized SNP may well be the cause of the phenotype, but the possibility of linked changes in the unsequenced 4kb regulatory region was not eliminated (note that this is the region that changes the most rapidly and spontaneous variants of this region have been shown to arise in laboratory stocks – see Rand). Furthermore, identification of a mitochondrial DNA mutation altering an electron transport component that causes male sterility is not entirely novel (see Xu). The manuscript does report a fairly detailed effort to characterize the defect and shows suppression of this defect in crosses that introduce different nuclear backgrounds. In this regard, it goes beyond other reports that argued for nuclear modification of phenotypes caused by mitochondrial mutations. In our opinion these findings are of interest and could constitute a significant advance. We are however, left with some hesitancy because the merit ought to lie in the rigor in of the documentation of the principles, and we see some shortcomings.</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises two points. First, there is a possibility of linked changes in the unsequenced 4 kb regulatory region- the so-called D loop. We now explicitly suggest this possibility in the Discussion. However, we would like to point out that the causal connection with the COII<sup>G177S</sup> mtDNA mutation is quite strong. We have observed a biochemical defect in cytochrome C oxidase activity that correlates perfectly with the male infertility phenotype. This COX activity is rescued in the suppressor background – these data strongly suggest that the G177S mutation causes the COX defect, which in turn causes the fertility defect. This is as strong a statement that can be made with a causal connection with a single mtDNA mutation, the exception being the Xu et al. paper that used a restriction enzyme strategy to introduce mtDNA mutations. In all other cases that have mapped a phenotype to a single mutation in mtDNA they did not assay or sequence the A+T region (Camus et al. 2015, Meiklejohn et al. 2013, Clancy et al., 2011, Xu et al. 2008, and Clancy 2008).</p><p>Second, the reviewer is correct that the <italic>mt:CoI<sup>R301L</sup></italic>mutant in a previous report (Xu, DeLuca &amp; O’Farrell Science 2008) was also associated with male sterility. However, this report did not quantitatively assess other aspects of male or female fitness. We now more fully discuss the <italic>mt:CoI<sup>R301L</sup></italic>mutant in our revisions, pointing out the biochemical and biological differences between this mutant and the one we characterize. Even though both mutants had a male sterility defect (<italic>mt:CoI<sup>R301L</sup></italic>was completely male sterile), the authors observed no defects in cytochrome oxidase activity and spermatogenesis. Instead, the infertility was reported due to a defect in sperm storage. Thus, we have a unique manifestation of a male-harming mtDNA mutant. Additionally, we believe that our claim regarding the specificity of the G177S mutation in causing male sterility is based on one of the most comprehensive and quantitatively rigorous phenotypic characterizations.</p><p> <italic>One concern is that the data are not sufficient to rigorously demonstrate the genetic homogeneity of the lines examined. The details are below, but this view can be summarized as follows: the original plan treated the crosses as if they were a selection that would yield a pure male harming mutation, and suitable measures where not take to ensure the genetic homogeneity of the stock that was retrieved. Given the number of mt genomes carried by flies, a high sensitivity of detection of a rare allele (in a range approaching 0.1%) and analysis of single flies is needed to rigorously demonstrate homoplasmy.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the reviewers’ concerns can be remedied by clarified wording and one critical additional experiment that we have performed with the help of new co-author Scott R. Kennedy (now added). First, we now clarify in the text that subsequent to identification of the G177S mutation in experimental line 7, all experiments were done from a mutant and wildtype mtDNA stocks reestablished from the original w118 strain. Additionally, we have now sequenced pools and individuals of these stocks to show that the pools of flies are nearly homoplasmic:</p><p>“We characterized the nature of the heteroplasmy in the re- isolated COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA lines by sequencing a pool of COII<sup>G177S</sup> mutant mtDNA and a separate pool of re-isolated wildtype mtDNA adult fly heads using a Duplex Sequencing strategy (Kennedy, Schmitt et al. 2014) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). […] We therefore used these re-isolated strains for all subsequent phenotypic analyses.”</p><p> <italic>A second issue concerns data on fertility demonstrating that in an early first mating the males exhibited no (at 25°C) or weak (29°C) deficits in fertility. At least in reading the text, the subsequent analyses did not seem to take this fully into account. Many of my concerns here could be dealt with by better reference to supplementary material and more careful wording. Nonetheless, it still seemed to me that this issue was not fully investigated and the impact of this finding on other analyses was not always considered.</italic></p><p>All subsequent analyses to document infertility or its suppression were done in either aged males at 25°C or young males at 29°C; in both instances the deficit in fertility is robustly observed.
