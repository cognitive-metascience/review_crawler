Here, we report miR-139-5p as another new p53 microRNA target. p53 induced the transcription of miR-139-5p, which in turn suppressed the protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), an oncogenic protein involved in multiple tumor promoting processes. Knockdown of p53 reversed these effects. Also, overexpression of miR-139-5p decreased PDE4D levels and increased cellular cAMP levels, leading to BIM-mediated cell growth arrest. Furthermore, our analysis of human colorectal tumor specimens revealed significant inverse correlation between the expression of miR-139-5p and that of PDE4D. Finally, overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors, accompanied by decrease in PDE4D and increase in BIM. These results demonstrate that p53 inactivates oncogenic PDE4D by inducing the expression of miR-139-5p.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15978.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15978.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15978.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body is kept mostly free from tumors by the actions of so-called tumor suppressor genes. One such gene encodes a protein called p53, which prevents tumors from growing by regulating the activity of many other genes that either inhibit cell growth or cause cells to die. For example, p53 regulates genes that encode short molecules called microRNAs, which in turn suppress the activity of other target genes.</p><p>Although a number of microRNAs have been reported as p53-regulated genes, there are still more to find. Discovering these genes would in turn help researchers to better understand exactly how p53 acts to suppress the growth of tumors, and to treat cancers caused by mutations in this tumor suppressor gene.</p><p>Cao, Wang et al. now discover a new microRNA – called miR-139-5p – as one that is activated by p53 in human cells. Colon tumors produce much lower levels of this microRNA than normal tissues, while the cancer cells with a higher level of miR-139-5p grow slower than do the cancer cells with less miR-139-5p. Further experiments showed that this is because miR-139-5p can suppress the production of a protein called PDE4D, which is often highly expressed in human cancers. The suppression of PDE4D by this microRNA results in an increase in the levels of a protein that can cause cancer cells to die.</p><p>Cao, Wang et al. suggest that miR-139-5p and PDE4D form part of a signaling pathway that plays an important role in suppressing the growth of colon cancer cells. Since microRNAs often have more than one target, future studies could explore if miR-139-5p regulates the production of other cancer-related proteins as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15978.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15978.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>miR-139-5p</kwd><kwd>PDE4D</kwd><kwd>BIM</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>tumor suppression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81172337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30973395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA095441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA172468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA127724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 CA190775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The tumor suppressor p53 prevents tumor cell growth by employing a small RNA called miR-139-5p to inhibit the activity of an tumorigenic protein, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4D.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of cellular short non-coding RNAs responsible for modulating the expression of their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. Abnormal regulation of miRNAs is associated with human cancer development and staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). Over the past decade, increasing attention has been drawn to the role of miRNAs in p53 signaling network, and a number of miRNAs have been identified as p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liao et al., 2014a</xref>). These miRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, glycolysis and so on. Also, they often connect p53 with other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christoffersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sachdeva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). Although miRNAs have been appreciated as important mediators of p53’s tumor suppression functions, a lot still remain unexplored to better understand the fine-tuning of p53 signaling and crosstalk with other pathways by these RNAs. In this study, we identified miR-139-5p as a novel p53 target gene and demonstrated a new pathway connecting p53 and miR-139-5p with an oncogenic protein PDE4D as a new target of this miRNA and its downstream cAMP signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of miR-139 as a novel p53 target gene</title><p>In order to identify potential p53 target microRNAs, we used colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup>, the latter of which were genetically engineered to lose the expression of wild type (WT) p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bunz et al., 1998</xref>).

The results revealed that in addition to known p53 target microRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-1246 and miR-143 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liao et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>), miR-139 was also significantly induced in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup>, cells, suggesting miR-139 as a potential p53 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In both cell lines, the binding of p53 with the p53RE was dramatically increased upon Doxorubicin treatment as compared to non-treatment control, indicated by p53RE sequence pulled down with p53 specific antibody DO-1, but not non-specific immunoglobulin G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

After screening several candidates, PDE4D turned out to be an ideal target as its 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) contains miR-139-5p targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overexpression of miR-139-5p mimic markedly reduced the expression of PDE4D in H460 and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Notably, the PDE4D variants with smaller molecular weight have been reported to possess stronger oncogenic activities due to the lack of functional inhibitory domains as compared to the longer forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, miR-139-5p transfection and doxorubicin treatment led to similar expression inhibition of both the long and the short variants of PDE4D, indicating that this newly identified pathway has broader inhibition on PDE4D. In contrast, knocking down p53 elevated PDE4D expression in these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right panel). We then assessed the effect of miR-139-5p on PDE4D in PC-3, a p53 null cell line, and found similar reduction of PDE4D by miR-139-5p mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further validate the regulatory role of p53 on PDE4D, we also treated HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cells with 10 μM Nutlin-3 (Nut), which disrupts MDM2-p53 interaction and therefore activates p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vassilev et al., 2004</xref>), and 5 nM Actinomycin D (ActD), which causes ribosomal stress-mediated p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Iapalucci-Espinoza and Franze-Fernández, 1979</xref>), and found PDE4D was reduced by both of these two drugs only in p53 positive, but not p53 negative, cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Consistent with our in vitro observation, BIM expression was also elevated in miR-139-5p tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These findings suggest that the tumor suppressor role of miR-139-5p is likely attributed to its regulation of the PDE4D/BIM pathway.</p><p>In summary, this study for the first time demonstrates that p53 can induce the expression of miR-139-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which in turn suppresses the expression of an oncogenic protein PDE4D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and leads to cAMP/BIM-mediated cell growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Significantly, miR-139-5p expression is negatively correlated with PDE4D in human colorectal tumor and normal tissues, and overexpression of miR-139-5p is associated with slower tumor growth in the xenograft model, which is accompanied with PDE4D suppression, BIM induction and cell proliferation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As a potential tumor suppressor, miR-139 was previously shown to be downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer with characterized targets including Rho-kinase 2, IGF-IR and RAP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we identified PDE4D, an oncogenic protein that is upregulated in various human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), as another novel target of this miRNA. Inhibition or depletion of PDE4D significantly induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rahrmann et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, the oncogenic property of PDE4D involves the cAMP/BIM pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zambon et al., 2011</xref>). cAMP is an important secondary messenger mediating diverse cellular processes with protein kinase A as its main effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Taskén and Aandahl, 2004</xref>). In particular, lower cAMP levels favor cancer cell survival and proliferation, which can be reversed by inhibition of PDE4D, the cAMP specific phopsphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goldhoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>). The tumor suppressor role of p53 has been extensively documented over the last two decades, and is highly attributable to its regulation of target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bieging et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Levine, 2011</xref>). More recent discoveries revealed that p53 is also a critical mediator of metabolic pathways that are important for tumor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bieging et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang and Gu, 2014</xref>). Based on our findings, we propose a p53-miR-139-5p-PDE4D-cAMP-BIM pathway as a novel pathway that can mediate p53’s tumor suppression function to modulate cellular cAMP levels by inhibiting PDE4D expression via miR-139-5p, and deregulation of this pathway would be highly associated with tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0291">RRID: CVCL_0291</ext-link>) and HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_S744">RRID: CVCL_S744</ext-link>) cells were generous gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein at the John Hopkins Medical Institutes.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled &quot;Inactivation of Oncogenic cAMP-specific Phosphodiesterase 4D by miR-139-5p in Response to p53 Activation&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers found the work potentially quite interesting, but raised a large number of concerns, all of which would need to be addressed successfully to make the paper suitable, after re-review, for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors performed a differential expression analysis to look at p53 regulated micro RNAs in HCT116 cells that were treated with Inauhzin-C (INZ-C) and identified miR-139-5p as a new micro RNA p53 target. Their data show quite convincingly that this is a real p53 target since it is induced by Doxorubicin and INZ-C in a p53-dependent manner, that the miR-139-5p gene contains a p53 binding site to which Dox-induced p53 binds (by ChIP analysis) and that this sequence can serve as a p53 response element in a luciferase reporter assay. The authors go further and use computational analysis to identify a target of miR-139-5p as cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase4D (PDE4D) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> show that a mimic of miR-139-5p leads reduces expression of PDE4D while and inhibitor of miR-139-5p increased the levels of PDE4D. PDE4D is known to increase conversion of cAMP to AMP and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors show increased levels of cAMP upon introduction of the miR-139-5p mimic, and corresponding increased levels of Bim, shown previously to be downstream of cAMP mediated cell death. Finally, they show results from a clinical colon cancer patient dataset indicating a reciprocal relationship between miR-139-5p and PDE4D levels.</p><p>Identifying novel target of p53 is an important area of study, especially when these targets provide new insights into the mechanism of action of p53. Thus, the focus of this study could be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors were to provide more information as outlined in the comments below. The problem with this study, however, is that the authors do not have enough information as to whether, how or when the induction of miR-139-5p by p53 actually plays a role in any p53 outcomes in cells, in animals or in human cancer. There is no evidence for this newly described process in a physiological or pathological setting in vivo. For publication in a journal, such as <italic>eLife</italic>, some demonstration of the importance of this process in vivo needs to be provided. The authors would need to produce extensive and convincing data to allay the above concerns as well as the following more specific comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. What is the relative concentration of the mature endogenous miR-139-5p when induced by p53 compared to the concentration of the miR-139-5p mimic? This is important because it is not clear whether p53 induction of endogenous miR-139-5p is sufficient to cause enough of a drop in PDE4D to have any impact on cAMP.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows that there is a massive increase in the levels of PDE4D when the miR-139-5p inhibitor in introduced into cells even without Dox treatment. One would therefore expect that the levels of cAMP would be reduced. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> this is not the case. They only see an impact of the inhibitor on the levels that are increased by Dox treatment. Why is this?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>: the authors show data indicating a modest but apparently convincing drop in cell viability upon introduction of the miR-139-5p mimic into cells. If BIM is the reason for this, then one would assume that knockdown of BIM would increase cell viability. But there does not appear to be any rescue by BIM knockdown in cells treated with the mimic and so their claim that the impact of miR-139-5p mimic is attenuated by BIM is not substantiated by the data. Understanding the biological consequences of this pathway is central to establishing this microRNA as an important target for p53. Knockdown of BIM is an important experimental approach. Multiple targeting sequences should be used for this knockdown to lessen the possibility of off-target effects. The authors also need to show that knockdown of BIM blocks some cellular outcome due to p53, presumably proliferation inhibition.</p><p>4) If p53 works via miR-139-5p to increase levels of cAMP after doxorubicin as the authors propose, they need to show this. Similarly, they need to show that the increase in BIM is p53 dependent. This is central to their conclusion.</p><p>5) While the authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> an inverse correlation between miR-139-5p and PDE4D, is there a positive correlation between wild-type p53 and miR-139-5p in tumors?</p><p>6) Many of the differences shown, especially, the impact of mir-139-p on cell death and the impact of BIM knockdown on this cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) are very small.

However, it should be noted that these are not new concerns, but rather points that the authors failed to properly address.</p><p>1) Most importantly, there was a concern about the biological relevance of the findings. The authors have now included a xenograft study. While this extends observations to an in vivo setting, they still have not shown that cellular outcomes are dependent upon this pathway.

It is not clear how BIM would induce a cell-cycle effect and the authors have not clearly stated which outcome they think is occurring in response to miR-139-5p regulation by p53. They note that BIM siRNA causes effects on cell viability and on the percent of cells with a hypodipold DNA content and yet the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows BIM causes a cell cycle effect. This is confusing.</p><p>2) As pointed out by reviewers 1 and 3 there are some cases (for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) where effects were very modest and even if statistically significant.

To this melded comment they provide data for the reviewers' eyes that 2 different siRNAs vs BIM have the same effect on Doxorubicin suppression of H460 cell proliferation. First, the &quot;rescue&quot; by BIM knockdown was very modest in the H460 cells. Second, the cells they use to show this are not the same that were in the paper in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, where they used A549 cells.

What they show is not very convincing. First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> doxorubicin is not really appropriate to use as a demonstration of p53-specific response because this drug has other p53-independent effects on cells, so Nutlin would be a better control. Second, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, it is not appropriate to compare two cell lung cancer lines that differ in p53 status as a way to prove that BIM is induced in a p53-specific manner. They use wild-type p53 expressing H460 cells and compare these to p53-null H1299 cells. Yet these two cell lines differ in many more ways besides p53 status. An isogenically matched set of cells is needed to make this important point that the increase in BIM needs p53 under these conditions. Also the extent of induction is really very modest in the H460 cells. Either use the HCT116 pair of cells or knockdown p53 in the H460 cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This revised study by Cao et al. has identified a miR139-5p as a gene that is transactivated by p53 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> in this letter, induction of p53 by 4μM INZ-C or 0.5 μM Doxorubicin led to 6 to 8-fold increase of miR-139-5p in H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A</xref>). Transient transfection of pSIF-H1-miR-139-5p and miR-139-5p mimic in A549 cells resulted in ~4-fold and ~7800-fold increase of miR-139-5p, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1B and C</xref>). However, we were able to detect changes in PDE4D protein at comparable levels among cells treated with 4μM INZ-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Image 1D</xref>), 0.5 μM Doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), or transfected with pSIF-miR-139-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1E</xref>) or miR-139-5p mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistently, 0.5 μM Doxorubicin treatment and miR-139-5p mimic transfection also led to similar induction of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). These observations suggest that although the relative levels of miR-139-5p could differ significantly when cells were treated with different means, several folds of increase achieved by p53 induction is sufficient to suppress PDE4D protein expression and subsequently cAMP elevation, while the excess amount of miR-139-5p mimic does not cause further impact.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15978.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Downregulation of PDE4D by p53 and miR-139-5p.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H460 cells were treated with DMSO, 2 μM INZ-C or 0.5 μM Dox for 18 hr followed by qRT-PCR analysis of miR-139-5p.

Unfortunately, we don’t have the first hand data on p53 status in this set of tumor samples. However, it is well accepted that p53 mutation rate in colon cancer is 50~60% according to the literature (Iacopetta, 2003, Kandoth, McLellan et al., 2013). In addition, even though p53 is wild type in some tumors, its activity should remain quite low due to other tumor favorable pathways. Therefore, it is difficult to elucidate the correlation between p53 mutation status and miR-139-5p/PDE4D levels, but we, as well as many other p53 researchers, believe that the overall p53 activity in the tumors is very low based on a large amount of literature information and the “killing” nature of p53 activity.</p><p><italic>6) Many of the differences shown, especially, the impact of mir-139-p on cell death and the impact of BIM knockdown on this cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) are very small.

However, the difference between control and miR-139-5p transfected cells is statistically significant. Also, previous reports showed that miR-139-5p is a potential tumor suppressor against various types of cancer (Guo, Hu et al., 2012, Wong, Wong et al., 2011), which are consistent with our findings. In addition, our in vivo data in the revised manuscript further confirmed the tumor suppressor role of miR-139-5p, and tumors overexpressing miR-139-5p have elevated expression of BIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting the correlation between miR-139-5p and BIM as we have proposed.</p><p><italic>7) It is unclear whether the authors examined the p53 status in the clinical samples.

To address this, we treated HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells with 10 μM Nutlin-3 (Nut), which disrupts MDM2-p53 interaction (Vassilev, Vu et al., 2004), or 5 nM Actinomycin D (ActD) (Iapalucci-Espinoza &amp; Franze-Fernández, 1979), which leads to ribosomal stress-mediated p53 activation at low concentration, and found that these two drugs only reduced PDE4D in p53 positive, but not p53 negative, cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating this reduction is p53 dependent, and not limited to DNA damage caused by Doxorubicin.</p><p><italic>9) Along these lines as well, it should be tested whether the miR-139-5p inhibitor blocks this p53-dependent cellular outcome.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the advice.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> they provide evidence that PDE4D is a target of miR139-5p. They show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that levels of cAMP a known target of PDE4D, are up in miR139-5p mimic-containing cells or in Doxorubicin-treated cells. Also BIM, previously shown to be upregulated by cAMP, is increased by the miR-139 mimic. Finally in new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, they provide data from mouse xenograft studies and show that SW480 cells harboring a construct expression miR-139-5p produce smaller tumors than cells with a control vector and a representative sample shows lower PDE4D and Ki67 staining. In this revised paper they have responded to the most serious criticisms that came from Reviewers 1 and 3 who made it clear that it did not go far enough to show physiological significance of the p53 target. The new xenograft data are for the most part convincing and strengthen the paper. However, some of the previous concerns remain. If the authors can respond to these comments and provide better data where indicated this paper would be suitable for eLife.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive view of our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we are providing point-by-point responses to specific concerns.</p><p><italic>1) As pointed out by reviewers 1 and 3 there are some cases (for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) where effects are very modest and even if statistically significant. It is difficult to reconcile such modest effects with meaningful physiological outcomes.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in some cases, our in vitro data did not show very dramatic effects. Specifically, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, since the pMIR-reporter assay is an ectopic luciferase system as a very sensitive and reliable method, we believe that statistically significant changes (20-35% inhibition) are meaningful. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, we realized that in A549 cells, miR-139-5p is relatively less effective in inhibiting cell growth, so in our first revision, we included another cell line H460 and performed flow cytometry analysis, which showed quite dramatic induction of sub-G1 cell population (3, first rebuttal letter).</p><p>Additionally, our xenograft study further confirmed the correlation between miR-139-5p and PDE4D, BIM and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, our study demonstrates the tumor suppressor role of miR-139-5p in both in vitroand in vivosystems.</p><p><italic>2) Their responses to the comments are in some cases not really satisfactory. In one case (their point 3) they combine comments by two referees and respond to them as if they were one referee's comment. To this melded comment they provide data for the reviewers' eyes that 2 different siRNAs vs BIM have the same effect on Doxorubicin suppression of H460 cell proliferation. First, the &quot;rescue&quot; by BIM knockdown is very modest in the H460 cells. Second, the cells they use to show this are not the same that were in the paper in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> where they used A549 cells. It does not seem very relevant to present data on a different assay in another cell line to make their point.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The original decision letter was provided to us as a melded summary, so we did not have separate comments from different reviewers. That was why we tried to address point 3 as one comment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> in the first rebuttal letter, we showed that BIM knockdown rescued H460 cell inhibition by Doxorubicin from 58% to 42% (siBIM-1) and 35% (siBIM-2) at 48 h, and from 67% to 47% (siBIM-1) and 37% (siBIM-2) at 72 h after treatment, respectively, which we believe is quite evident. To be consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> as the reviewer suggested, we also performed cell proliferation assay in A549 cells to test the rescue effect of BIM knockdown in response to Nutlin-3 treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, the inhibitory effect of Nutlin-3 on cell proliferation was significantly reversed by BIM siRNA. Although the rescue effect was not 100%, we believe it is reasonably anticipated, because as one of hundreds of target genes of p53, miR-139 also has multiple target genes other than PDE4D/cAMP/BIM pathway (Guo, Hu et al., 2012, Shen, Liang et al., 2012, Wong, Wong et al., 2011). Therefore, we propose that induction of miR-139-5p mediated PDE4D/cAMP/BIM pathway contributes to p53 tumor suppressor function.</p><p><italic>3) In another case their response to the comment &quot;If p53 works via miR-139-5p to increase levels of cAMP as the authors propose, they need to show this. Similarly, they need to show that the increase in BIM is p53 dependent&quot;. Is not very convincing. First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. Doxorubicin is not really appropriate to use as a demonstration of p53-specific response because this drug has other p53-independent effects on cells, so Nutlin would be a better control. Second, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> it is not appropriate to compare two cell lung cancer lines that differ in p53 status as a way to prove that BIM is induced in a p53-specific manner. Also the extent of induction is really very modest in the H460 cells. Either use the HCT116 pair of cells or knockdown p53 in the H460 cells.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that Nutlin-3 is a more appropriate approach to show p53 dependence. We now have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with new data showing that Nutlin-3 treatment also increased cAMP level in A549 cells, but not in the presence of miR-139-5p inhibitor.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that comparing BIM induction in H460 and H1299 cells is not appropriate to show p53 dependence and therefore performed Western blot analysis in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> with new data (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) showing that Nutlin-3 induced BIM expression only in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup>, cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a revision of a previous submitted manuscript which attempts to argue that miR-139-5p is a novel p53 target and its mechanism of action is to increase cAMP levels via downregulation of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4D) and resulting Bim-mediated cell growth arrest. While the authors have addressed many of the concerns of the previous review, there remain several notable issues. If these can be addressed, the manuscript would be acceptable for publication. However, it should be noted that these are not new concerns, but rather points that the authors failed to properly address.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive view of our manuscript, which is potentially acceptable upon satisfactory responses to specific concerns.</p><p><italic>First, and most importantly, there was a concern about the biological relevance of the findings. The authors have now included a xenograft study. While this extends observations to an in vivo setting, they still have not shown that cellular outcomes are dependent upon this pathway. They state that there is Bim-mediated cell cycle arrest and yet data is presented to argue that the outcome may in fact be apoptosis. It is not clear how BIM would induce a cell cycle effect and the authors have not clearly stated which outcome they think is occurring in response to miR-139-5p regulation by p53. They note that BIM siRNA causes effects on cell viability and on the percent of cells with a hypodipold DNA content and yet the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows BIM causes a cell cycle effect. This is confusing.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. In addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>), in which we showed that Nutlin-3 treatment led to p53 specific suppression of PDE4D and miR-139-5p inhibitor significantly rescued Nutlin-3 inhibition (in addition to INZ-C and Actinomycin D) of cell proliferation, we have now included more data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), showing that specific p53 activation by Nutlin-3 induced cAMP dependent on miR-139- 5p, and cell growth inhibition by Nutlin-3 is at least partially dependent on miR-139-5p and BIM. Combined with our in vivo observation, we believe that the tumor suppressor function of p53 is at least partially through our proposed pathway.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that BIM is a mediator of apoptosis. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Image 3</xref> in the first rebuttal letter, we used sub G1 population as an indicator of apoptosis (Zhou, Hao et al., 2015). In fact, in our proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, we showed that BIM actually caused cell growth arrest as a general term of cellular outcome, instead of a cell cycle effect.</p><p><italic>Second, it was noted that cAMP levels do not track with outcomes. The authors' response is one of speculation rather than providing additional insights through experimental data.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We now have included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> to show that the rescue effect of miR-139-5p on A549 cell growth inhibition by Nutlin-3 is correlated with the change of cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Third, the p53-dependence of the BIM increase remains an issue. They use wild-type p53 expressing H460 cells and compare these to p53-null H1299 cells. Yet these two cell lines differ in many more ways besides p53 status. An isogenically matched set of cells is needed to make this important point that the increase in BIM needs p53 under these conditions.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that H460 and H1299 cells are not an appropriate pair of cells for comparing p53 dependent BIM induction. Therefore, we performed Western blot analysis in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> with new data (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) showing that Nutlin-3 induced BIM expression only in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
