RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that recruits DNMT1 to sites of newly replicated DNA through ubiquitylation of histone H3. UHRF1 binds DNA with selectivity towards hemi-methylated CpGs (HeDNA); however, the contribution of HeDNA sensing to UHRF1 function remains elusive. Here, we reveal that the interaction of UHRF1 with HeDNA is required for DNA methylation but is dispensable for chromatin interaction, which is governed by reciprocal positive cooperativity between the UHRF1 histone- and DNA-binding domains. HeDNA recognition activates UHRF1 ubiquitylation towards multiple lysines on the H3 tail adjacent to the UHRF1 histone-binding site. Collectively, our studies are the first demonstrations of a DNA-protein interaction and an epigenetic modification directly regulating E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. They also define an orchestrated epigenetic control mechanism involving modifications both to histones and DNA that facilitate UHRF1 chromatin targeting, H3 ubiquitylation, and DNA methylation inheritance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17101.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17101.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17101.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are able to regulate the activity of their genes in response to different cues. Genetic information is encoded in DNA and one way to regulate gene activity is to modify the DNA by attaching chemical “epigenetic” markers to it. When a cell divides, these epigenetic markers can be inherited by the daughter cells so that they share the same patterns of gene activity as the parent cell. When the DNA of the parent cell is copied prior to cell division, the epigenetic markers are also copied onto the new DNA. Mistakes in this process are linked to a wide range of diseases in humans, such as cancer and neurological disorders.</p><p>One type of epigenetic marker is known as a methyl tag and it is added to DNA by certain enzymes in a process called DNA methylation. A protein called UHRF1 is required for human cells to inherit patterns of DNA methylation through cell division. This protein binds to newly copied DNA that lacks some methyl tags as well as to another protein associated with DNA called histone H3. UHRF1 modifies histone H3 by attaching a small protein molecule called ubiquitin to it. This helps to recruit a DNA methylation enzyme to place methyl tags on the newly copied DNA. However, it was not clear how the various properties of UHRF1 allow it to control how DNA methylation is inherited.</p><p>Harrison et al. addressed this question by studying purified proteins and DNA fragments outside of living cells. The results show that UHRF1 binding to DNA and histone H3 work together to bring UHRF1 to the sites on DNA that require methylation. Further experiments revealed that the methylation pattern on newly copied DNA is able to activate the ability of UHRF1 to place ubiquitin on histone H3.</p><p>The findings of Harrison et al. reveal a new mechanism by which dividing cells control how DNA methylation is inherited by their daughter cells. A future challenge will be to find out how attaching ubiquitin to histone H3 activates DNA methylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17101.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17101.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>histone post-translational modifications</kwd><kwd>UHRF1</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006019</institution-id><institution>Van Andel Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothbart</surname><given-names>Scott B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-CA009156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Joseph S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA181343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothbart</surname><given-names>Scott B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM073960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhlman</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strahl</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klevit</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM07270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DaRosa</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenetic modifications to DNA can regulate E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic regulation of chromatin architecture and gene expression is driven, in large part, by proteins that write, erase, and read histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and DNA methylation.

We also observed that the DNA binding affinity of UHRF1 was exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations in salt concentration; we measured a nearly 500-fold affinity difference for HeDNA between 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next used a previously developed genetic complementation system in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rothbart et al., 2012</xref>) to determine the contribution of DNA-binding and HeDNA-sensing to UHRF1 function in DNA methylation maintenance. Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>), global DNA methylation levels were significantly reduced following stable knockdown of endogenous UHRF1 by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). DNA methylation was restored by reintroduction of a wild-type UHRF1 transgene, but like mutations that disrupt histone interaction through the PHD finger (H3<sup>mut</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (RING<sup>mut</sup>) and DNA binding (DNA<sup>mut</sup>), HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> could not rescue DNA methylation loss in cells despite retaining its ability to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). These results demonstrate that in addition to the well-appreciated roles of histone-binding and ubiquitin ligase activity to the DNA methylation regulatory function of UHRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>), hemi-methylated DNA sensing is critical for DNA methylation maintenance.</p><p>Notably, unlike H3<sup>mut</sup> and DNA<sup>mut</sup>, wild-type and HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> bound to bulk chromatin biochemically fractionated from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that the histone- and DNA-binding domains of UHRF1 are performing complementary functions to target UHRF1 to chromatin, and that HeDNA recognition provides an additional regulatory layer in the DNA methylation program.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first sought to determine whether the independently characterized DNA- and histone-binding activities of UHRF1 might function in concert. In agreement with previous analyses of the isolated TTD-PHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>), full-length UHRF1 displayed a preference for H3K9me3 peptides over unmodified H3 peptides (H3K9un) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; top panel, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). No binding was observed for H3<sup>mut</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or for wild-type protein binding to peptides containing an N-terminal 5-carboxyfluorecin (FAM) probe to block PHD engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; bottom panel). Performing these assays with full-length UHRF1 allowed us to ask whether DNA binding affects H3 peptide binding and vice versa. Histone binding measurements in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled HeDNA, SyDNA, or UnDNA enhanced the interaction with C-terminal FAM-labeled H3K9me3 and H3K9un peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; top panel). HeDNA did not enhance binding to N-terminal FAM-labeled peptides, indicating that the multivalent interaction of the TTD-PHD with a single H3 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>) remained intact.

H3K9me3 peptide showed a three-fold enhancement of DNA binding over H3K9un, and asymmetric di-methylation of arginine 2 (H3R2me2a), which blocks the UHRF1 PHD interaction with H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rajakumara et al., 2011</xref>), did not enhance DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, H3<sup>mut</sup> completely perturbed the ability of an H3K9me3 peptide to positively regulate DNA binding, a previously characterized double mutation to the linker connecting the TTD-PHD that uncouples multivalent engagement to H3 (Linker<sup>mut</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>) exhibited a weaker enhancement of DNA binding in the presence of peptide than wild-type, and DNA<sup>mut</sup> remained unable to bind DNA in the presence of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Conversely, the DNA binding affinity of HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> was still enhanced by H3K9me3, although HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> could not discriminate between UnDNA and HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), providing a biochemical basis for HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> retention on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The observed positive allostery between DNA- and histone-binding suggested the possibility of a direct physical interaction between the SRA and TTD-PHD domains of UHRF1. Consistent with this hypothesis, the UHRF1 TTD-PHD associated with the SRA and SRA-RING in pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and this association was perturbed in the presence of DNA, irrespective of methylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). SRA-RING DNA<sup>mut</sup> maintained interaction with the TTD-PHD in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right). However, an H3K9me2 peptide did not inhibit the interaction between the SRA and the TTD-PHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that the DNA-binding surface of the SRA contributes to an intramolecular interaction in a manner non-competitive with histone binding. To ensure that the allostery observed was due to an intramolecular rearrangement and not through oligomerization, we characterized UHRF1 in the presence and absence of ligands with several biophysical techniques. Indeed, UHRF1 remained monomeric and in good agreement with the expected molecular weight as measured by analytical size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17101.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DNA binding disrupts a UHRF1 intramolecular interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro pull-down analysis of the interaction between GST-TTD-PHD and MBP or the indicated MBP fusions of UHRF1.

The data further suggest that ligand-induced intramolecular rearrangement of UHRF1 domain connectivity results in high-affinity retention of UHRF1 on chromatin through positive regulation of histone- and DNA-binding activities. This model is generally consistent with a recent report published during the preparation of this manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2016</xref>), which shows that HeDNA enhances histone interaction and suggests a closed-to-open conformational change in UHRF1 intramolecular architecture upon ligand binding. However, two key differences between our findings are that we show reciprocal positive allostery between the histone- and DNA-binding domains of UHRF1, and that general DNA interaction (regardless of methylation state) can displace the TTD-PHD domain and enhance histone interaction. We note that the conclusions from Fang <italic>et al.</italic> relied upon the interpretation of qualitative in-solution pull-down experiments conducted with a 2:1 DNA:UHRF1 ratio (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2016</xref>), whereas we used quantitative FP to measure relative binding affinities and included unlabeled ligands in our experiments at concentrations at least five-fold over their measured K<sub>d</sub> values to ensure saturation.</p><p>Since UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity is required to support DNA methylation yet is dispensable for bulk chromatin interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that there may be a functional link between HeDNA-binding and UHRF1 ligase activity. To begin testing this hypothesis, we <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted UHRF1-mediated ubiquitylation using recombinant UHRF1, H3 peptides, Flag-tagged ubiquitin, and the ubiquitin conjugation enzymes E1 (Uba1) and E2 (UbcH5c) (for a review of the mechanism of ubiquitin activation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulman, 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed robust ubiquitylation of an H3<sub>1-32</sub>K9me2 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in a 20 min end-point assay in the presence of HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We measured a 2.5-fold rate enhancement of UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation in the presence of HeDNA vs. UnDNA, both in the presence or absence of H3<sub>1-32</sub>K9me2 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In sharp contrast, the rate of HeDNA-stimulated H3<sub>1-32</sub>K9me2 mono-ubiquitylation was stimulated by more than 100-fold over the rate obtained with UnDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Comparing the rate of activity on UHRF1 substrates (peptide vs. self), the rate of auto-ubiquitylation was 20-fold faster than the rate of peptide ubiquitylation in the presence of UnDNA. Conversely, the rate of peptide ubiquitylation was seven-fold faster than the rate of auto-ubiquitylation in the presence of HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on these observations, we propose that HeDNA-binding acts as an allosteric switch to enhance ubiquitylation of histone substrates.</p><p>Similar to peptide substrates, UHRF1 mono-, di-, and tri-ubiquitylation of purified HeLa mononucleosomes was stimulated by HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming that the enhanced ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 is relevant in the context of chromatin. In addition, when excess H3<sub>1-15</sub>K9me2 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (which harbors the TTD-PHD binding site but not the published ubiquitin target lysines) was added to UHRF1 mononucleosome ubiquitylation assays, H3<sub>1-15</sub>K9me2 effectively inhibited enzymatic activity towards mononucleosome substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, HeDNA concentrations as high as 40 μM did not block mononucleosome ubiquitylation, consistent with its role as an activator of UHRF1 E3 ligase activity. These results suggest that the N-terminus of H3 is the primary binding site for substrate recognition through the TTD-PHD and that DNA interaction can occur in <italic>trans</italic> to the nucleosome being targeted for ubiquitylation.</p><p>To further investigate the role of UHRF1 reader domain functions in ligase activity, we tested the previously described H3<sup>mut</sup>, Linker<sup>mut</sup>, DNA<sup>mut</sup>, HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and D469G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avvakumov et al., 2008</xref>) mutants in ubiquitylation assays using H3<sub>1-32</sub>K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and H3<sub>1-43</sub>K9un peptides as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Reacting UHRF1 with peptide substrates, we observed low ubiquitin ligase activity in the absence of HeDNA, while HeDNA binding permitted robust formation of mono-, di-, and tri-ubiquitylated H3 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Characterizing DNA-, HeDNA-, and histone-binding loss-of-function UHRF1 mutants in ubiquitylation assays revealed defects in HeDNA-dependent H3 ubiquitylation, with the exception of the previously reported SRA loss-of-function mutant (D469G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avvakumov et al., 2008</xref>), that exhibited wild-type binding to HeDNA in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Ubiquitylation defects observed for H3<sup>mut</sup> and Linker<sup>mut</sup> confirmed a critical role for the TTD-PHD as the substrate-binding domain for HeDNA-dependent H3 ubiquitylation and demonstrated that multivalent <italic>cis</italic> engagement of H3K9me3 by the UHRF1 TTD-PHD is required for proper ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, complete loss of HeDNA-dependent ubiquitylation for DNA<sup>mut</sup> UHRF1 and the absence of multi-ubiquitylated H3 for HeDNA<sup>mut</sup> UHRF1 further support the role of DNA binding and HeDNA recognition to fully activate UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity. The histone ubiquitylation defects observed for these loss-of-function mutants further highlights the interplay between UHRF1 functional domains to support proper UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity.</p><p>There is a growing appreciation for the role of allosteric regulation of RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in the field of ubiquitin biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vittal et al., 2015</xref>). Most often, the regulation of RING E3 ligases is accomplished through modulation of the E3 affinity for an E2-ub (thioesterified E2-ubiquitin) conjugate. Auto-inhibition release is the primary mechanism observed to date, in which steric occlusion of the RING domain prevents E3 interaction with the E2-ub until the E3 receives an appropriate release signal. Examples of RING auto-inhibition release include neddylation of Cullins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>), phosphorylation of Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dou et al., 2012</xref>), and substrate/peptide mimetic binding to inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dueber et al., 2011</xref>). Taking into consideration the above-described allosteric regulatory mechanism of E3 ligase activity, we first sought to determine whether the interaction with HeDNA could affect association with E2-ub. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we monitored the interaction between UHRF1 and E2-N-ub (isopeptide-linked C85K E2-ubiquitin conjugate) or <sup>15</sup>N-E2-O-ub (oxyesterified C85S E2-ubiquitin conjugate), respectively. Surprisingly, neither ITC nor NMR spectrum intensity loss measurements indicated a change in affinity for the E2 conjugates in the absence or presence of HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we readily observed UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation in the presence of HeDNA and UnDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating the RING domain of UHRF1 could productively interact with E2-ub regardless of the methylation status of the bound DNA.

This alternative RING conformation stabilizes the E2-ub/RING complex, thereby enhancing ubiquitin discharge from the conjugated E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DaRosa et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether HeDNA-induced UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity enhanced ubiquitin discharge from the conjugated E2, we performed single turnover ubiquitylation assays where purified E2-ub served as the ubiquitin donor and excess free lysine was present as a proxy ubiquitin substrate. The rate of ubiquitin discharge from E2 in these assays (monitored by the loss of the E2-ub and the appearance of free E2) showed only a modest increase in the reactivity of the conjugate in the presence of HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that HeDNA-dependent activation of UHRF1 RING activity does not occur through enhancement of the intrinsic rate of ubiquitin discharge from the E2 to non-specific lysine sidechains.</p><p>Remarkably, when an H3<sub>1-20</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) was added to ubiquitin discharge reactions, we observed rapid conversion of E2-ub to E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Additionally, we observed the appearance of a band corresponding to ubiquitylated H3<sub>1-20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, we also observed a decrease in the amount of free ubiquitin and UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation formed when peptide was present, presumably because more ubiquitin was being transferred to H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, even under conditions where free lysine was in great excess, ubiquitin was transferred rapidly and preferentially to H3 substrate in the presence of HeDNA.</p><p>To determine whether activation of UHRF1 occurs upon substrate binding (i.e., substrate-assisted activation), we performed single turnover assays in the presence of H3<sub>1-20</sub>, H3<sub>1-20</sub>K14acK18ac, and H3<sub>1-20</sub>K9acK14acK18ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We previously demonstrated the interaction of the UHRF1 TTD-PHD with these potential substrates by peptide microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>) and reasoned that the acetylated peptides would maintain interaction with the TTD-PHD but would be unable to accept ubiquitin. Neither the H3<sub>1-20</sub>K14acK18ac nor H3<sub>1-20</sub>K9acK14acK18ac were capable of being modified with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Additionally, rapid E2-ub depletion was only observed in the sample containing H3<sub>1-20</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that substrate binding alone does not enhance the E3 ligase activity of UHRF1 in the presence of HeDNA. Consistent with our previous single turnover results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), reactions that contained unblocked lysines on H3<sub>1-20</sub> accumulated less auto-ubiquitylated UHRF1 and free ubiquitin compared to assays with no peptide or with the acetylated H3 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), supporting a model where HeDNA alters the substrate specificity of UHRF1 ubiquitylation. It is worth noting that in all single and multiple turnover assays performed, virtually no ubiquitylated species of H3 were observed in assays that lacked HeDNA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HeDNA stimulates UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity through a novel regulatory mechanism and suggest that HeDNA binding serves as an allosteric switch that directs the TTD-PHD bound H3 substrate to the E2-ub active site for transfer.</p><p>We next used high-resolution mass spectrometry to further characterize the histone lysine specificity of HeDNA-stimulated UHRF1 ubiquitylation. HeLa mononucleosomes were reacted with UHRF1 in the presence of HeDNA or UnDNA for 2 hr using the enrichment strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Since histone proteins are highly basic, propionic anhydride was used to chemically modify free lysines and facilitate the identification of peptide fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>). We first identified peptides that were enriched in the HeDNA sample relative to the UnDNA sample, and the only histone peptides that were enriched greater than ten-fold were derived from H3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (see Materials and methods for information about normalization and quantification). Consistent with our findings that HeDNA stimulates UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity, ubiquitin remnants on H3 peptides were heavily enriched in samples reacted in the presence of HeDNA relative to UnDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). In addition to the previously identified sites H3K18 and H3K23, we also found H3K14ub, H3K27ub, and H3K36ub heavily enriched in the presence of HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). We further identified abundant H3K18ub and H3K23ub (multi-ubiquitylation) on the same peptide. These results are consistent with laddering observed for H3ub in our experiments with synthetic peptides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and recombinant and native mononucleosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as well as immunoblots from HeLa cells in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2015</xref>). H3K18ub was the most abundant ubiquitylated peptide based upon spectral counts (greater than 15-fold more than any other site), and H3K23ub was only observed in the context of H3K18ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Collectively these results suggest that H3K18 is the preferred ubiquitylation site for UHRF1, but that UHRF1 can target a number of lysines on the H3 tail.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17101.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>HeDNA stimulates UHRF1-directed ubiquitylation of multiple N-terminal lysines on histone H3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the assay and sample preparation strategy to identify by LC-MC/MS products of UHRF1 ubiquitylation reactions with HeLa mononucleosomes in the presence of UnDNA or HeDNA.

In particular, we identified a nine-fold enrichment of UHRF1 K303ub, a solvent exposed lysine in the PHD near the C-terminus of a bound H3 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This region may represent the target zone for HeDNA-dependent ubiquitylation where the RING domain would be in proximity to this region. Accordingly, we observed an additional auto-ubiquitylated UHRF1 band in the presence of HeDNA compared to that observed with UnDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>), corroborating our mass spectrometry results.</p><p>We also identified several histone PTMs that co-occurred with ubiquitylated H3 peptides, including all three states of H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, several of the most enriched H3 peptides not containing ubiquitin remnants also contained H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We confirmed this epigenetic link by immunoblotting HeLa mononucleosomes ubiquitylated by UHRF1. Ubiquitylated H3 was detected in the presence of HeDNA (but not UnDNA) on nucleosomes marked with H3K9me3, but not on nucleosomes marked with H3K9acK14ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, titrating recombinant human histones H3, H2A, and H2B into ubiquitylation assays revealed that while UHRF1 could modify H2A and H2B at concentrations above 5 μM, H3 could be modified at sub-micromolar concentrations, and H3K9me2 protein (synthesized by native chemical ligation) could be modified at even lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly support the role of H3K9 methylation in directing UHRF1 ubiquitylation to adjacent lysine residues in the presence of HeDNA. Other histone PTMs co-occurring on ubiquitylated peptides were: H3K23ac, also identified in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2015</xref>); H3K27me2, which often co-occurs with H3K9me2/me3 and is considered a hallmark of facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boros et al., 2014</xref>); H3K36ac, and H3K37me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

While it remains to be seen whether uncoupling UHRF1 from HeDNA recognition changes its residence genome-wide, our studies show HeDNA sensing is not required to target UHRF1 to bulk chromatin. Rather, coordinated recognition of H3 and DNA, independent of HeDNA discrimination, drives chromatin interaction. We propose that the avidity resulting from sub-μM affinities of UHRF1 for both DNA and H3 peptides through reciprocal positive allostery provides a biochemical basis by which UHRF1 is exclusively localized on chromatin. This may also explain why small perturbations to histone binding affinity through the TTD-PHD (e.g., Linker<sup>mut</sup> and TTD aromatic cage mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothbart et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>]) so dramatically affect chromatin targeting of this protein.</p><p>Our studies define the UHRF1 TTD-PHD as the substrate-binding domain for HeDNA-stimulated ubiquitylation, further demonstrating a functional role for the coordinated recognition of H3K9me2/me3 and HeDNA in UHRF1 ubiquitylation. UHRF1 appears to be versatile in targeting lysines for ubiquitylation on the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>): this ability may be related to the complexities of PTM patterning found on this region of the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Young et al., 2009</xref>) and the necessity to promote efficient recruitment of DNMT1 to differentially modified chromatin environments. In addition, UHRF1 histone ubiquitylation may serve other roles in DNA related processes (i.e., DNA repair) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are necessary to examine the biological consequence of different patterns of H3 ubiquitylation by UHRF1 and their relationship to pre-existing histone PTM signatures.</p><p>Important to note are studies on the enzymology of DNMT1 activity that show the enzyme has an intrinsic preference for HeDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goyal et al., 2006</xref>) and methylates in a processive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bestor and Ingram, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermann et al., 2004</xref>). Our studies define a major function for HeDNA, beyond direct stimulation of DNMT1 activity, in the regulation of UHRF1 histone ubiquitylation and DNA methylation inheritance. Considering DNMT1 behavior on oligonucleotide substrates, it is intriguing to speculate that UHRF1 functions to provide a nucleation event for DNMT1 recruitment to chromatin. Future studies mapping the genome-wide distribution of UHRF1-directed H3 ubiquitylation in relation to DNA methylation patterning will clarify the relationship between UHRF1 and DNMT1 activities.</p><p>How might HeDNA binding alter the substrate preference of UHRF1 directed ubiquitylation? We speculate that HeDNA is bound by the UHRF1 SRA in a manner that positions the RING in proximity to the H3 binding region of UHRF1. RING activity towards H3 may be conformationally restricted when UHRF1 binds SyDNA or UnDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, structures of the SRA domain from mouse UHRF1 (Np95) show this domain can adopt different conformations bound to UnDNA and HeDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2008</xref>). Also the NKR finger of the UHRF1 SRA, which harbors the HeDNA<sup>mut</sup>, adopts a highly ordered conformation upon HeDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avvakumov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2008</xref>). This allows for pseudo-base pairing to the exposed guanosine nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we hypothesize this stable finger conformation is critical for HeDNA-stimulated H3 ubiquitylation. Unfortunately, efforts to crystallize the enzymatically active conformation of UHRF1 proved unsuccessful. Determining the active conformation of UHRF1 will be an important step in further understanding the regulation imparted by HeDNA.</p><p>Why might ubiquitin be an ideal PTM to accompany a temporally controlled process like replication-coupled DNA methylation? Ubiquitin itself is a functional protein domain capable of participating a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>) and can sterically occlude surfaces, as has been proposed for H2BK120ub in the formation of a productive complex with DOT1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Ubiquitin modifications are also dynamic and can be rapidly removed by deubiquitylases. In fact, recent analysis of ubiquitin turnover kinetics showed that the half-life of H2BK123ub in budding yeast is approximately one minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yumerefendi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, discovering the identity of the deubiquitylase that removes H3 ubiquitylation may provide key insight into the dynamics of DNA methylation regulation at the level of histone ubiquitylation. The initial study implicating H3 ubiquitylation in the inheritance of DNA methylation indirectly suggested that USP7 may be responsible for this function through interaction with DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishiyama et al., 2013</xref>). This is notable, as USP7 has also been shown to interact with UHRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have tied USP7 to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lecona et al., 2016</xref>) and the maintenance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mungamuri et al., 2016</xref>), providing a biological link to replication-coupled inheritance of DNA methylation. However direct evidence of USP7 catalyzed deubiquitylation of H3 is lacking.</p><p>In conclusion, our study defines the relationship between UHRF1 histone-binding, DNA-binding, and ubiquitylation activities and connects HeDNA recognition to UHRF1 enzymatic function. Additionally, we characterize HeDNA as an active epigenetic mark that allosterically regulates UHRF1 ubiquitylation towards histone H3. More broadly, these finding provide a function for epigenetic patterning associated with UHRF1 beyond protein recruitment. We speculate that epigenetic mechanisms of multivalency and allostery are more widespread and add additional layers of complexity, specificity, and connectivity to chromatin recognition, modification patterning, and genome regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>UHRF1 protein production</title><p>The cDNA that encodes amino acids 1–793 of human UHRF1 (full length) was cloned into a modified pGEX vector in frame with an N-terminal 6xHis-MBP tag that can be cleaved with TEV protease. <italic>E. coli</italic> were grown to O.D. 0.6 and induced with 600 mM IPTG overnight at 18°C.

Cleaved UHRF1 was less stable at higher concentrations than 6xHis-MBP-UHRF1 but behaved similarly in binding and ubiquitylation assays.

Gain settings in the parallel (||) and perpendicular (⊥) channels were calibrated to a polarization measurement of 100 milli-polarization units (mP) for the FAM tracer in the absence of protein. Polarization (P) was determined from raw intensity values of the parallel and perpendicular channels using the equation P = || – ⊥ / || + 2(⊥) and converted to anisotropy (A) units using the equation A = 2P / 3 – P. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of anisotropy curves using a one-site binding model in GraphPad Prism. To control for variability in salt concentration, each experiment included a wild-type protein as a reference.

The mass of propionyl was subtracted from variable lysine modification masses (except methylation) due to the already applied static propionyl modification. For unpropionylated samples, the differing parameters were: up to 3 missed cleavages, fully-enzymatic trypsin digestion, no static modifications, and a maximum of 4 variable modifications consisting of up to 2 lysine ubiquitinations (+114.042931), 2 methylations (+14.01565), 2 dimethylations (+28.0313), 2 trimethylations (+42.046951), 2 acetylations (+42.010571), 1 methionine oxidation (+15.99492), and 1 STY phosphorylation (+79.966331). Prior to execution of the Percolator algorithm supplied by Crux, deltaCn scores were re-computed using an alternate definition: deltaCn<sub>i</sub> = 1 – ((xcorr<sub>1</sub>-xcorr<sub>i</sub>) / xcorr<sub>1</sub>). This adjustment was performed because the similar mass of trimethylation and acetylation results in identical xcorr values for the low mass accuracy MS/MS spectra from linear ion traps, which then led to invalid deltaCn values with the default equation used by Percolator. After application of a 5% FDR threshold, peptides were further filtered by ensuring they had the expected retention time relative to peptides having the identical unmodified sequence. We used the following procedure. First, peptides with the same unmodified sequence were sorted in ascending order by their Percolator PEP (posterior error probability). Then, each peptide (starting from lowest to highest PEP) was accepted if at least one of its MS/MS scan’s retention time was consistent relative to all currently accepted peptides having the same unmodified sequence. The expected relative retention time constraints were: ubiquitin &lt; dimethyl ≤ trimethyl &lt; acetyl &lt; propionyl &lt; methyl, oxidation &lt; unmodified, and phosphorylation ≤ unmodified. Peptides expected to have the same retention times were allowed to elute within 2 min of each other.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jerry Workman who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a detailed biochemical and proteomic analysis of the role of H3K9me3 and hemi-methylated DNA on the functions of the UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase. Previous studies have implicated UHRF1binding to HeDNA to be important for the recruitment of UHRF1. However, in this very systematic biochemical study the authors find that HeDNA is an allosteric activator of UHRF1 expanding its lysine targets in histone H3. The work is well done and timely. In general the chromatin field considers protein interactions with epigenetic marks to be the basis for recruitment of chromatin modifiers. This study clearly indicates allosteric activation of chromatin modifiers needs to also be considered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript provided by Harrison et al., describes an excellent body of work – in terms of both breadth and interest – regarding the activity of a critical multi-domain epigenetic component, UHRF1. This protein has a well-established role in recognition of hemi-methylated DNA, association with H3K9me3 and subsequent recruitment of DNMT1 for methylation maintenance. In this paper they advance mechanistic understanding of UHRF1 activity and promote a model whereby hemi-methylated DNA (HeDNA) actively promotes UHRF1-mediated ubiquitylation of H3. First they show that while HeDNA discrimination mutants of UHRF1 are unable to sustain methylation in vivo, they are able to associated with chromatin. Next they provide evidence for positive allostery, showing that UHRF1 association with H3 is promoted by the presence of (He)DNA and visa versa. They provide a mechanism for this positive allostery, showing that the SRA and TTD-PHD domains normally associate with each other but that his interaction is abrogated in the presence of DNA, which presumably allows the free TTD-PHD domain to associate with its known chromatin target, H3K9me3. Next they provide compelling evidence that the presence HeDNA stimulates the ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 on H3 substrate. To explain the stimulatory effect of HeDNA, they aim to provide evidence for 'lysine prioritization' (weakest part of the manuscript, see below). Finally, they use mass spectroscopy techniques to determine the PTMs associated with HeDNA simulated UHRF1 activity on nucleosomes.</p><p>While this article is slightly foreshadowed by the article of Fang et al., (published earlier in April <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045799">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045799</ext-link>), I believe the article herein still contains more than sufficient novel insight – particularly regarding ubiquitylation – to justify publication in a prestigious journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I felt that the authors were overly dismissive of the results from the other group, despite their findings being largely complementary. In fact, some of the data presented here could be benefit from interpretation in context of the work of Fang et al. The main concern I have with this manuscript regards their lysine prioritization model, for which I believe their current supporting evidence to be insufficient (see below).</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>1) In the Results section, the authors state: &quot;UHRF1-dependent histone ubiquitylation was largely unaffected by free lysine in multi-turnover ubiquitylation assays, while UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, I</xref> am not convinced that the presence of free lysine preferentially affects auto-ub over H3 peptide. If at all, auto-ub levels appear barely increased in the absence of free lysine, however, the di and mono-ub levels of H3 seem equally if not even more increased (cf. lanes 1 and 4 at di-ub or lanes 2 and 5 at mono-ub) suggesting that there is no prioritization of H3 lysines whatsoever. Nor is there any attempt to quantify this result.</p><p>They go on to say &quot;We also confirmed this result using single turnover lysine discharge assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>)…&quot; – yet these assays are in no way a confirmation of prioritization, as they simply show that H3 peptide ub can occur in the presence of free lysine, however, critically, they do directly compare rates H3 ub rates (normalized to auto-ub) in the absence vs. presence of free lysine as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p><p>To me these results are much more consistent with the findings from Fang et al., and also shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) whereby the combination of HeDNA, H3K9me3 and H3R2 unlock UHRF1 in an open confirmation associated with H3, facilitating efficient ubiquitylation of histone lysines. This more parsimonious possibility is even alluded to by the authors: Fifth paragraph of Discussion section – &quot;We also cannot rule out the possibility that the increased rate of HeDNA-dependent ubiquitin transfer to lysines compared to auto-ubiquitylation or ubiquitin discharge to free lysine may arise from the UHRF1-bound histone lysines possessing ideal characteristics for accepting ubiquitin (e.g. spatially pre-arranged, protected from solvent, and/or appropriate pK).&quot;</p><p>Overall, unless considerably improved evidence supporting the 'lysine prioritization' model is provided, this line of argument should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>2) In my view the most important aspect of this paper is to establish the mechanism through which HeDNA binding stimulates ubiquitylation. This maybe partly explained by DNA binding disrupting the SRA-RING interaction with TTD-PHD (leading to enhanced binding to H3K9me), but this occurs with any DNA binding (modified or otherwise). So we are left, somewhat disappointingly, with the speculation that HeDNA binding causes specific conformational changes that reposition the RING domain to target the E2 ligase to particular H3 lysines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17101.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The manuscript provided by Harrison et al., describes an excellent body of work – in terms of both breadth and interest – regarding the activity of a critical multi-domain epigenetic component, UHRF1.

This more parsimonious possibility is even alluded to by the authors: Fifth paragraph of Discussion section – &quot;We also cannot rule out the possibility that the increased rate of HeDNA-dependent ubiquitin transfer to lysines compared to auto-ubiquitylation or ubiquitin discharge to free lysine may arise from the UHRF1-bound histone lysines possessing ideal characteristics for accepting ubiquitin (e.g. spatially pre-arranged, protected from solvent, and/or appropriate pK).&quot;</italic> </p><p> <italic>Overall, unless considerably improved evidence supporting the 'lysine prioritization' model is provided, this line of argument should be removed from the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful critique, and after consideration of this careful analysis and key results from several new experiments, we now propose that HeDNA functions with the TTD-PHD to direct the “substrate specificity” of UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards histone H3. Below we highlight experiments we’ve included in new versions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> that support our proposed model.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: We carefully analyzed the rate of UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation and peptide ubiquitylation in the presence of UnDNA and HeDNA. These results are striking: while HeDNA modestly enhances the rate of auto-ubiquitylation by 2.5-fold, the rate of peptide ubiquitylation in the presence of HeDNA is enhanced by more than 100-fold over the rate in the presence of UnDNA. Importantly, for UnDNA-bound UHRF1, the rate of auto-ubiquitylation is greater than 20-fold faster than the rate of peptide ubiquitylation, while in the presence of HeDNA, peptide ubiquitylation is favored (7-fold over). These results show that HeDNA-stimulated ubiquitin ligase activity is not generally activating RING activity. Coupled with competition and mutation analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>, results of ubiquitin discharge experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C-D</xref> (see below), and mass spec analysis of ubiquitin target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we now feel sufficient evidence is provided to propose HeDNA functions with the TTD-PHD to direct the substrate specificity of the UHRF1 ubiquitylation reaction towards histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>: In further support of our “substrate specificity” model, we show that E2~ub discharge is greatly enhanced only when it can be transferred to a histone substrate. We also show that both auto-ubiquitylation and free ubiquitin discharged to lysine is reduced when ubiquitin is transferred to a peptide.</p><p> <italic>2) In my view the most important aspect of this paper is to establish the mechanism through which HeDNA binding stimulates ubiquitylation. This maybe partly explained by DNA binding disrupting the SRA-RING interaction with TTD-PHD (leading to enhanced binding to H3K9me), but this occurs with any DNA binding (modified or otherwise). So we are left, somewhat disappointingly, with the speculation that HeDNA binding causes specific conformational changes that reposition the RING domain to target the E2 ligase to particular H3 lysines.</italic></p><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer that “establishing the mechanism” promoting HeDNA-dependent histone ubiquitylation is a high priority – particularly since we appear to have uncovered a distinct mechanism of RING activation. While we are now working to define the structural basis for these allosteric regulatory mechanisms controlling UHRF1 binding and enzymatic activities, these experiments are technically challenging and are not feasible to perform within the timescale of the revision. As the reviewers pointed out above, we hope the many layers of mechanistic advance presented in this manuscript in its current form will stimulate the community at large to further study (biochemically and structurally) mechanisms of allostery controlling the activities of chromatin regulators.</p></body></sub-article></article>
