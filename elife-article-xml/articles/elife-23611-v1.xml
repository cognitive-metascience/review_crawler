The transcriptional programs governing these complex innate glial immune responses are still unclear. Here, we describe a novel injury assay in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> that elicits widespread glial responses in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We profiled injury-induced changes in VNC gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and found that responsive genes fall into diverse signaling classes. One factor, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), is induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ensheathing glia responding to severed axons. Interestingly, glial induction of MMP-1 requires the highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper, as well as AP-1 and STAT92E. In MMP-1 depleted flies, glia do not properly infiltrate neuropil regions after axotomy and, as a consequence, fail to clear degenerating axonal debris. This work identifies Draper-dependent activation of MMP-1 as a novel cascade required for proper glial clearance of severed axons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23611.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23611.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glial immunity</kwd><kwd>Wallerian degeneration</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Draper</kwd><kwd>matrix metalloproteinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn/AFAR Scholarship for Research in the Biology of Aging</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Purice</surname><given-names>Maria D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Neuroscience of Aging Training Grant T32AG023477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Purice</surname><given-names>Maria D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS084112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Speese</surname><given-names>Sean D</given-names></name><name><surname>Logan</surname><given-names>Mary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fred W.

These reactions provide neuroprotection and minimize further damage to the central nervous system (CNS. Changes in glial gene expression is one highly conserved feature of glia responding to a range of insults in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Barres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Logan and Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Logan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) cascade is one central player in initiating reactive astrocytic and microglial responses to neural damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ben Haim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Glial activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the downstream transcriptional heterodimer AP-1, which consists of c-Fos and c-Jun, has also been reported in various injury and disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pennypacker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 1995</xref>). However, it remains unclear what pathways are required to initiate these transcriptional programs and how they drive complex glial responses to neural injury.</p><p>Reactive glia often display prominent changes in cell shape, size, or motility in response to neuronal damage. Glial cells can migrate substantial distances to reach trauma sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roth et al., 2014</xref>). In other instances, glial somas remain in fixed locations while the cells extend elongated processes to rapidly enter regions that house damaged neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dissing-Olesen et al., 2014</xref>). These striking morphogenic responses ensure that glial cells gain access to sites of damage to release protective (and sometimes detrimental) factors and clear apopototic cells and degenerating projections through phagocytic engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hines et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Polazzi and Monti, 2010</xref>), but we still have an incomplete understanding of how these dynamic responses are elicited and carried out in reactive glia.</p><p>Glial responses to injury and disease share common features across species. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, acute axotomy triggers reactions from local glia that are strikingly similar to those observed in mammals. For example, severing adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory nerves that project into the antennal lobes of the central brain initiates a classic Wallerian degeneration (WD) program in olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoopfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). Over the course of several days, local glia extend membrane projections into the antennal lobe neuropil to phagocytose degenerating axonal and synaptic debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Logan and Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Logan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ziegenfuss et al., 2012</xref>). Common molecular pathways are also activated in fly and mammalian glia responding to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Awasaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macdonald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>). As in mammals, the transcription factors AP-1 and STAT92E are acutely induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ensheathing glia in response to axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macdonald et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, common molecules are required for glial clearance of engulfment targets across species, including the conserved Draper/MEGF10 receptor, downstream Syk tyrosine kinases, and Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Awasaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Logan and Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Logan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scheib et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the fly represents a powerful genetic model system to explore new molecular cascades and probe the basic mechanisms driving innate glial immune reactions.</p><p>In adult flies, axotomy triggers activation of the Draper receptor on local ensheathing glia, which, in turn, stimulates a positive auto-regulatory transcriptional loop. Specifically, STAT92E becomes activated and targets the <italic>draper</italic> locus to upregulate <italic>draper-I</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>). This response ensures that adequate levels of Draper are present at the cell surface of phagocytic reactive glia. Aside from STAT92E targeting of <italic>draper</italic>, virtually nothing is known about the transcriptional programs invoked in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> glia responding to neural injury. Here, we describe a new non-lethal nerve injury model which elicits widespread glial responses to neurodegeneration in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Using this assay, we carried out an RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of VNC tissue to identify axotomy-induced changes in gene expression. We also performed a detailed in vivo functional analysis of the secreted protease matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), a novel gene we found to be acutely upregulated in ensheathing glia responding to nerve injury. Interestingly, we show that MMP-1 induction in ensheathing glia requires Draper/STAT92E/AP-1 signaling. MMP-1 is required for proper glial recruitment to severed axons and, subsequently, timely clearance of degenerating axonal debris. Together, this work demonstrates an essential role for MMP-1 in glial recruitment and phagocytic responses post-axotomy and reveals a novel connection between Draper/STAT92E/AP-1 and requisite MMP-1 expression during glial responses to nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Draper is robustly upregulated in VNC ensheathing glia after axotomy</title><p>In the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, local ensheathing glial cells upregulate the pro-engulfment isoform <italic>draper-I</italic> in an AP-1/STAT92E-dependent manner in response to axotomy, suggesting that neurodegeneration triggers transcriptional programs in fly glia. However, the glial cells that surround antennal lobe neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref> antennal lobe, orange circles) represent a small percentage of total brain glia, which presents substantive challenges in assessing changes in antennal glial gene expression post-injury. We sought to develop an in vivo injury model that would elicit a broader glial response in order to identify differentially expressed genes using a large-scale transcriptional profiling screen. Recent studies revealed that peripheral sensory neurons in the wing undergo a classic Wallerian degeneration program and are cleared by glia in a Draper-dependent manner after axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fullard and Baker, 2015</xref>), suggesting that glial cells throughout the adult fly nervous system use common pathways to sense and respond to degenerating axons. Thus, we turned to the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of the fly with the goal of establishing a more robust in vivo nerve injury assay to query changes in glial gene expression. In adult flies, axons extending to and from the front, middle, and rear sets of legs project through the prothoracic (PN), mesothoracic (MN), and metathoracic (MtN) neuropil regions of the VNC, respectively. Sensory axons from the wing project through the VNC accessory mesothoracic (AMN) neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). First, we asked if Draper was upregulated in various axotomy paradigms in the VNC by surgically removing select peripheral tissues and then performing Draper immunostaining on dissected VNCs one day after injury. In uninjured animals, Draper was detectable around neuropil and throughout the cortex of the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, uninjured panels). In various injury paradigms, Draper was consistently upregulated selectively on severed nerves 24 hr after injury. For example, removal of a single wing or bilateral ablation of the front legs, resulted in strong Draper immunofluorescence in the neuropil that contained degenerating projections corresponding to each injured structure(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, decapitation elicited robust Draper upregulation throughout the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23611.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> VNC serves as a new model to study glial responses to acute axotomy.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and VNC showing major neuromere regions as uniquely colored circled regions in the CNS.

Removal of a single wing resulted in an expansion of ensheathing glial membrane and striking upregulation of Draper around the AMN neuropil on the injured side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Notably, these signals appeared to overlap (merged, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Ensheathing glial expression of Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> largely eliminated the ensheathing glial membrane expansion and Draper increase following left wing injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We did not detect any astrocyte membrane expansion following left wing injury, nor substantial Draper/astrocyte membrane overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In addition, expression of Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> in astrocytes did not attenuate injury-induced Draper upregulation following injury to the left wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

groups of injury-induced genes</title><p>Interestingly, components of known innate immunity signaling pathways were included in our list of differentially expressed genes. For example, we detected upregulation of JNK/AP-1 signaling components downstream of Draper, which is consistent with published work describing the role of the JNK/AP-1 pathway during glial recruitment/phagocytic responses to axonal injury in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macdonald et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). In addition, several members of the Spatzle/Toll pathway were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). The Toll pathway, including the downstream transcription factors Cactus and Dorsal, which are known players in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valanne et al., 2011</xref>), is elicited in response to Wallerian degeneration in vertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boivin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rotshenker, 2011</xref>). Finally, to date, only ~30 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes have been implicated in glial responses to nerve injury. When mutated, knocked down, or overexpressed in glia, these factors prevent proper clearance of degenerating axons. Nine of these genes (27%) were transcriptionally altered in our RNAseq screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). Together, these comparisons suggest that our method of transcriptional profiling the adult VNC after peripheral nerve injury is a valuable strategy to identify factors functionally coupled to innate glial immune responses.</p><p>Next, we performed confirmational Q-PCR on a subset of differentially expressed genes (8 upregulated and 2 downregulated) from our screen and measured transcript levels 5 hr after severing legs, wings, and heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). With the exception of CG6277, all genes were significantly changed in a manner consistent with our RNA-seq data. Correlation analysis comparing fold-change for all 10 genes (RNA-seq versus Q-PCR) revealed a Pearson’s coefficient of r = 0.860 (p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>), indicating the robustness of the RNAseq screen to accurately measure the magnitude of differential gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>RNA-seq reveals a novel candidate transcriptional target implicated in glial migration</title><p>Following neural injury, glial cells undergo dramatic changes in size, shape, and migratory behavior to ensure that they quickly infiltrate areas of trauma and efficiently clear degenerating neuronal debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bardehle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong and Stevens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Napoli and Neumann, 2009</xref>). However, the transcriptional cascades that govern these striking aspects of glial immune responses are not entirely clear. Thus, to glean new insight into the factors required for glial migration and altered membrane dynamics following nerve injury, we took a two-step approach to determine if our VNC injury RNA-seq results might reveal critical conserved genes implicated in cell migration, membrane remodeling, and related events. First, we used the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) to identify the closest orthologs for all differentially expressed genes in mouse and humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>), with the ultimate goal of focusing our analysis on conserved, upregulated genes. Next, we utilized Annokey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al., 2014</xref>), an open source tool that queries the Entrez Gene database and linked Pubmed articles with a user generated gene list and a set of user defined search terms. For our analysis, we compared the upregulated set of genes (≥2.0 fold, adj p&lt;0.01) and mammalian homologs against a set of ten search terms related to cell motility and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1a</xref>). The top ten genes with the highest search term matches are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1b</xref>; a complete summary of Annokey matches for all upregulated genes and associated Entrez Gene hyperlinks are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Table 1—Source code 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>.</p><p>One interesting gene that emerged from this analysis was matrix metalloproteinase-1 (<italic>Mmp-1</italic>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1a</xref>), which was a top ten Annokey match to our select search terms across all three species (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, mouse, and human) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1b</xref>) and was also robustly upregulated in injured VNC tissue by RNA-seq analysis (~12 fold) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). MMPs are proteases implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration, and metastasis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nagase and Woessner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rosenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Verma and Hansch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vu and Werb, 2000</xref>). The role of glia-derived MMPs in mammals is controversial. While some studies have shown that MMPs have detrimental roles in response to injury, others show that they are neuroprotective and promote CNS repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). A detailed analysis of MMP function has been hindered by the fact that there are over 23 partially redundant MMP genes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains only two MMP genes: <italic>Mmp-1</italic>, a secreted protease, and <italic>Mmp-2</italic>, which is GPI anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Page-McCaw et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we chose to take advantage of our <italic>Drosophila in vivo</italic> injury models to explore the role of MMP-1 during early responses to nerve axotomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>MMP-1 is upregulated in the adult nervous system following axotomy</title><p>The expression pattern of MMP-1 in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS is unknown.

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system contains two sets of external structures, the antennae and maxillary palps, which house ORNs that project to the antennal lobes in the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Removal of the antennae or maxillary palps severs the antennal or maxillary nerves, respectively, and local ensheathing glia respond by infiltrating the antennal lobes and clearing degenerating ORN material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>). One notable advantage of the olfactory system nerve injury assay is that it permits analysis of degenerating sensory axons projecting into the antennal lobes with no interference from injured efferent projections to the antennae or maxillary palps. First, we performed a small-scale comparative Q-PCR analysis of a few upregulated genes identified in our VNC RNA-seq screen. All three queried genes were significantly upregulated in the VNC after injury (<italic>Hairy</italic>, <italic>MMP-1</italic>, and <italic>Ets21C</italic>) and, importantly, also in the central brain 3 hr after severing the antennal and maxillary nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), further suggesting that common transcriptional cascades are stimulated in central brain and VNC glia after neural injury.</p><p>Next, we assessed MMP-1 levels by immunostaining 24 hr after severing olfactory nerves. In uninjured brains, MMP-1 was detected at low levels on the tracheal network (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). MMP-1 levels were dramatically increased in the antennal lobe neuropil regions 24 hr after severing both antennal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, middle panel); we also observed a striking increase specifically on maxillary palp glomeruli after bilateral maxillary nerve injury (arrowheads, right panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that MMP-1 is acutely upregulated in the adult olfactory system after axotomy.</p><p>Finally, we hypothesized that ensheathing glia are responsible for the MMP-1 increase in the antennal lobes after olfactory nerve injury since (a) we observe a robust overlap between MMP-1 and ensheathing glial membranes in the injured VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and (b) based on all known transcriptional and cellular readouts, ensheathing glia are the primary responders to antennal or maxillary nerve injury in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system. We performed a more detailed analysis of MMP-1 localization in the antennal lobes after olfactory nerve axotomy by using various drivers to express membrane-tethered GFP (<italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic>) in distinct cell types of the antennal lobe, including ensheathing glia (<italic>TIFR-Gal4</italic>), astrocytes (<italic>alrm-Gal4</italic>), a subset of maxillary palp ORNs (<italic>OR85e-Gal4),</italic> or in all ORNs with the pan-ORN driver (<italic>orco-Gal4</italic>). Notably, after antennal nerve injury, we observed overlap of MMP-1 and expanding ensheathing glial membranes but not astrocytic membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). Moreover, we do not observe MMP-1 accumulation on uninjured maxillary palp projections (dotted outlined regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>) despite the fact they were surrounded by degenerating antennal ORN axons after antennal nerve injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23611.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MMP-1 largely overlaps with ensheathing glia and degenerating axons after olfactory nerve injury.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Representative high magnification images of MMP-1 expression three days after antennal nerve injury in flies expressing membrane tethered GFP in discrete antennal lobe cell types.

We should note that because our VNC harvests did not utilize a glial-specific isolation strategy, our dataset likely contains some transcripts upregulated in neurons projecting to peripheral injured structures. Notably, mammalian CNS motor neuron axons do not regenerate after mechanical or ischemic injury unless intrinsic proregenerative transcriptional programs are activated through neuron preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neumann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qiu et al., 2005</xref>).

It remains to be determined if the adult VNC injury model will reveal transcriptional changes in motor neurons (or other neuronal subtypes) that are components of a preconditioning program.</p><p>Our screen revealed MMP-1 as a novel gene upregulated in ensheathing glia in the fly CNS in response to axon degeneration. In addition, we discovered that injury-induced expression of MMP-1 in glia requires the engulfment receptor Draper, as well as the transcription factors AP-1 and STAT92E. Our AP-1 and STAT92E loss of function results mirror findings in other organisms that report MMP genes are regulated by JNK signaling, AP-1 and/or STAT92E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chakraborti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Korzus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stevens and Page-McCaw, 2012</xref>), highlighting the AP-1/STAT92E/MMP-1 cascade as an evolutionarily conserved module of innate glial immunity. Previous work has demonstrated a requisite role for Draper during infiltration of Drosophila neuropil after olfactory nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ziegenfuss et al., 2012</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms were unclear. Our work is now the first to couple Draper, which is classically considered an engulfment recognition receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Logan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tasdemir-Yilmaz and Freeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), to a transcriptional cascade that we propose actively promotes extracellular matrix remodeling and glial cell motility via MMP-1 induction. Indeed, MMPs can cleave extracellular matrix molecules to accommodate increased cell migration in a variety of organs and cell types, including metastatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Alem and Curry, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deryugina and Quigley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Page-McCaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thakur and Bedogni, 2016</xref>). MMPs can also target specific ligands or receptors to reveal cryptic sites and modulate intercellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bauvois, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chakraborti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that in response to adult antennal nerve axotomy, activation of the ensheathing glial receptor Draper is required for the production of the secreted protease MMP-1 in ensheathing glial cells within 24 hr. Our results also reveal that loss of MMP-1 inhibits dynamic membrane expansion of ensheathing glia and delays glial clearance of degenerating olfactory receptor neuron axons. We favor a model in which released MMP-1 remodels the extracellular matrix – and perhaps transmembrane molecules (e.g. adhesion factors) - to facilitate ensheathing glial infiltration into the inner regions of the antennal lobes that house a large number of degenerating axons. This model is supported by the fact that we observe increasing levels of MMP-1 in more central regions of the antennal lobes over time (three days post-injury, as compared to one day post-injury), a time that closely corresponds to ensheathing glia membrane extension and accumulation within the central antennal lobes. However, we can’t exclude the possibility that secreted MMP-1 also cleaves factors on degenerating axons to encourage fragmentation or perhaps even release peptide fragments that serve as secondary ligands to further stimulate responses from local ensheathing glia.</p><p>MMPs do not appear to cleave target proteins at specific consensus sites. Therefore, identifying the likely abundant MMP targets in the CNS has been an ongoing challenge. One molecule cleaved by <italic>Drosophila</italic> MMP-1 during development is the transmembrane adhesion factor NinjurinA (NinjA). Most organs of the fly contain an intricate tracheal network that transports essential gases or fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Samakovlis et al., 1996</xref>), and MMP-1 cleavage of NinjA on the surface of tracheal cells is essential for proper branching and formation of a mature tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, Ninjurins are a conserved family of factors that were initially identified by screening for upregulated genes in a rodent nerve injury assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araki and Milbrandt, 1996</xref>). Several groups have since confirmed that one or more Ninjurins are upregulated in injury, stress, and inflammation models, although the specific function of Ninjurins is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jennewein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, NinjA was also upregulated in our VNC injury screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), and it will be interesting to explore a potential mechanistic connection between MMP-1 and NinjA in the context of glial recruitment to injury sites and phagocytic clearance of degenerating axonal debris. Finally, the mammalian genomes contain about two dozen MMP genes, and the encoded proteases fall into three different structural categories: secreted, GPI-anchored, and transmembrane-tethered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chakraborti et al., 2003</xref>). The significance of spatially restricting select MMPs is still unclear. <italic>Drosophila</italic> MMP-1 is secreted, while MMP-2 is GPI-anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Page-McCaw, 2008</xref>), and it remains unclear whether MMP-2 also contributes to innate glial immunity in the adult fly brain. Nonetheless, the fly clearly offers a powerful model to explore important questions about target specificity and release mechanisms of MMP in reactive glia, as well as in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to influencing disease and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gialeli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rosenberg, 2002</xref>) and injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Candelario-Jalil et al., 2009</xref>), MMPs can also influence structural and functional synaptic remodeling in the healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujioka et al., 2012</xref>). For example, MMP-9 levels are significantly increased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus after induction of late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huntley, 2012</xref>). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MMP-9 blocks not only L-LTP, but also the spine enlargement that is typically associated with persistent LTP. Conversely, gain of function experiments have revealed that MMP-9 is sufficient to promote synaptic structural remodeling, likely through proteolytic cleavage of integrins and/or integrin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huntley, 2012</xref>). These recent findings introduce new concerns for how pathological release of MMPs might influence neural circuitry and function. High levels of MMP activity or expression could contribute to maladaptive wiring after acute injury and in disease states. Elucidating the upstream signaling pathways that modulate MMP expression, as well as defining the full array of MMP targets in the healthy and diseased brain, will be critical to parse out the protective versus potentially detrimental role of MMPs in the CNS. Given that the Draper receptor, STAT, AP-1, and MMP family of secreted proteases are all highly conserved, we anticipate that our work will provide new insight into how MEGF10 mechanistically contributes to glial engulfment of apoptotic neurons and synaptic/axonal clearance, as well as functional neuronal recovery, in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peripheral nervous system (PNS) axotomy assay</title><p>Peripheral nerve injury was induced in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> by removing legs, wings, and/or head with Vannas scissors (World Precision Instruments # 500260 G, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008593">SCR_008593</ext-link>) while flies were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Oren Schuldiner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Purice et al. examine the molecular mechanisms underlying glial clearance of neuronal debris following neuronal injury. The authors show that a transcriptional program mediated by the cell surface receptor Draper and its downstream target, a STAT protein, occurs following a number of neuronal injury paradigms. They use the prevalence of the response to characterize gene expression changes in nerve cords where most neurons are undergoing degeneration, and identify targets. Analysis reveals that one gene, encoding a matrix metalloprotease MMP-1, is upregulated and secreted by glia. MMP-1 is required for morphological changes in glia, and for efficient engulfment of neuronal debris, and represents the first known functional target of the Draper injury signaling pathway.</p><p>How glia react to neuron injury is an important and active field of research as it lies at the heart of development, plasticity, and disease of the nervous system. The work in this paper takes an important step forward in identifying a strategy to explore underlying molecular mechanisms, and in identifying a specific molecular effector. The paper is very clearly written, the experiments appear well controlled, and overall the conclusions justified. However, several points and concerns should be addressed as summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data demonstrate that ensheathing glial MMP1 is required for the clearance of severed axons as well as glial membrane expansion in response to nerve injury. While the data show that it is ensheathing glial MMP that has a regulatory role in the injury response, it appears that by 3 days post injury, MMP1 is not localized to ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is a bit unclear how the authors are envisioning how MMP1 is acting to regulate membrane expansion. Is the idea that MMP1 is secreted by ensheathing glia and that by 3 days post injury, ensheathing glial MMP1 is binding to/acting on a different cell type? The data seem to suggest that this could be a very likely possibility. To explore this further, the authors should provide some high magnification images at 3 days post injury of MMP1 stains with counter stains for other tissue types like astrocytes, neuronal debris, and healthy neurons.</p><p>2) The analysis of glial subtypes is a bit simplistic and could be clarified. Please include a magnified image of the anti-Drpr and CD8 driven by the TIFR and Alrm-Gal4s to provide more convincing evidence that indeed Draper is expressed in ensheathing glia. To strengthen the claim that these cells are ensheathing and not astrocytes, then cell specific RNAi followed by draper staining is needed. Otherwise this should be toned down in the text.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is important. However, the statements in the paper claim to have identified a Stat/Drpr/MMP1 cascade – for this, I think it is important to at least try to rescue the <italic>draper<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype with overexpression of MMP1 by ensheathing glia.</p><p>4) A more rigorous analysis of the RNASeq data is needed as well as more details and clarity on methods and decision on cutoffs and better presentation of data is needed. While no additional experiments are necessary, this is important as the RNASeq data are a key part of the paper and would significantly improve the logic of the connection between the two parts of the study.</p><p>*Specific comments and suggestions from one reviewer are included below.</p><p>Please include the raw data and explain what is a read and other necessary details of method and analyses. For example: how many genes were considered as &quot;expressed&quot; and how was this determined (is one read sufficient? Ten reads?). How were these reads normalized? At low expression levels the noise is very high – therefore, have the authors performed any thresholding to decide which expression data are reliable enough to actually compare – resulting in the total number of genes actually compared (one way to figure out a reasonable threshold would be to scatter plot – on log axes – two repeats and see from what expression levels they actually look similar); all these analyses should result in one big xls file that is well annotated and can be easily read – together, this would be the &quot;data&quot; which would be used for the comparisons.</p><p>Comparison of the expression before and after injury: why was 1.2 fold chosen? this seems a bit low and p-values seem small, raising the possibility that the flow of the analysis needs to be reevaluated. All this results in a volcano plot in which the data is spread out and it is thus unclear how many genes are &quot;grey&quot; – thus not statistically changing their expression? This is also evident in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 5</xref> – all the genes that are expressed in the data set are unregulated. Seems unlikely that there are no genes that are present but not up or down regulated. The Y-axis for the volcano plot needs to be corrected to -log10 (p-value). The KEGG/GO analysis is not informative at all – what do we learn from this?</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> – the Annokey algorithm is not very informative (and therefore not very heavily used.) I understand that the authors want to find a meaningful way to transition from the RNAseq data to MMP1.; however, this transition could be improved. One suggestion is to focus on one group of genes (which should obviously include MMP1, #13 in the entire list) and then check a few candidates and finally focus on MMP1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A novel <italic>Drosophila</italic> injury model reveals severed axons are cleared through a Draper/MMP-1 signaling cascade&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance that relates to the analyses of the RNAseq data as outlined below.</p><p>We suggest considering using a more conventional 2-fold change cut off for the analyses. However if a 1.2 fold change cut off is used, please provide ample explanation and justification as suggested by reviewer #2 below. Given the heterogeneity of the system, it is possible that key genes involved in glial response to injury may only be modestly upregulated in this transcriptional screen, but still be biologically relevant, as pointed out in your response to reviewer comment 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this revised manuscript the authors have significantly improved many aspects and have addressed most of my concerns. However, one point still bothers me quite substantially. I even consulted with an expert on analyses of RNA seq and he agreed with me that:</p><p>1) If the authors feel very strong about the 1.2 FC then they should explain their rationale within the text. I discourage the authors for going here – as one key reason for the low FC of some genes is the heterogeneity of the sample, in which some people might say – so why didn't they sort the glial cells to get a &quot;tighter&quot; expression pattern.</p><p>2) Use a 2FC – in reality, almost all of the genes that the authors want to highlight, like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> ARE induced by a factor of more than two – with the exception of Dor and Ced-6. I think it's a reasonable price to pay. You get a much tighter list of about 350 DE genes. MMP is also unregulated by MORE than 2FC. So I really don't see a good reason why not to opt for this solution.</p><p>3) A compromise might be the following: Do most of the analysis as suggested in #2 but then explain that many more potentially DE genes might exhibit a less than 2FC because the tissue is heterogeneous and for that reason, the authors are also providing another list of DE genes with a FC of 1.5 or 1.2 or whatever.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23611.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The data demonstrate that ensheathing glial MMP1 is required for the clearance of severed axons as well as glial membrane expansion in response to nerve injury. While the data show that it is ensheathing glial MMP that has a regulatory role in the injury response, it appears that by 3 days post injury, MMP1 is not localized to ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct. We do see robust overlap between ensheathing glia (e.g. ensheathing glial driven GFP) and MMP1 at the periphery of the antennal lobes (where the glial cell bodies reside) in the first ~24 hours after antennal nerve injury. This MMP1 immunofluorescence appears to “shift” over days and by 3 days post-axotomy, more MMP1 is detected in interior regions of the antennal lobes. We propose that at day 1, much of the MMP1 signal at the periphery is MMP1 peptide that is being actively translated, transported, and recently released from the glial cells. Over the course of several days, we propose that this secreted factor (MMP1) becomes more apparent in interior regions of the lobes as it precedes thin extending glial membranes in the core region of the lobes. We attempted to demonstrate this shift by comparing MMP1 levels at the border of the antennal lobes (“AL Border”) and in the interior of the antennal lobes (“Inside AL”) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>). We acknowledge, however, that this concept could be described in greater depth in the body of the manuscript and have now modified the Results and Discussion to further clarify our observations in this set of experiments and how they are coupled to potential models. We should also note that following glial expression of MMP1<sup>RNAi</sup>, we observe no MMP1 in the antennal lobes 3 days after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which argues against possibility that local antennal lobe neurons (second order projections neurons, interneurons, etc.) are producing MMP1 and serving as the source of MMP1 in the interior regions of the antennal lobes.</p><p><italic>It is a bit unclear how the authors are envisioning how MMP1 is acting to regulate membrane expansion. Is the idea that MMP1 is secreted by ensheathing glia and that by 3 days post injury, ensheathing glial MMP1 is binding to/acting on a different cell type? The data seem to suggest that this could be a very likely possibility. To explore this further, the authors should provide some high magnification images at 3 days post injury of MMP1 stains with counter stains for other tissue types like astrocytes, neuronal debris, and healthy neurons.</italic> </p><p>Yes, our favored model is that secreted MMP1 is targeting a key extracellular matrix molecule (or set of molecules) to accommodate additional glial membrane extension into the inner regions of the antennal lobes and more easily access degenerating axons. We cannot exclude the possibility that MMP is instead (or in addition) cleaving factors on the damaged axons to 1) enhance the physical degeneration of the injured nerves or 2) cleave axonal molecules to release additional injury signals that feedback to responding glia. These are all very interesting questions that we hope to investigate in the coming years. We have expanded the manuscript to further describe these models.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the above suggestion. We used various genetic drivers to express membrane-tethered GFP in 1) ensheathing glia, 2) astrocytes, 3) uninjured OR85e maxillary palp axons, or 4) all olfactory receptor neurons. In a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we now show high magnification images of antennal lobe regions showing MMP-1 staining and each GFP-labeled subtype three days after axotomy (and uninjured controls). Briefly, we detect MMP-1 signal overlap with ensheathing glial membranes and actively degenerating axons, but not with astrocytes or intact subsets of olfactory receptor neuron projections – even those that are immediately adjacent to degenerating axons. Please see new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and corresponding text for further details. We should note that this light microscopy analysis does not provide adequate resolution to definitively state if a small area of MMP1-positive fluorescence is directly associating with the ensheathing glial membrane, axon, or synaptic region. Future efforts that identify and characterize the specific MMP1 cleavage target(s), and where they reside, in this context will give us greater insight into how MMP1 is transported and functioning in the 3D space of the antennal lobe after nerve injury.</p><p><italic>2) The analysis of glial subtypes is a bit simplistic and could be clarified. Please include a magnified image of the anti-Drpr and CD8 driven by the TIFR and Alrm-Gal4s to provide more convincing evidence that indeed Draper is expressed in ensheathing glia. To strengthen the claim that these cells are ensheathing and not astrocytes, then cell specific RNAi followed by draper staining is needed. Otherwise this should be toned down in the text.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have now provided high magnification images of Draper immunostaining and GFP-labeled membranes (ensheathing and astrocytes) in the injured VNC (new version <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D</xref>). In addition, we replicated this VNC injury assay (wing injury) in flies expressing Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> in either ensheathing glia (TIFR-Gal4) or astrocytes (alrm-Gal4) and assessed anti-Draper and GFP signals. Briefly, expression of Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> in ensheathing glia resulted in almost a complete loss of Draper signal and no notable changes in glial membranes after wing injury. Knockdown of Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> in astrocytes did not appear to alter Draper upregulation after wing injury. (Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E</xref> and the body of the text for more detail.) These results strongly suggest that ensheathing are responding to peripheral nerve injury, as in the adult olfactory system. Although we cannot rule out an as-yet-unknown response from astrocytes (for which we do not currently possess a readout), we feel our collective results validate a focused analysis on ensheathing glia, with regard to Draper/MMP1 activation and ensheathing glial migration and phagocytosis following nerve injury.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is important. However, the statements in the paper claim to have identified a Stat/Drpr/MMP1 cascade – for this, I think it is important to at least try to rescue the draper-/- phenotype with overexpression of MMP1 by ensheathing glia.</italic> </p><p>We have attempted to perform MMP1 rescue experiments using two different strategies. Unfortunately, both approaches have been unsuccessful, and it’s currently impossible for us to provide any conclusive results. First, we tried to co-express UAS-Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> and UAS-MMP-1 under the control of the glial drivers repo-Gal4 or TIFR-Gal4. These flies also carried the tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> transgene so that we could temporally control Gal4 activity and express Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> and MMP-1 in adult glial cells. Although these experimental flies successfully eclosed as adults, they died with ~24 hours after shifting the temperature of the flies to “turn on” Gal4. This lethality appears to be due to the overexpression of MMP-1 since 1) Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> can be expressed successfully in glia for weeks in adult animals and 2) control cohorts flies overexpressing glial MMP-1 (lacking the UAS-Draper<sup>RNAi</sup> transgene) died within a similar timeframe. Unfortunately, a &lt; 24-hour temperature shift in these experimental flies is insufficient to knockdown Draper levels in glia. Next, we attempted to generate new transgenic strains that would ultimately allow us to produce the following set of experimental flies: OR85e-mCD8::GFP,tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/UAS-MMP1; TIFR-Gal4, DraperD5rec9/ DraperD5rec9. These flies would allow us to force expression of MMP-1 in adult ensheathing glia in draper null mutant flies and assess clearance of severed olfactory neuron axons. Unfortunately, these experimental flies failed to eclose as adults. It is most likely that this lethality is due to genetic background incompatibility, as opposed to MMP-1 expression.</p><p>Although we could attempt this rescue experiment with a fresh approach (new genetic strains, etc.), it would take a substantial amount of time. In addition, we propose that a conclusive result, positive or negative, would not alter our Draper/STAT/MMP1 model. Rescuing axon clearance in draper mutant flies with forced MMP-1 expression would indeed support our findings. We argue, however, that a failure to rescue would not be sufficient to exclude this model. There may be numerous transcriptional targets downstream of Draper that are essential to orchestrate a proper glial immune response. Forced expression of MMP-1 alone may simply not be sufficient to override the loss of the Draper and other downstream factors that are reliant on Draper activation.</p><p><italic>4) A more rigorous analysis of the RNASeq data is needed as well as more details and clarity on methods and decision on cutoffs and better presentation of data is needed. While no additional experiments are necessary, this is important as the RNASeq data are a key part of the paper and would significantly improve the logic of the connection between the two parts of the study.</italic> </p><p><italic>*Specific comments and suggestions from one reviewer are included below.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for providing thorough and thoughtful feedback regarding the presentation of our RNAseq results. We have done a substantial re-work of the data and agree that this provides additional key information regarding the analysis and more coherent presentation of our findings.</p><p><italic>Please include the raw data and explain what is a read and other necessary details of method and analyses. For example: how many genes were considered as &quot;expressed&quot; and how was this determined (is one read sufficient? Ten reads?). How were these reads normalized? At low expression levels the noise is very high – therefore, have the authors performed any thresholding to decide which expression data are reliable enough to actually compare – resulting in the total number of genes actually compared (one way to figure out a reasonable threshold would be to scatter plot – on log axes – two repeats and see from what expression levels they actually look similar); all these analyses should result in one big xls file that is well annotated and can be easily read – together, this would be the &quot;data&quot; which would be used for the comparisons.</italic> </p><p>To address the above concerns, we have made a number of changes to the analysis and presentation of the RNA-seq screen results:</p><p>1) We have now provided data sets with the raw reads and read counts. Specifically, we have supplied an excel file with the raw read counts for all genes from both conditions (uninjured and injured) and all biological replicates. This information can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref> and included in our uploaded data to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The GEO data also includes FASTQ files that contain the raw read sequences. We have provided a private GEO link that the reviewers can use to access this data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=oxaraumktfwhlyv&amp;acc=GSE92759">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=oxaraumktfwhlyv&amp;acc=GSE92759</ext-link>). After clicking the above link, enter “GSE92759” into the “GEO accession” box and click the “GO” tab.</p><p>2) In order to classify any given gene as “expressed,” we took the following approach: First, to normalize for differences in transcript length and read depth, raw read counts were converted to Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) (Wagner et al., 2012) by first dividing the raw read counts by the length of the longest annotated transcript for a given gene and then dividing by the number of mapped reads for a given biological replicate (these results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Second, the gene list was filtered to ensure at least one group (Injured or Uninjured) had an average TPM value &gt;2, an appropriate, previously reported cutoff for identifying actively transcribed genes (Wagner et al., 2013). Based on this filtering, 9,364 out of 14,253 genes were deemed “expressed” in our dataset. Notably, we queried the FlyBase RNAseq expression database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/static_pages/rna-seq/rna-seq_profile_search.html">http://flybase.org/static_pages/rna-seq/rna-seq_profile_search.html</ext-link>) using a expression threshold level of 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase million), and found that 9,363 and 9,219 genes are expressed in the L3 larval CNS and adult head, respectively, which provides confidence that our calculation of 9,364 expressed genes in the adult ventral nerve cord is a valid value.</p><p>3) While exploring the p-values associated with our differential gene expression analysis (addressed below in reviewer comment #2), we opted to use an alternative program, Shiny Transcriptome Analysis Resource Tool (START), to assess differential expression in our uninjured versus injured VNC samples (Nelson et al., 2016). Ultimately, the START analysis identified 348 fewer genes that were significantly changed (as compared to our previous EdgeR analysis). Thus, we have decided to report the more conservative START results in our revised manuscript, however this does not alter any of the key conclusions in the manuscript. In addition to using this new analysis method, we have more clearly explained how the data were analyzed in the Results and Materials and methods sections. We have also added a number of quality control analyses including a PCA analysis, sample distance heatmaps, and a correlation analysis (included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), which more clearly presents the quality of our dataset.</p><p><italic>Comparison of the expression before and after injury: why was 1.2 fold chosen? this seems a bit low and p-values seem small, raising the possibility that the flow of the analysis needs to be reevaluated. All this results in a volcano plot in which the data is spread out and it is thus unclear how many genes are &quot;grey&quot; – thus not statistically changing their expression?</italic> </p><p>The choice to use 1.2-fold change as a cut-off is three-fold:</p><p>1) Our re-analysis of the data has resulted in a new volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which addresses the valid concerns raised by the reviewer regarding visibility of the data points and plotting scale. Even with our new analysis (START) and cutoffs for significance, we still detect 169 genes that are significantly changed (green dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: – adj. p-value &lt;.03) but fall below our threshold of 1.2-fold change (log2FC=.263), suggesting that our cutoff of 1.2-fold may be on the conservative side.</p><p>2) Published research has identified numerous <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes known to be functionally involved in glial responses to axon injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>, previously Source Data 5). Our RNAseq analysis revealed that two of these genes were significantly up-regulated in the 1.2-fold range (Stat92e, 1.204-fold; Akt1, 1.253-fold). Moreover, 4 additional genes shown to be essential for proper glial responses to axon injury (InR, Pi3K92E, dos, and ced-6) were upregulated in the range of 1.3 to 1.7-fold. Even the critical glial immune response gene draper, which we know is at least 5-fold upregulated in the ventral nerve cord based on Q-PCR experiments, was only detected as upregulated 2.1-fold in the RNA-seq dataset. Together, these observations suggest that critical genes may only be modestly upregulated in our transcriptional screen.</p><p>3) Finally, instead of using an adjusted p-value of 0.05, we have conservatively set the adjusted p-value (Benjamini Hochberg) cutoff to &lt;0.03 to increase our confidence in designating a gene as differentially expressed, despite a smaller fold change in expression.</p><p>Regarding our initial p-values reported by the EdgeR analysis and adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg, we did find that re-analysis with the START program resulted in higher p-values, although the calculated fold change for any given gene are very similar with both pipelines. Overall, despite the shift in p-values, no key results within the manuscript were altered. For example, in comparing our revised <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 4</xref> with the previous version (named Source Data 5 in original submission), the same genes are deemed significantly differentially expressed via both pipelines. The only exception is ced-6, which was accidentally omitted from the original Source Data 5 table in our original submission.</p><p><italic>This is also evident in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 5</xref> – all the genes that are expressed in the data set are unregulated. Seems unlikely that there are no genes that are present but not up or down regulated.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion prompted by poor labeling in this data file. Now renamed <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 4</xref> in the resubmission, our column label suggested that a subset of genes were not expressed, when our intention was to indicate that they were not differentially expressed in injured VNC samples. This file has now been modified and more clearly labeled.</p><p><italic>The Y-axis for the volcano plot needs to be corrected to -log10 (p-value).</italic> </p><p>This label has been changed.</p><p><italic>The KEGG/GO analysis is not informative at all – what do we learn from this?</italic> </p><p>In order to conceptually streamline the presentation of the RNA-seq data, we have removed the KEGG/GO analysis.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> – the Annokey algorithm is not very informative (and therefore not very heavily used.) I understand that the authors want to find a meaningful way to transition from the RNAseq data to MMP1.; however, this transition could be improved. One suggestion is to focus on one group of genes (which should obviously include MMP1, #13 in the entire list) and then check a few candidates and finally focus on MMP1.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, a common challenge with large-scale screens is deciding how to strategically hone in on one factor, or a small set of specific factors, for follow-up in vivo analysis. Some choose to “focus on one group of genes” by choosing, for example, the top 10 most robustly upregulated genes; others may choose to focus on specific signaling pathway of choice. We opted to use Annokey so that we targeted a specific biological process (cell migration/invasion) that was informed by prior biological knowledge and published literature, but not biased by fold-upregulation in our screen, particularly since critical glial factors (e.g. draper) were not robustly upregulated in the RNA-seq dataset. In addition to Mmp-1, we are exploring several additional genes upregulated in our RNA-seq screen and investigating their role during axon degeneration and glial immunity in adult flies, but these preliminary results will form the basis for future manuscripts. We have modified the text in the Results section (which includes Annokey description) in hopes of making the transition from our screen description to our analysis of Mmp-1 in glial responses to nerve injury smoother.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance that relates to the analyses of the RNAseq data as outlined below.</italic> </p><p><italic>We suggest considering using a more conventional 2-fold change cut off for the analyses. However if a 1.2 fold change cut off is used, please provide ample explanation and justification as suggested by reviewer #2 below. Given the heterogeneity of the system, it is possible that key genes involved in glial response to injury may only be modestly upregulated in this transcriptional screen, but still be biologically relevant, as pointed out in your response to reviewer comment 2.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this revised manuscript the authors have significantly improved many aspects and have addressed most of my concerns. However, one point still bothers me quite substantially. I even consulted with an expert on analyses of RNA seq and he agreed with me that:</italic></p><p><italic>1) If the authors feel very strong about the 1.2 FC then they should explain their rationale within the text. I discourage the authors for going here – as one key reason for the low FC of some genes is the heterogeneity of the sample, in which some people might say – so why didn't they sort the glial cells to get a &quot;tighter&quot; expression pattern.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Use a 2FC – in reality, almost all of the genes that the authors want to highlight, like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> ARE induced by a factor of more than two – with the exception of Dor and Ced-6. I think it's a reasonable price to pay. You get a much tighter list of about 350 DE genes. MMP is also unregulated by MORE than 2FC. So I really don't see a good reason why not to opt for this solution.</italic> </p><p><italic>3) A compromise might be the following: Do most of the analysis as suggested in #2 but then explain that many more potentially DE genes might exhibit a less than 2FC because the tissue is heterogeneous and for that reason, the authors are also providing another list of DE genes with a FC of 1.5 or 1.2 or whatever.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #2’s comments underscore a thoughtful ongoing debate in the scientific community as to how much weight should be applied to various features of comparative transcriptome data, including fold change and <italic>p</italic>-values, to identifying biologically meaningful sets of genes. To address the concerns of reviewer 2, we have made several changes to our data analysis and presentation. First, we repeated our differential gene expression analysis using a more stringent adjusted p value of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, as opposed to our previous threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.03. We have also parsed out our results such that the results presented in the primary figures of the manuscript utilize a 2.0-fold change cutoff, while differentially expressed genes that fall within the 1.2 – 2.0-fold range are listed separately in supplemental source data files. As noted by the reviewer, because of tissue heterogeneity in nerve cord samples, this cohort of genes (1.2 – 2.0-fold change) may include biologically relevant factors that are</p><p>underrepresented (with regard to their fold induction). The fact that our initial positive control (Draper), which is a well-described innate immunity gene, was differentially expressed in our RNAseq screen by 2.09-fold supports this notion. Although we have excluded the 1.2-2.0 FC cohort of genes from the primary analysis, we favor providing this list of genes in an accessible manner to readers who may be interested in exploring their putative role in glial immunity in other systems/contexts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
