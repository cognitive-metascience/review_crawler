exogenous and endogenous cues such as age, day length, light, nutrients, and temperature. Previous studies have shown that the gradual decline in microRNA156 (miR156) with age promotes the expression of adult traits. However, how age temporally regulates the abundance of miR156 is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of miR156 responds to sugar. Sugar represses miR156 expression at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level through the degradation of miR156 primary transcripts. Defoliation and photosynthetic mutant assays further demonstrate that sugar from the pre-existing leaves acts as a mobile signal to repress miR156, and subsequently triggers the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in young leaf primordia. We propose that the gradual increase in sugar after seed germination serves as an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00269.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00269.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like animals, plants go through several stages of development before they reach maturity, and it has long been thought that some of the transitions between these stages are triggered by changes in the nutritional status of the plant. Now, based on experiments with the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Yu et al. and, independently, Yang et al. have provided fresh insights into the role of sugar in ‘vegetative phase change'—the transition from the juvenile form of a plant to the adult plant.</p><p>The new work takes advantage of the fact that vegetative phase change is controlled by two genes that encode microRNAs (MIRNAs). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has eight <italic>MIR156</italic> genes and both groups confirmed that supplying plants with sugar reduces the expression of two of these—<italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>—while sugar deprivation increases their expression. Removing leaves also leads to upregulation of both genes, and delays the juvenile-to-adult transition. Given that this effect can be partially reversed by providing the plant with sugar, it is likely that sugar produced in the leaves—or one of its metabolites—is the signal that triggers the juvenile-to-adult transition through the reduction of miR156 levels.</p><p>Yu and co-workers confirmed that sugar also reduces the expression of <italic>MIR156</italic> in tobacco, moss, and tomato plants, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Consistent with the work of Yang and colleagues, Yu and co-workers revealed that sugar is able to reduce the transcription of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> genes into messenger RNA. Moreover, they showed that sugar can also suppress <italic>MIR156</italic> expression by promoting the breakdown of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> primary messenger RNA transcripts.</p><p>The work of Yu et al. and Yang et al. has thus provided key insights into the mechanisms by which a leaf-derived signal controls a key developmental change in plants. Just as fruit flies use their nutritional status to regulate the onset of metamorphosis, and mammals use it to control the onset of puberty, so plants use the level of sugar in their leaves to trigger the transition from juvenile to adult forms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00269.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00269.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>developmental timing</kwd><kwd>sugar</kwd><kwd>juvenile-to-adult phase transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31222029; 91217306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB127000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Jirong</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Recruitment Program of Global Expects (China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Pujiang Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12PJ1409900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Initiation grant from National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics (Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KSCX2-YW-N-069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sugar levels in leaves act as a signal for plants to switch from their juvenile to their adult form by regulating the expression of two genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>After seed germination, plants undergo two developmental transitions: juvenile-to-adult and adult-to-reproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäurle and Dean, 2006</xref>). The transition from the juvenile to adult phase is marked by acquisition of reproductive competence and changes in leaf morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Poethig, 2010</xref>). The adult to reproductive transition, also known as flowering, transforms the identity of the shoot apical meristem from vegetative into inflorescence. Physiological and genetic studies have demonstrated that both developmental transitions are regulated not only by environmental signals such as day length, light intensity, and ambient temperature, but also by endogenous signals transmitted by plant hormones and age.</p><p>microRNA156 (miR156), which targets SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcriptional factors, provides an endogenous age cue for developmental timing in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Poethig, 2010</xref>). The expression of miR156 decreases over time, with a concomitant rise in SPL level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu and Poethig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Overexpression of miR156 prolongs the juvenile phase, whereas a reduction in miR156 level results in an accelerated expression of adult traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu and Poethig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). SPL promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition and flowering through activation of miR172 and MADS-box genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamaguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2011</xref>). Very recently, defoliation experiments and expression analyses demonstrated that the repression of miR156 in the leaf primordia is mediated by a mobile signal(s) derived from the pre-existing leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al. 2011</xref>). However, the identity of this signal is still unknown.</p><p>In addition to being essential as prime carbon and energy sources, sugars also play critical roles as signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rolland and Sheen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smeekens et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, diverse sugar signals are perceived and transduced through a glucose sensor, HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1). HXK1 exerts its regulatory function through distinct molecular mechanisms including transcriptional activation, translational inhibition, mRNA decay, and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rolland and Sheen, 2005</xref>). Analyses of two catalytic inactive <italic>HXK1</italic> alleles further indicate that the signaling activity of HXK1 is uncoupled from its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, a nuclear HXK1 complex has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). In this complex, HXK1 binds to two unconventional partners, the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase B1 (VHA-B1) and the 19S regulatory particle of a proteasome subunit (RPT5B). Since neither VHA-B1 nor RPT5B has DNA binding capacity, the precise molecular mechanism by which this nuclear-localized HXK1 complex regulates gene expression remains unanswered. In addition to the HXK1-dependent pathway, some glucose-responsive genes are regulated through an HXK1-independent pathway. For instance, the expression of the genes encoding chalcone synthase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and asparagine synthase responds to glucose signaling in the absence of HXK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed expression and mutant analyses to identify the upstream regulator of miR156. Our results demonstrate that the expression of miR156 quickly responds to sugar. Sugar reduces miR156 abundance through both transcriptional repression and transcript degradation. Thus, gradual accumulation of sugar after seed germination leads to a reduced level of miR156, which promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> have dominant roles within the <italic>MIR156</italic> gene family</title><p>The transition from juvenile to adult phase in Arabidopsis is accompanied by changes in vegetative morphology. Under long day conditions, the wild type Arabidopsis plants switch from the juvenile to the adult phase from the fifth or sixth leaf. The juvenile leaves are round, smooth on their margins, and barely develop trichomes (leaf hairs) on the abaxial side (lower side). By contrast, the adult leaves are elongated, serrated, and produce abaxial trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the Arabidopsis genome, miR156 is encoded by eight coding loci (<italic>MIR156A</italic>–<italic>MIR156H</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reinhart et al., 2002</xref>). To understand which locus or loci play important roles within this gene family, we identified all available <italic>MIR156</italic> transfer-DNA (T-DNA) knockout plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Samson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Woody et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">supplementary file 1A</xref>). Due to functional redundancy, none of these mutants exhibited visible developmental defects (data not shown). One of the double mutants, <italic>mir156a mir156c</italic>, displayed a similar, but weak phenotype as the transgenic plant expressing a target mimicry from the constitutively active <italic>35S</italic> promoter (<italic>35S::MIM156</italic>), which reduced miR156 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Todesco et al., 2010</xref>).

To test this possibility, we carried out sugar treatment assays. Five-day-old seedlings grown in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid media were treated with sugars, including two disaccharides (maltose and sucrose) and two hexoses (glucose and fructose). The break-down of maltose results in two glucose molecules, whereas hydrolysis of sucrose produces glucose and fructose.

Given the fact that sucrose is able to move within plants through the vascular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Truernit 2001</xref>) and that sucrose as well as its hydrolytic product, glucose, repress the expression of miR156, we speculated that sugar is a potential candidate for this mobile signal. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated the relationship between sugar content and the level of miR156 in vivo. Under long day conditions, Arabidopsis plants show a rapid life cycle with very short juvenile and adult phases. For this reason, we grew wild type plants under short day conditions to extend the vegetative phase. Then 15-day-old (in the juvenile phase) and 60-day-old (in the adult phase) plants were collected at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 16. Expression analyses demonstrated that miR156 was highly abundant in 15-day-old plants but less so in 60-day-old plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast to this expression pattern, 60-day-old plants exhibited a higher level of glucose, fructose, and sucrose than 15-day-old plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with our findings that sugar represses miR156 and indicate an inverse correlation between the level of miR156 and endogenous sugar content in vivo.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00269.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sugar as a mobile signal to trigger vegetative phase transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of miR156 in 15-day-old and 60-day-old wild type plants grown under short day conditions.

We propose a model explaining how sugar regulates the juvenile-to-adult phase transition through modulation of miR156 expression as follows. After seed germination, plants start accumulating sugars through photosynthesis. Sucrose, the major transportable sugar, moves from the pre-existing leaves to the young leaf primordia, where its hydrolytic hexose product, glucose, represses the expression of miR156. As a result, the level of <italic>SPL</italic> increases and the expression of adult traits is promoted.</p><p>Identification of sugar as the endogenous developmental timing cue explains the irreversible nature of the age pathway. The level of miR156 is destined to decrease because the gradual accumulation of carbohydrates is inevitable and essential for plant growth and development. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the transitions between the stages of larval development are controlled by the sequential action of two miRNAs, <italic>lin-4</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pasquinelli and Ruvkun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros, 2011</xref>). In contrast to miR156, the expression of these two miRNAs is increased with age. It will be intriguing to examine whether sugar/carbohydrates or nutrients from the diet triggers the upregulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> in worms.</p><p>Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are tightly coordinated to sustain optimal plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng, 2009</xref>).

Whether miR156 and the juvenile-to-adult transition respond to N excess or deficient conditions is another interesting topic awaiting investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Does sugar promote flowering through miR156?</title><p>In addition to the juvenile-to-adult transition, flowering is of great importance for reproductive success in plants. Previous studies revealed that the floral transition is regulated by diverse environmental factors, such as photoperiod, temperature, and light, in combination with the endogenous signal derived from nutritional status. The nutrient-dependent regulation of flowering is likely dependant on the rate of sucrose export from source leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbesier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sivitz et al., 2007</xref>). This notion is supported by our observations that sugar from pre-existing leaves acts as a long-distance signal to repress the expression of miR156 in young leaf primordia, and that a high level of miR156 delays flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study has demonstrated that INDETERMINATE DOMAIN transcription factor AtIDD8 regulates photoperiodic flowering by modulating sugar transport and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seo et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that additional sugar-mediated flowering pathways exist.</p><p>Sugar, produced in mesophyll cells in leaves, is transported from source tissues to sink tissues through vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuhn and Grof, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayre, 2011</xref>). In Arabidopsis, sucrose transporters are involved in loading sucrose into the phloem in source leaves and the uptake of sucrose into the cells of sink tissues such as roots, fruit, and developing leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Very recently, the sucrose effluxers, SWEET11 and SWEET12, which facilitate sucrose efflux into the cell wall of companion cells, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore interesting to investigate whether impairment of sucrose transport from leaf cells into the vascular system causes a defect in miR156 expression and developmental transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of miR156 by sugar in a complex manner</title><p>There are several means by which sugar regulates gene expression. For example, sugar decreases the transcript level of rice <italic>AMY3</italic> at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. It was shown that destabilization of the mRNAs of <italic>AMY3</italic> is mediated by its 3′ untranslated region (UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Yu, 1998</xref>). Similarly, we found that <italic>pri-MIR156A</italic> and <italic>pri-MIR156C</italic> are subjected to transcriptional repression as well as transcript degradation in response to glucose. This two-level expression control by sugar might contribute to robust repression of miR156, which leads to irreversible transition from the juvenile to adult phase in plants. In Arabidopsis, HXK1 is a glucose sensor that transduces diverse aspects of sugar response. For example, the <italic>gin2</italic>-1 mutant reduces shoot and root growth, delays flowering, increases apical dominance, and alters sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). However, we did not observe an obvious juvenile-to-adult phase phenotype in the <italic>gin2-</italic>1 mutant under long day conditions (data not shown). Further studies will determine if the transcriptional repression of miR156 by sugar is mediated by the previously identified nuclear-localized HXK1-VHA-B1-RPT5B complex.</p><p>The level of miR156 is greatly reduced when plants are treated with both glucose and sucrose. Since these sugars can be easily interconverted, it remains unclear whether the repression of miR156 is hexose or sucrose-dependent. Moreover, based on pharmacological treatment and mutant analyses, we show that sugar is able to trigger the degradation of <italic>pri-MIR156A/C</italic> independently of the canonical glucose sensor, HXK1. Thus, investigation of the molecular mechanism by which sugar in particular recognizes <italic>pri-MIR156</italic> and promotes their degradation is an important goal for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>P. patens</italic>, <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> were grown at 21°C (day)/19°C (night) under long day (16 hr light/8 hr dark) or short day (8 hr light/16 hr dark) conditions.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel) and 2 reviewers, one of whom (Rick Amasino) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>The finding that sugar may be the age signal that acts via the miR156/SPL module is a significant advance in plant biology that will stimulate further research.</p><p>There are, however, some issues that need to be resolved, in particular the inconsistencies between your paper and the related paper submitted by the Poethig lab.</p><p>[Editors' note: these two studies were conducted independently; each was reviewed on its own merits, on the understanding that it would be published alongside the related study if both were accepted.]</p><p>Although the major conclusion of both papers is the same, namely that sugar treatment reduces the levels of miR156, three major differences are: 1) effect or lack thereof of cycloheximide, 2) hexokinase dependence (i.e., whether or not HXK1 is a glucose sensor for the age effect), and 3) transcriptional versus post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>MIR156</italic> expression. Some of these inconsistencies might result from studying different promoters (<italic>MIR156A</italic> vs <italic>MIR156C</italic>), measuring miR156 versus <italic>pri-MIR156C</italic> levels, the use of liquid culture versus solid media, or different temperature and light regimens.</p><p>Two other issues are:</p><p>4) The possible difference in effect of the <italic>cao/chlorina1</italic> mutant is due to short day versus long day conditions. In addition to day length, light intensity, and temperature are likely to play a role. (There also needs to be agreement on the nomenclature of the mutant.)</p><p>5) Differences in glucose concentrations used.</p><p>We hope that you will exchange information with Scott Poethig and colleagues on experimental design, repeat a number of crucial experiments under common conditions (which should not take long), and determine if the inconsistencies may in fact be resolvable. We will relay a corresponding message to the Poethig lab.</p><p>A final note: the editors and reviewers discussed the lack of measurement of endogenous sugars during phase change and concluded that, although this would be a valuable addition to the body of work you have presented, it would be beyond the scope of your study.</p><p>Comments specific to your paper:</p><p>A) The Materials and methods often do not provide sufficient detail for the reader to evaluate your work. A major example is the lack of detail of plant growth conditions. You simply note LD and SD.

This is crucial, especially in the norflurazon experiment, as, contrary to what is claimed, not only are pre-existing leaves affected by the treatment, but the newly formed leaves are too, as can be seen in Figure 3H. Therefore it cannot be ruled out that there is a direct norflurazon effect on miR156 expression.</p><p>G) The title “Sugar is an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants” is too general as only one aspect of developmental timing is studied in detail (vegetative phase change).</p><p>[Editors' note: the authors were also asked to address the following comment before acceptance.]</p><p>Before acceptance, it is necessary for you to compare Wt and <italic>gin2</italic> mutant directly because only the immediate response in the presence of ActD has been examined.

In the revision, most of the inconsistencies between our papers have been resolved. The conclusion is that sugar represses miR156 at both transcriptional level (partially dependent on HXK1), and post-transcriptional level through promoting degradation of <italic>pri-MIR156</italic> transcripts.</p><p>In the last version, we did not exclude the possibility that sugar regulates miR156 expression through transcriptional level. In the revision, we performed ChIP assay using anti-Pol II antibody. The enrichment of the genomic fragment of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> was markedly reduced after glucose treatment, demonstrating that sugar is able to repress miR156 expression at transcriptional level (Figure 7A).</p><p>In the revised version, our paper focuses on how sugar represses miR156 at the post-transcriptional level in an HXK1-independent manner, while the paper from the Poethig lab emphasizes the role of sugar in the transcriptional control of <italic>MIR156A</italic>.</p><p>After blocking transcription by ActD, we found that sugar is able to repress miR156 through promoting the degradation of primary transcripts of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>. This sugar-induced pri-miRNA degradation is not dependent on HXK1 but requires de novo protein synthesis.</p><p><italic>4) The possible difference in effect of the</italic> cao/chlorina1 <italic>mutant is due to short day versus long day conditions.

This inconsistency could be due to different growth conditions. In the revision, the nomenclature of the <italic>cao</italic> mutant has been unified by using <italic>cao/ch1</italic>.</p><p><italic>5) Differences in glucose concentrations used</italic>.</p><p>The inconsistencies between our papers were not due to the different glucose concentration that we used. We repeated our experiment using 10 mM glucose and got the same results as those from Poethig lab.</p><p><italic>A final note: the editors and reviewers discussed the lack of measurement of endogenous sugars during phase change and concluded that, although this would be a valuable addition to the body of work you have presented, it would be beyond the scope of your study</italic>.</p><p>According to your suggestions, we performed sugar measurements. We compared the sugar content between juvenile and adult plants. We could not obtain reliable results in long day, probably due to a rapid life cycle under this condition. We then performed our measurement in short day. It appears that the adult plants accumulated more sugar (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) than juvenile plants. Consistently, we found that there was a nice correlation between miR156 level and sugar content in these samples (Figure 4A and 4B).</p><p><italic>Comments specific to your paper:</italic></p><p><italic>A) The Materials and methods often do not provide sufficient detail for the reader to evaluate your work. A major example is the lack of detail of plant growth conditions. You simply note LD and SD. But for the type of research you are presenting – an effect of sugar – a detailed description of light intensity and light quality, as well as temperature is critical</italic>.</p><p>We have included further details in the Materials and methods. For example: “<italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>P. patens</italic>, <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants were grown at 21 °C (day)/19 °C (night) in long days (16 hours light/8 hours dark). White light was provided by a 4:2 mixture of cool white fluorescent lamps (Lifemax cool daylight 36W/865; Philips Lighting Co., China) and warm white fluorescent lamps (Lifemax warm white 36W/830, Philips Lighting Co.). Light intensity is 80 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s.”</p><p><italic>B) You should attempt to quantify GUS activity for the MIR156 promoter response experiments</italic>.</p><p>We communicated with Scott Poethig. It turned out that the <italic>MIR156A/C</italic> promoter GUS reporters from Peter Huijser's lab lack the essential sugar responsive element in the 3'UTR. Therefore, we removed this result in the revision.</p><p><italic>C) The ActD treatment should have a control (e.g., from another miRNA gene, which presumably should have no effect)</italic>.</p><p>We used HXK1 as a control (Figure 7B). HXK1 is rapidly induced by glucose. This effect is abolished after the addition of ActD, indicating that our treatment is effective.</p><p><italic>D) Another useful control would be measurements from wild-type plants alongside the sugar-response result for the</italic> gin2-1 <italic>mutant</italic>. gin2-1 <italic>still responds to sugar, but does it respond as much as wild type in the same experiment?</italic></p><p><italic>gin2-1</italic> is in the Ler genetic background. Therefore, we performed the same treatment in wild-type Ler accession. There is no difference in miR156 expression between Ler and <italic>gin2-1</italic> (Figure 7E).</p><p><italic>E) Removal of the first two leaves in 7d old Arabidopsis seedlings resulted in a delayed expression of adult traits and this can be partially overcome by sucrose application to the remaining petioles. This indicates that sugars may be the mobile signal. However, the effects of defoliation and subsequent sugar feeding on miR156 expression were not investigated, leaving part of the question unresolved</italic>.</p><p>We performed the expression analyses of miR156. Compared to intact plants, miR156 is increased after defoliation. This effect is suppressed by sucrose application (Figure 4F). This expression pattern is consistent with our phenotypic characterizations.</p><p><italic>F) In the</italic> cao <italic>mutant and in norflurazon-treated plants, it is important to determine whether all aspects of the vegetative phase change phenotype (morphological as well as molecular) can be rescued by application of glucose or sucrose. This is crucial, especially in the norflurazon experiment, as, contrary to what is claimed, not only are pre-existing leaves affected by the treatment, but the newly formed leaves are too, as can be seen in Figure 3H. Therefore it cannot be ruled out that there is a direct norflurazon effect on miR156 expression</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this argument. Therefore we removed the norflurazon treatment assay in the revision.</p><p><italic>G) The title “Sugar is an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants” is too general as only one aspect of developmental timing is studied in detail (vegetative phase change)</italic>.</p><p>We have changed it to “Sugar is an endogenous cue for juvenile-to-adult phase transition in plants”.</p><p><italic>Before acceptance, it is necessary for you to compare Wt and</italic> gin2 <italic>mutant directly because only the immediate response in the presence of ActD has been examined.

Compared to Wt, the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant has a lower level of miR156 in seedlings. However, the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant still exhibited the gradual decreased expression pattern of miR156 as Wt. Consistently, the expression of <italic>pri-MIR156</italic> was reduced in response to sugar treatment. We normalized the data to the same standard (Figure 7C, 7D, and 8E).</p></body></sub-article></article>
