Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumors, we show many transcriptional changes in tumors are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancers arise when harmful changes happen in the genetic information of certain cells. These ‘mutations’ are different from person to person, but overall, they disrupt healthy cells in similar ways. In particular, cancer cells tend to lose features that help cells work together in the body. Researchers have suggested that cancers may emerge when cells stop being able to cooperate with each other as part of an organism.</p><p>Our bodies still rely on old genes that were present in our earliest, single-cell ancestors. However, we also have newer genes that evolved when the organisms in our lineage started to have more than one cell. A complex network of signals exists to ensure that both sets of genes work together smoothly, and previous studies have suggested that cancers may appear when this delicate balance is disrupted.</p><p>To address this question, Trigos et al. have now used a computational approach to analyse different types of tumours from over 9,000 patients. This showed that, in cancer, many mutations disrupt the genes that coordinate old and new genes. These mutations were usually small, punctual changes in the genetic sequence. However, large modifications, such as an entire gene being deleted or repeated, took place more often in the old or the new genes themselves. Therefore, different classes of mutations have specific roles when disrupting how old and new genes work in cancer.</p><p>While certain genes highlighted during this analysis were already known to be associated with cancer, others were not – including genes present during the evolution of the earliest animals on Earth. Looking more closely into how these genes can cause disease may help us better understand and fight cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>networks</kwd><kwd>orthology</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trigos</surname><given-names>Anna S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name><name><surname>Papenfuss</surname><given-names>Anthony T</given-names></name><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cancer is a consequence of the release of basal cellular functions inherited from our unicellular ancestors from the control of regulatory networks that evolved during the emergence of multicellularity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spectra of genomic and transcriptomic alterations across cancer types are highly heterogeneous. A multitude of driver genes exist both within and across subtypes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armenia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</xref>) spanning a range of mutational types, from simple substitutions, to extensive genome-wide aneuploidies and complex rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ciriello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoadley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zack et al., 2013</xref>). This complex array of genetic alterations confounds efforts to assign function to driver genes and identify key driver mutations within patients. Despite this extensive molecular heterogeneity, tumors originating from a variety of tissues converge to several common hallmark cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Many of these involve loss of features commonly associated with multicellularity, for example, uninhibited proliferation, tissue dedifferentiation, disruption of cell-cell adhesion and intercellular communication, suggesting the alteration to genes involved in the evolution of multicellular traits is central to tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aktipis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aktipis and Nesse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies and Lineweaver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vincent, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Through the addition of new genes and repurposing of existing genes, metazoan evolution has led to progressive formation of intricate and interconnected regulatory layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenas-Mena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitz et al., 2016</xref>), which suppress improper activation of replicative processes originating in single-celled organisms and ensure the complex phenotypes and cooperative growth required for multicellularity. Our investigation of gene expression data from a collection of solid tumors revealed extensive downregulation of genes specifying multicellular phenotypes and activation of genes conserved to unicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trigos et al., 2017</xref>). This was accompanied by significant loss of coordinated expression of unicellular and multicellular processes within tumors, suggesting selection for the disruption of key regulators mediating communication between unicellular and multicellular genes. Evidence for such selection comes from the clustering of cancer genes at the evolutionary boundary of unicellularity and multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2010</xref>) and the accumulation of mutations in genes required for multicellular development during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Only a limited number of driver mutations are thought to be responsible for the transition from normal, healthy cell to a malignant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martincorena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schinzel and Hahn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stratton et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting individual mutations in highly connected genes in the regulatory network could bring about significant changes in cellular phenotypes. Under our model, the highest impact mutations would be those affecting proteins modulating the communication between the subnetworks that sustain multicellularity and the conserved core of fundamental cellular processes originated in single-celled organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trigos et al., 2018</xref>). This would enhance a more primitive phenotype and provide a strong selective advantage for individual cellular lineages. Therefore, the contribution of somatic mutations to the rewiring of transcriptional networks during tumor development can be contextualized and estimated by their effect on gene regulatory networks pieced together during evolution, aiding the identification of key driver mutations.</p><p>Here, we elucidate how mutational heterogeneity across tumors results in common cellular hallmarks by accounting for their evolutionary ages and locations in the GRN. We found an overrepresentation of copy-number aberrations and point mutations in genes dating back to early metazoan ancestors. Point mutations disrupted key master regulators that evolved in early in the metazoan lineage, suggesting a primary role in the uncoupling of the subnetworks regulating multicellularity and the fundamental core of cellular processes dating back to single-celled organisms. CNAs were involved in a complementary mechanism of dysregulation, generally disrupting the downstream targets of each of these subnetworks. These results indicate that both point mutations and CNAs contribute to the dysregulation of multicellularity in cancer, but do so in different ways, impacting regions of transcriptional networks with distinct roles in the regulation of multicellularity. Finally, we show how our approach of integration of sequence conservation and transcriptome data with annotated regulatory associations provides a framework for identifying important driver mutations and prioritizing compounds for targeted therapy, at the level of both patient populations and individual tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early metazoan genes are enriched with point mutations and copy-number aberrations acquired during tumourigenesis</title><p>We investigated the association between the evolutionary ages of genes and the frequency of copy-number aberrations (CNAs) and point mutations across tumor cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2017b</xref>). We collected CNA and point mutation data from 10256 and 9926 patients, respectively, from The Cancer Genome Atlas across 30 tumor types (see Materials and methods). We selected a subset of genes that were consistently amplified or deleted in at least 10% of patients of each tumor cohort, and genes with either missense or loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in at least three patients and with a higher rate of occurrence than synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (see Materials and methods). Human genes were classified by their evolutionary age using phylostratigraphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2010</xref>), resulting in 16 phylogenetic groups (phylostrata) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), ranging from genes found in unicellular ancestors (Phylostrata 1–3) (6,719 UC genes), to genes found in early metazoans (Phylostrata 4–9) (7,939 EM genes), and mammal-specific genes (Phylostrata 10–16) (2,660 MM genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trigos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We calculated the fraction of genes in each phylostratum with recurrent CNAs and point mutations, accounting for differences in CNA and mutation rates between tumor cohorts by ranking each phylostratum by the fraction of genes altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We found an increasing trend of enrichment of CNAs starting from the earliest UC genes (phylostratum 1), but peaking in EM genes (phylostrata 4–8), with EM genes being the most enriched with both amplifications and deletions across tumors. A high proportion of tumor types (14/30 tumor types for amplifications and 27/30 tumor types for deletions) had at least 3 EM phylostrata in the top five most recurrently altered phylostrata. In contrast, recurrent CNAs were consistently depleted from MM genes (phylostratum 10 onwards), indicating a lack selection for CNAs in younger genes. The decreasing enrichment trend along the phylostrata was significant for amplifications in 20/30 tumor types, and for deletions in 27/30 tumor types (Jonckheere-Terpstra tests Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p&lt;0.05). Similar results were obtained using recurrent gains/losses as defined by Gistic2, as the one used by Gistic2 (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), which employs a rigorous probabilistic model to identify recurrent CNAs. Among the recurrently amplified and deleted EM genes are well-known cancer genes. Examples include the EGFR oncogene, recurrently amplified in more than 10% of patients in 19/30 of the studied tumor types and having emerged together with bilaterians (Phylostratum 6), and the tumor suppressor TP53 which also dates back to early metazoan ancestors (Phylostratum 5) and is found recurrently deleted in an average of 12.73% of patients across all tumor types studied. In contrast to the patterns obtained for genes with recurrent CNAs, genes not recurrently copy-numbered altered (frequency &lt;0.10 across patients) were not enriched in EM genes, but were often enriched in MM genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). An exception is TNFRSF17 (also known as BCMA, BCM), a mammal-specific gene involved in immune system processes that was amplified in &gt;10% of BRCA, ACC, KIRP, THCA, PRAD and KIRC patients. TNFRSF17 has classically been associated with lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laâbi et al., 1992</xref>) and has oncogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coquery and Erickson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that EM genes are specifically preferentially under selection for recurrent CNAs across patients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of CNAs and point mutations in EM genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of amplified (left) and deleted (right) genes across phylostrata.

In contrast, MM genes were consistently depleted of recurrent point mutations. The decreasing trend of enrichment associated with gene age was significant in the majority of tumor types for both missense (18/23) and LoF (12/14) mutations (Jonckheere-Terpstra tests Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p&lt;0.05).

Since important innovations required for the regulation of transcriptional networks from unicellular ancestors evolved in early metazoan species, we investigated whether this could be evidenced in the current structure of the human gene regulatory network (GRN). The GRN was obtained by subsetting the network from PathwayCommons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pathway Commons, 2017</xref>) to include only edges annotated with control-of-expression.</p><p>Given the directed nature of the GRN, regulator genes can be distinguished from downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that over half (56.42%) of regulators in the GRN were EM genes, whereas only 37.88% and 5.69% were UC and MM genes, indicating an enrichment of EM genes as regulators (Fisher enrichment test p=6.48×10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Given that broad CNAs involving large chromosome sections include a high number of genes with poor resolution of the genes under selection, we focused on recurrent CNAs that included less than 25% of the genes of a chromosome in at least 10% of patients of each tumor cohort.

Similar results were obtained when we used the significantly CNA and point mutated genes identified by MutSig2CV and Gistic algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, recurrent point mutations are more likely to affect master regulators in the GRN, whereas recurrent CNAs are more likely to affect target genes.</p><p>The complex regulatory interactions in the GRN result in many genes having a dual role, acting as both regulators and targets, with EM genes being both master regulators and under high degree of regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>).

In contrast, EM genes with CNAs were skewed toward being highly regulated downstream targets (median ratio = 0.38), even compared to UC and MM genes with CNAs (median ratio UC = 0.67 and MM = 0.60). Similar results were obtained using MutSig2CV and Gistic to define recurrent point mutations and CNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).

The majority of high impact mutations occurred in UC/EM-i regulators (75%), whereas only 43.13% of low impact mutations occurred in these regulators, indicating that high-impact mutations preferentially occur in in UC/EM-i regulators (two-proportions Z-test p=0.026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The actual ages of the UC/EM-i regulators were also associated with mutational impact. EM genes represented a higher proportion of UC/EM-i regulators with high impact mutations (67%) than those with low impact mutations (50%), and as a whole, point-mutated early metazoan regulators were two-times more likely than other point-mutated regulators to have a high impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, point mutations creating the most substantial alterations to gene expression tend to be in regulator genes of early metazoan origin at the interface of UC and EM genes.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that the recurrence across tumor cohorts of point mutations in EM regulators is tied with transcriptional disturbances of the regulation between UC and EM genes in the GRN, making them potential gene drivers. Multiple known cancer genes were found among UC/EM-i regulators, including RB1, PIK3CA, SMAD4, NF1 TP53, TERT and MDM4. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these regulators are involved in multiple signaling pathways, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling, but they are also involved in a diversity of other processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Investigation of the pathways associated with UC/EM-i regulators revealed that their point mutation often had a significant effect on pathway expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Point mutation of well-studied genes such as p53 affected the expression of pathways such as MAPK signaling, p53 signaling, WNT, apoptosis, cell cycle across 18 tumor types; mutations in PTEN with changes in expression of p53 signaling in six tumor types, PIK3CA affecting the expression of multiple pathways such as ERBB signaling, MTOR, JAK-STAT, and VEGF signaling across 10 cancer types; and point mutations in SMAD4 in colon cancer affected WNT signaling. We also found other understudied effects. For example, mutation of EP300 was associated with differences in expression of cell cycle and JAK-STAT pathways in bladder, endometrial, cervical and endocervical cancers. Point mutation of PIK3R1 affected ERBB, MTOR and JAK-STAT signaling. Intriguingly, our analysis pointed to other other EM UC/EM-i regulator genes with mutational frequencies and percentage of differentially expressed downstream targets similar to known cancer genes. Many of these genes, including KEAP1, HNF1A, NFE2L2 and LRRK2, have implied roles in cancer but no strong mechanistic links to date (Figure 5; Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CNAs directly regulate the expression of UC and EM downstream targets in the GRN</title><p>While somatic mutation of regulators could provide a major selective advantage via simultaneous dysregulation of a multitude of downstream target genes, where and when such mutations occur is largely based on stochastic events during tumor development.

We found a higher percentage of target genes than regulators were differentially expressed after amplifications across all tumor types, and for deletions in 64.64% of tumors types, indicating that CNAs more strongly influence the expression of target genes than regulator genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, UC target genes showed the largest changes in expression after CNAs (median values across tumor types: 7.80% upregulated after amplifications, 7.48% downregulated after deletions), followed by EM genes (4.45% and 4.79%, respectively), and lastly MM genes (2.46% and 1.62%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (Jonckheere-Terpstra decreasing trend test: amplifications p-value: 0.0028, deletions p-value: 0.0021), indicating that UC and EM targets are more susceptible to changes in expression after CNA.</p><p>However, the effect of CNAs on the expression of targets was dependent on their regulator. Targets of UC-t regulators were more likely to be differentially expressed after amplifications or deletions were the targets of UC/EM-i regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). On the other hand, target genes of EM-t regulators mostly modulated their expression in response to deletions as opposed to amplifications (one-sided Wilcoxon test p=0.043) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting selection of CNAs in targets of EM-t regulators could be a mechanism for the direct down regulation of EM network regions, as an alternative to direct mutation of their regulators. In contrast, CNAs of the target genes of UC/EM-i regulators changed their expression much less often, no matter whether it was amplified or deleted (two-sided Wilcoxon test p=0.95), suggesting CNAs are playing a less prominent role in the dysregulation of UC and EM interface regions than do somatic point mutations.</p><p>A model of transcriptional changes in UC-t and EM-t targets driven by CNAs as an alternative to direct mutation of the regulators themselves would predict the mutual exclusivity of concurrent CNAs of a regulator and its targets in the same tumor, as the co-occurrence of such mutations would be largely redundant. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the median fraction of targets with CNAs for each regulator across all patients in the tumor cohorts, and found that the fraction of targets with CNAs was significantly higher in patients where the regulator was CNN than when the regulator was CNA (Wilcoxon test p-value=4.10×10<sup>−29</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, this trend was only observed for targets of UC-t and EM-t regulators (one-sided Wilcoxon test p=1.36×10<sup>−7</sup> and p=1.11×10<sup>−42</sup>, respectively), but not for targets UC/EM-i regulators (p=0.79), where the trend seemed to be the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that preferential alteration of target genes by CNAs, as opposed to regulators, is a mechanism employed for the independent modulation of UC and EM network regions.</p><p>We next investigated how the copy-number status of regulator (CNA or CNN) was associated with the fraction of CNA downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that over two thirds of UC-t and EM-t regulators (71.70% and 71.30%, respectively) had a higher fraction of copy-aberrant downstream genes when they were CNN than when they were CNA. These results were independent of the evolutionary ages of the regulators, since the percentages were similar for both UC and EM regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). A potential explanation for this pattern is illustrated by MDM2, where 33.33% of its downstream targets were CNA when MDM2 was CNN, but no target was CNA when MDM2 had changed in copy-number. Since MDM2 is an inhibitor of p53, either amplification of MDM2 or deletion of p53 would have a similar effect, and therefore there is no selection for the simultaneous co-occurrence of both alterations in the same patient. In contrast to the strong trends observed for UC-t and EM-t regulators, this trend was only observed in 28.72% of UC/EM-i regulators. The preferential copy-number aberration of targets of CNN UC-t and EM-t regulators, but not in CNN UC/EM-i regulators, supports our proposed model of selection for the CNA of target genes of UC-t and EM-t regulators, but not for those of UC/EM-i regulators.</p><p>Here we found that CNAs are a widespread mechanism of dysregulation of UC and EM target genes, directly modulating the expression of targets of UC-t and EM-t regulators.

We found that these interface genes were involved in well-known cancer signaling networks (e.g. TP53, NF1, PIK3CA), but found that other processes of emerging interest, such as metabolism and mithochondrial dysregulation are also associated with the rupturing of regulation of unicellular and multicellular components by point mutations. On the other hand, CNAs preferentially affected their downstream target genes, directly promoting the independent activation and inactivation of regions predominantly composed of unicellular and multicellular genes, as opposed to mixed regions, further supporting a loss of multicellularity and the tight association between gene expression level and gene age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trigos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Samples where UC/EM-i regulators were mutated tended not to have CNAs in the corresponding target genes and vice versa; in samples carrying CNAs for multiple target genes, unicellular and multicellular, the cognate UC/EM-i regulator were mostly unaltered. These complementary but distinct mechanisms of alteration to the same regulatory subnetworks by different classes of somatic mutations in different tumors provide mutually exclusive but highly convergent paths toward common hallmarks associated with the loss of multicellularity features in cancer.</p><p>Our evolutionary network analysis approach also highlights potential early driver genes by elucidating the evolutionary regulatory context in which genes operate. Only a handful of driver mutations are thought to be responsible for the transition from a normal, healthy cell to a malignant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martincorena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schinzel and Hahn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stratton et al., 2009</xref>), but their identification amid large and diverse genetic alterations is challenging. Our results suggest the key positioning of early metazoan regulator genes at the interface of network regions from unicellular and multicellular ancestors makes cells susceptible to widespread dysregulation of transcriptional networks upon their disruption, as their alteration would uncouple the regulatory controls required for multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greaves, 2015</xref>). This implicates these genes in key roles in the onset and progression of cancer and highlights them as potential gene drivers and drug targets. Our analysis of the effect on cell line dependency after knockout of these regulators revealed that their alteration is capable of modulating cell proliferation across 364 cell lines.</p><p>Many of these interface regulators have not been significantly studied in the context of cancer, but drugs targeting these genes are currently in clinical trial for other diseases, opening the possibility for drug repurposing. LRRK2 encodes the dardarin protein, considered to be central to the aetiology of Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zimprich et al., 2004</xref>).

We also identified that cell lines dependent on the UC/EM-i regulator PPRC1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, co-activator-related 1, were particularly susceptible to mTOR inhibitors, YK-4–279 and docetaxel. PPRC1 is an activator of mitochondrial biogenesis, a process regulated by mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramanathan and Schreiber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schieke et al., 2006</xref>), highlighting the use of mTOR inhibitors in cancers with aberrant mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, it suggests that YK-4–279, a binding inhibitor of oncogenic fusion proteins in Ewing’s sarcoma and with encouraging pre-clinical efficiency in this cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamhamedi-Cherradi et al., 2015</xref>), could also be broadly effective in general for tumors with aberrant mitochondrial activity.</p><p>This study provides comprehensive evidence that both the frequency and types of mutations in genes in cancer are strongly influenced by a given gene’s evolutionary age and its regulatory functions. This furthers our understanding of how a limited number of genetic alterations could promote rapid tumor development through loss of multicellular features and provides an explanation as to how the widespread convergence to common hallmark phenotypes in solid cancer may occur. As we show, this approach can be used to prioritize genes as drivers and identify possible targeted therapies, creating a novel analytical framework that will become increasingly informative as the volume and resolution of cancer genomics data continue to increase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene ages</title><p>The evolutionary ages of genes were obtained from previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trigos et al., 2017</xref>).

We only considered negative correlations &lt; −0.25 and with a adjusted p-values after Benjamini and Hochberg correction &lt;0.05, since we were interested in cell lines with high dependency to a regulator and that showed greater drug sensitivity at lower concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Code availability</title><p>R code to perform all analyses and generate all figures is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cancer-evolution/Evolutionary-analysis-of-somatic-mutations-in-cancer">https://github.com/cancer-evolution/Evolutionary-analysis-of-somatic-mutations-in-cancer</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trigo, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Evolutionary-analysis-of-somatic-mutations-in-cancer">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Evolutionary-analysis-of-somatic-mutations-in-cancer</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Melbourne International Engagement Award (MIEA) and a Melbourne International Fee Remission Scholarship (MIFRS) from the University of Melbourne to AST and funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) (APP1052904) and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Foundation to DLG, NHMRC Senior Research Fellowships to ATP, and a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Program Grant (#1053792) and Fellowship to RBP.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Provided advise on methodologies and project design</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.037</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Point mutated genes.</title><p>Genes marked as ‘Frequent’ were included in the analysis.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp1-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.038</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Ratio of out-degree and in-degree per age and mutation type.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp2-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.039</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Regulator classification.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp3-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.040</object-id><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Functional enrichment analysis of UC/EM-i regulators using gprofileR.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp4-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.041</object-id><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Significance of change of pathway activity levels after point mutation of UC/EM-i regulators.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp5-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.042</object-id><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Difference in median dependency between cell lines with regulator mutated and non-mutated.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-40947-supp6-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40947.043</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-40947-transrepform-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data used during this study was obtained from the public databases indicated in the manuscript.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As with the GRN from PathwayCommons, we only included in our analysis edges for which gene ages were available for both the regulator and target, resulting in the TRRUST network having 7222 edges, with 719 regulators and 2187 targets, and the RegNetwork having 104,626 edges, with 1254 regulators and 14,677 targets.</p><p>Similar to the GRN from PathwayCommons, the GRN from both TRRUST and RegNetwork were dominated by regulators of EM origin (66.48% and 58.69, respectively, enriched p=8.25×10<sup>−10</sup> and p=2.38×10<sup>−7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A, D</xref>). EM genes also had a higher out-degree (11.19 compared to 8.38 for UC genes and 4.41 for MM genes in TRRUST, and 100.21 compared to 65.27 for UC genes and 28.99 for MM genes in RegNetwork) and in-degree (3.68 compared to 2.72 for UC genes and 3.20 for MM genes in TRRUST, and 7.58 compared to 7.29 for UC genes and 4.46 for MM genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B,E</xref>). Finally, 72.10% and 63.95% of the most connected regulators (upperquantile of the distribution of out-degree) were EM genes in TRRUST and RegNetwork, respectively. With respect to mutations in regulators and targets, we also found that regulators were preferentially affected by point mutations (Wilcoxon test p=1.44×10<sup>−5</sup> in TRRUST and 9.70 × 10<sup>−6</sup> in RegNetwork), and that targets showed a preference for CNAs (Wilcoxon test p=9.12×10<sup>−7</sup> in TRRUST and 9.12 × 10<sup>−7</sup> in RegNetwork) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C, F</xref>).

A representative set of genes are analysed in terms of accumulated point mutations and copy number changes in seven solid tumours from TCGA. The results are then discussed in terms of the relation between gene age, type of mutations and functional role of the genes as master in gene regulation at different levels. The difference between mutations and CNVs is also interpreted in terms of a potential differential role in gene regulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are questions about the use of a more complete TCGA dataset and selection of the initial gene set that affects the scope of the study and results. They have to be properly addressed.</p><p>There is also an important question about the relation between the possible positive selection on point mutations in early EM regulators that requires specific considerations, as well as a number of other comment and criticisms regarding clarity and interpretation of the results.</p><p>In more detail:</p><p>Data completeness:</p><p>1) TCGA currently comprises of data from a large number of tumour types. The authors have analysed data from only seven tumour types? Why have the authors conducted the analysis in only a subset of the available solid tumour types in TCGA? Several solid tumour types have been missed (e.g. renal, melanoma, testicular, pancreatic, etc) with no apparent explanation. Please could the authors either extend the analysis to the full TCGA solid tumour dataset, or clarify why only a subset of available data has been utilised.</p><p>2) The gene filtering strategy (subsection “Enrichment of recurrent point mutations and CNAs in phylostrata”) raises some concern – only taking genes with more missense+LoF than synonymous mutations may miss some important driver events (e.g. by chance a long gene may carry a number of synonymous mutations, and then missense mutations only in hotspot domains (KRAS G12D, V600E, etc)). By chance drivers may be excluded. Could the authors confirm whether this approach was done on a per tumour type basis, or across all histologies combined? The latter would be particularly concerning. As a minimum the authors should provide a supplementary table showing this data and the genes excluded, so readers can confirm what is being excluded. A better approach instead could be to take only genes significant in MutSigCV analysis for each cancer type (which are already available for all tumor types in the Broad Firehose repository). The mutsigCV algorithm implements a similar method but in a much comprehensive way.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>1) Some sections of the text (particularly Results section “Point mutations disrupt the regulation between UC and EM Genes”) should be cut down and streamlined, so the salient (and significant) results are better highlighted, and other non-significant descriptive text removed. For example endless &quot;x out of y&quot; results are quoted, e.g. (4/6 and 5/6 regulators). These proportions are stated with no associated p-values, so it is somewhat unclear to the reader if these significant results or not?</p><p>2) The authors have tried to link transcriptional states with mutation states of genes such as gene expression down-regulation has been linked to missense or LoF mutations.

Our results with the new dataset are consistent with the previous results, which strengthen our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The gene filtering strategy (subsection “Enrichment of recurrent point mutations and CNAs in phylostrata”) raises some concern – only taking genes with more missense+LoF than synonymous mutations may miss some important driver events (e.g. by chance a long gene may carry a number of synonymous mutations, and then missense mutations only in hotspot domains (KRAS G12D, V600E, etc)).

We have reduced the number of categories to define the level of change of expression of target genes from 3 (high, moderate, low impact) to 2 (high or low impact). The inclusion of 23 additional tumour types as well as the reduction in the number of categories has also increased the number of regulators and point mutated genes in the set. We found that 12/16 regulators affected by high-impact point mutations are UC/EM-i genes (75%), whereas this proportion is considerably smaller for low-impact mutations (22/51, 43.14%). This was significant by a two-proportions Z-test (p = 0.026), indicating that high impact mutations affect a higher proportion of UC/EM-i regulators than low impact mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have tried to link transcriptional states with mutation states of genes such as gene expression down-regulation has been linked to missense or LoF mutations.

I think this study will definitely benefit from more examples of specific UC/EM-i genes and the pathways they regulate in tumorigenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The evidence for the changes in gene expression associated to mutations is presented in Figure 1C, where a higher percentage of EM genes with point mutations are differentially expressed than UC or EM genes. This analysis includes data from 30 tumour types and 9675 missense mutations and 2367 LoF mutations. We show EM genes are more likely to be differentially expressed when point mutated than are UC and MM genes across most of the cancers we assessed.</p><p>To provide more biological context to the reader, we have included a functional enrichment analysis of the UC/EM-i regulators and also evaluated the association between the expression level of multiple pathways relevant to cancer and point mutations in UC/EM-i regulators in subsection “Point mutations disrupt the regulation between UC and EM genes”. This uncovered many differences in key pathways are linked to mutations in certain regulators, the implications of which are discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>We interpret these findings as support for the direct disruption of activity of key EM genes across cancers by point mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Positive selection of EM regulators:</p><p>The authors propose a model of point mutations in early EM regulators being key drivers under positive selection in cancer (paragraph five “Point mutations disrupt the regulation between UC and EM genes”). This point needs to be further substantiated, by showing these mutated genes are indeed enriched as clonal driver events. Can the authors show the variant allele frequencies for these EM regulator mutations are higher than average, or higher than other groups? This would support their role as drivers and presence in a high proportion of cancer cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We present multiple sources of evidence that point towards mutations in EM regulators as key drivers. We show that recurrent mutations in EM genes are the most frequent (Figure 1 – panel B), that genes with point mutations affect genes that have a strong regulatory role (Figure 2 – panel F), and we further show in Figure 3 that this effect is strongest for UC/EM-i regulators of EM origin.</p><p>Our model in particular emphasizes the importance of UC/EM-i regulators that sit at the interface between UC and EM regions of the regulatory network. This set we would expect plays a very important role in tumourigenesis when mutated and thus comprises a significant proportion of early driver mutations in many tumours.</p><p>To assess this, we turned to a study that derived clonality and driver status for individual patients using machine learning applied to multi-region sequencing data from cohorts outside TCGA (Caravagna et al., 2018). The overwhelming majority (91%) of non-small-cell lung cancers from the TRACERx study (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017) and the Yates cohort of breast cancers (71%) (Yates et al., 2015) have at least one UC/EM-i regulators labelled as a clonal driver event. Thus, the number of driver and clonal point mutated regulators in individual patients shows a high prevalence of UC/EM-i regulators as clonal drivers across lung cancer and breast cancer patients, supporting our claims of UC/EM-i regulators playing a key role in cancer development. These results have been added to the manuscript (second paragraph of subsection “UC/EM-i regulators are important drivers of tumourigenesis and influence drug sensitivity” of the Results) and are displayed in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Similar data on sub-clonal populations have been produced for selected TCGA tumour types, however these results are not available with the degree of detailed required. Applying clonality prediction algorithms ourselves to all 30 TCGA types used here would be highly computationally intensive and it would be very time consuming to go through the results.</p><p>Thus we turned to analysis of VAFs in our key regulator classes, as this reviewer suggests. We calculated the VAF of the variants identified by all four somatic SNV detection methods used by the TCGA consortium (Muse, Mutect, SomaticSniper and Varscan). Given that the VAF substantially differed between variant callers, we analysed them individually and excluded all genes that were identified as being CNA as copy-number changes will skew the VAF. Since differences in purity affect the range of VAFs between patients, we scaled the VAF of each patient into quantiles to avoid having to select an a priori VAF cutoff. We looked for a shift to higher quantiles in UC/EM-i regulators, under the expectation clonal driver mutations would have higher VAF than the majority of other mutations in a given tumour. To boost power only patients with at least 20 mutated genes were considered.</p><p>Regardless of variant caller, we consistently see a bimodal distribution of VAFs in UC/EM-i regulators with a noticeable peak at VAF &gt;50% (yellow histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This suggests a substantial proportion of UC/EM-i regulator mutations are clonal. We see many high VAFs in other regulator types as well, consistent with the notion that point mutations in regulators are generally important drivers of cancer.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40947-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Finally, comparing the percentage of significantly and non-significantly recurrently mutated regulators based on the output from MutSig2CV, we see UC/EM-i regulators comprise a higher percentage of significant mutated genes than non-significantly mutated genes in 27 out of the 30 tumour types, indicating the preference for recurrent mutations in these regulators.
