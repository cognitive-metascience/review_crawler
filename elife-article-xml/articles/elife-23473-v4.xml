These diseases include the human form of mad cow disease, and are often fatal with no effective treatments or cures. Though the normal activity of PrP is not certain, abnormal PrP can affect the healthy PrP on the surface of brain cells and lead to disease. Similar mechanisms may also contribute to other life-threatening brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>It had been shown that certain altered PrP proteins caused the death of brain cells by allowing excessive electrical charges to cross the membranes of the cell. These changes led to symptoms in animal models of the diseases. Experiments showed that adding a large amount of normal PrP to the cells could prevent these effects. These studies, however, had not yet resolved how PrP behaves inside cells and how this contributes to disease.</p><p>Using genetically modified mice and cells grown in the laboratory, Wu et al. investigated the role of different parts of PrP in causing brain cells to degenerate. The experiments showed that one end of the protein, called the N-terminus, is involved in the movement of electrical charges across the cell membrane and is able to cause cell degeneration. By contrast, the other end of the protein, the C-terminus, acts as a regulator for the N-terminus and can prevent cell degeneration. Further investigation revealed that the C-terminus regulates the N-terminus through direct contact.</p><p>A better understanding of the role of PrP in prion diseases may help to reveal new treatments for these and other degenerative brain disorders. In particular, the new findings highlight that treatments should target the toxic N-terminus of altered PrP and not the regulatory C-terminus. Further study will examine how different molecules in the brain control the interaction between the two ends of PrP in healthy brain cells and how this is altered in diseased cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23473.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23473.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotoxicity</kwd><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>protein regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS065244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Bei</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Celeste B</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM065790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Markham</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Millhauser</surname><given-names>Glenn L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Kyle P</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 1454508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Kyle P</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(TA 167/6)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tatzelt</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>N.I.H.

These diseases are caused by refolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into an infectious isoform (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that catalytically templates its abnormal conformation onto additional molecules of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prusiner, 1998</xref>). A similar, prion-like process may play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases and tauopathies, which are due to protein misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jucker and Walker, 2013</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence that PrP<sup>C</sup>, in addition to serving as a precursor to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, acts as a signal transducer that mediates the neurotoxic effects of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biasini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chesebro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mallucci et al., 2003</xref>). Clues to possible mechanisms by which PrP<sup>C</sup> can initiate neurotoxic activity have emerged from studies of transgenic mice expressing PrP molecules that harbor certain internal deletions within the N-terminal domain. The PrP<sup>C</sup> molecule consists of a partially unstructured N-terminal domain (residues 23–125), and a globular, C-terminal domain (residues 126–230) comprising three α-helices and two short, β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zahn et al., 2000</xref>). Deletions spanning a 21-amino acid region (amino acids 105–125) at the end of the flexible, N-terminal domain induce a spontaneous neurodegenerative phenotype with certain similarities to natural prion diseases, but without accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shmerling et al., 1998</xref>). Importantly, these phenotypes are dose-dependently suppressed by co-expression of wild-type PrP, suggesting that the wild-type and deleted molecules interact with each other, or compete for binding to a common molecular target that mediates both physiological and pathological effects. The shortest deletion, Δ105–125 (designated ΔCR, for <underline>c</underline>entral <underline>r</underline>egion), produces the most severe neurodegenerative phenotype, and requires the largest amount of wild-type PrP for rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In our efforts to understand why these deleted forms of PrP are so neurotoxic, we have discovered that they induce large, spontaneous ionic currents, recordable by patch clamping techniques, when expressed in a variety of cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Solomon et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>) and in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biasini et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, these currents are silenced by co-expression of wild-type PrP in the same cells, paralleling the rescuing effects of wild-type PrP in transgenic mice expressing deleted PrP. This observation suggests that the spontaneous ionic currents themselves, or some closely associated phenomenon, play a role in the neurodegenerative phenotype of these mice.</p><p>In this study, we uncover novel mechanistic features of the toxicity-inducing activities of PrP<sup>C</sup>. We show that ligands binding N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> abolish ΔCR PrP-induced currents, as do mutations of positively charged residues at the extreme N-terminus of this domain. Remarkably, expression of the isolated N-terminal domain in the absence of the C-terminal domain also induces spontaneous currents, indicating that the N-terminal domain is capable of acting as an autonomous, toxicity-determining effector. We also demonstrate that anti-PrP antibodies targeting epitopes in the structured, C-terminal domain induce ionic currents in cultured cells expressing wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>, and cause degeneration of dendrites on hippocampal neurons. These results, taken together with structural evidence from heteronuclear NMR experiments, suggest a molecular model for PrP<sup>C</sup> in which the N-terminal domain acts as a neurotoxic effector whose activity is regulated by the C-terminal domain. We speculate that this inter-domain regulatory interaction could play a role in the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup>, and that disruption of this interaction could contribute to pathology in neurodegenerative disorders. Our results also have important implications for the safety of anti-PrP antibody therapies for prion and Alzheimer’s diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>N-terminal ligands, and reversal of positive charges, block ΔCR-induced currents</title><p>Our previous studies identified a positively charged, nine amino acid segment at the very beginning of the N-terminal domain (residues 23–31, KKRPKPGGW) that is essential for the current activity of ΔCR PrP, and for the neurodegenerative phenotype of mice expressing another deletion mutant, Δ32–134 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solomon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westergard et al., 2011b</xref>). As demonstrated in these earlier studies, deletion of residues 23–31 abolishes the spontaneous inward currents induced by ΔCR PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as does addition of pentosan polysulfate (PPS), a negatively-charged glycosaminoglycan which binds to several regions within the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To probe further the role of the N-terminal domain in ΔCR PrP-induced currents, we tested the effect of additional ligands (antibodies and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions), as well alteration of positively charged residues within 23–31 region.</p><p>We tested two different anti-prion antibodies: 100B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thuring et al., 2005</xref>), targeting residues 24–28, and POM11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Polymenidou et al., 2008</xref>), which binds to the octapeptide repeats (residues 51–90). These antibodies (at concentrations of 57 nM and 33 nM, respectively), dramatically reduced ΔCR PrP-induced currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). As a control for POM11, we tested the effect of this antibody on ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP, which retains current activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solomon et al., 2011</xref>), but which lacks the octapeptide repeat region and would not be expected to bind the antibody. As predicted, POM11 had relatively little effect on the currents induced by ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while 100B3 and PPS were still inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results demonstrate that antibody ligands targeting the extreme N-terminus or the octapeptide repeats inhibit ΔCR PrP-induced currents. Interestingly, even though the octapeptide repeats are not required for current activity, binding of an antibody ligand to this region blocks the currents.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23473.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ligands binding to the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> block ΔCR-induced currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, representative traces of currents recorded from N2a cells expressing ΔCR or ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP in the absence (upper traces) or presence (lower traces) of 100B3 (57 nM).

Pentaglycine, with a K<sub>d</sub> for Cu<sup>2+</sup> similar to that of PrP<sup>C</sup> (40 nM), was included as a Cu<sup>2+</sup> chelator in order to minimize the concentration of free Cu<sup>2+</sup> (1 μM) while still allowing PrP<sup>C</sup> to compete for Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. This result indicates that Cu<sup>2+</sup> coordination to the octapeptide repeats blocks ΔCR PrP currents.</p><p>Both PPS and copper have been shown to induce endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup> from cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pauly and Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shyng et al., 1995a</xref>). To determine whether ligand binding to the N-terminus blocked ΔCR PrP-induced currents by reducing the amount of the mutant protein on the cell surface, living cells were treated with PPS for 1 hr or Cu<sup>2+</sup>-pentaglycine for 5 min in recording buffer at room temperature, and then surface-stained for ΔCR PrP with anti-PrP antibody. Under these conditions, neither ligand altered the amount of ΔCR PrP on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), presumably because of the short period of treatment and the fact that the experiment was conducted at room temperature rather than 37°C. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pauly and Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shyng et al., 1995a</xref>), PPS did induce significant endocytosis after treatment at 37°C for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, the inhibitory effects of PPS, POM11, 100B3 and Cu<sup>2+</sup> did not result from acute changes in localization or trafficking of the mutant protein.</p><p>The extreme N-terminus of PrP<sup>C</sup> contains four positively charged amino acids (<sub>23</sub><bold>KKR</bold>P<bold>K</bold>PGGW<sub>31</sub>). To test the role of these residues in ΔCR-induced currents, we generated a variant of ΔCR (designated ΔCR/E3D) in which the three lysine residues (at positions 23, 24, and 27) were mutated to glutamic acid and the single arginine residue (at position 25) was mutated to aspartic acid. We found that N2a cells expressing this mutant did not show any currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The most active currents were observed with a construct encompassing PrP residues 1–109, with successively lower current activities seen as the constructs became shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Importantly, the PrP 32–109 construct was much less active, demonstrating the dependence of current activity on the 23–31 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Expression of the C-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> (Δ23–89 PrP) did not induce any currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We note that ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was more effective at inducing currents than 1–31-EGFP or 1–59-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There are at least two possible reasons for this observation. First, the ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP construct contains additional sequences that are not present in the 1–31-EGFP or 1–59-EGFP constructs. In particular, ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP contains residues 91–104, which are absent in 1–31-EGFP and 1–59-EGFP. These additional residues may enhance production of spontaneous currents, consistent with the general observation that PrP-EGFP chimeras incorporating longer stretches of the PrP N-terminus produced more currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A second possible explanation is that the EGFP portion of the chimeric constructs may position the PrP N-terminus at a different distance from the membrane, or in a different orientation, than the natural PrP<sup>C</sup> C-terminus, and this may diminish the ability of the N-terminus to interact with the membrane to produce currents.</p><p>The spontaneous currents associated with PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI had characteristics identical to the currents associated with ΔCR PrP. First, PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI currents were sporadic in nature, and were silenced by N-terminal ligands, including PPS, 100B3, POM11, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-pentaglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Second, PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI currents, like ΔCR PrP currents, were silenced in a dose-dependent fashion by co-expression of WT PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Moreover, removal of 23–31 region abolished the ability of WT PrP<sup>C</sup> to suppress both ΔCR and PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that expression of Δ23–31 PrP does not rescue the neurodegenerative phenotype of mice expressing Δ32–134 PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turnbaugh et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the currents induced by both ΔCR and PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI were voltage-dependent, only being observed at holding potentials below −30 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NMR analysis reveals diminished interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of ΔCR PrP</title><p>The results presented thus far suggest that the C-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> may directly regulate the N-terminal domain through a cis-interaction between the two domains. This interaction may be disrupted by deletion of residues in the central region (as in ΔCR), or by substitution of an unrelated protein for the C-terminal domain (as in PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al. (2016)</xref> used <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR to demonstrate that Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions, when bound to the N-terminal, octapeptide repeats, promote contact between these repeats and a C-terminal surface site encompassing helices 2 and 3. We predicted that this <italic>cis</italic> interaction would be weakened in ΔCR, thereby accounting for the ability of the liberated N-terminal domain to induce spontaneous currents.</p><p>To test this prediction, we employed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement to probe the interaction between octapeptide-bound Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions and residues in the C-terminal domain. Using the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al. (2016)</xref>, we compared the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra of recombinant, wild-type mouse PrP (WT PrP) and ΔCR PrP in the presence and absence of one equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Residues that come in close proximity to Cu<sup>2+</sup> have their NMR cross-peaks broadened, resulting in a lower observed intensity. For example, in the absence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, a large cross-peak shown in black corresponding to WT PrP residue E199 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1–A1</xref>). However, upon the addition of one equivalent of Cu<sup>2+</sup> the corresponding cross-peak depicted in red for residue E199 was greatly diminished in intensity. On the other hand, when Cu<sup>2+</sup> was titrated into ΔCR PrP, only a small shift between positions of the cross-peaks corresponding to E199 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1–A2</xref>). The chemical shift changes, mapped onto the structure of WTPrP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, identify those residues in the C-terminal domain affected by Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding to the octapeptide repeats. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1 and A2</xref>, residues that do not significantly change upon addition of Cu<sup>2+</sup> are indicated by blue bars, while residues that underwent a significant reduction in intensity are indicated by red bars. Cross-peaks that were not identified are not shown in the figure. The large interaction patch seen in WT PrP is clearly reduced in the ΔCR mutant (compare the residues highlighted in magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B1/C1 and B2/C2</xref>), especially in helices 2 and 3. These data suggest that deletion of residues in the central region disrupts a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-driven regulatory interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23473.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ΔCR PrP shows diminished interaction between N- and C-terminal domains based on NMR analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reduction in peak intensities of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of WT PrP (A1) and ΔCR PrP (A2) in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>.

Because we were not able to obtain sufficient amounts of ICSM-18 for further electrophysiological experiments, we turned to a single chain version of this antibody (ICSM-18 scFv). Like the holo-antibody, ICSM-18 scFv-induced spontaneous currents on on N2a cells overexpressing WT PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), although higher concentrations were required (200 nM for the scFv version, compared to 33.3 nM for the holo-antibody), presumably reflecting the lower avidity of the monovalent scFv antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mammen, 1998</xref>).

In addition, treatment of WT PrP-expressing N2a cells with POM11 blocked POM1- or D18-induced currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), similar to the inhibitory effect of POM11 on ΔCR PrP currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, cells expressing PrP with a deletion of residues 23–31 were resistant to current induction by POM1 and D18 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), parallel to the situation with ΔCR PrP, and emphasizing the importance of the polybasic region in antibody-induced current generation. One would expect a significant reduction in antibody-induced currents in N2a cells expressing Δ23–31 PrP compared to cells over-expressing WT PrP (as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), since the endogenous level of WT PrP in N2a cells is low, and we have shown that untransfected cells display reduced currents after antibody treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The fact that the Δ23–31-expressing cells do not display even low levels of current due to endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> may be due to some suppression of endogenous PrP expression, or perhaps competition by the deleted protein for binding of the antibodies.</p><p>We performed several control experiments to demonstrate that the antibody-induced currents were dependent on expression of cell-surface PrP<sup>C</sup>. First, we pretreated transfected N2a cells expressing WT PrP with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) at 1 U/ml for 4 hr at 37°C, which cleaves the C-terminal GPI anchor and releases PrP<sup>C</sup> from the cell membrane. Neither D18 nor POM1 induced currents in PIPLC pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Second, we demonstrated that D18 did not induce currents in N2a cells in which PrP gene expression had been abolished by CRISPR-Cas technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mehrabian et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, we observed that D18 induced currents in untransfected N2a cells, although they were smaller than in transfected N2a cells over-expressing WT PrP<sup>C</sup>, presumably due to the lower expression level of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the former cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that D18 and POM1-induced currents are PrP-dependent and are due to binding of the antibodies to cell-surface PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p><p>To determine whether antibody-induced currents were the result of cross-linking of cell-surface PrP<sup>C</sup>, or Fc-mediated antibody effector functions, we tested the effect of monovalent Fab fragments. We found that Fab fragments prepared from D18-induced currents on N2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This result, along with the effectiveness of ICSM-18 scFv antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicates that the ability of the C-terminally directed antibodies to induce currents in PrP-expressing cells is not due to cross-linking of cell-surface PrP by bivalent binding, or to Fc-mediated effector functions such as complement fixation.</p><p>The antibody 6D11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pankiewicz et al., 2006</xref>), whose epitope (residues 93–109) encompasses several positively charged residues following the octapeptide repeats, also induced currents in WT PrP-expressing N2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, this antibody was less potent than POM1 and D18, since the currents were much smaller, and higher concentrations were required to produce consistent effects (66.7 nM for 6D11, compared to 33.3 nM for POM1 and 16.7 nM for D18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). 6D11 and three other antibodies targeting this region, D13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williamson et al., 1998</xref>) (epitope: a.a. 95–105), POM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Polymenidou et al., 2008</xref>) (epitope: a.a. 95–100) and ICSM-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khalili-Shirazi et al., 2007</xref>) (epitope: a.a. 93–105), did not induce currents at a concentration of 33.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that antibodies targeting a positively charged segment at the terminus of the flexible domain are less effective at inducing currents than antibodies binding to helix 1 in the C-terminal, structured domain.</p><p>To explore further the epitope specificity of the antibody-induced currents, we tested two additional POM antibodies recognizing other epitopes in the C-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup>. We found that POM4 (whose epitope encompasses helix 3 and β1) and POM6 (which recognizes helices 1 and 2) did not produce detectable currents when applied to WT PrP-expressing N2a cells at a concentration of 33.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We tested whether anti-PrP antibodies induce currents in hippocampal neurons, as well as in N2a cells.

Eight of 10 Tga20 neurons analyzed in the presence of D18 were lost to observation shortly after breaking the patch, usually after recording an initial inward current that did not return to baseline. This phenomenon is similar to what we previously observed in cultured neurons expressing ΔCR PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biasini et al., 2013</xref>), and may reflect a detrimental effect of the induced currents on the integrity of the neuronal membrane. In contrast, recordings from Tga20 neurons in the presence of D18 and PPS remained stable for 5 min without current activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Seven out of 15 wild-type neurons analyzed in the presence of D18 exhibited spontaneous currents, with no lost cells.

Both activities are associated with deletions spanning the central region of the protein (residues 105–125), as well as with binding of antibodies to overlapping epitopes on the outer surface of helix 1 in the structured, C-terminal domain of the protein. Both activities are dependent on the flexible, N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup>, and are blocked by deletion or mutation of this domain, or by binding of specific ligands to the N-terminal domain. When fused to an unrelated protein (EGFP), the N-terminal domain is sufficient by itself to induce current activity in the absence of the C-terminal domain. Taken together with evidence from heteronuclear NMR experiments, these results suggest a molecular model in which the N-terminal domain represents a toxic effector whose activity is regulated by the C-terminal domain, most likely by a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-promoted physical interaction between the two domains. We speculate that alterations of this intramolecular regulation may have both pathological and physiological consequences.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> is necessary and sufficient for current activity</title><p>Our previous studies identified a nine amino-acid polybasic region at the N-terminus of PrP<sup>C</sup> (residues 23–31) that is essential for several toxic activities, including the spontaneous current activity associated with the ΔCR PrP deletion mutant, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of cells expressing ΔCR PrP, and the neurodegenerative phenotype of transgenic mice expressing the deletion mutant Δ34–121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solomon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westergard et al., 2011b</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that reversal of positive charges within this region (three lysine residues and one arginine residue) abolishes ΔCR current activity, as does treatment with ligands (antibodies, Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions, pentosan sulfate) that bind to this region or to other sites within the flexible N-terminal domain (residues 23–125). Strikingly, the isolated N-terminal domain fused to an unrelated protein (EGFP) has the ability to induce spontaneous ionic currents. The magnitude of these currents is quantitatively related to the length of the N-terminus incorporated (fusions ending at residues 31, 58, 90, and 109 produce progressively more current), and the activity of these constructs is entirely dependent on the presence of the 23–31 region. Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> acts as an autonomous effector of ionic current activity, and that basic amino acids at the extreme N-terminus are essential for this activity.</p><p>We suggest two possible models to explain how the N-terminal domain induces currents. One model is based on the fact that polybasic residues 23–31 resemble a ‘protein transduction domain’, originally described in the HIV Tat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wadia et al., 2008</xref>). Such positively charged domains are capable of penetrating lipid bilayers and creating pores, by virtue of binding to and disrupting membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herce and Garcia, 2007</xref>). The N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> may thus function as a ‘tethered’ protein transduction domain capable of spontaneously and transiently penetrating the lipid bilayer to produce pores that allow passage of ions. Consistent with penetration of a positively charged protein domain into or across the cell membrane, we find that the ionic current activity associated with both ΔCR and PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI is apparent only at hyperpolarized holding potentials (&lt;−30 mV), similar to the resting potential of neurons (−60 to −70 mV). A second possibility is that the N-terminal domain interacts with other membrane proteins, for example endogenous ion channels or channel-modulating proteins, to induce current activity. Supporting this hypothesis is our observation that co-expression of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> suppresses the ionic currents induced by ΔCR and PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI, a phenomenon that could be attributable to competition between the wild-type and mutant forms for a common membrane-associated target protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Antibodies to the C-terminal domain induce currents</title><p>Three different antibodies (POM1, D18, ICSM-18) targeting the C-terminal domain all induce ionic current activity in cells expressing WT PrP<sup>C</sup>. Importantly, the properties of these currents are identical to those of the spontaneous currents associated with ΔCR PrP, in terms of their sporadic nature, their blockage by N-terminal ligands (PPS, antibodies), and their absolute dependence on the presence of the polybasic 23–31 region. Based on crystal structures, mutagenesis studies, and peptide arrays, the epitopes of these antibodies, while not identical, are largely overlapping and encompass the outer surface of helix 1, as well as parts of the β1-α1 loop and helix 3 in the case of POM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonyuk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doolan and Colby, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>).

Published crystal structures of both POM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>) and ICSM-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonyuk et al., 2009</xref>) bound to PrP<sup>C</sup> indicate that these antibodies do not induce major structural alterations in the PrP<sup>C</sup> globular domain compared to the unliganded state, arguing against antibody-induced allosteric changes as a toxic mechanism. Rather, our results suggest that antibodies bound to helix 1 disrupt a critical regulatory interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains, thereby liberating the N-terminal domain to produce toxic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The fact both Fab and scFv forms of the relevant antibodies display current-inducing activity suggests that antibody ligands as small as 25–50 kDa are able to disrupt N-C interactions. We propose that a similar loss of regulation occurs when residues within the 95–125 region are deleted (as in ΔCR), or when an unrelated protein is substituted for the C-terminal domain (PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). In this scenario, the toxic activity of the liberated N-terminal domain would be blocked by binding of ligands, including PPS, antibodies, or Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23473.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Models for the neurotoxic effects of PrP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The C-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> negatively regulates the toxic effector function of the N-terminal domain. +++, basic residues within the 23–31 region at the extreme N-terminus, which are essential for the toxic action of PrP.

NMR studies performed here as well as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spevacek et al., 2013</xref>) demonstrate that the N-terminal domain docks onto the C-terminal domain, thereby regulating in cis the ability of the N-terminal domain to promote toxic effector functions under normal conditions. Of note, the docking site encompasses the POM1 epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, binding of antibodies to this region would be predicted to disrupt the N-C interaction, leading to toxic activity. We also show here that deletion of the central region (in ΔCR PrP) weakens Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced N-C interaction, consistent with the hypothesis that the toxicity of the ΔCR mutant results from disrupted regulation of the N-terminal domain. Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions are physiological ligands of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Millhauser, 2007</xref>), and changes in endogenous Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentration are likely to modulate the strength of N-C interactions. Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding to the octarepeats may also directly suppress the toxic activity of the N-terminal domain, as we have observed for the currents induced by ΔCR PrP and PrP(N)-EGFP-GPI.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>C-terminally directed antibodies induce dendritic degeneration</title><p>In addition to acutely inducing ionic currents, helix 1 antibodies (POM1, D18, ICSM18) cause major changes in dendritic morphology of cultured hippocampal neurons, in particular the appearance of blebs or varicosities, when applied for longer periods of time (48 hr) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These antibody-induced dendritic changes are, like the currents induced by the same antibodies, entirely dependent on the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup>, and are blocked by N-terminal ligands and deletions of residues 23–31.</p><p>The parallel characteristics of the ionic currents and the dendritic changes induced by C-terminal antibodies suggest a mechanistic connection between the two phenomena. One possibility is that chronic activation of PrP<sup>C</sup>-mediated currents leads directly or indirectly to dendritic degeneration. Consistent with this possibility, dendritic varicosities similar to those caused by anti-PrP antibodies are a characteristic feature of glutamate excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hasbani et al., 2001</xref>), and glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the neuronal degeneration induced by ΔCR PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biasini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2010</xref>). A second possibility is that current induction and dendritic degeneration are parallel events that represent two distinct outputs of antibody binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>. For example, the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> may stimulate currents by interacting with the lipid bilayer, and dendritic changes by interacting with signal-transducing proteins embedded in the membrane.</p><p>Several other studies have reported toxic effects of anti-PrP antibodies, including several of the ones used here, although some of these results have been contradictory. It has been reported that antibodies D13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reimann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Solforosi et al., 2004</xref>), POM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>), and ICSM-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reimann et al., 2016</xref>), but not D18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Solforosi et al., 2004</xref>), caused acute death (within 24–48 hr) of neurons when injected stereotaxically into the hippocampus or cerebellum. Using a similar protocol, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klöhn et al. (2012)</xref> found that D13 and ICSM-18 were non-toxic, as was ICSM-35. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al. (2013)</xref> observed that chronic treatment (10–21 days) of cerebellar slices with several C-terminally directed antibodies, including POM1, caused neuronal death, and they concluded that this effect was dependent on the flexible N-terminal domain. The results presented here are consistent with this proposal.</p><p>It has been reported that anti-PrP antibodies trigger several toxic mechanisms in cerebellar slices, including generation of reactive oxygen species, calpain activation and stimulation of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>). Whether these pathways are operative in our system remains to be determined. Since we observe relatively acute changes in dendritic morphology without loss of neuronal viability, it is possible that the downstream toxic pathways engaged by antibody treatment in our system may be different.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications</title><p>The results presented here have several important implications. First, they add to concerns that have been raised regarding the use of anti-PrP antibodies as therapeutic tools for treatment of prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2003</xref>) and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klyubin et al., 2014</xref>), given the potential side-effects of these reagents on neuronal viability at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reimann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Solforosi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Second, our results also suggest a mechanism by which pathologic ligands that bind to PrP<sup>C</sup> could produce neurotoxic effects by disrupting the normal regulatory cis-interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains, similar to the action of the antibodies described in this study. The Alzheimer’s Aβ peptide, which binds to PrP<sup>C</sup> and triggers functional and structural alterations in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laurén et al., 2009</xref>), is an example of such a ligand. PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which also binds to PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solforosi et al., 2007</xref>), might act in a similar fashion, although the fact that mice expressing N-terminally truncated PrP<sup>C</sup> remain susceptible to prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Supattapone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turnbaugh et al., 2012</xref>) argues against this as the primary pathogenic mechanism in these disorders.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that the antibody-induced effects we have observed here are a reflection of a physiological activity of PrP<sup>C</sup>. If so, natural ligands, including proteins, small molecules or metal ions, may exist, whose binding to PrP<sup>C</sup> regulates an effector activity of the N-terminal domain, similar to the way that we suppose anti-PrP antibodies operate. Copper ions are examples of natural ligands, binding of which to the octapeptide repeats promotes docking of the N- and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spevacek et al., 2013</xref>). Endogenous ligands for the globular domain may also exist, which either enhance or disrupt N-C interaction.

Intensity ratios were analyzed using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) and residues with intensity reductions greater the one standard deviation of the mean were considered significantly perturbed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants R01 NS065244 (to DAH), R01 GM065790 (to GLM), and GM104316 (to DWC); NSF grant 1454508 (to DWC); and by funds from the German Research Foundation (TA 167/6) to JT We thank Dr. Gerold Schmitt-Ulms for supplying <italic>Prnp</italic> gene-edited N2a cells; Anthony Williamson, Dennis Burton, and Bruce Chesebro for providing D13 and D18 hybridoma cells; and the University of Zürich, Institute of Neuropathology, Switzerland, for providing the POM antibodies.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>BW, Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>AJM, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>KM, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>CBR, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>KPM, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>JT, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>DWC, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>GLM, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>DAH, Supervision, Writing—original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Rob Krumlauf (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Surachai Supattapone (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present data from multiple complementary approaches, and build upon prior results, to elucidate the role of the N-terminal domain of PrP in mediating ionic membrane currents and neuronal degeneration. The reviewers are enthusiastic about insights into a potential mechanism for the toxicity of certain anti-PrP antibodies, which may help to resolve the current controversy about using these antibodies in human immunotherapy trials. The model may help explain the toxicity of Abeta oligomers, which bind to PrPC, although this isn't directly tested. The reviewers have elaborated several questions and concerns that must be addressed before this manuscript can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers point out two apparent inconsistencies that need resolution: First, the failure of the 1-31-EGFP and 1-59-EGFP constructs to induce currents is puzzling since the deltaCR/delta51-90 mutant is very active in this regard and nearly identical to these EGFP constructs in terms of the N-terminal domain. Second, the lack of antibody-induced currents or toxicity in the delta23-31 cells and transgenic mouse neurons is surprising since one would expect that wild-type levels of PrP are present.</p><p>2) The relevance of the current findings to disease is incompletely explored. Whereas the connection between the toxicity of the POM1 and d13 antibodies with the ionic current mechanism is novel and interesting, the authors also speculate that the N-terminus of PrPC may be the mediator of PrPSc- and Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. This can be addressed by emphasizing that the mechanism explored relates to antibody-induced current only. Alternatively, to support the relationship to PrPSc- and Abeta-induced neurodegeneration, the reviewers have requested further elucidation of this connection and suggested additional experiments in this regard. Specifically, one reviewer expressed skepticism that the N-terminus of PrPC is required for the PrPSc-induced neurodegeneration since transgenic mice expressing N-terminally truncated PrPC develop spongiform degeneration following prion inoculation (J Virol. 2001 Feb;75(3):1408-13). On the other hand, perhaps the N-terminus of PrPC is required for Abeta-mediated toxicity, and we encourage the authors to test this directly (e.g. does application of Abeta oligomer cause the current?) Also, do recombinant PrP oligomers or fibrils induce currents?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The PrPc protein harbors an intrinsically disordered segment between aa23-125. It was previously noted that expression in mice of a mutant form of PrPc with internal deletions of aa102-125 result in degeneration in the absence of PrP amyloid assembly and, furthermore, that this toxicity is suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by OE of wild type PrPc. In parallel it was noted that expression of internal deletion mutants of PrPc in cell lines induce spontaneous ionic currents that are also suppressed by OE of wild type PrPc, although a cause-and-effect relationship between ionic current induction and degeneration remains to be established. The current study focuses on the role of the N-terminus of PrPc in mediating the toxicity.</p><p>Within the N-terminus of PrPc, prior studies suggested that a charged region (aa23-31) is essential for current induction by expressing PrPc-delta105-125 in cells and also degeneration in mice expressing PrPc-delta32-134. Prior studies also showed that treatment of cells with pentosan polysulfate (PPS, which purportedly binds to the N-terminus of PrPc) also abolished current induction. Here the investigators show that treatment with anti-PrPC antibodies 100B3 (epitope aa24-28) and POM11 (epitope aa51-90) both reduce current induction in N2a cells expressing mutant deltaCR PrPc. Deletion of the epitope for POM11, a region of octapeptide repeats, eliminates the effect of POM11 treatment. Further investigating the octapeptide repeats they use show that addition of Cu++, which purportedly binds the octapeptide repeats reduces current induction in N2a cells expressing mutant deltaCR PrPc, similar to antibody binding. Further confirming the importance of the positively charged region, a mutant (E3D, in which 3 charges are reversed) also abolished current-inducing activity. Interestingly, it is shown that the N-terminal domain itself (aa1-109), in the absence of the C-terminal domain, is sufficient to induce spontaneous currents. This activity reduces with smaller fragments. These currents are inhibited by ligands, including PPS, Cu++, and antibodies 100B3 and POM11. NMR-based interrogation suggests that aa102-125 deletion, which correlates with current induction, reduces interaction between the C-terminus and N-terminus of PrPc. Antibodies targeting the C-terminal folded domain also induced spontaneous currents, and expression of PrPc-delta23-31 were resistant to current induction. One antibody (D18) failed to induce currents in cells pre-treated with PIPLC to cleave PrPc, or in cells with PrPc knockout.</p><p>The proposal that a disinhibited native function of PrPc mediates the toxicity of PrPsc (and perhaps A-β), and that the mechanism relates to disturbance of association between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of PrPc is certainly intriguing. As an outsider to the prion field, I find this line of investigation fascinating. With respect to the current work, I find compelling the evidence that the C-terminus of PrPc suppresses an activity of the N-terminus that underlies the induction of a spontaneous ionic current. I have several experimental questions, but the two more important issues to me are:</p><p>1) what is the disease relevance of the spontaneous currents examined here? and 2) to what extent does this work provide a conceptual advance or mechanistic insight beyond what was previously known? First, with respect to the spontaneous currents elicited by expression of mutant PrPc (PrPc-delta105-125), as far as I can tell there is no established cause-and-effect relationship with degeneration, merely a correlation between induction of these currents in cell culture and degeneration in cells or in mice. Even if it is clear that spontaneous currents associated with forms of PrPc with internal deletions can drive toxicity, is this toxic gain of function relevant and essential to degeneration driven by PrPsc (and A-β)? Second, it appears that prior work has already established that PrPc deletion mutants induce spontaneous currents that are mitigated by N-terminal binding ligands, that the N-terminus interacts with the C-terminus, and that similar currents can be induced by antibodies targeting certain C-terminal epitopes. Just how much of a mechanistic advance does the current paper represent?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This important study by Wu and colleagues focuses on understanding the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by PrPC. These new results shed light on how PrP can trigger ionic currents and neuronal degeneration, and also provide hints into the physiologic function of PrPC. Residues 23-26 in the N-terminus of PrP were previously identified as key to inducing spontaneous ionic currents in cells with deletions in the central region of PrP (105-125). Here, in a carefully controlled series of experiments, additional ligands specific for the N-terminus abolished spontaneous ionic currents, as did mutating the suspected N-terminal lysine residues. The C-terminus of PrP was not required for the induction of ionic currents. The experiments are well-designed and logical, and for the most part, clearly described. Inclusion of relevant negative data would be informative (noted below). Overall this work is a highly significant contribution toward understanding prion protein pathophysiology, and may have implications for AD since amyloid-β oligomers may bind PrPC and lead to neuronal toxicity.</p><p>Suggestions for improving the manuscript clarity are noted below.</p><p>1) Whether ionic currents are induced during prion disease is unclear. Did the authors test recPrP oligomers or fibrils for induction of currents?</p><p>2) Three antibodies targeting C-terminal epitopes in PrP were found to induce spontaneous currents, but it is unclear how many antibodies were tested. Were antibodies to other C-terminal epitopes tested (i.e. helix 3)? These would provide additional support for helix 1 specificity.</p><p>3) Further description of the NMR methods and analysis in the Results is necessary for clarity, i.e., what residues in the C-terminus were impacted by copper binding to the OR? This seems to be the key point of these results, yet the interaction patch is not described beyond helices 2 and 3 in the C-terminus. From the figure, it appears that there is no longer an interaction with helix 3. Also a brief explanation of the NMR spectra would be helpful. Also the reference to the methods used from the Evans et al. study is unclear, was there a key part of the methods employed?</p><p>4) The currents in untransfected N2a were reported as smaller, but the figure shows fewer (% of time). How much smaller were the currents in the untransfected cells?</p><p>5) Subsection “Antibodies against the C-terminal domain and hinge region of PrP<sup>C</sup> induce ionic currents”, last paragraph – Were anti-PrP antibodies tested in WT hippocampal neurons tested in addition to the tga20 neurons? It would be important to know whether overexpression was required to observe currents or the dendritic degeneration in neurons. Please clarify.</p><p>6) Adriano Aguzzi and colleagues have published several high profile papers on prion-induced toxicity, also describing the N-terminus as an effector regulated by the C-terminal domain. It would be important to discuss how the results here correspond to these findings from the field.</p><p>7) In previous reports, the PERK arm of the UPR was activated following exposure to anti-PrP C-terminal antibodies (Hermann et al., 2015 PLoS Pathogens). Did the authors test whether the PERK pathway was activated in the hippocampal neurons? Or whether calpain activation occurred (as observed in the Sonati et al. study, Nature 2013)?</p><p>8) The beaded appearance of the dendrites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is difficult to appreciate in these small images.</p><p>9) Typo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – Figure shows results from a deletion of 32-109, but legend states deletion of 23-109.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I think this is an outstanding manuscript. The authors use a multidisciplinary approach (electrophysiology, NMR, antibodies, mutagenesis, dendritic spine analysis) with appropriate controls to make an extraordinarily compelling case that the N-terminus of PrP mediates toxicity through inducing an ionic current in cells. The methods, data, rigor, and writing are all top-notch.</p><p>The work is very significant because it provides a mechanism for the toxicity of certain anti-PrP antibodies, which may help to resolve the current controversy about using these antibodies in human immunotherapy trials. The model may help explain the toxicity of Abeta oligomers, which bind to PrPC, although this isn't directly tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript examines the role of the N-terminal domain of the prion protein in mediating ionic membrane currents and neuronal degeneration. Previous result showed that the currents induced by the deltaCR PrP variant (missing residues 105-125) depend on a cluster of positive charges near the very N-terminus of the protein (residues 23-31), that a ligand to the N-terminus of the protein (PPS) eliminates the currents. They now show that two N-terminal epitope antibodies (100B3 and POM11) also reduce these currents, as does copper-2 binding, and as does mutation of 4 positive charges in the positive charge cluster to negative charges (E3D mutant).</p><p>A construct of the N-terminal domain fused to EGFP also elicits ionic currents, but N-terminally and C-terminally truncated versions induced less currents. Notably, here it is unclear why 1-31-EGFP and 1-58-EGFP were not active, since the deltaCR/delta51-90 mutant is very active and nearly identical to these EGFP constructs in terms of the N-terminal domain?</p><p>NMR then shows that the N-to-C-terminal contacts already demonstrated by Millhauser et al. in a previous publication are reduced for the deltaCR mutant. Notably, the data for the WT (panels A1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and panels A1, B1 and C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) appear essentially identical to those previously published, raising the question of whether their inclusion is justified here, and at a minimum a reference must be included in the figure legend.</p><p>Antibodies to the folded C-terminal domain of PrP (POM1, D18 and ICSM-18), previously shown to be toxic, also induced currents that were suppressed by PPS and the POM11 antibody in cells expression WT PrP, but less current was induced for cells expressing PrP missing residues 23-31. The effects are eliminated by cleaving PrP from the membrane, and are observed in WT cells, including hippocampal neurons, but not in PrP KO cells. D18 and POM1 also caused changes in dendritic morphology. Interestingly, in N2A cells expressing delat23-31 or neurons from transgenic mice expressing PrP missing residues 23-31 or 23-111, no effect (currents or toxicity) was observed. However, would the WT protein in these cells/TG mice not be expected to be susceptible to the antibodies and to cause currents/toxicity/degeneration?</p><p>The authors conclude that the N-terminal domain of PrP is responsible for the ionic currents they observe, and propose either a TAT peptide like mechanism or via protein-protein interactions. The propose that these currents, which are induced by antibodies to the C-terminal folded domain, may be responsible for the toxicity of such antibodies, as well as the toxicity of PrpSC, which is also reported to bind to the C-terminal domain of PrpC.</p><p>This is an interesting paper, which attempts to tie together a variety of previous observations from these groups and others, namely that antibodies to PrP can be toxic, that the flexible N-terminus of the protein mediates toxicity as well as ionic currents, and that intra-molecular interactions between the N- and C-terminus may regulate the activity/toxicity of the N-terminus. However, much of this model has already been presented in the various prior studies, including previous NMR work and previous work on the deltaCR construct and on the 23-31 deletion. The work is logical extension of the prior studies, but falls out largely as might be expected. That said, there are some troubling discrepancies, including the failure of the 1-31-EGFP and 1-59-EGFP constructs to induce currents, the lack of antibody-induced currents/ toxicity in the delta23-31 cells and transgenic mouse neurons, and the lack of any data supporting a specific mechanism linking the ionic currents to cell toxicity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The N-terminus of the Prion Protein Is a Toxic Effector Regulated by the C-terminus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

First, the ΔCR/Δ51-90 PrP construct contains additional sequences that are not present in the 1-31-EGFP or 1-59-EGFP constructs. In particular, ΔCR/Δ51-90 PrP contains residues 91-104, which are absent in 1-31-EGFP and 1-59-EGFP. These additional residues may enhance production of spontaneous currents, consistent with the general observation that PrP-EGFP chimeras incorporating longer stretches of the PrP N-terminus produced more currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A second possible explanation is that the EGFP portion of the chimeric constructs may position the PrP N-terminus at a different distance from the membrane, or in a different orientation, than the natural PrP<sup>C</sup> C-terminus, and this may diminish the ability of the N-terminus to interact with the membrane to produce currents. It was necessary to substitute the C-terminal domain of PrP with EGFP in order to facilitate delivery of the proteins to the cell surface.</p><p><italic>Second, the lack of antibody-induced currents or toxicity in the delta23-31 cells and transgenic mouse neurons is surprising since one would expect that wild-type levels of PrP are present.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the Δ23-31 and Δ23-111 PrP transgenic mice used to derive the neurons were maintained on a PrP knockout background, so there is no wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> in those neurons. This has now been clarified in the legend. The Material and Methods section in the original manuscript incorrectly stated that these mice were maintained on a C57BL6 background; this has now been corrected.</p><p>In N2a cells expressing Δ23-31 PrP, one would expect a significant reduction in antibody-induced currents compared to cells over-expressing WT PrP (as was, in fact, observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), since the endogenous level of WT PrP in N2a cells is low, and we have shown that untransfected cells display reduced currents after antibody treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The fact that the Δ23-31-expressing cells do not display even low levels of current due to endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> may be due to some suppression of endogenous PrP expression, or perhaps competition by the deleted protein for binding of the antibodies.</p><p><italic>2) The relevance of the current findings to disease is incompletely explored. Whereas the connection between the toxicity of the POM1 and d13 antibodies with the ionic current mechanism is novel and interesting, the authors also speculate that the N-terminus of PrPC may be the mediator of PrPSc- and Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. This can be addressed by emphasizing that the mechanism explored relates to antibody-induced current only. Alternatively, to support the relationship to PrPSc- and Abeta-induced neurodegeneration, the reviewers have requested further elucidation of this connection and suggested additional experiments in this regard. Specifically, one reviewer expressed skepticism that the N-terminus of PrPC is required for the PrPSc-induced neurodegeneration since transgenic mice expressing N-terminally truncated PrPC develop spongiform degeneration following prion inoculation (J Virol. 2001 Feb;75(3):1408-13). On the other hand, perhaps the N-terminus of PrPC is required for Abeta-mediated toxicity, and we encourage the authors to test this directly (e.g. does application of Abeta oligomer cause the current?) Also, do recombinant PrP oligomers or fibrils induce currents?</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the proposed role of the PrP<sup>C</sup> N-terminus in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and Aβ toxicity is speculative, and is not directly addressed by any of the experiments reported in the paper. We are currently performing experiments to test this hypothesis, but we feel that the results are properly the subject of another paper. It would seem perverse to omit completely any reference to the possible implications of our results for prion pathogenesis, particularly since this connection has already been proposed in two publications from the Aguzzi laboratory (Sonati et al., 2013; Herrmann et al., 2015). However, in line with the suggestion of the reviewers, we have revised the text of the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion sections to downplay the connection to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and Aβ toxicity, and to emphasize the relevance of our findings to the use of anti-PrP antibodies in a clinical setting.</p><p>With regard to the role of the N-terminus in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> toxicity, the reviewers rightly point out that mice expressing N-terminally truncated PrP<sup>C</sup> are susceptible to prion disease (although with a protracted incubation time), as shown in the 2001 J. Virology publication, as well as in our own work (Turnbaugh et al., J. Neurosci. 32:8817– 8830, 2012). We have now cited these papers in the Discussion section, in order to qualify our suggestion about the role of the N-terminus in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> toxicity. However, we wish to point out that the results of these two studies do not definitively rule out a role for the N-terminal domain in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> toxicity. Multiple pathogenic mechanisms likely contribute to neurodegeneration at different times during the course of chronic disorders like prion diseases, and eliminating one of these mechanisms (such as toxicity mediated by the PrP<sup>C</sup> N-terminus) would still allow other mechanisms to remain operative and produce disease. Thus, a more accurate interpretation of the cited experiments is that the PrP<sup>C</sup> N-terminal domain is not required for prion-induced neurodegeneration, but this domain could nevertheless still play a contributing role.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Please revise the text of the manuscript to provide possible explanations for unanticipated results, as described by Reviewer #1.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have posited explanations for two of the deficits noted in my review of the manuscript, namely 1) that residues 91-104 may contribute to current induction in deltaCR/delta51-90 and are absent in 1-31-EGFP and 1-58-EGFP, or possibly that EGFP does not position 1-31 or 1-58 NTD sequences at the proper distance from the membrane; and 2) that no antibody-induced currents are observed in N2A cells transfected with delta23-31 PrP because this construct may compete for antibody binding or suppress endogenous PrP expression.
