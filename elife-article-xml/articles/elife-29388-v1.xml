At the cellular level, different stressors can damage proteins affecting their native structure and thus causing loss of function. A prototypic example is the heat shock that leads to protein misfolding, aggregation and cellular toxicity. To keep the cellular proteome in structural and functional balance, called proteostasis, a network of specialized proteins has evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>). The proteostasis network (PN) is responsible for protein refolding and, in case of the unrepairable damage, degradation. Different classes of molecular chaperones assist during refolding and E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in degradation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>). Both chaperones and E3 ligases are helped by a number of obligate and optional protein cofactors that increase the specificity, precision and efficiency of the respective reactions.</p><p>C-terminal Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a paradigm example of how protein folding and degradation pathways cooperate during protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arndt et al., 2007</xref>). Initially identified as a cytosolic cochaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballinger et al., 1999</xref>), CHIP was shortly afterwards discovered to be a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. It was found to engage with HSP70 and HSP90 molecular chaperones which act as adaptors to detect substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2001</xref>). CHIP interacts with the chaperones through the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. The C-terminal tails of chaperones determines the specificity and affinity of this association, which is rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Weak interaction implies dynamic and transient collaboration between CHIP and the chaperones; however, a detailed atomic and kinetic understanding of the collaboration is missing.</p><p>One key question regarding proteostasis is the molecular and functional differences in space and time at different levels of biological organization: organisms, tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Powers et al., 2009</xref>). Considerable progress has been achieved in elucidating signaling and metabolic mechanisms associated with proteostasis changes during organism aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Zvi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>) and differences of PN composition and stress response across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guisbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tebbenkamp and Borchelt, 2010</xref>). At the level of single cells, an obvious strategy to deal with proteostasis load is to accumulate it in distinct subcellular structures and, in the case of duplication, to inherit it asymmetrically in mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sontag et al., 2014</xref>). Several cellular locations are used to concentrate damaged proteins, such as the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum or perivacuolar space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). A number of PN components, including molecular chaperones from HSP70 and HSP90 families but also the cochaperones HSP40 and HSP110, were shown to be involved in sorting misfolded proteins to the deposition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sontag et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mechanisms leading to the rearrangement of the cellular architecture during proteostasis stress are less clear. How do organelles change to support the sequestration of a misfolded proteome? Is protein quality control machinery involved in this aspect of the stress response? Here we report our finding that chaperone-binding ubiquitin ligase CHIP has the capacity to sense an acute deficiency of HSP70 in the cytosol and relocalize to membrane-bound organelles enriched in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. We describe the structural elements in CHIP which determine its function as a stress sensor. Finally, with the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, we provide an example that the relocalization of PN components is capable of reorganizing the cellular architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chaperone-free CHIP interacts with cellular membranes and phospolipids</title><p>Shortly upon exposing EGFP-CHIP-transfected murine embryonic fibroblasts to 43°C, cells with membranous CHIP localization could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Because the HSP-CHIP association is rather weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Assimon et al., 2015</xref>), we reason that sequestration of chaperones with aggregating proteins could lead to the appearance of chaperone-free CHIP <italic>in vivo</italic>, at least temporarily until more HSPs accumulate following transcriptional upregulation. Indeed, transiently transfected CHIP partially lost its association with HSC70 during acute heat shock as determined by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). To detect chaperone-free endogenous CHIP in membranes, subcellular fractionation combined with chemical crosslinking was performed. In preliminary experiments with recombinant protein, the conditions to capture CHIP in its naturally dimeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolay et al., 2004</xref>) were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f,g</xref>). CHIP association with molecular chaperones is determined mainly by its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain interacting with last several amino acids of HSP70 or HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). When added to cellular lysates, the C-terminal HSP70 octapeptide GPTIEEVD dissociated high-molecular-weight species (CHIP-chaperone complexes) leading to the appearance of an HSP-stripped CHIP dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 8). Presence of a crosslinked dimer, even in the absence of the chaperone-competing peptide, in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 10) indicated that endogenous membrane-associated CHIP was at least partially chaperone-free.</p><p>To further investigate the possibility that it is the chaperone-free CHIP that interacts with cellular membranes, we used a TPR domain mutant K30A with impaired binding to chaperones. Isothermal titration calorimetry using octapeptide GPTIEEVD confirmed the weak binding to wild-type CHIP (K<sub>d</sub> = 5 μM when measured at 37°C) which was further reduced in case of K30A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). As predicted, a membranous localization of EGFP-CHIP-K30A was observed when compared to its wild-type version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The difference could not be explained by different steady-state levels of the proteins upon transient transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). To exclude localization differences due to altered lipid binding specificity, we probed the respective recombinant proteins on lipid arrays <italic>in vitro</italic>. Chaperone-free CHIP and the K30A variant showed a similar binding pattern thus excluding accidental formation of a novel determinant of membrane association by the mutation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, analysis of a broad spectrum of cellular phospholipids revealed CHIP specificity mainly to phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol monophosphates (PIP), especially PI4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Binding to phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphates was reduced and there was no binding to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate detected, arguing against a trivial electrostatic interaction but pointing instead to high stereospecificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sudhahar et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that chaperone-free CHIP was able to interact with cellular membranes <italic>in vivo</italic> and a distinct set of phospholipids <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Membranes and chaperones compete for TPR domain of CHIP <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To analyze the details of the interaction, we reconstituted CHIP association with membranes <italic>in vitro</italic> using the recombinantly purified chaperone-free wild-type protein and 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposomes. A liposome floatation assay revealed cofloatation of CHIP which was strongly enhanced when liposomes were supplemented with 20% PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). CHIP also interacted with liposomes in a liposome pelleting assay, in which pelleting was increased in the presence of PA and also by 1% PI4P, but to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Surprisingly, the antibody recognizing the N-terminal epitope (18–37 aa) failed to detect CHIP bound to lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). Given the comparable sensitivities of the C-terminal and N-terminal antibodies when tested with recombinant CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>), the result suggested that the N-terminal part of CHIP, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, must be involved in the interaction with lipids thereby hindering its recognition by the respective antibody. TPR domains are found in numerous proteins where they usually mediate protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeytuni and Zarivach, 2012</xref>). However, there is at least one example of a TPR domain-lipid interaction as in the case of protein phosphatase 5 binding fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Cohen, 1997</xref>). To test the assumption that the TPR domain from CHIP has dual – protein and lipid - specificity, we cloned and purified the isolated TPR domain and TPR domain-free CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, upper panel outlining the deletions). We decided to include the neighboring N- and C-terminal regions while preparing the recombinant TPR domain in order to preserve its functional and structural integrity. According to deuterium exchange measurements, the N-terminal tail is very dynamic extending this flexibility over the first two α-helices in the TPR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2010</xref>); from the other side, 16 C-terminal α-helical amino acids seem to cap the last tetratricopeptide repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The truncated proteins remained soluble and did not pellet during ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The liposome cosedimentation analyses confirmed that the TPR domain is required for the interaction with membranes containing either PA or PI4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Notably, the isolated TPR domain bound to the PA-containing liposomes more strongly than the parental full-length protein reaching ca. 160% efficiency of the full-length protein. The relatively high PA concentration (20%) in liposomes seems not to be a reason of this effect, because the TPR domain still surpassed the full-length CHIP in binding capacity when liposomes with lower concentration (5%) of PA were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). The high flexibility and asymmetry of CHIP dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) possibly influence the dynamics of membrane interaction (e.g. on- and off-rates) which might differ in case of the isolated TPR domains. The argument of dynamic interaction fits well with our microscopy data where fixation of the samples were found to affect the membrane localization of chaperone-free CHIP.</p><p>Having established an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, we sought to test directly the notion that the abundance of molecular chaperones regulates CHIP association with membranes. The 260 amino acid-long C-terminal domain of HSP70 (HSP70-C) was used instead of the full-length protein to exclude N-terminal ATPase effects. Surprisingly, even the substoichiometric amount of 1 μM HSP70-C efficiently prevented CHIP from interacting with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Preincubation of CHIP with an equimolar amount of HSP70-C blocked the association of CHIP with liposomes to ca. 30% of the control. Likewise, incubation of CHIP with lipid arrays in the presence of HSP70-C resulted in complete loss of binding to phosphatidylinositol monophosphates and only residual interaction with phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the TPR domain was observed to mediate the binding of CHIP to liposomes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Molecular chaperones binding to TPR compete with lipids for this interaction efficiently.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A positively charged patch is required for CHIP binding to phospholipids</title><p>Because TPR domain-less CHIP still showed residual binding to phosphatidic acid-containing liposomes, we assumed additional lipid-interacting determinants. Basic amino acid motifs in polypeptides often play an important role in recognition of negatively charged phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stahelin et al., 2014</xref>). Inspection of the CHIP sequence revealed two patches of positively charged amino acids which we named m1 (143–146 aa: KKKR) and m2 (221–225 aa: KRKKR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Both motifs are outside of the TPR domain and are evolutionary conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). When m1 was mutated to alanines, the specificity of lipid binding and association with cellular membranes was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). However, partial exchange of m2 with alanines impaired CHIP-lipid interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and efficiently released chaperone-free EGFP-CHIP-K30A from membranes in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Contrary to wild-type CHIP, m2 mutant was strongly present not only in the cytosol, but in the nucleus as well. The positively charged patches m1 and m2 seem to be very similar and they are spatially in close proximity as judged from the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the neighboring amino acids contribute to the striking difference in the subcellular localization when m1 and m2 mutants are compared. An alternative explanation would be the different flexibility of the patches. When compared to m1, m2 is localized in a more dynamic part of the middle domain that fluctuates between unfolded coil and α-helical conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2010</xref>). At this stage, it is unclear whether coil or α-helical structure contributes to the interaction of CHIP with phospholipids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29388.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A positively charged patch is required for CHIP binding to phospholipids.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Surface representation of CHIP dimer (PDB entry 2c2l) with TPR domains colored green. m1, m2, positively charged patches colored red.

None of the structural analyses revealed differences between soluble and liposome-associated protein implying full functionality of CHIP on membranes. First, CHIP remained dimeric and was still capable of oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This is an important finding since monomerization of CHIP by the steroid detergent deoxycholate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>) was shown to reversibly inactivate its ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolay et al., 2004</xref>). The higher amount of oligomers from liposome samples does not necessarily mean that oligomerization is stronger on the liposomes. Because of the experimental constraints (due to dilution of non-bound protein in the supernatant), the input CHIP for the crosslinking reaction is less concentrated and thus cannot be compared quantitatively to the liposome-bound samples. The amount of secondary structure elements did not change upon binding to liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), although CHIP is known to be a rather labile protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2010</xref>).

NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) P187S mutant served as a substrate protein because it is known to be ubiquitylated by CHIP with and without assistance of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martínez-Limón et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsvetkov et al., 2011</xref>).

To avoid dimerization of the transfected K30A variant with the endogenous wild-type CHIP, CHIP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used in the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). CHIP was implicated in HSF1 activation during stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2003</xref>). However, early translocation of HSF1 into nucleus during heat shock was not affected by the absence of CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). For comparison, we sought conditions when CHIP-K30A loses its membrane localization. One of the cellular pathways that generates CHIP-interacting phosphatidic acid (PA) is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by members of the phospholipase D (PLD) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). The PLD isoform-unspecific inhibitor FIPI and the inhibitor of PLD1 (VU0155069), but not that of PLD2 (CAY10594), efficiently released chaperone-free CHIP into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This was not due to changes in the abundance of CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>) or general disturbance of membrane structure as controlled by the correct localization of farnesylated EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). From the other side, it was also possible to release chaperone-free CHIP from the plasma membrane using inhibitors of PI4P-generating type III phosphoinositol-4 kinases (PI4KIII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>).

As a control, EGFP-only transfected fibroblasts were used. 24 hr later, the cells were sorted to enrich the transfected cells from one third to an almost pure population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1g</xref>) and proteome changes were measured by means of label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>).

There were more proteins with a reduced rather than an increased abundance, 37 versus 19, respectively, which is an expected bias considering the involvement of CHIP in protein degradation. The accumulation of at least some of the proteins might be a consequence of the recently discovered noncanonical ubiquitylation by CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ronnebaum et al., 2013</xref>); however, indirect degradation loops leading to the abundance changes are conceivable as well.</p><p>Golgi-specific phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stahelin et al., 2014</xref>) showed specificity to CHIP in lipid array experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). GO analysis of CHIP interactors scored ‘Golgi organization’ GOBPslim term (biological processes) as the second-highest enrichment among significantly changed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This is especially interesting because the Golgi apparatus is known to fragment under heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrosyan and Cheng, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welch and Suhan, 1985</xref>). Coexpression of the β−1,4-galactosyltransferase1-EGFP marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 1996</xref>) verified fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus following CHIP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). In a complementary setup, CHIP-deficient fibroblasts failed to increase fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) further supporting the involvement of CHIP in the reorganization of membrane-bound organelles during proteostasis stress. In addition to the changes in the ‘Golgi organization’ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1i</xref>), several other components related to the Golgi apparatus were affected by CHIP overexpression as well. Some proteins showed lower abundance, for example, Golgi integral membrane protein 4 (Golim4) was reduced to 62% of its normal levels; others were upregulated, for example, the amount of Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor Gdi2 doubled. It will be interesting to uncover the exact mechanisms and functional consequences of Golgi fragmentation by chaperone-free CHIP (effector function). The central role of chaperone availability in this mechanism is supported by the observation that the overexpression of HSP70 inhibited fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus by CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1j</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Early on, CHIP was shown to participate in the quality control and degradation of membrane proteins. The best-known example among its substrates is the ΔF508 mutant of chloride channel CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meacham et al., 2001</xref>). Many molecular details regarding the recognition and ubiquitylation of membrane proteins by CHIP <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> have been elucidated since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Younger et al., 2006</xref>). The unifying aspect of the analyzed processes has been the recognition of substrates by CHIP-bound molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arndt et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to the endoplasmic reticulum-related quality control, CHIP has been shown to participate in the quality control of plasma membrane-resident proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</xref>). This activity also entails the participation of HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, here we describe the function of CHIP which relies on the chaperone-independent recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase to membrane-bound subcellular compartments. In fact, association with a chaperone would suppress this pathway of CHIP recruitment to membranes because its TPR domain is responsible for the mutually exclusive binding to either chaperones or membranes. It remains to be clarified how an additional determinant of the phospholipid specificity, the m2 patch, contributes to the TPR domain-driven association of CHIP with membranes. An electrostatic attraction of the positively charged cluster to the negatively charged membrane surfaces can be hypothesized, but remains to be tested. Indeed, a similar positively charged patch in vicinity of m2 does not influence CHIP interaction with lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At this stage, an allosteric effect upon the TPR domain cannot be excluded, especially because of the high flexibility of CHIP in general and of the m2 patch in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Membrane specificity of chaperone-free CHIP is key to understanding CHIP-assisted reorganization of the cellular architecture during severe conformational stress. We addressed this question by means of analytical <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches which revealed the preference of the ligase for phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol monophosphates. PA is interesting in the context of stress response for several reasons. First, in plants PA is known to be involved in response to many diverse stressors, such as high salt, drought, cold, aluminium exposure, to mention a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Second, the constitutive levels of PA in membranes are comparably high, yet they can change to functionally significant extents depending on metabolic or stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2001</xref>). Third, the involvement of PA-generating enzymes from the phospholipase D family in diverse pathologies has been established, advancing the development of therapeutics and thus creating possibilities to intervene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frohman, 2015</xref>). In this regard, Alzheimer’s disease is an interesting example, having been associated with different isoforms of phospholipase D. On the other hand, phosphatidylinositol monophosphates (PIPs) are less abundant, but highly relevant as tags of organelle identity. For example, PI3P is enriched on early endosomes and PI4P marks the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>). PI3P and PI5P are less abundant than PI4P (ca. ten and hundred times, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>), thus their affinity to CHIP might be an evolutionary byproduct with little functional consequences. At this stage, the relative importance of PA versus PI4P for <italic>in vivo</italic> relocalization of CHIP during stress remains unclear.</p><p>Discussing cellular localization approaches, we would like to emphasize the highly dynamic nature of CHIP interaction with membranes. It is strikingly evidenced by the undocking of CHIP from membranes during paraformaldehyde fixation of the samples, a standard processing before fluorescence microscopy. Another challenge is the highly suprastoichiometric amounts of chaperones with respect to CHIP levels in the cytosol which prevents freeing of CHIP even under stress conditions.</p><p>Summarizing, we propose a simple mechanism of how mammalian cells can sense the catastrophic extent of protein misfolding and aggregation in the cytosol and how membraneous compartments are acutely modified in response. Under normal conditions, HSP70- and HSP90-interacting proteins, such as CHIP, are associated with molecular chaperones and remain in the cytosol because their compartment-targeting determinants are shielded by that association. Acute conformational stress leads to accumulation of misfolded species with a high affinity for chaperones that, in turn, bind to the fresh aggregates following the law of mass action. Previous interactors of chaperones are now freed from shielding, thereby exposing their compartment-specific determinants allowing them to depart to new destinations. There, depending on functional specialization, relocalized proteins turn into effectors and modify newly encountered sets of proteins. Specifically in the case of CHIP, this would involve docking onto phosphatidic acid- and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-enriched cellular compartments and subsequent ubiquitylation of compartment-specific proteins. The small fraction of relocalized CHIP indicates that the PN in the given cell line is strong enough to handle the ensuing misfolding and aggregation, with most of CHIP remaining in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>Immediate reorganization and adaptation of organelles is a less understood aspect of cytosolic stress response compared to the transcriptional and post-transcriptional reactions, such as HSF1-driven activation of stress gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>) or eIF2α-mediated attenuation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider and Bertolotti, 2015</xref>). Importantly, the final outcome of the organelle reorganization probably depends on the capacity of a given cell to upregulate compensatory amounts of molecular chaperones. For the sake of the whole organism, metazoans might need to identify and sacrifice those cells which have failed to do so. An altruistic self-sacrifice involving membrane-bound organelles can be envisioned as an extension of the mechanism we propose. Although reversible under limited heat shock, Golgi fragmentation is a well-known marker or even the cause of cellular toxicity upon different stressors, including protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Miranda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haase and Rabouille, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Dissociation of CHIP from molecular chaperones under conformational stress resembles activation of HSF1 when the liberated protein trimerizes and translocates to the site of its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimoto, 1993</xref>). However, molecular determinants of the inhibitory interaction between chaperones and HSF1 are less clear compared to the TPR-based mechanism described here. Involvement of the TPR domain poses a question regarding the generality of the mechanism. In addition to CHIP, a number of other members from the PN, such as HOP, DnaJC7, FKBP51, FKBP52 among others, engage their TPR domains to interact with HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Assimon et al., 2015</xref>). The organelle adaptation described here, if used by other co-chaperones with distinct functionality, would diversify the response to acute stress. Finally, unmasking of the determinants of cellular localization must not be restricted to protein misfolding. For example, C-terminal phosphorylation of HSP70 and HSP90, such as that which takes place during a proliferative boost, was shown to critically affect TPR domain-based associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muller et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, comprehension of the scope and details of the subcellular reorganization of protein quality control machinery bears wide biological implications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents, plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Phospholipase D inhibitors FIPI, VU0155069 and CAY10594 were purchased from Caymen Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), wortmannin from Enzo (Farmingdale, NY), PI4KIIIβ inhibitor IN-10 from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ), HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), HSP90 inhibitor 17-(Allylamino)−17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) from Biomol (Germany). 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid, PA) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoinositol-4-phosphate (phosphadtidylinositol-4-phosphate, PI4P) was from Echelon Bioscience (Salt Lake City, UT).

Liposomes were reconstituted by shaking at 2000 rpm for 1 hr at 50°C, followed by sonication for 1 hr at 50°C in a water bath. The liposome suspension was subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen to promote unilamellar vesicle formation, aliquoted in 200 µl and pulse-sonicated for 8 s at 45% output with MS72 sonotrode (Bandelin) to create a population of homogenously sized liposomes as determined using NanoSight (Malvern Instruments). Sonicated liposomes were pooled, aliquoted again, snap-frozen and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Liposome floatation assay</title><p>1 mM liposomes and 0.5 µM CHIP were incubated in 150 µl reconstitution buffer for 30 min at 37°C. The suspension was adjusted to 30% sucrose by adding 100 µl of a 75% (w/v) sucrose solution in reconstitution buffer. The resulting high-sucrose solution was transferred to a 500 µl ultracentrifugation tube and overlaid with 200 µl of a 25% (w/v) sucrose solution and 50 µl reconstitution buffer. The sample was centrifuged at 240,000 g in a TLA120.1 fixed angle rotor for 1 hr at 25°C. The bottom (250 µl), middle (150 µl) and top (50 µl) fractions were collected from bottom to top using a 100 µl Hamilton syringe.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CHIP as a membrane-shuttling proteostasis sensor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Davis Ng is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vytas A Bankaitis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors propose the intriguing hypothesis that the Hsp70 associated E3 enzyme CHIP associates with specific membrane lipids to act as a &quot;proteostasis sensor&quot;. The data supporting this role consist of intracellular localization of CHIP-EGFP under varying conditions, cell fractionation experiments, filter binding assays of CHIP to specific lipids, liposome binding experiments, and CHIP pull-down experiments coupled with MS. In general, the data are convincing that Hsp70 unassociated CHIP can associate with lipids and this association is related to membrane fragmentation caused by stress. The reviewers are in agreement that the study is interesting, breaks new ground, and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers also agree that substantial gaps remain that can be ameliorated with some additional experimentation. Of particular concern is the functional relationship between CHIP relocalization and Golgi fragmentation. The reviewers also suggest another round of text editing (perhaps with assistance of colleague not directly involved in the work) to improve the readability and clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be useful to quantify plasma membrane association for images other than the heat shock. For example, quantification of plasma membrane association of CHIP for images as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Considering the subtlety of some of this phenotype (only ~20% of cells for the quantified heat shock), this is important to demonstrate the indicated effects.</p><p>2) It would be interesting to see how universal this response is to other types of cytosolic stress. For example, As(III) induces protein misfolding in the cytosol and activation of the HSR. It would be interesting to see if As(III) induces a similar response.</p><p>3) It's unclear how the CHIP membrane association phenotype integrates with other aspects of stress signaling. Does this membrane association integrate with HSF1 signaling, and if so, does CHIP membrane association require HSF1?</p><p>4) Additional experiments to follow up on proteomic results are required. Are the membrane proteins identified as CHIP interactors ubiquitinated by this E3 ligase or does CHIP influence their activity through other mechanisms. There is no need to follow-up on all of the 'hits' but some follow-up on at least one hit seems appropriate.</p><p>5) All of the membrane-association images presented show few cells and are of rather poor resolution. These need to be improved. To what membranes does CHIP relocalize to? Are these Golgi membranes as the proteomics data would suggest? Double-label imaging experiments should be done to address this point.</p><p>6) As follow-up to comment 5, the authors should present statistics that indicate how many cells were imaged and how many showed the phenotypes they claim as 'representative'. This is the standard way to describe data of this sort.</p><p>7) From this reviewer's perspective, a better case can be made that it is PI4P that is the key sensing ligand for CHIP relocalization to membranes. The crude fat-blot experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> at least do not make a compelling case that PA is a regulatory lipid as excess chaperone does not strongly affect the binding. Yet the follow-up experiments focus on PLD. Perhaps PA strongly potentiates CHIP-binding to PI4P – that is, low PA enhances CHIP-binding affinity for PI4P. That possibility is consistent with all of the data and it can be tested in an appropriately-designed liposome flotation assay. Also, does knockdown/inhibition of π 4-OH kinase prohibit CHIP relocalization to intracellular membranes?</p><p>8) As follow-up to comment 7, PLD1 and PLD2 single and double knockout mice are viable and, curiously, these seem better protected against prion disease. This is not the expected outcome if one embraces the conclusion of this study. While this reviewer is not asking the authors to solve everything, the point is that maybe PA itself is a secondary factor with PI4P being the main player. If the data still point to PA, then the authors should at least comment on the mouse data in the context of their findings.</p><p>9) What happens to Golgi fragmentation is the CHIP-less MEFs are reconstituted with the m1 and m2 deletion forms of CHIP?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29388.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors propose the intriguing hypothesis that the Hsp70 associated E3 enzyme CHIP associates with specific membrane lipids to act as a &quot;proteostasis sensor&quot;.

Excitingly, meantime we have acquired additional experimental evidence supporting the key finding of the study, namely, the functional relationship between chaperone availability and CHIP-induced reorganization of subcellular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Furthermore, prompted by the comments of the Editor and the reviewers, we have collected and are now including the following new data:</p><p>– Subcellular localization of CHIP during arsenite-induced stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>– Binding of CHIP to liposomes containing 5% PI4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>– Activation of HSF1 in the presence and absence of CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>– Association of CHIP with cellular membranes when generation of PI4P is inhibited by wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or PI4KIIIb inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement Ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also suggest another round of text editing (perhaps with assistance of colleague not directly involved in the work) to improve the readability and clarity of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>An English native-speaker biochemist who was not involved in the study reformulated several passages in the text to improve the readability and clarity of the manuscript as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be useful to quantify plasma membrane association for images other than the heat shock. For example, quantification of plasma membrane association of CHIP for images as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Considering the subtlety of some of this phenotype (only ~20% of cells for the quantified heat shock), this is important to demonstrate the indicated effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The respective quantification panels are now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be interesting to see how universal this response is to other types of cytosolic stress. For example, As(III) induces protein misfolding in the cytosol and activation of the HSR. It would be interesting to see if As(III) induces a similar response.</p></disp-quote><p>The arsenite did not induce CHIP relocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because arsenite causes protein damage via thiols, the oxidative damage protection might be the first line of cellular defense in this case. We are very thankful for this suggestion and included the result in the revised version because it implies specificity and argues against a trivial, i.e., general toxicity-driven, nature of CHIP binding to membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's unclear how the CHIP membrane association phenotype integrates with other aspects of stress signaling. Does this membrane association integrate with HSF1 signaling, and if so, does CHIP membrane association require HSF1?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, CHIP has been described as a component of the HSF1 activation machinery by Dai et al., (2003). Intuitively, the membrane relocalization (of a fraction) of CHIP during acute stress does not fit with the opposite direction of the HSF1 movement into nucleus. We analyzed the heat-induced HSF1 translocation into nuclei in wild-type and CHIP knock-out fibroblast and observed no differences in the time scale of the CHIP relocalization to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It will be interesting to uncover in the future how distinct pools of cellular CHIP commit to different cellular compartments during stress response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Additional experiments to follow up on proteomic results are required. Are the membrane proteins identified as CHIP interactors ubiquitinated by this E3 ligase or does CHIP influence their activity through other mechanisms. There is no need to follow-up on all of the 'hits' but some follow-up on at least one hit seems appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Ubiquitylation of new substrates on organelles would be the straight-forward explanation how chaperone-free CHIP can contribute to the reorganization of the cellular architecture during acute chaperone deficiency. Importantly, our analyses of the CHIP ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that it remains preserved on liposomes.</p><p>In our study we focused on the initial (trigger) phase of CHIP mobilization to cellular membranes. As mentioned above, our proteomics results suggests the capacity of CHIP to interact with different organelles. Besides the Golgi apparatus, we have not investigated changes of other organelles yet. We believe that the mechanistic analysis of the effector phase (i.e., the cell biological consequences of the degradation of individual membrane-associated proteins) should go in parallel with a systematic assessment of subcellular structures. We kindly ask you to agree that this kind of in-depth analysis goes beyond the scope of the present focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) All of the membrane-association images presented show few cells and are of rather poor resolution. These need to be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we exchanged the problematic images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Arrow indications are not needed there anymore.</p><p>CHIP associates with membranes in a highly dynamic way. For example, the association is lost upon fixation of cells with a paraformaldehyde solution, a standard procedure before imaging. For this reason, live cell imaging was performed throughout. In doing so, we used low laser power to avoid phototoxicity and possible disruption of CHIP-membrane interaction. Secondly, we used the rather low 512x512 scanning format to increase the speed of image acquisition. Since only a fraction of cells reacted, we needed to acquire as many as possible cells to come up with statistically significant numbers. Cytosol vs. membrane localization was clearly distinguishable, so we applied the above measures as an acceptable trade-off.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To what membranes does CHIP relocalize to? Are these Golgi membranes as the proteomics data would suggest? Double-label imaging experiments should be done to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a difficult question to answer with a direct experimental evidence because of the highly dynamic nature of the interaction between CHIP and membranes as discussed above. The pull-downs of chaperone-free CHIP indicated an involvement of many different organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Whether these interactions are primary or rather related to the interaction with the Golgi apparatus has to be clarified with kinetic approaches using techniques capturing transient associations <italic>in vivo</italic> as, for example, mass spectrometry upon APEX (proximity labeling with ascorbate peroxidase).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As follow-up to comment 5, the authors should present statistics that indicate how many cells were imaged and how many showed the phenotypes they claim as 'representative'. This is the standard way to describe data of this sort.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having scattered this information throughout the Materials and methods section in the previous version of the manuscript. We now listed all the numbers in one place at the end of the subsection Fluorescence microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) From this reviewer's perspective, a better case can be made that it is PI4P that is the key sensing ligand for CHIP relocalization to membranes. The crude fat-blot experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> at least do not make a compelling case that PA is a regulatory lipid as excess chaperone does not strongly affect the binding. Yet the follow-up experiments focus on PLD. Perhaps PA strongly potentiates CHIP-binding to PI4P – that is, low PA enhances CHIP-binding affinity for PI4P. That possibility is consistent with all of the data and it can be tested in an appropriately-designed liposome flotation assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her interpretation of the blocking experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and for suggesting the possibility of synergistic effects between PA and PI4P. PI4P is by far the most abundant phosphatidylinositol monophosphate species <italic>in vivo</italic>. We fully agree that it is the level of PI4P in membranes what could critically effect the final localization pattern of chaperone-free CHIP. We increased the PI4P concentration in liposomes from 1% to 5% and show now that PI4P can strongly enhance the association of CHIP with membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We were careful not to claim the relative importance of PA over PI4P in our manuscript. We inhibited PA-generating PLDs primarily as a means to release the membrane-bound CHIP into the cytosol for further analyses. At the same time, the fact that the manipulation of either PA or PI4P (next paragraph) levels undocks CHIP suggests that both are important for CHIP localization <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, does knockdown/inhibition of π 4-OH kinase prohibit CHIP relocalization to intracellular membranes?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we assessed the relocalization of CHIP upon inhibition of the phosphoinositol-4 kinase with wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and PI4KIIIb-IN-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Wortmannin is a specific inhibitor of PI3K, however, it inhibits type III PI4K if used at higher concentrations. Both inhibitors reduced association of chaperone-free CHIP with membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) As follow-up to comment 7, PLD1 and PLD2 single and double knockout mice are viable and, curiously, these seem better protected against prion disease. This is not the expected outcome if one embraces the conclusion of this study. While this reviewer is not asking the authors to solve everything, the point is that maybe PA itself is a secondary factor with PI4P being the main player. If the data still point to PA, then the authors should at least comment on the mouse data in the context of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases is complex and cellular stress response is only one of its components. For example, amyloid β-peptide can activate PLD2 and the lack of PLD2 reduces neuropathology in murine Alzheimer’s models. How cellular reorganization triggered by CHIP contributes to the amyloid toxicity in particular diseases remains to be determined. However, we fully agree with the reviewer regarding the possible importance of PI4P and have included a respective statement in the revised version of the manuscript in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What happens to Golgi fragmentation is the CHIP-less MEFs are reconstituted with the m1 and m2 deletion forms of CHIP?</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on the m2 mutant, because the m1 mutant behaves as wild-type CHIP. The steady-state level of transfected CHIP-m2 mutant drops to ca. 20-30% of the wild-type protein level. Thus, the comparison of the effects on the Golgi fragmentation is not straightforward. One would need to transfect different amounts of the proteins risking additional effects. When transfected at equal amount as the wild-type CHIP, m2 mutant did not induce fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (fraction of control 1.2 ± 0.1, N=3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
