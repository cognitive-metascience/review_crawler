xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Repass et al., 2016), that described how we intended to replicate an experiment from the paper ‘<italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma’ (Castellarin et al., 2012). Here we report the results. When measuring <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> DNA by qPCR in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), adjacent normal tissue, and separate matched control tissue, we did not detect a signal for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in most samples: 25% of CRCs, 15% of adjacent normal, and 0% of matched control tissue were positive based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) and confirmed by sequencing of the qPCR products. When only samples with detectable <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in CRC and adjacent normal tissue were compared, the difference was not statistically significant, while the original study reported a statistically significant increase in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissue (Figure 2; Castellarin et al., 2012). Finally, we report a meta-analysis of the result, which suggests <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression is increased in CRC, but is confounded by the inability to detect <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in most samples. The difference in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression between CRC and adjacent normal tissues was thus smaller than the original study, and not detected in most samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>Fusobacterium nucleatum</kwd><kwd>colorectal carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study did not reproduce those experiments in the original paper that it attempted to reproduce.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Repass et al., 2016</xref>), for a paper by Castellarin et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2012, Castellarin et al. reported that overall abundance of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (<italic>F. nucleatum</italic>) RNA was increased by approximately 79 fold in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) as compared to adjacent normal biopsies, as determined by RNA sequencing. Next, they measured <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA abundance in 99 CRC and adjacent normal tissue biopsies from a patient cohort and found that the presence of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA was 415 times greater in CRC tissue than adjacent normal tissue. These results, combined with earlier studies, provided evidence for a link between tissue-associated bacteria and tumorigenesis.</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellarin et al. (2012)</xref> described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 2), and summarized the current evidence for these findings. Since that publication there have been additional studies investigating <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> abundance in CRC. <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA abundance was reported to be enriched in 88 out of 101 CRC tissue samples compared to adjacent normal tissues in Chinese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The proportion of CRC tissue that were found to be <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA positive increased from rectal cancers to cecal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mima et al., 2016a</xref>), increased according to histological grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), and varied depending on diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mehta et al., 2017</xref>). An association of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA with clinical outcome in CRC patients has also been investigated, but with mixed outcomes. In one study, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> positive cases resulted in a worse outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mima et al., 2016b</xref>), while two separate studies found no association with cancer-specific mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mima et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many of these recent studies utilized the same TaqMan primer/probe set as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellarin et al. (2012)</xref> and reported 12–13% of CRC samples as positive for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mehta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mima et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mima et al., 2015</xref>), compared to 3.4% positive in adjacent normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mima et al., 2015</xref>). Another study, which utilized a custom-made TaqMan assay, reported 56% of CRC samples as positive, and that a subset of these positive CRC samples had lower <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression in the adjacent normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). Ito and colleagues also examined <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression in normal mucosa samples and reported 15% were positive, but with low expression of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, these studies utilized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue instead of fresh frozen tissue samples. While FFPE has the advantage of preserving morphology, it makes analysis of biomolecules, particularly nucleic acids, challenging due to formation of crosslinks as compared to fresh frozen tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Van Allen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to using quantitative PCR (qPCR), <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> has also been visualized within CRC tissue using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kostic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>). Another method of detecting bacterial infection is through a humoral immune response. <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> specific antibodies were detectable in samples from CRC patients and have been reported as a potential diagnostic biomarker for CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, using pyrosequencing, Gao and colleagues reported a higher abundance of bacteria from the genus <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> between CRC patients and separate healthy individuals (10.08% vs 0.01%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative PCR of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA abundance from colorectal carcinoma, adjacent normal tissue, and matched normal human colon tissue</title><p>We sought to independently replicate an experiment testing the hypothesis that <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> is overrepresented in CRC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue by qPCR. This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellarin et al. (2012)</xref>. While it is common practice to use adjacent normal tissue as a control to reduce the effect of genetic background, it is widely accepted that adjacent normal tissue, while observationally normal, may have genetic alterations that make it distinct from very distant somatic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braakhuis et al., 2004</xref>). To this end, gene expression profiling in adjacent normal tissue has even been used to predict recurrence in patients with rectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>) and to predict recurrence as well as overall survival time in breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Troester et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, as an additional control, this replication attempt included a group of normal colorectal tissues from age/ethnicity matched patients. Extracted genomic DNA was analyzed for abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, which was determined using the same primers as the original study targeting an <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> specific gene. The human <italic>PGT</italic> gene (updated gene symbol: solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2A1 (<italic>SLCO2A1</italic>)) served as the reference control, with the ratio of these two genes giving an estimate of the ratio of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA to human DNA in each sample. Two independent qPCR runs were performed.</p><p>The cycle threshold (Ct) values, a measure of the concentration of the target sequence in the PCR reaction, observed in this replication attempt ranged from 22.4 to 40 for adjacent normal tissue, 22.1 to 40 for CRC tissue, and 21.8 to 40 for matched normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This compares to the original study that reported Ct values that ranged from 25.5 to 40 for adjacent normal tissue and 21.4 to 40 for CRC tissue. However, these ranges include all Ct values observed (<italic>PGT</italic> and <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>). We observed that while the raw Ct values for <italic>PGT</italic> were well within the normal acceptable range (&lt;30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karlen et al., 2007</xref>), the raw Ct values for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> were very high across both independent qPCR runs for all samples. For <italic>PGT</italic>, the first independent run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) yielded a median raw Ct value of 22.7 (IQR = 22.6–22.9) in adjacent normal tissue, 22.8 (IQR = 22.6–22.8) in CRC tissue, and 22.8 (IQR = 22.7–23.0) in matched normal tissue. However, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> did not give a signal in most samples. In these samples, the Ct was set to 40, even though no amplicon was observed (also known as ‘non-detects’). While others have suggested methods to reduce the bias introduced when non-detects are set to Ct values of 40, such as setting the value to 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McCall et al., 2014</xref>), or using imputation methods and hierarchical models to deal with non-detects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McCall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boyer et al., 2013</xref>), the approach should be based on evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caraguel et al., 2011</xref>) and introduced prior to data collection, such as in a pre-registered analysis plan, to minimize confirmation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in the samples in which <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> was detectable, it was often at the edge of detectability, requiring more than 30 cycles of PCR to be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This makes the data difficult to interpret considering the noise associated with very high Ct values. A similar observation was made with data from the second independent run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). There was high concordance for the <italic>PGT</italic> Ct values between the two runs with a correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.84, 0.93, and 0.96 for adjacent normal, CRC, and matched normal tissue, respectively. Similar high concordance was observed for the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> Ct values with a ρ of 0.99, 0.96, and 0.81 for adjacent normal, CRC, and matched normal tissue, respectively.</p><p>Although not pre-specified, to assess if the signal for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> from the qPCR assay produced a specific product for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, we sequenced the amplicons generated. When we examined the 10 adjacent normal and 16 CRC tissue samples that gave a signal for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> from the qPCR assay, we observed that at higher Ct values (Ct &gt;35) a specific sequence was detected in some samples (3 CRC), while others only produced non-specific amplification (4 adjacent normal; 6 CRC). The non-specific amplification observed could be due to poor DNA quality or poor cleanup of the DNA samples during the sequencing process. In all of the samples with Ct values less than 35, specific sequences were observed (6 adjacent normal; 7 CRC). Interestingly, there were six paired samples, all with Ct values less than 35, where a specific sequence was observed in the adjacent normal as well as in the CRC tissue. These samples were further analyzed to determine if the relative abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA (normalized to <italic>PGT</italic>) between the tissues were different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Performing an exploratory analysis on the mean normalized expression of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA (normalized to <italic>PGT</italic>) from the two independent runs, we found that the median fold change in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA between CRC and adjacent normal tissue [n = 6] was 1.42 (IQR = 0.72–2.80) with the mean fold change equal to 2.78 [<italic>SD</italic> = 3.46]. This difference was not statistically significant (two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test: <italic>t</italic>(5) = 1.067, <italic>p </italic>= 0.335, <italic>r</italic> = 0.43, 95% CI [−0.59, 0.92]) when only samples in which <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> was detected in both CRC and adjacent normal tissue was considered. Considering only the data in which a specific product from the qPCR assay was able to be confirmed, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression was higher in the CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissue in 8 of the 40 examined samples, while expression was higher in the adjacent normal tissue compared to CRC tissue in two samples.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25801.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in colorectal carcinoma versus adjacent normal biopsies in samples with detectable <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>.</title><p>Only samples in which <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> was detected in both colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and adjacent normal tissue by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and confirmed by sequencing of the qPCR product are shown (n = 6).

Samples in this case were identified positive based upon whether a product was amplified in the qPCR reaction, irrespective of whether the amplicon was confirmed to be <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> by sequencing. While allowing us to compare qPCR signal intensity among samples, this approach also introduces error into the comparison because, as noted above, we know that some of the amplification products from the qPCR assay were non-specific. The relative abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA (normalized to <italic>PGT</italic>) between CRC and adjacent normal tissue was determined for each independent run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and averaged for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that the median fold change in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA between CRC and adjacent normal tissue [n = 40] was 1.13 (IQR = 0.91–2.84) with the mean fold change equal to 4.97 [<italic>SD</italic> = 14.2]. This compares to the original study, which reported an estimated median fold change of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA in CRC to adjacent normal tissue [n = 99] of 3.15 (IQR = 1.04–14.49) with the mean fold change equal to 378.9 [<italic>SD</italic> = 1980] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellarin et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of the mean normalized expression of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA (normalized to <italic>PGT</italic>) from the two independent runs was statistically significant (two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test: <italic>Z</italic> = 2.14, <italic>p </italic>= 0.032), which suggests that <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA is over represented in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissue. Collectively, 5% (2 out of 40 samples) of the matched normal tissue samples, 25% (10 out of 40 samples) of the adjacent normal tissue, and 40% (16 out of 40 samples) of the CRC tissue gave qPCR products for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> (i.e. amplification of a product after fewer than 40 cycles in both independent repeats, some of which were confirmed to have amplified <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> sequence and some that were non-specific, as noted above). There were three samples that gave qPCR products for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in the adjacent normal tissue and not in the CRC tissue, nine samples that gave qPCR products in the CRC tissue and not in the adjacent normal tissue, and seven samples that gave qPCR products in the adjacent normal as well as in the CRC tissue. Considering all of the data in which a product was amplified in the qPCR reaction, and irrespective of whether the qPCR products were confirmed to be specific or non-specific upon sequencing, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression was higher in the CRC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue in 13 of the 40 examined samples, while expression was higher in the adjacent normal tissue compared to CRC tissue in six samples. The difference in the observed fold change between this replication attempt and the original study could be due to a number of factors between the studies. Particularly with so many samples around the threshold of detection for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, very small changes in signal can lead to large changes in fold-change values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25801.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> by qPCR in colorectal carcinoma versus adjacent normal biopsies.</title><p>Fold change values are shown for all paired specimens based on differences in Ct values, irrespective of whether the qPCR products were confirmed to be specific or non-specific upon sequencing.

Each sample was approximately the same size, with the amount of Proteinase K and other additives used based on volume calculations and assumed tissue density of 1.04 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Following an initial qPCR run, genomic DNA was re-purified using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, cat# 69504) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the amount of starting material was increased in an attempt to optimize the detection of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# ND-1000). qPCR was performed on the ABI 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, cat# 4351405) using assays specific for each gene of interest as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Repass et al., 2016</xref>). For both assays, each reaction well contained 10 µL of TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems, cat# 4440039), 60 ng (first independent run) or 100 ng (second independent run) total DNA, at 30 ng/µL, and 1 µL of each assay (final forward/reverse primer concentration 900 nM and probe concentration 250 nM) in a reaction volume of 20 µL. Cycling conditions were as follows: 50°C for 2 min for UNG activation, 95°C for 10 min for polymerase activation, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Ct values were obtained using Sequence Detection System software from Applied Biosystems, version 2.4. The reaction for the <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> assay, using six serial logarithmic dilutions of purified genomic DNA from <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic>Nucleatum</italic> Strain VPI 4355 (ATCC, cat# 25586D-5), was found to have an efficiency of 99% with a sensitivity to detect at least 1 pg DNA.

For qPCR preprocessing all nondetects were set to 40. Technical duplicates were averaged for each sample. Fold difference in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> abundance in tumor versus normal tissue was determined using the ∆∆Ct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfaffl, 2001</xref>). For each run, ∆Ct (<italic>F. nucleatum</italic> expression normalized to <italic>PGT</italic> expression) was calculated for each tissue sample and then the fold difference (2<sup>-∆∆Ct</sup>) in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> abundance in tumor versus adjacent normal tissue was determined. There was high concordance of normalized expression between the two runs with a correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.99, 0.98, 0.97 for adjacent normal, CRC, and matched normal tissue, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The new data has really improved the paper. We're almost there but it's still written in a way that makes it hard to extract the key observations. Below are some suggestions that could be addressed with minor changes to the text that would really improve readability:</p><p>1) In the Abstract you wrote &quot;…5% of matched control tissue, 25% of adjacent normal, and 40% of CRC gave a positive signal&quot;. My understanding is that the new sequencing data show that many of these &quot;positive signals&quot; didn't actually have detectable <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> because the amplification products were non-specific. If that's true, it's misleading to write that 40% of CRCs gave a positive signal, knowing that many of these samples weren't actually positive for the bacterium. Instead, you should give the numbers of each type of sample that were confirmed to be positive based on sequencing of the amplicon, or at least that generated amplification products within a range of Ct values that were consistent with specific amplification based on the sequencing data.</p><p>2) In addition to indicating what fraction of samples of each type were truly positive for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, you should indicate in the Abstract whether there was a statistically significant difference in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> levels among samples in which there was confirmed positivity for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in the CRC AND/OR adjacent normal sample.</p><p>3) You do a good job of mentioning all of the other studies that compared <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> between CRC and control tissue. However, you usually don't state what fraction of samples from the other studies had detectable <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. That's the key piece of information that's required to compare your results with theirs. If that is known for some of the other studies (e.g. Gao et al., 2015 and Mima et al., 2016a) that information should be included when you first mention the studies.</p><p>4) In subsection “Quantitative PCR of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> DNA abundance from colorectal carcinoma, adjacent normal tissue, and matched normal human colon tissue”, paragraph five, &quot;this criteria&quot; should be &quot;this criterion&quot;.</p><p>5) In that same paragraph you should always state the denominator (the total number of samples analyzed) when you state the number that were positive.</p><p>6) Rather than going all the way through the paper, with much discussion of positive and negative samples, before presenting the key piece of information why not state up front the number of positive samples, taking into account both the PCR data and the sequencing data. As currently presented, much of the discussion, and the numbers in the Abstract and Results seem misleading when you finally acknowledge that many of the &quot;positive signals&quot; were actually non-specific – with no detectable <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>.</p><p>7) In the same section you wrote &quot;In samples with Ct values less than 35…&quot;. If it would be accurate to write &quot;In ALL of the samples with Ct values less than 35…&quot; this clarification would be helpful.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is unnecessarily unclear about what is presented. Rather than graphing &quot;2-ddCt&quot; why not just show fold change? You should also state explicitly on the Y-axis what is divided by what (CRC/adjacent normal?) rather than leaving it for readers to try to figure out.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25801.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors tried to replicate a selected experiment from the paper &quot;Fusobacterium nucleatum infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma&quot; (Castellarin et al., 2012).

This should be included in the manuscript in this reviewer's opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this in the Introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should present the concordance between the 2 qPCR runs conducted. In addition they should comment as to whether the two runs identified the same patients as Fn+ using a Ct cutoff value of 35.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have included this information in the revised manuscript. There was high concordance of the raw Ct values between both runs, as well as the gene expression. Additionally, the same patients were identified with a Ct cutoff of 35, with the exception of one patient that was over the cutoff for the first run (Ct = 37.1) and just under it for the second run (Ct = 34.9). Interestingly, all patients that were identified as <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> positive in their adjacent normal tissue were also identified positive in their CRC tissue. We have included this additional analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: additional revisions were requested prior to acceptance.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the Abstract you wrote &quot;…5% of matched control tissue, 25% of adjacent normal, and 40% of CRC gave a positive signal&quot;. My understanding is that the new sequencing data show that many of these &quot;positive signals&quot; didn't actually have detectable F. nucleatum because the amplification products were non-specific. If that's true, it's misleading to write that 40% of CRCs gave a positive signal, knowing that many of these samples weren't actually positive for the bacterium. Instead, you should give the numbers of each type of sample that were confirmed to be positive based on sequencing of the amplicon, or at least that generated amplification products within a range of Ct values that were consistent with specific amplification based on the sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and have revised the Abstract to reflect only the numbers and results of the confirmed positive samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition to indicating what fraction of samples of each type were truly positive for F. nucleatum, you should indicate in the Abstract whether there was a statistically significant difference in F. nucleatum levels among samples in which there was confirmed positivity for F. nucleatum in the CRC AND/OR adjacent normal sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and have revised the Abstract to reflect only the statistical analysis performed on the confirmed positive samples from CRC and adjacent normal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) You do a good job of mentioning all of the other studies that compared F. nucleatum between CRC and control tissue. However, you usually don't state what fraction of samples from the other studies had detectable F. nucleatum. That's the key piece of information that's required to compare your results with theirs. If that is known for some of the other studies (e.g. Gao et al., 2015 and Mima et al., 2016a) that information should be included when you first mention the studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We included most of this information in the Results/Discussion section; however we agree including this information when the studies are first mentioned in the Introduction is more fitting and have revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In subsection “Quantitative PCR of F. nucleatum DNA abundance from colorectal carcinoma, adjacent normal tissue, and matched normal human colon tissue”, paragraph five, &quot;this criteria&quot; should be &quot;this criterion&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this error. We have fixed it in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In that same paragraph you should always state the denominator (the total number of samples analyzed) when you state the number that were positive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have included the total number of samples analyzed for each of the numbers given in this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Rather than going all the way through the paper, with much discussion of positive and negative samples, before presenting the key piece of information why not state up front the number of positive samples, taking into account both the PCR data and the sequencing data. As currently presented, much of the discussion, and the numbers in the Abstract and Results seem misleading when you finally acknowledge that many of the &quot;positive signals&quot; were actually non-specific – with no detectable F. nucleatum.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and have revised the Results/Discussion to start with the observation of the Ct values, then discuss the sequencing and the number of positive samples taking into account both the PCR data and the sequencing data, and ending with the comparison to the original study (only using the PCR data), before going into the meta-analysis section. We have also reordered the figures to include the subset analysis (confirmed <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> positive) as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the complete analysis of all samples (just PCR data) as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the same section you wrote &quot;In samples with Ct values less than 35…&quot;. If it would be accurate to write &quot;In ALL of the samples with Ct values less than 35…&quot; this clarification would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the text as suggested in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is unnecessarily unclear about what is presented. Rather than graphing &quot;2-ddCt&quot; why not just show fold change? You should also state explicitly on the Y-axis what is divided by what (CRC/adjacent normal?) rather than leaving it for readers to try to figure out.</p></disp-quote><p>For each Replication Study, we have presented the results in the same way as the original study to provide a direct comparison. This is the way the original study had presented the results; however we agree it could be made clearer and have revised the y-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to better reflect what is being plotted. It is the fold change in <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> abundance (normalized to <italic>PGT</italic>) in CRC versus adjacent normal tissue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
