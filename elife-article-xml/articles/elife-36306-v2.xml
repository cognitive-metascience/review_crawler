Full-length BicD robustly activated dynein-dynactin motility only when both the mRNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) and <italic>K10</italic> mRNA cargo were present, and electron microscopy showed that both Egl and mRNA were needed to disrupt a looped, auto-inhibited BicD conformation. BicD can recruit two dimeric dyneins, resulting in faster speeds and longer runs than with one dynein. Moving complexes predominantly contained two Egl molecules and one <italic>K10</italic> mRNA. This mRNA-bound configuration makes Egl bivalent, likely enhancing its avidity for BicD and thus its ability to disrupt BicD auto-inhibition. Consistent with this idea, artificially dimerized Egl activates dynein-dynactin-BicD in the absence of mRNA. The ability of mRNA cargo to orchestrate the activation of the mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex is an elegant way to ensure that only cargo-bound motors are motile.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36306.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is a motor-like protein that uses energy to transport cargo where it is needed within cells. It moves along protein filaments called microtubules, which act like miniature tracks. Once dynein engages with microtubules, it then picks up cargo using adaptor proteins. In fruit flies, this cargo includes a messenger RNA molecule known as K10, which attaches to dynein via adaptors called Egalitarian and BicD (short for “Bicaudal D”). Egalitarian grabs hold of K10, and BicD links Egalitarian to the dynein motor.</p><p>In the absence of a cargo, full-length BicD does not bind to dynein. But, shortening BicD to remove its link to Egalitarian allows it to bind and activate the motor for transport. Much of our current understanding of dynein comes from studies that use shortened adaptor proteins like these. These proteins cannot bind cargo, so we know little about how the cargo and the adaptors control dynein activity.</p><p>To address this, Sladewski, Billington, Ali et al. purified the components of the K10 transport system and then recreated it in the laboratory. This revealed that it is BicD that decides when dynein is ready to go. First, imaging techniques showed that empty BicD forms a looped shape that hides the part of its structure that binds to dynein. This essentially switches it “off”, preventing empty dynein motors from moving. When the K10 cargo is ready for transport, it binds to two Egalitarian molecules, which work together to uncurl the BicD loop. This frees up the end of the BicD molecule, allowing it to link up with the dynein motor.</p><p>The key to uncurling the BicD protein was the presence of two Egalitarian molecules. And it was the cargo, K10, that brought them together, ensuring that the motors only moved when the cargo was ready. What is more, the uncurled BicD could bind not one but two dyneins. This allowed the cargo to move faster, and over longer distances than cargo with one dynein motor.</p><p>Recreating molecular machines and imaging their molecules provides a way to understand how they work. Studying how dynein moves cargo is key to understanding how molecules are transported within cells. This, in turn, could reveal what happens when the system goes wrong. Transport defects can cause diseases in humans, including neurodegenerative diseases. As such, a better understanding of how the transport system works may one day open new avenues for health research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA transport</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>BicD</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd><kwd>Egalitarian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM078097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trybus</surname><given-names>Kathleen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17GRNT33661158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>M Yusuf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>mRNA cargo orchestrates the activation of an in vitro reconstituted dynein-dynactin-Bicaudal D-Egalitarian complex for robust processive motion on microtubules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian cytoplasmic dynein-1 (hereafter dynein) is a 12 subunit, 1.4 MDa dimeric molecular motor complex of the AAA+ ATPase family that provides essential cellular functions including transport of vesicles, organelles, and mRNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>]). Dynein is the predominant minus-end directed microtubule-based motor that traffics cellular cargoes for many microns at speeds of ~1 µm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan, 2011</xref>). Molecular motors that transport cargo typically exhibit processive behavior when assayed in vitro, meaning that single motors remain bound to the polymer track for long distances without dissociating. It was therefore surprising when in vitro studies showed that single molecules of mammalian dynein were at best weakly processive, even in the presence of the multi-subunit 1.2 MDa dynactin complex that is needed for most cellular functions of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Schroer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 1995</xref>). It was not initially recognized that dynein, like other molecular motors, exists in an auto-inhibited state. One of the first structural studies to investigate dynein auto-inhibition showed that the AAA+ motor domains are closely stacked in a structure called the phi particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amos, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Torisawa et al., 2014</xref>). Several non-physiologic mechanisms of disrupting this interaction, such as coupling multiple dyneins to a DNA origami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amos, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Torisawa et al., 2014</xref>) or binding to a bead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King and Schroer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mallik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nicholas et al., 2015</xref>), converted dynein from a diffusive to a weakly processive motor by separating the stacked rings.</p><p>A major advance in understanding dynein function came from single molecule studies, which showed that an α-helical coiled-coil N-terminal fragment of the mammalian adaptor protein Bicaudal-D2 (BicD2N) couples dynein to dynactin. This causes dynein to become highly processive, with 5–10 µm run lengths, and leads to motor accumulation at the microtubule minus-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). This minimal tripartite complex is called DD(BicD2N) (dynein-dynactin-BicD2N). Dynein in the activated DD(BicD2N) complex produced 4.3 pN of force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>), considerably higher than the 0.5–1.5 pN forces reported earlier for dynein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mallik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ori-McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rai et al., 2013</xref>), thus allowing dynein to successfully engage in a tug-of-war with a single kinesin. Recent EM studies provided further insight into the structural basis for the inhibition and activation of dynein. Cryo-EM studies showed that when the dynein motor domains are stacked in the phi particle they are locked in a conformation with low affinity for microtubules; disruption of the motor domain self-dimer creates an ‘open’ state that is still inhibited for motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Only when bound to dynactin and an ‘adaptor’ such as BicD2N are the dynein motor domains aligned in a parallel orientation on the microtubule that correlates with highly processive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cargo adaptor proteins such as BicD2 are thus central to control of dynein activity in the cell. Although BicD2N artificially fused to mitochondria or peroxisome targeting sequences supports robust dynein-driven motility in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>), full-length BicD has only a mild effect on organelle re-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>). It has been assumed that full length BicD2 assumes an auto-inhibited conformation that does not bind to or activate dynein-dynactin. BicD2 is composed of three α-helical coiled-coil domains; the N-terminal domain (CC1) is involved with dynein-dynactin binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the C-terminal domain (CC3) binds adaptor proteins that link dynein to cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Early yeast-2-hybrid studies showed that the CC1 domain interacts with the CC3 domain, leading to a model in which BicD forms N- to C-terminal auto-inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>). Early metal-shadowed images of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD, in contrast, suggested interaction of CC3 with CC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuurman et al., 1999</xref>). The leading hypothesis for cellular activation of dynein-dynactin transport by BicD is that cargo-associated BicD2-binding proteins relieve auto-inhibition by freeing up CC1.</p><p>Here, we test this cargo-activation model by reconstituting in vitro a biologically well-characterized system, localization of <italic>K10</italic> mRNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. During development, <italic>K10</italic> mRNA is transported by dynein from nurse cells to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, where it localizes to the anterior margin to establish the dorso-ventral axis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung et al., 1992</xref>). <italic>K10</italic> contains a single 44 base-pair transport/localization element (TLS) in its 3’UTR that binds the mRNA-binding adaptor protein Egalitarian (Egl), which in turn binds to CC3 of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serano and Cohen, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular basis for dynein activation in this system, we reconstituted a motile mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex in vitro from purified dynein, dynactin, full-length BicD, Egl, and synthesized <italic>K10</italic> mRNA. Single-molecule approaches coupled with electron microscopy suggest that the key to dynein activation is disruption of an auto-inhibited loop structure of BicD. A single <italic>K10</italic> mRNA can bind two Egl molecules to create a bivalent Egl that efficiently disrupts the BicD loop structure, freeing CC1 and favoring recruitment of two dynein motors to the complex. The resulting mRNPs move at higher speeds and over longer distances than complexes with just one dynein. <italic>K10</italic> mRNA cargo thus orchestrates activation of the motile complex, an elegant mechanism ensuring that only motors properly complexed with cargo can undergo robust motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Full-length BicD forms an auto-inhibited looped conformation that does not bind dynein-dynactin</title><p>A single-molecule pulldown assay was used to determine if full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (hereafter called BicD) binds to dynein-dynactin purified from bovine brain.

Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was used to visualize and quantify associations with the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Binding of BicD or BicD<sup>CC1</sup> alone to microtubules was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), and thus BicD recruitment to microtubules is an accurate reporter of formation of a tripartite BicD-dynein-dynactin complex.

Our interpretation that the relatively straight portion of BicD is CC1 is consistent with contour length measurements. The distance from YFP to the very bottom of the loop is 38.7 ± 3.8 nm (± SD, n = 150), in good agreement with Paircoil2 analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McDonnell et al., 2006</xref>) that predicts the first 258 amino acids of BicD (CC1) to be an α-helical coiled-coil 37.7 nm long (based on 0.146 nm rise/residue). The contour length from YFP to the point where the CC2-CC3 loop contacts CC1 is 16.5 ± 2.3 nm (± SD, n = 133), and from here to the bottom of the loop is 19.1 ± 2.0 nm (± SD, n = 150).

A potential complication is the presence of the YFP domains at the N-terminus of CC1, which is itself flexible. To rule out that the additional density corresponds to the YFPs, we aligned and classified images of Egl bound to BicD lacking YFP. The appearance was strikingly similar to that of YFP-BicD-Egl but the two large YFP domains were no longer present. By contrast, the globular domain adjacent to the loop was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This verified the assignment of the YFP domains and further demonstrated that the BicD structure is not significantly affected by the YFP tag. Alignment and classification of this complex gave very similar results to those obtained for YFP-BicD-Egl, revealing once again the characteristic loop structure and adjacent globular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> shows a low-resolution 3D map of negative stain EM data, which allows size comparison of the loop with existing structures for parts of the YFP-BicD-Egl complex.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-36306-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36306.014</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Low-resolution 3D map of negative stain EM data (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</title><p>The video shows the size comparison of the apparent loop (EM volume depicted in gray mesh) with existing structures for parts of the YFP-BicD-Egl complex.

Processive motility on microtubules depended on the presence of all components.</p><p>In the absence of mRNA, neither full-length BicD nor BicD-Egl bind to dynein-dynactin due to BicD auto-inhibitory interactions. This is in contrast to an N-terminal fragment of mammalian BicD2 (BicD2N) that can recruit dynein-dynactin and convert it into a highly processive motor with enhanced force output, but cannot bind cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). The comparable truncation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD, BicD<sup>CC1</sup>, also activates dynein-dynactin processive runs in vitro, consistent with studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>). The speed and run length of both minimal dynein-dynactin-truncated BicD complexes were very similar to those seen with the fully reconstituted mRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Class averages of negatively stained full-length BicD revealed the structural basis for BicD auto-inhibition: BicD forms a looped conformation that resembles the letter ‘b’. The long straight portion of the letter ‘b’ corresponds to the first coiled-coil region, CC1 (~40 nm), and the remaining loop to CC2-CC3. An atomic resolution structure of dynactin in complex with BicD2N and the dynein tail showed that 275 amino acids (~40 nm) of BicD bind along dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). Although essentially all of the ~40 nm CC1 is exposed in full-length auto-inhibited BicD, binding of CC3 to the middle of CC1 must be sufficient to block formation of a stable high-affinity ternary complex with dynein-dynactin.</p><p>EM images of BicD-Egl retain the same auto-inhibited loop structure seen with BicD alone. Part of the Egl molecule folds into a globular domain which is attached via a flexible linker to the BicD binding site. A candidate for the globular domain is the putative 3’−5’ exonuclease domain identified within Egl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mach and Lehmann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>). Individual residues typically associated with exonuclease activity have been shown to be unnecessary for the function of Egl, whereas deletion of the entire domain strongly reduced RNA-binding activity. The globular domain may represent an RNA binding module that does not require exonuclease activity for normal function.</p><p>It is noteworthy that only one globular domain is seen in the EM images, suggesting that at the low protein concentrations used for microscopy and for single-molecule experiments, only one Egl is bound to BicD in the absence of mRNA. Binding studies showed that two Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> adaptors can bind to the CC3 domain of BicD, by associating with opposite faces of the BicD coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), but the binding affinity is relatively weak (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.9 µM).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Why is mRNA needed to relieve BicD auto-inhibition?</title><p>EM showed that the auto-inhibited loop of BicD was disrupted only in the presence of Egl and mRNA, but not with mRNA alone. This observation is consistent with the requirement of mRNA for high-frequency robust processive motion in single molecule experiments. Experiments using two different colors of the same component, to allow copy number in motile mRNPs to be assessed, lent insight into why mRNA was required. First, 87% of moving mRNPs contained two Egl molecules. Second, two-color mRNA experiments showed that 89% of moving mRNPs contained only one mRNA. Consistent with our in vitro studies, transported mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts were shown to primarily contain a single mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014</xref>). The observation that two Egls are incorporated into motile mRNPs at the nanomolar concentrations used in single-molecule assays suggested that interactions between components of the assembled complex may enhance affinity, with a likely candidate being the mRNA. If one mRNA tethers two Egl molecules together as our data suggest, Egl essentially becomes bivalent in its interaction with the two-chained coiled-coil BicD, conferring the enhanced avidity associated with bivalent binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siglin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, two Egl molecules may be required to overcome the auto-inhibition of BicD, and this is enabled by their simultaneous binding to one mRNA. A proof-of-principle experiment that strongly supports this mechanism was the effect of a truncated Egl construct with a leucine zipper, which activates dynein-dynactin-BicD motility in the absence of mRNA to a similar extent as seen for the fully reconstituted mRNP. Tantalizingly, the run lengths and speeds trended to higher values with the zippered Egl than observed with the fully reconstituted mRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), suggesting that this artificial construct may stabilize the motile complex to a greater extent because one Egl can no longer dissociate, which would favor complex disassembly. In vivo, a dynamic complex that needs to disassemble once cargo is transported to its destination may be advantageous and necessary. In a concurrent elegant study, using different <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNA transcripts and complementary techniques, Bullock and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>) (<italic>see accompanying paper</italic>) also proposed that a single mRNA scaffolds the association of two Egls with BicD CC3 to facilitate activation of dynein. The requirement for mRNA is biologically important because it ensures that motor activation is coupled to cargo binding, preventing futile dynein activity.</p><p>We previously showed that in an actomyosin-based mRNA transport system in budding yeast, mRNA was also required for processive motion, but for a different reason: mRNA stabilized the interaction of two single-headed class V myosins (Myo4/She3) with the mRNA-binding adaptor protein She2 at physiological ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sladewski et al., 2013</xref>). Although mechanistically the role of mRNA differs from what we show here with dynein-dynactin and BicD, in both cases the requirement for mRNA ensures that only cargo-bound motor complexes are motile.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism by which BicD auto-inhibition is relieved</title><p>Steric/competitive or allosteric mechanisms for disruption of the CC3-CC1 interaction by two Egl molecules can be considered. A competitive mechanism suggests that two Egls compete effectively with CC1 for a common binding site on CC3. A competitive mechanism appears to be the case with Rab6<sup>GTP</sup>, an adaptor protein that links dynein-dynactin-BicD to vesicular cargo. The Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> and CC1 binding sites on CC3 overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>), implying that both cannot bind simultaneously. Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> (but not Rab6<sup>GDP</sup>) in solution or bound to artificial liposomes released BicD2 from an auto-inhibited state to promote processive dynein-dynactin motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>). The bound GTP in essence signals to BicD that the Rab is bound to cargo (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>]).</p><p>Alternatively, an allosteric mechanism would postulate that binding of Egl-mRNA causes a propagated change in the BicD coiled-coil that weakens the CC3-CC1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). This possibility is due to an unusual feature of part of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD CC3 structure, in which the same residues in the two chains of the coiled-coil adopt different heptad registries, referred to as ‘heterotypic’ interactions. It was proposed that this region may act as a molecular switch to promote weakening of the CC3-CC1 interaction following cargo binding to the adjacent ‘homotypic’ segment of coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of the mRNA zip code</title><p>The highest frequency of moving complexes, and the highest number of complex associations detected in single-molecule pulldowns, were obtained with <italic>K10</italic> mRNA containing the TLS zip code. These values decreased ~two-fold when the zip code was removed, or with either of two heterologous mRNA transcripts, but remained higher than in the absence of mRNA, implying that motor complexes may also bind to sequences other than the TLS. Studies using extracts from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos also concluded that the role of localization signals/zip codes is to increase the average copy number of dynein-dynactin recruited to an mRNP, but even non-localizing mRNAs associate with dynein and move bidirectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>). The function of zip codes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appears to differ from that seen in budding yeast, where zip codes in the model mRNA <italic>ASH1</italic> are essential for recruitment of myosin motors to the mRNA-binding adaptor protein She2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sladewski et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>mRNPs recruit two dyneins</title><p>When we began this study, we had assumed that a single dynein was recruited to the complex containing dynein and BicD, and thus used a 1:1 stoichiometry of dynein:dynactin for reconstitutions. Surprisingly, when we reconstituted mRNPs with two different color Egls, we observed that dual-colored complexes had a distinct peak with faster speeds and longer run lengths than single-colored mRNPs containing a mixture of one or two Egls. Separate experiments with dual-colored dyneins directly showed that the enhanced speed and run length can be attributed to the recruitment of two dyneins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result is consistent with recent studies showing that dynactin can recruit two dyneins to a dynein-dynactin-adaptor protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>), and that complexes with two dyneins show faster movement and enhanced force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, our observation implies a link between a fully activated mRNP and enhanced dynein recruitment. Experiments with a zippered Egl construct, which was also reconstituted with one dynein per dynactin, also showed a distinct faster peak indicative of recruitment of two dyneins, solidifying the link between full occupancy of BicD with two Egls and binding of two dyneins. The putative interaction between Egl and LC8 of dynein does not, however, appear to contribute to dynein recruitment because mRNPs reconstituted with dynein lacking LC8 exhibited the same speed and run length as those containing wild-type dynein.</p><p>The cryo-EM studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjahn et al. (2018</xref>) visualized two dimeric dyneins bound to essentially all (&gt;97%) of dynein-dynactin-BicD2N or dynein-dynactin-Hook3 complexes bound to a microtubule in the presence of AMP-PNP. Interestingly, Carter and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>) also showed that BicDR1 and Hook3 recruited two dimeric dynein motors, but found that only 18% of the BicD2N complexes bound two dyneins, which they related to the position of the N-terminus of the BicD2N fragment in the complex. Our results showed the same number of two-dynein complexes with BicD versus Hook. Factors that influence recruitment of the second dynein to <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD and human BicD2 remain to be determined. Our studies with full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD suggest that one factor influencing recruitment of two dimeric dynein motors in an mRNP is the presence of two bound Egls, thus establishing a link between cargo binding and full dynein occupancy on dynactin. This in vitro reconstitution of an mRNP, from motor to bona fide biological cargo, provides an excellent model system to further test interactions between components of the complex, which likely are stabilized by multiple weak interactions that synergize to produce a robust transport complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 488–5-UTP</td><td valign="top">Molecular Probes</td><td valign="top">C11403</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Andy Fluor 488-X-UTP</td><td valign="top">GeneCopoeia</td><td valign="top">C410A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Andy Fluor 647-X-UTP</td><td valign="top">GeneCopoeia</td><td valign="top">C418A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Rnase Inhibitor</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">N261B</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Q-dot 525 streptavidin <break/>conjugate</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Q10141MP</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Q-dot 565 streptavidin <break/>conjugate</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Q10131MP</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Q-dot 655 streptavidin <break/>conjugate</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Q10121MP</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SNAP-Surface Alexa <break/>Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">S9129S</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SNAP-Surface Alexa <break/>Fluor 647</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">S9136S</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SNAP-Biotin</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">S9110S</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Ribonucleic acid, transfer <break/>from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">R1753</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Tubulin protein (X-rhodamine): <break/>bovine brain</td><td valign="top">Cytoskeleton, Inc</td><td valign="top">TL620M-A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">paclitaxel</td><td valign="top">Cytoskeleton, Inc</td><td valign="top">TXD01</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial kit</td><td valign="top">RiboMAX Large Scale RNA <break/>Production Systems</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">P1280</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA</td><td valign="top">pDyn1 (SNAPf-His-ZZ-LTLT- <break/>DYNC1H1 in pACEBac1) <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlager et al.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Recruitment of two dyneins to an mRNA-dependent Bicaudal D transport complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sladewski and colleagues present the first reconstitution of dynein-mediated RNA transport using purified components. Using single-molecule assays they show that robust transport requires the presence of full-length BicD, mRNA and the mRNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl). They also show that the presence of two Egl leads to faster and more processive movement and that faster, more processive events are associated with the recruitment of a second dynein molecule to the complex. The authors also used negative stain electron microscopy to characterize the architecture of the autoinhibited conformation of BicD, and to show that both Egl and the mRNA are required to open up BicD to its active form.</p><p>The reviewers were positive about the work but also identified weaknesses that require your attention, and that leave the overall impression that the results are interesting but still somewhat preliminary. In particular, reviewer #1 notes that there is no mechanistic insight into the role of mRNA in RNP assembly. In addition, there are concerns with technical aspects of the work, in particular the validity of comparing a human BICD2 fragment (CC1) with full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (Figure 1 and Figure 5) and the lack of some important controls). Reviewer #3 pointed out that the very minimal data processing done with the EM data and the fact that the stoichiometry of the RNA in the transport complex was not addressed directly experimentally are major weaknesses of the current version of the manuscript. The current EM analysis is well below what would be considered acceptable in the field.</p><p>These comments were discussed among reviewers and there was an agreement that the points below should be dealt with as clearly and thoroughly as possible in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, protein gels of the dynein, dynactin, and BICD2 CC1 preparations need to be shown. It is not clear why the Egl preparation is shown in this figure, as Egl is not introduced until Figure 3.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors should clearly state that dynein and dynactin come from bovine brain, the CC1 fragment of BICD2 is human, and the full-length BicD protein is from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. If it is not possible to repeat experiments with <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD CC1 within the required time frame, the caveat of species differences should at least be clearly acknowledged. Point 3 below addresses the same concern.</p><p>3) In Figure 1, in the pull-down assay (Figure 1C, D), the authors observe that BICD2 CC1 &quot;showed 13-fold enhanced recruitment to dynein-dynactin bound to microtubules compared with full-length BicD&quot;. Is that due to autoinhibition of BicD, as is implied in the text, or simply because BICD2 CC1 is from another vertebrate species, whereas BicD is from insects?

Another possibility is that any mRNA can un-specifically interact with Egl in this assay.

A few of the issues are: (1) Dynactin is shown as a rounded rectangle that represents neither its structure nor its size relative to dynein. This is particularly surprising when one of the authors of the paper is the person who discovered dynactin and was involved in two nice papers on the structure of DDB complexes. (2) Dynein is shown with 2-fold symmetry, which we now know is precisely what dynactin breaks to impose translational symmetry and activate the motor.

Using single-molecule assays they show that robust transport requires the presence of full-length BicD, mRNA and the mRNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl). They also show that the presence of two Egl leads to faster and more processive movement and that faster, more processive events are associated with the recruitment of a second dynein molecule to the complex. The authors also used negative stain electron microscopy to characterize the architecture of the autoinhibited conformation of BicD, and to show that both Egl and the mRNA are required to open up BicD to its active form.</p><p>The reviewers were positive about the work but also identified weaknesses that require your attention, and that leave the overall impression that the results are interesting but still somewhat preliminary. In particular, reviewer #1 notes that there is no mechanistic insight into the role of mRNA in RNP assembly. In addition, there are concerns with technical aspects of the work, in particular the validity of comparing a human BICD2 fragment (CC1) with full-length Drosophila BicD (Figure 1 and Figure 5) and the lack of some important controls). Reviewer #3 pointed out that the very minimal data processing done with the EM data and the fact that the stoichiometry of the RNA in the transport complex was not addressed directly experimentally are major weaknesses of the current version of the manuscript. The current EM analysis is well below what would be considered acceptable in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a substantially revised manuscript that we believe addresses the major weaknesses as described above. New experiments were done to show that one RNA binds per mRNP, and that a zippered Egl will activate the complex in the absence of mRNA. Taken together, these new data provide the mechanistic insight that two Egls are required to overcome the auto-inhibition of full-length BicD, which is orchestrated by the mRNA cargo vis à vis its role in coupling two Egl molecules together. As requested, we also expressed a truncated <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (BicD<sup>CC1</sup>) and characterized it in single molecule pulldowns (Figure 1) and in moving complexes (speed, run length) (Figure 5). Not surprisingly, it showed the same properties as mammalian BicD2N, confirming that the different properties of truncated and full-length BicD are not due to species differences. Concerns about the EM have been addressed by revision of Figure 2 and Figure 3, and inclusion of 5 additional supplemental figures to specifically address the reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These comments were discussed among reviewers and there was an agreement that the points below should be dealt with as clearly and thoroughly as possible in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p>For ease of reading, we grouped and responded to all of the comments related to the electron microscopy analysis first (points 6, 9 and 14-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2, what is the difference between &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; shapes? The EM images in rows 1 and 2 of Figure 2A look the same.</p></disp-quote><p>The only difference between the “d” and “b” shapes is likely to be the particle orientation on the EM grid, as suggested by the reviewers. This issue is raised multiple times throughout the reviewer comments and it is clear that we did a poor job of explaining this clearly in the manuscript.</p><p>The particle has a preferred orientation on the grid which leads to the dominant appearance resembling that of a letter “b”. A less common appearance, which is almost certainly due to the same conformation being in the opposite orientation on the grid, results in the appearance being that of a letter “d”. In addition, there are occasional but rarer side views.</p><p>The purpose of showing these two orientations in Figure 2 was firstly to introduce the most common, “b type”, orientation. Since this orientation dominates, it is used in subsequent analysis to simplify the process of locating variable portions of the images. By analyzing only the molecules in which the loop is in a relatively fixed position, variability in the position of other parts of the molecule, relative to the loop, can be assessed. Secondly, as pointed out by the reviewers, the b and d type image look simply like mirror images of each other. If the precise orientation was strongly affected by, for example, a large domain on one face of the loop, then the molecule would be less likely to lie flat when that face was presented to the carbon. This suggests that in these orientations, the molecule is quite flat in the plane of the carbon. We believe that this is best appreciated by showing examples of both orientations.</p><p>Since the confusion stems from our poor wording, we have amended the text. We now make clear that we interpret these appearances to be different orientations of the same conformation. All uses of the word configuration have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 3, a conformational change in the YFP:BicD-Egl complex is observed when mRNA is added. An important missing control is to add mRNA to BicD alone to show that Egl is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The data for the mRNA + BicD control have now been added. We did not observe a disruption of the loop in the presence of mRNA alone, suggesting that only the combination of mRNA and Egl is sufficient to destabilize the autoinhibited conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 2A. Did the authors try to mirror the particles in (2) and see if that leads to particles/averages like those in (1)? It seems as though the particles in (2) fell in the flipped orientation relative to those in (1). The concern is that calling them &quot;a less common &quot;d&quot; configuration&quot; implies structural (conformational) differences that may not exist.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed regarding point 6 above, we do not interpret them to be a different conformation, we interpret them to be a different orientation, as suggested by the reviewer. The wording has been changed to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Did the authors attempt any classification of their data? It was surprising that only single particles and global averages are shown.

Since it is clear that the classifications can be useful for readers in interpreting the data, we have now included classifications in the supplementary data. Example class averages are also included in the main figures. The results of the classifications strongly depends on the masks used, due to variable positions of multiple components. We have included classification using masks focused on different regions for this reason.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) What are the variances in Figure 2C supposed to be telling us? If anything, the fact that the regions of high variance mirror the global average shown on the left tells us that the data is a mixture that has been aligned to the predominant view and that classification is therefore required.</p></disp-quote><p>The intention of the variances in Figure 2C was to illustrate the variable position of the region of CC1 which extends beyond the loop. As pointed out by the reviewer this is made less obvious by the regions of high variance around the loop itself. The classifications requested by the reviewers are now included as supplementary material. The global variance image has been moved to the supplementary material as has the variance image following the second round of alignment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Where is the rest of Egl in Figure 3A? Some classification (maybe targeted to different regions of BicD) should reveal additional densities when compared with the BicD alone data. The authors should perform difference mapping between class averages of BicD and BicD-Egl; just one difference map would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>The classifications are now included. Using a mask around the region adjacent to the loop reveals the globular domain attributed to the attached Egl. A concern with this analysis was the presence of the YFP-CC1 region which in a minority of cases can occupy the region adjacent to the loop. In order to mitigate these concerns, we also aligned and classified images of BicD-Egl lacking the YFPs. The results were very similar, with the globular domain still present next to the loop.</p><p>Although we had done difference mapping of class averages, the results were quite noisy and we had thus elected not to include them. Examples of these are now included as part of Figure 3G, with the full classification in the supplement. The additional density is seen as a region centrally and towards the bottom of the loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Did the authors attempt to label the mRNA in Figure 3D (with gold, for example)? How do we know the mRNA is present in these particles? Depending on the data, this is something that might also be addressable with classification.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not able to successfully label the mRNA in such a way as to allow the various components of the activated complex to be identified. We believe that the marked difference between YFP-BicD-Egl and YFP-BicD-Egl-mRNA is sufficient to demonstrate the presence and effect of the mRNA. This can be seen by comparing fields of view of the different datasets, individual raw images of particles and also the classifications of the data. We have now included all of these to make this difference clearer to readers. Alignment of the complex in the presence of RNA is largely unsuccessful due to the variable appearance of the complex. In contrast, the presence of mRNA alone (i.e. without Egl), is insufficient to cause a disruption of the loop. The disruption of the loop is also observed when we compare BicD-Egl with BicD-Egl-mRNA (version lacking YFP) and the data showing this are now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) In Figure 3C, it might be more informative to subclassify b-type data using masks around the b-loop.
