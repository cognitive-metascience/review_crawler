These small protuberances (5–10 μm in length) are found in nearly every cell type. Primary cilia house key downstream elements of the sonic hedgehog pathway, which regulates embryonic development and some cancers. Recently, new tools have enabled measurements of other signaling elements within cilia. Primary cilia have elevated resting internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]=300–700 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delling et al., 2013</xref>]), and possess at least two TRP channels, polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1. These ion channels are encoded by the PKD2 and PKD2L1 genes of the TRPP subfamily. Electrophysiological measurements demonstrate that polycystin 2-l1 and polycystin-2 both underlie ionic currents in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleene and Kleene, 2017</xref>). This suggests that voltage gradients and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in addition to cAMP, are relevant signals within primary cilia.</p><p>PKD2 and PKD2L1 share high degrees of sequence identity (52%) and similarity (71%). Mutations in PKD2 account for ~15% of cases of individuals afflicted with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). In contrast, there are no diseases currently linked to PKD2L1. Deletion of PKD2 is lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 1998</xref>), but deletion of PKD2L1 results in occasional gut malrotation, a relatively mild <italic>situs inversus</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, while the functional characterization of polycystin 2-l1 protein has been enabled by its plasma membrane expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2016</xref>), polycystin-2 protein function has been hampered by its restriction to surface expression in primary cilia. Recent approaches have been successful, however, in establishing the key biophysical properties of polycystin-2. These approaches include a gain-of-function mutation that enables expression to the plasma membrane in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arif Pavel et al., 2016</xref>) and direct patch clamp recording of polycystin-2 in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleene and Kleene, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). These studies establish polycystin-2 as a monovalent-selective cation channel with little or no calcium permeation. In contrast, polycystin 2-l1 shows significant and relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> ~6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2016</xref>). Despite this knowledge, the physiological stimulus for activation and gating is unclear for both channels.</p><p>In a similar fashion, structural information about membrane proteins has undergone a profound advance. This is largely due to the explosion of structures from single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) in recent years. Accordingly, multiple structures have been solved for the TRP ion channel family, including the TRPP family to which polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1 belong.</p><p>Here we present a structure of the full-length human polycystin 2-l1 protein at 3.3 Å resolution in cryo-EM. The overall architecture conforms to that of other TRP channels, and in particular to the TRPP polycystin-2 structures. We establish the core structure and point out differences in regions and residues that may account for polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1’s distinct permeation and gating.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first expressed and purified full-length recombinant polycystin 2-l1 protein tagged with maltose binding protein (MBP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) using HEK293 GnT I<sup>-</sup> cells and the BacMam system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether the MBP-tagged protein was functional, we measured single channel activity in reconstituted liposomes under voltage clamp. The channel’s conductance in the same buffer used for purification (HKN, see Materials and methods) was 105 pS, consistent with previous single-channel studies from cells expressing polycystin 2-l1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>General architecture of polycystin 2-l1</title><p>Polycystin 2-l1’s structure exhibits many of the hallmarks of TRP channels: it forms a homotetramer with a domain-swapped Voltage Sensing-Like Domain (VSLD, the S1-S4 transmembrane domains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and shares remarkable architectural similarity to polycystin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (RMSD of 1.5 Å measured with polycystin-2 model pdb 5T4D). As characteristic of group 2 TRP channels (TRPPs and TRPMLs), polycystin 2-l1 has a long S1-S2 extracellular loop, termed the polycystin mucolipin domain (PMD). This domain, a series of 3 α-helices, 4 β-sheets, and a glycosylated three loop region (see below, TLC or three-leaf clover), forms a cover, or lid, above the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast to the 3 or 4 observed glycans in polycystin-2's polycystin mucolipin domain (PMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grieben et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkes et al., 2017</xref>), polycystin 2-l1’s PMD has one clear glycan density located at residue N207. An additional density, at N241, could possibly support an additional glycan. Notably, the PMD interacts with underlying elements of the pore, the voltage sensing-like domains, and adjacent PMDs. The role of glycosylation of the PMD in TRPPs is unknown. Two possibilities include serving as a folding/quality control mechanism or as a site for intermolecular interactions (e.g., ligand involved in gating).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36931.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Architecture of polycystin 2-l1 tetrameric ion channel.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Side view parallel to the membrane and from the top (extracellular) surface.

Also, despite expression of full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) the C terminus of polycystin 2-l1 was not resolved. We conclude that these elements are either unstructured or connected with flexible regions, which, along with the lack of cytoplasmic elements in 2D classification in polycystin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2016</xref>), prevents model building of these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The voltage sensing-like domain</title><p>The VSLD is comprised of four transmembrane helical spanning elements that, while similar in structure to the voltage-sensing domains of voltage-gated ion channels, do not convert the energy of the transmembrane electric field into pore gating. Indeed, none of the group II TRP channels have significant voltage dependence. Comparison of the VSLD of polycystin 2-l1 and polycystin-2 reveals that the polycystin 2-l1 S2 helix is tilted an additional 4.5° away from the core, is laterally shifted away from the rest of the VSLD, and shows the greatest local RMSD difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a, b and c</xref>). Polycystin 2-l1’s S3 is a near-continuous helix extending from the membrane-spanning region into a pocket created by the PMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and 3b). This S3 helix exhibits greater secondary structure than the presumed closed polycystin-2 structure of Shen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2016</xref>), but is similar to that of the multiple- and single-ion models of Wilkes et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkes et al., 2017</xref>). The S3 extended helix abuts the PMD of the same monomer but does not display the same cation-π interactions as polycystin-2’s F545 and R320 residues. The S3-S4 linker and the top portion of the S4 helix also fit into the same cleft of the PMD as in polycystin-2. In polycystin-2, the S4 adopts a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix configuration (I571 – F579). The density of the S4 helix of polycystin 2-l1 is incomplete at this region so a 3<sub>10</sub> configuration is not observed. Similarly, the equivalent residues of polycystin-2 that are thought to form a salt bridge between the S3 and S4 helix (K572, K575) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2016</xref>), do not have sufficient side chain density to model accurately.

As noted, TLC1 in polycystin-2 appears to extend into the adjacent PMD and interact with the S3 helix and S3-S4 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grieben et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wilkes et al., 2017</xref>). In polycystin 2-l1, the analogous TLC1 extends from one monomer into the PMD of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, the nature of the interaction differs in that F216 of TLC1 is near Y308 of the adjacent subunit’s PMD, representing a possible π - π stacking interaction or a hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Additionally, N311’s carboxamide oxygen group, located on a hairpin between β3 and β4 of the PMD, is within hydrogen bonding distance (3.3 Å) of Y224’s amide in TLC1 of the adjacent subunit of polycystin 2-l1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Finally, residue W259 of TLC3 formats a cation-π stacking interaction with the upper pore domain at residue R534 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We interpret these interactions as supporting tetrameric assembly and stability.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36931.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Polycystin mucolipid domain interactions of polycystin 2-l1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) π- π interaction of residue residing in TLC1 F216 (brown) with the neighboring (green) PMD (Y308).

This element appears to reach under the PMD’s β-sheet. Proximity of the returning loop of TLC1 towards TLC2, as well as the S5-PH1 loop of the monomer and the PH2-S6 loop adjacent monomer creates four lateral openings at the base of the PMD in polycystin 2-l1, as in polycystin-2.

Higher resolution cryo-EM structures that identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or monovalents that are occupying the pore with high certainty (or equivalent crystallographic studies like those of CaVAb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2014</xref>]), and molecular dynamic simulations, should shed light on these issues.</p><p>As a final attempt to understand the differences in the relative selectivity of TRP channels, we compared the charge landscape of the pore helix-selectivity filter-pore helix assembly of polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1. When the PMD is stripped away and only the pore-helices and selectivity filter elements of both channels are visualized, a striking difference appears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Polycystin 2-l1 has a more restricted negative charge density immediately surrounding the pore than does polycystin-2. Interestingly, its pore-helices form a ‘Maltese cross’ of net positive charge, rotated 45° to the negative charge distribution ‘cross’ in polycystin-2. We compare these charge distributions to the much more Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective TRPV5 and TRPV6 (P<sub>Ca</sub><sup>2+</sup>/P<sub>Na</sub><sup>+</sup>&gt; 100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) in which the TRPV5/6 channels’ negative charge is much more localized around their respective pores.</p><p>An additional mechanism to explain different selectivities of TRPPs is a local bonding environment difference at and near the selectivity filter between polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1. A conserved salt bridge between D523 and R518 in polycystin 2-l1 exists in polycystin-2 (D643 and R638). Yet a hydrogen bond between residues D525 and A528 in polycystin 2-l1 is not present in polycystin-2; the residues are not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>). Local hydrogen bonding networks at the selectivity filter of ion channels have been observed to influence function such as the entry into a C-inactivated state for KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>), but such details for non-selective channels are currently unknown.</p><p>In both observations, we rely on one structure, which may change with gating. The use of molecular dynamics (MD) to observe the simulated trajectory of ions and their relationship to the energy landscapes of the selectivity filter is an excellent starting point for future experiments. Coupling future structures with functional mutagenic studies (e.g., the weakly conserved residue K511) should answer these questions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although polycystin 2-l1 and polycystin-2 structures are very similar, there are notable differences that may explain reported functional differences in their selectivity and permeation. For discussion, we divide polycystin 2-l1 into three regions to highlight these differences; the voltage sensing-like domain (VSLD), the pore mucolipin domain (PMD), and the pore (PD). In the VSLD, polycystin 2-l1’s S3 helix extends into the PMD as a complete α-helix. In addition, the top of the S3-S4 helical region abuts the PMD. Comparing the PMDs, polycystin 2-l1 lacks oligosaccharides that act as bridges between adjacent subunits. Finally, although similar, polycystin 2-l1’s pore diameter is slightly larger.</p><p>Due to our inchoate understanding of the TRPP family, we must be cautious in linking the observed differences in structure to functional differences. The two main features we seek to understand are selectivity and gating. Comparing selectivities of the two channels, we know that polycystin 2-l1 conducts both monovalent ions and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while polycystin-2 is monovalent-selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleene and Kleene, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We explain this difference with two features: pore diameter and electrostatic fields. The relatively larger size of polycystin 2-l1’s pore radius (2.6–2.8 Å) may enable partially hydrated calcium’s transit, thus avoiding the larger energy required for pore residues to dehydrate calcium. Most striking are the unique electrostatic maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) surrounding the polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1 pores. Such differences in charge suggest that the putative energy landscapes may create small variations in selectivity, a characteristic suggested for the prokaryotic NaK ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam and Jiang, 2011</xref>). These slight charge differences, and so landscapes, may impart the subtle relative permeability differences observed among most TRP channels. For organelles in which the TRPP (cilia) and TRPML (endolysosomes) appear, these subtle differences may have driven the evolution of small changes in relative permeation in order to titrate levels of ions within these sub-femtoliter compartments. Research into the relative permeabilities of the related TRPML family of ion channels will further our understanding of mechanisms beyond direct side chain coordination.</p><p>TRPPs are not appreciably voltage- or mechanically-gated within physiologically relevant ranges of these forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2016</xref>), which raises the question of what other mechanisms activate these channels. The large surface area of the PMD is a logical candidate for binding of ligands. An appealing hypothesis is that unknown ligands bind the PMD, initiates an interaction with the VSLD (possibly at the extended S3 helix) and/or pore domain which alters channel function. Similarly, interactions of the PMD with the pore domain may elicit conformational changes leading to gating. Given the association of polycystin-1 (a protein of unknown function) and polycystin-2 proteins, it will be important to determine if any of the domains of polycystin-1 proteins interact with polycystin-2 family PMDs.</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was recently observed to facilitate the gating of both polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1 by interacting with residues on both the N and C termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The current lack of resolution of N- and C-terminal ion channel flexible regions limits our interpretation of gating influences for the group II TRP channels. Among group I TRP channels, the large interaction surfaces for intracellular ligands, such as the ankyrin repeats found on several TRPs, the more common TRP domains, and predicted C-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding sites and calmodulin-binding domains, are difficult to interpret without better understanding of proteins or ligands that may bind these regions.</p><p>The explosion of structures available for TRP channels lays the groundwork for interpreting future detailed characterization. The structure of polycystin 2-l1 presented here, will help in understanding what drove evolution to create the diversity that exists in the TRPP subfamily, but only when we more completely understand their biophysical and physiological functions. The recent progress made in cryo-EM underscores the importance of discovering these features.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PKD2L1</td><td valign="top">Synthetic, non-codon optimized</td><td valign="top">Uniprot - Q9P0L9</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK 293 GnT I-</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC: CRL-3022/RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_A785">CVCL_A785</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sf9</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC: CRL-1711/RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0549">CVCL_0549</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">pEG BACMAM</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1038/nprot.20.14.173</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">cisTEM</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.7554/eLife.35383</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cistem.org">http://cistem.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Pymol</td><td valign="top">PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, <break/>Schrödinger, LLC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">UCSF Chimera</td><td valign="top">UCSF Resource for <break/>Biocomputing, <break/>Visualization, and <break/>Bioinformatics</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">3D FSC</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4347</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://3dfsc.salk.edu/">https://3dfsc.salk.edu/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">PHENIX</td><td valign="top">doi.org/10.1107/S0907444909052925</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014224">SCR_014224</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phenix-online.org">https://www.phenix-online.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Coot</td><td valign="top">doi.org:10.1107/S0907444910007493</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">HOLE</td><td valign="top">(see References)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.holeprogram.org">http://www.holeprogram.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">VMD</td><td valign="top">UIUC Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification</title><p>Cloning, expression, and purification of full-length human polycystin 2-l1 were completed using the BacMam strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>).

Particles were then automatically selected based on an empirical evaluation of maximum particle radius (80 Å), characteristic particle radius (60 Å), and threshold peak height (2 S.D. above noise). 2D classification on 842,130 particles used an input starting reference from a previous model solved in C4 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This initial model was generated <italic>ab initio</italic> from a data set acquired for polycystin 2-l1 and processed using cisTEM (particles from 20 Å to 8 Å for the first step of classification with a 20 Å low pass filter used for the initial model to avoid bias). Eight class averages representing different orientations were selected for further iterative 3D classification and refinement in C4 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The best solutions for each iteration were selected for local refinement in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) cisTEM. Upon completion of 3D refinement, the best class was sharpened using B-factors. Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) and angular distribution plots were collected for the final dataset in cisTEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>). Final resolution maps are based on the 0.143 FSC criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>). 3D FSC plots were for the final data were analyzed via the web portal for 3DFSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://3dfsc.salk.edu">https://3dfsc.salk.edu</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>).

Protein was reconstituted following the dilution method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cortes and Perozo, 1997</xref>) into liposomes made from Soy Extract Polar (Avanti). After extensive dialysis, lipids were pelleted and resuspended in HKN buffer and stored at −80°C until characterization. A sample of reconstituted protein was dried overnight at 4°C under constant vacuum and rehydrated the next morning in the same buffer. Liposomes were allowed to swell for 1 hr on ice before recording with patch pipettes (10–15 MΩ). The bath was a Tris buffered variant of HKN (in mM: TRIS 10, KCl 150, NaCl 50, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1), pH 7.4; the pipette contained the same buffer with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Solution osmolarity was measured at 400–405 mOsm. Data was acquired at 10 kHz and a low-pass Bessel-filtered at 1–2 kHz. For each recording, pipette offset and capacitance were corrected. Approximately 2 min after a GΩ seal was achieved, the patch was excised, and capacitance corrected before recording.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structure of the polycystin 2-l1 ion channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Hulse et al., presented a structure of the full-length human polycystin 2-l1 protein at 3.1Å resolution using single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Although it shares high sequence similarity to polycystin 2, whose structure has been determined by multiple labs recently, polycystin 2-l1 exhibits distinct ion permeability. The study aims to provide a detailed view of the structural differences between polycystin 2-l1 and polycystin 2, and these structural differences may underlie the functional difference between the two channels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is structured from the viewpoint of understanding the function of the channel but, at present, it is not clear at this point whether the structural differences contribute to function. The main impact of the present study would be to compare the structures of polycystin 2-l1 and PKD2 in as much detail as possible. Oddly, the introduction to the manuscript barely mentions the fact that a structure for PKD2 has already been reported by this and other groups, but the trajectory of the manuscript would be better served by addressing this up front and moving on from there. In this context, figures showing direct comparisons or overlays of these two TRPP structures would be very useful and help convey important points that are difficult to ascertain from the current format. We are not expecting new functional data but the new structures at the least should help develop a cogent hypothesis for further testing.</p><p>2) There seems to be a disconnect between the stated resolution of the structure and the quality of the maps. This is suggested by the inability to resolve many regions and, in particular, side chains. From the figures provided (for example, Figure 2B and Figure 3D), it is not clear how well the model fits the density map in various regions. The maps look more to be in the 4 – 4.5Å range, and it isn't clear where the possible discrepancy lies. Overfitting is a known issue with cisTEM program for EM structure determination. The authors should re-evaluate their data processing and analysis.</p><p>3) Related to the above point, please provide the map for this structure which would help reviewers assess the quality of the data and thus the validity of the conclusions.</p><p>4) Another question concerns the unusual protocol for channel protein purification, which is very different from that described for PKD2 and which involves initial extraction into C12E9 detergent, batch overnight incubation with amylose resin, and multiple gel filtration steps. Could this be enhancing protein instability that degrades resolution?</p><p>5) Overall, the manuscript is difficult to follow. Most figures are not properly labeled and many of the descriptions in the paper are not adequately supported by figures, making it difficult to comprehend, particularly for readers who are not familiar with the TRPP family of channels. Specifically:</p><p>Results section: &quot;We conclude that these elements are either unstructured or connected with flexible regions, which, along with the lack of cytoplasmic elements in 2D classification (Shen et al., 2016), prevents model building of these regions.&quot; This sentence is unclear and I am not sure what the phrase &quot;cytoplasmic elements&quot; refer to.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>The Voltage Sensing-Like Domain</italic>”: &quot;This S3 helix exhibits greater secondary structure than the presumed closed polycystin-2 structure of Shen et al.&quot; What does greater secondary structure mean here – longer S3?</p><p>Subsection &quot;The Polycystin Mucolipin Domain&quot;. The authors spend so much effort pointing out very detailed structural differences between polycystin 2-l1 and polycystin 2. However, these differences do not seem to have any functional relevance.</p><p>Subsection “Three leaf clovers of the polycystin mucolipin domain”: &quot;However, the nature of the interaction differs in that F216 of TLC1 is near W308 of the adjacent subunit's PMD, representing a possible pi-pi stacking interaction or a hydrophobic pocket&quot;. A hydrophobic pocket is not a proper way to describe this interaction.</p><p>Subsection “Fenestrations and TLC3”: If I recall correctly, the fenestration appears to be sealed in polycystin-2 by an extended loop based on Shen's structure. If there is a fenestration in the present structure, a proper figure should be provided here.</p><p>Subsection “Fenestrations and TLC3”: What does &quot;upper pore domain&quot; refer to: the extracellular side of the pore domain? What do &quot;the loop pore helices&quot; refer to here: the loop and/or the pore helices? What does &quot;mutually exclusive glycosylation states&quot; refer to? In the last sentence of this section: &quot;This difference may help rationalize the intermediate diameter observed in the polycystin-2 multiple-ion structure (1.4Å) (Wilkes et al., 2017) and the single-ion structure (1.0Å) (Wilkes et al., 2017) where such interactions do not exist, and our polycystin 2-l1 structure (3.1Å).&quot; What diameters are the authors describing here and what does &quot;this difference&quot; refer to? Again, there is no figure to support all the descriptions in this paragraph.</p><p>Subsection “The Pore Domain”:</p><p>I am not sure how the figures are ordered. Figure 2 is described after Figure 4. Also, there are no proper labels on Figure 2.</p><p>First paragraph of subsection “The Pore Domain”: &quot;Notably, one element, K511 in polycystin 2-l1, is highly variable among TRPPs.&quot; Where is this K511? Again, there is no figure to support it.</p><p>Second paragraph subsection “The Pore Domain”: I simply don't understand what is discussed here and again there is no figure to support the description. Should the filter diameter be radius? Does 5K47 refer to a PDB code?</p><p>Third paragraph of subsection “The Pore Domain”: The narrowest distance of 2.1 Å appears to be the narrowest filter radius based on Figure 2A (right panel), which excludes the van deer Waals radius of the G522 carbonyl oxygen. The &quot;2.4 Å metal-oxygen distance&quot; refers to atom-to-atom distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and oxygen. These two distances are not comparable.</p><p>Third paragraph of subsection “The Pore Domain”: Here the author repeated the same discussion as the last paragraph, except using atom-to-atom diagonal distances. If the diagonal distance between the two G522 carbonyl oxygen atoms is 8.7Å, then the minimum distance between the G522 carbonyl oxygen and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion would be 4.4 Å. If so, the argument of 2.4 Å metal-oxygen distance is no longer correct. Basically, the whole description about the pore domain is messy and incomprehensible.</p><p>Subsection “Ion permeation differences between polycystin-2 and polycystin 2-l1”. The values of relative permeability ratio should be provided.</p><p>&quot;Higher resolution Cryo-EM structures that identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or monovalents that are occupying the pore with high certainty (or equivalent crystallographic studies like those of CaVAb (Tang et al., 2014)), and realistic molecular dynamic simulations, should shed light on these issues.&quot; What is realistic MD simulation? What do &quot;these issues&quot; refer to here?</p><p>I simply don't understand the logic behind the electrostatic argument. Are the authors suggesting that the net positive charge of the polycystin 2-l1 pore helices contributes to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the channel? Also, how do they compare the relative Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability among four different channels?</p><p>Discussion section &quot;The relatively larger diameter of polycystin 2-l1's pore (0.6Å – 1.1Å) may enable partially […]&quot; Where is this distance value from?

We believe that the most relevant comparisons are made in Figure 5 with PKD2 and TRPV5 and TRPV6. We emphasize that despite PDK2’s similarity with PKD2L1 (structural and sequence), there are differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation physiologically: polycystin-2l1 is permeant to calcium, but polycystin-2 is not. We have included a comparison of the profile of the selectivity filter and mapped the RMSD difference onto the structure as well as provided an overlay (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p> <italic>2) There seems to be a disconnect between the stated resolution of the structure and the quality of the maps.

Further evaluation of the data after consultation with Niko Grigorieff’s group revealed that the data was slightly overfit. To address this concern, we reviewed our data processing strategy and now have limited the resolution during refinement to 8Å. This decreased the nominal resolution but improved map density, with associated improved 3D FSCs (see below). We’ve re-evaluated the data with new tools from the Lyumkis group using 3D FSC plots to characterize the preferred orientation observed in our data Tan et al., 2017. The 3D FSC results are consistent with the angular distribution plot (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) which show that while the Z-resolution is high (labeled side view), the in-plane (x/y) resolution is weaker. This is also reflected in the fits of side chains in the map such as elements seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 5B. We have included the results of this analysis as well as new maps and models. We hope that our analysis and the new tools will help other ion channel groups facing similar problems with their structural efforts using cryoEM. While we cannot eliminate the preferred orientation of our channel, we believe that Lyumkis’ methods enable a better understanding of the effect on the data. Additional metrics, such as the fit of the map (Figure 1—figure supplement 5), the high degree of similarity to Erhu Cao’s polycystin-2 model (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), and the similarity to the mouse polycystin 2-l1 model that was released very shortly after we submitted this work (Su et al., 2018) all verify that our model is not significantly affected. The current estimation from cisTEM and the 3D FSC is 3.3Å and 3.2Å respectively. We report our resolution at the more conservative 3.3Å. The model was reevaluated with the new maps, and several minor adjustments were made including the ability to build in a side chain for residue D523, a critical component of the selectivity filter. We also reveal a more complete loop in the PMD, and some improved density fitting at linkers between transmembrane helices. All figures and the manuscript were updated with this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above point, please provide the map for this structure which would help reviewers assess the quality of the data and thus the validity of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another question concerns the unusual protocol for channel protein purification, which is very different from that described for PKD2 and which involves initial extraction into C12E9 detergent, batch overnight incubation with amylose resin, and multiple gel filtration steps.

C12E9 was selected as an efficient extraction detergent on an empirical screen using western blot against MBP. Stability is evident from the exchange into DDM:CHS during amylose chromatography and in the SEC (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and the ability of the protein to remain in solution for up to 72 h with stable SEC profiles (not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall, the manuscript is difficult to follow.
