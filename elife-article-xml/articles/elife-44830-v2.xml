integration and survival. Moreover, newborn neurons are thought to replace pre-existing ones that die. Despite indirect evidence supporting this model, systematic in vivo observations are still scarce. We used two-photon in vivo imaging to study neuronal integration and survival. We show that loss of new neurons in the OB after arrival at terminal positions occurs only at low levels. Moreover, long-term observations showed that no substantial cell death occurred at later stages. Neuronal death was induced by standard doses of thymidine analogs, but disappeared when low doses were used. Finally, we demonstrate that the OB grows throughout life. This shows that neuronal selection during OB-neurogenesis does not occur after neurons reached stable positions. Moreover, this suggests that OB neurogenesis does not represent neuronal turnover but lifelong neuronal addition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>neuronal cell death</kwd><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV4-0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cremer</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ING20150532361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cremer</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT20160435597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cremer</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTD20170437248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelova</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDF70959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cremer</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Venkatesh N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DC016482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>Jenelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb is not a turnover system but represents a lifelong neuronal addition mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurogenesis continues after birth in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of rodents. During OB neurogenesis predetermined stem cell population along the walls of forebrain ventricles generate neuronal precursors that migrate via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) into the center of the OB. After their radial migration into the principal target layers, the granule cell (GCL) and glomerular layers (GL), cells integrate into the preexisting circuitry and function as interneurons using GABA and dopamine as their principal neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The currently available information indicates that OB neurogenesis is based on two key principles: First, neuronal integration in the adult is a competitive process, during which large numbers of newly arriving neurons compete for integration into the circuitry and ultimately survival. This competition is thought to occur during a defined critical window of 2–8 weeks after arrival and leads to the apoptotic elimination of about half of the initial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergami and Berninger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lledo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandairon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005</xref>). Second, the OB represents a turnover system, in which newly integrating cells replace preexisting ones, leading to a relatively stable total number of neurons in the target layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergami and Berninger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lledo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>These two concepts are to a large extend based on lineage-tracing experiments using thymidine analogs like bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or 3H-thymidine to label the DNA of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandairon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005</xref>). A common observation in such experiments is a loss of labeled cells during the first few weeks after their arrival in the olfactory bulb, which led to the postulation of a selection mechanism allowing the remodeling of specific OB circuits during a period when new cells had already matured and developed dendritic arborizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, genetic approaches using CRE-inducible markers layers have been performed and demonstrated an accumulation of adult born neurons in the OB over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with the turnover model, this has been interpreted as a replacement of older neurons that died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>). Only recently more direct approaches based on two-photon in vivo imaging allowed studying OB neurons directly in the living animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizrahi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sailor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, long-term observation of either juxtaglomerular neurons in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizrahi et al., 2006</xref>), or more specifically of dopaminergic neurons, demonstrated an increase in these populations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>). While at first sight this finding contradicts a pure replacement model, it was interpreted as a change in the interneuron subtype composition of the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition, olfactory activity and learning have been implicated in the regulation of neuron survival. On one hand, sensory deprivation by naris closure reduced the number of BrdU-labeled newborn neurons in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandairon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saghatelyan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, olfactory training increased the number of labeled neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouret et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Thus, while the available data is still mostly indirect, the elegant model based of selection and replacement appears justified. However, to doubtlessly validate this model and to understand the factors controlling the adult neurogenic process, all populations of integrating neurons have to be observed in the living animal from their arrival in the OB throughout the selection phase until their disappearance.</p><p>Here, we combined genetic birthdating and lineage tracing with long term in vivo microscopy to follow timed cohorts of postnatal and adult born neurons from their arrival in the OB for up to 6 months. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that neuronal loss during the critical period for survival, and also at later stages, is rare in all observed populations. We demonstrate that classically used doses of the tracers BrdU and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) induce cell loss. This loss was not observed when low doses of EdU were used. Finally, based on in vivo microscopy and light-sheet imaging of fixed cleared tissue, we show that neuronal addition merely than replacement occurs in the adult OB, leading to permanent growth of the structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long-term in vivo imaging of postnatal and adult born OB neurons</title><p>We used two-photon imaging to directly study the integration and survival of perinatal and adult born OB neurons at high spatial and temporal resolution in the living animal.

However, they strongly contradicted our in vivo observations showing very little cell loss. As suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehner et al., 2011</xref>), we considered the possibility that incorporation of modified nucleotides impacted on neuronal survival in the OB and developed an approach to test this hypothesis.</p><p>To allow immunohistological BrdU detection, tissue samples have to be subjected to strong denaturing conditions that break the complementary base-pairing of DNA, a prerequisite for efficient BrdU antibody binding. Such treatment invariably leads to sample degradation and negatively impacts on staining intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>). In concert with limitations due to antibody penetration, this imposes the use of relatively high concentrations of BrdU, generally several injections of 50 to 200 mg/kg of body weight i.p., for reliable detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandairon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouret et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winner et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, EdU labeling of DNA is based on a click-reaction with fluorescent azides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rostovtsev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tornøe et al., 2002</xref>) that have much higher diffusion rates in tissue than antibodies. Moreover, the staining reaction can be can be repeated several times to increase signal strengths and DNA denaturation is dispensable, altogether allowing the use of considerably lower concentrations of EdU in comparison to BrdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>). Based on this increased sensitivity, we asked if the concentration of altered nucleotides in the DNA impacts on cell survival of new neurons in the OB.</p><p>Four injections of 50 mg/kg EdU in 2-month-old mice led to an about 40% loss of labeled cells in the GL and the GCL of the OB between 2 and 6 weeks, highly comparable to the results based on BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,e</xref>). Four injection of 1 or 5 mg/kg EdU under the same conditions led to the detection of slightly lower amounts of newly generated cells in the OB layers after 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5de</xref>). Importantly, under these conditions the decrease in cell numbers between 2 and 6 weeks was not detectable anymore, both in the GL and the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). As it has been suggested that deep and superficial GCs are differentially susceptible to replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>), we investigated the impact of low and high doses of EdU on both sub-layers. However, deep and superficial GCs showed the same behavior, cell loss at high EdU dose and survival at 5 mg/kg, as the entire GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Altogether, these results lead to the conclusion that loss of labeled cells in the OB during the critical period is correlated with the concentration of modified nucleotides in the DNA of newborn OB neurons.</p><p>Programmed cell death has been suggested to underlie the removal of integrating neurons from the OB during the critical window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2011</xref>). We investigated Caspase 3 (CC3) expression in the presence of high and low doses of EdU. Analyses of immunostained tissues detected consistently low numbers of CC3 positive cells in the OB layers (363 ± 34 cells /mm<sup>3</sup> n = 15; thus about 940 CC3+ cells/GCL) in overall agreement with previous work (770 cells/GCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi and Mori, 2005</xref>). However, among the 10803 analyzed EdU-positive OB neurons only 26 showed co-labeling for CC3. Application of four times 5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg EdU had no influence on the percentage of double stained cells, indicating that thymidine analog induced toxicity did not pass via the apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the distribution of total CC3-positive cells in the OB layers and the RMS. Interestingly, density of CC3-positive cells was more than six times higher in the RMS than in the GCL and the GL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). This is in good agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biebl et al., 2000</xref>) and suggests that cell death in the system occurs predominantly at the precursor level.</p><p>In conclusion, the above results, showing that lineage tracing by high doses of thymidine analogs is associated with cell loss in the OB, point to toxicity of such DNA modifying agents. Moreover, the finding that at low EdU doses cell loss in the OB during the proposed critical selection period is notdetected represents an independent confirmation of our in vivo imaging based findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Neuronal addition in the OB</title><p>Neurogenesis in the OB is considered to be a turnover system in which new neurons replace older ones, leading to a relatively stable size of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>). In such a scenario cell loss has to be expected. As we did not observe considerable cell death during early stages in the OB, we asked if neurons disappear at later stages.

Third, classical lineage tracing approaches based on thymidine analogs are associated with unwanted side effects and have to be interpreted with care.</p><p>Using a non-invasive long-term imaging approach combined with lineage-tracing approaches using low concentrations of the thymidine analog EdU, we were unable to detect considerable cell loss among postnatal and adult generated neurons during the first weeks after their arrival in the OB.</p><p>The predominant evidence that led to the postulation of selection in the OB target layers is based on the use of thymidine analogs, generally BrdU or 3H-dT, that incorporate into the nuclear DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winner et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>However, both BrdU and 3H-dT are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehmann et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuwagata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowakowski and Hayes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sekerková et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taupin, 2007</xref>) and studies in both rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webster et al., 1973</xref>) and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duque and Rakic, 2011</xref>) pointed to unwanted, and hard to interpret, long term effects associated to their use. Accordingly, warnings concerning the interpretation of such data have been issued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costandi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the existing literature, we observed massive loss of newborn neurons in the OB when standard doses of BrdU or EdU were used for tracing. Interestingly, in the presence of considerably lower concentrations of EdU neurogenesis was still obvious but cell loss during the critical period was not detectable anymore. This finding is in perfect agreement with our in vivo observations, in which we find very little neuronal death in the OB layers.</p><p>These results lead to the conclusion that a selection step in which an overproduced precursor population is matched to the needs of the target structure, does not principally occur after arrival in the OB. While this observation is unexpected, it is not completely isolated. For example, in Bax-KO mice, in which apoptotic cell death is blocked, the general structure and size of the OB neuron layers are virtually unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2007</xref>) while a disorganization and accumulation of neuronal precursors in the RMS was observed. This points to the possibility that neuronal selection occurs more at the level of recruitment from the RMS than at the level of integration in the target layers. Such a scenario of ‘early selection’ is also supported by the observation that the density of apoptotic cells is much higher in the RMS than in the OB proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biebl et al., 2000</xref>). However, other scenarios, like an impact of altered migration on survival in the OB, cannot be excluded.</p><p>Alternatively, integration or death of OB interneurons might be intrinsically encoded. It has been shown that in developing cortical interneurons neuronal survival is largely independent of signals from the local environment but that about 40% of the total population is predestined to undergo Bax-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>). In such a scenario, cell death would be expected to occur already in the SVZ/RMS.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that neuronal death is a rare event not only during early stages after arrival in the OB, but at all observed time points. However, the permanent addition of new neurons in the absence of considerable cell removal is not compatible with the idea that the OB represents a turnover system of constant size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergami and Berninger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>). Growth has to be expected and our in vivo imaging and light sheet microscopy studies clearly demonstrate a 40% vol increase during the first year of adulthood in the absence of detectable changes in cell density. Indeed, growth of the adult OB in mice has been observed in other studies, although considerable variation and dependence on genetic background have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richard et al., 2010</xref>). Other studies did not find obvious differences in total OB size or specific sublayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pomeroy et al., 1990</xref>). What could be the reason underlying these contradictory findings? Past approaches were based on the 2D analysis of a subset of tissue sections and the extrapolation of the total volume based thereon. However, the OB is not a simple radial symmetric globule, but a complex multi-layered structure that shows huge variations along the rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral axes (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Light sheet microscopy is suited to overcome many of these limitations as the OB is imaged and measured in its entirety. Extrapolations can be avoided and the selection of comparable levels for layer analyses is simple and reliable. Increases in OB lengths are directly obvious. As a consequence inter-animal variations are minor and growth of the structure becomes evident.</p><p>Independently from the light-sheet approach, we show that during in vivo long-term observations constantly larger frames are needed to accommodate the same group of cells and that the distance of individually identified neurons measurably increases. The latter finding is in full agreement with the observation that the distance between specific glomeruli increases with age of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richard et al., 2010</xref>). Altogether, these data clearly demonstrate growth of the mouse OB during the entire first year of the animal’s life.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that neuronal cell death is rare in the OB and that neuronal addition, but not replacement, is the outcome of adult neurogenesis. Genetic fate mapping studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ninkovic et al., 2007</xref>) and also direct observation of the TH positive neuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>) already pointed toward an increase in specific neuronal subsets in the adult OB. We show that neuronal addition is a general phenomenon that affects perinatally and adult generated neurons, leading to substantial growth of the OB throughout life. Thus, OB neurogenesis appears to reflect ongoing brain development rather than homeostasis.</p><p>How many neurons are added to the adult OB? Our data, based on measurements of cell density and volume of the structure, allows to estimate that between 2 and 6 months about 8000 cells/day are added to the growing OB. Interestingly, using a genetic approach, Imayoshi et al found that 6 months after tamoxifen induction, labeled neurons represent 41.2% of the total population (1,500,000, thus 620,000 new neurons). Considering 60–70% recombination efficiency at the stem cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>), this leads to a number of almost 6000 new cells that are added per day. Thus, our direct measurements and the genetic approach render highly comparable results in terms of the number of neurons that integrates in the adult OB. However, these numbers are substantially lower than estimates based on thymidine analog labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>) and future experiments will be needed to address this discrepancy.</p><p>Our work leaves of course other open questions. For example, it has been shown that olfactory enrichment and learning increases the survival of newborn neurons in the OB. Neurons are ‘saved’ from dying apoptotic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mouret et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rochefort et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sultan et al., 2010</xref>). But how can neurons be saved when death is extremely rare in first place? Repeating in vivo observations and low-dose EdU studies in the context of olfactory stimulation and learning will help to clarify these matters.</p><p>Moreover, an increase in BrdU-positive cells in the GCL was observed in BAX conditional mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>). While this could indicate that cell death is a regulating factor in the OB target layers, it is also in agreement with a scenario where neurons are selected during exit from the RMS, as discussed above.</p><p>Finally, neuronal selection at the level of integration has been proposed to underlie adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergami and Berninger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buss et al., 2006</xref>), and recent in vivo observations indicate that most cell death occurs among immature neurons, at relatively early stages after their birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>). This correlates well with the quasi absence of death during later stages, that we observe in the OB.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice were treated according to protocols approved by the French Ethical Committee (#5223–2016042717181477 v2).

Dexaméthasone (0.2 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.3 mg/mL) were injected subcutaneously and lidocaine was applied locally onto the skull. The pinch withdrawal reflex was monitored throughout the surgery, and additional anesthesia was applied if needed. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was injected ip. after the surgery. A steel bar was added during this step to allow fixation of the animal to the microscope. The skull overlying the OB was carefully thinned with a sterile scalpel blade until a thickness of 10–20 μm was reached. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate (superglu3, Loctite) was applied and a 3-mm round coverslip was apposed and sealed with dental cement (superbond, GACD).

After two-photon excitation, epifluorescence signals were collected and separated by dichroic mirrors and filters on four independent non-descanned detectors (NDD). Images were acquired using an excitation wavelength of 950 nm. RFP was first collected between 605–678. In addition, we collected an additional RFP signal between 560 and 590 that was voluntarily saturated to allow a better identification of subcellular structures like dendrites.</p><p>In general, image acquisition lasted about 10 min. Mice could potentially move on a treadmill during imaging, but rarely did so. The imaging window was centered on the dorsal surface of the OB. The whole PG layer was imaged for periglomerular observation experiments (around 150 μm). For GC observation experiments, we imaged from the surface of the olfactory bulb to a depth of 400 to 600 μm.</p><p>On consecutive observation, the same field of view was localized based on the geometric motifs of groups of neurons and specific morphological features of individual cells. Between 18 and 179 neurons were imaged initially every week for the first 8 weeks and further imaged at irregular intervals for up to 22 weeks.

Briefly, 250 nL of undiluted virus (1:1 mixture of lenti-syn-tTAad and lenti-TRE-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s) was injected bilaterally at each of two depths to target the RMS (coordinates from bregma: A + 3.3, L ± 0.82, from the brain surface: V-2.9 and −2.7). The virus was locally produced and the viral titer was not measured. Supplementary file 1 in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallace et al.

Maximum intensity projections were created and annotated manually in ImageJ and cross-referenced with z-stacks to confirm that the dendritic structure and location of a cell allowed unambiguous identification. Each line in 3C represents cells tracked for different lengths of time, and multiple lines may correspond to a single field of view. For example, this imaged field of view corresponds to the two lines representing three cells tracked over time, with one line ending at 5 weeks and one ending at 7 weeks (due to the final z stack not extending deep enough to include the first 3 cells). The newcomers arrived at different times, so they have different lines. For example, some of the cells with asterisks arrived at 3 weeks and others arrived at 4 weeks. Incoming cells not marked with asterisks had cell bodies that either were not fully included within the z stack or we were not able to track them for more than one imaging session and so were not quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chronic in vivo imaging analysis</title><p>Quantitative analyses were performed on raw image stacks using FIJI software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

Based on morphology and relative position each neuron was individually numbered and tracked on the successive weekly images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b,d</xref>). After identification of the first cohort, smaller numbers of additional neurons appeared permanently in the observation window as a consequence of ongoing neurogenesis in the stem cell compartment (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, 5wpi). These were numbered and followed like the first cohort. Results were summarized in Microsoft Excel. Occasionally neurons located at the border of an image were placed outside of the imaged field in one of the following sessions. These cells were excluded from further analyses. Animals showing an evident degradation of the imaging window were excluded from further imaging sessions.</p><p>For the analyses of the distance between neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7ab</xref>), we measured over time the volume between four neurons (three neurons in the same plane and another neuron in a different plane) using FIJI.

Stack of 6 to 15 images were performed every 2 um over the whole surface of the OB slice. The number of BrdU/EdU-positive cells in the glomerular layer and granule cell layer were quantified in three dimension using FIJI software and Imaris software.

The OB was imaged every 5.9 μm in Z with a xy pixel dimension of 2.5 μm and the whole brain with 30 µm steps in Z and a xy resolution of 3.03 µm, respectively. We used Imaris software (Bitplane, Germany) for reconstruction of the total volume based on the nuclear TOPRO3 staining.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Nowakowski (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, this is a potentially interesting manuscript that highlights how experimental differences may lead to very different outcomes/interpretations between studies. As you will see below, there was enthusiasm for this topic and the approach. However, a main concern of the reviewers in the post-review discussion was the strong statements, intended to counter many previous studies. This in itself is not bad, but the experimental rigor is lacking to fully support claims of a strong paradigm shift. In general, that would require consideration of additional data, other experimental approaches, and/or larger sample sizes. At present, the conclusions are over-interpreted. The dose-dependent effects of thymidine analogs suggest that high doses kill cells, but whether the low dose is sufficient to capture a decrease in number due to cell death if less clear. The number of neurons imaged with 2P seems too small to make a definitive conclusion about cell-death.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that challenges the notion that integration of adult-granule cells is dependent on neuronal competition. The authors show that normally used doses of thymidine analogs induce cell-death whereas low doses fail to do so. Using 2P imaging, the authors do not find evidence of cell death of adult-born granule cells &quot;during a critical period&quot; up till 8 weeks.</p><p>- The sample size for imaging is on the smaller side: 48 neurons from 3 mice (from 1-7 weeks post injection). Can the authors make conclusions regarding activity dependent survival based on such a small number of cells?</p><p>- It is not clear why the authors did not use the Nestin CreERT2:Ai14 system to label adult-born granule cells for 2P imaging.

Do the authors think that competition occurs only in the DG niche?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a great paper! It has impact on the OB issues and also on the DG related proliferation. It is difficult to argue with the single cell data as it has significant advantages over the generally used S-phase labeling.</p><p>The missing aspects of this paper are the early time points and a quantitative analysis (i.e., model). The first point should be addressed in the paper regarding what limits the missing early time points place on the conclusions – there are a few. The quantitative analysis, i.e., model could be the topic of a follow up manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Platel et al., the authors present an intriguing argument against neuronal turnover in the OB, and against critical periods for adult born neuron survival. They show that (1) populations of OB neurons theoretically replaced by adult neurogenesis are actually quite stable, (2) common methods for labeling adult born neurons via intercalating agents can lead to cell death, and (3) the volume of the OB increases continuously with age in accordance with a net influx of neurons. By implementing chronic two photon imaging of genetically labeled neurons, the authors show that populations of perinatally-born and adult-born PGCs are much more stable than previously appreciated. Whereas previous studies showed up to 50% loss of newborn neurons after 4 wks, this study shows little to no reduction in cell numbers. The authors pose that this is mainly due to differences in labeling strategy, and present intriguing evidence that labeling developing neurons with high concentrations of BrdU/EdU induces artificially high cell death, and that when low concentrations of EdU are used there is limited- or no loss of EdU-labeled cells over time. From these findings, the authors make the argument that adult neurogenesis in the OB is not a homeostatic process where the cell loss is balanced by the addition of new neurons, and that the influx of cells corresponds to a continual increase in OB volume. This finding is surprising and a bit harder to reconcile with the notion that the adult brain is in a relatively steady state. They use a combination of extrapolation within fields of view in vivo and whole OB imaging at different ages to show that the volume increases, but cell density and architecture within and between layers remain the same. Overall, this is a useful and informative study that should certainly be considered at <italic>eLife</italic>, however key aspects of the manuscript should definitely be addressed prior to acceptance for publication.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>• Although provocative to make the main claim that adult born neurons do not show a &quot;critical period&quot;, this overall notion is still challenged by the fact that survival/integration is still directly influenced by sensory deprivation/enrichment. This is a key idea to critical period…that levels of activity influence neuronal development. Until this is more clearly fleshed out with further enrichment/learning/training paradigms, it remains a stretch to turn over predominant models, and thus the language should be tempered.</p><p>• The in vivo imaging data is appreciated, and certainly reveals very important discrepancies between previous studies and the current work regarding turnover rates in adult born neuron populations. However, I find it a bit surprising that the authors did not present in vivo imaging data from animals actually labeled with differing concentrations of EdUA. Performing similar analyses in the variable-dosed animals and observing differential turnover rates in vivo would be very compelling, since it would be a direct comparison rather than completely separate experiments. This is a key point, and if not directly addressed with further experimentation, must at least be discussed.</p><p>• The study is lacking details in the Materials and methods section regarding viral injections and imaging methods. From the reference, it is unclear what total volume, titer, and dilution of virus was injected. This is important to assess aspects of labeling progenitor vs. migrating/postmitotic populations through potential diffusion, etc. On the same note, the authors do not describe how they chose their fields of view for imaging, including orientation, depth relative to the surface of the bulb, or other layer landmarks in the OB. Also, each field of view obtained from the same animal should not be considered an independent sample. Especially with only 3 animals, they should account for this by using a nested analysis or a linear mixed model. As is, the current Materials and methods section makes it difficult to fully evaluate this experiment.</p><p>• The description of overall bulb growth using triangulation measurements is appreciated, especially with reference to other brain areas. But given the estimates of newborn neuron birth rates, and the posed limited turnover, it would be possible to generate models and/or estimates of how much the OB should expand. The described growth rate here, still seems quite small considering the robust rate of addition vs. cell death. Can this be modeled, measured, and/or reconciled?</p><p>• For light sheet imaging, the authors use CUBIC-treated samples. Many of the recently developed clearing techniques impact final tissue volumes. It is important to show that this method is not affecting the brain volume differentially at different ages and different structures. Alternatively, other methods such as small animal in vivo CT scans that offer direct volume measurements might be considered.</p><p>• Finally, the authors do not present any data or discussion of how other OB cell types that do not undergo adult neurogenesis compensate for the increase in volume and/or presumed impact on OB circuitry. These issues should at least be raised in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44830.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Thank you for reviewing our work.

We agree that some of the statements are quite strong and should be toned down.

The initial version was much 'softer'. We agree that we should go back to that.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] - The sample size for imaging is on the smaller side: 48 neurons from 3 mice (from 1-7 weeks post injection).

Is Lentiviral labeling an equivalent approach (given the effects of injury, inflammation etc.)?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we repeated the entire experiment of observing adult born GCs over several months. As suggested by the reviewer, we induced cohorts of newborn neurons using the Nestin CreERT2:Ai14 system and followed granule cells over 8 weeks and beyond, up to 20 weeks. Using a chronic window approach we were able to follow 101 cells at high resolution. The results are in perfect agreement with the data for all cell populations observed, regardless if electroporation, viral transduction or Nestin-CRE-ERT2 was used: Once cells appear in the OB target layers, loss is very rarely observed. This does not exclude that a selection process based on recruitment occurs at an earlier time point, as discussed below.</p><p>Both datasets are now presented in Figure 3. Thus, for adult born granule cells, analyses based on different labeling approaches and performed in different labs led to the same conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Conditional deletion of Bax in nestin+ cells in the adult SVZ results in increased survival of adult-born granule cells (Sahay et al., 2011). Are the authors suggesting that Bax dependent cell-death plays a role prior to neuronal integration?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is indeed what we think. We say in the Discussion &quot;… in Bax-KO mice, in which apoptotic cell death is blocked, the general structure and size of the OB neuron layers are virtually unaffected (Kim et al., 2007) while a disorganization and accumulation of neuronal precursors in the RMS was observed. This points to the possibility that neuronal selection occurs more at the level of recruitment from the RMS than at the level of integration in the target layers. Such a scenario of &quot;early selection&quot; is also supported by the observation that the density of apoptotic cells is much higher in the RMS than in the OB proper (Figure 5I and Biebl et al., 2000).</p><p>However, both Sahay et al. and Kim et al. found an increase in BrdU labeled cells in the OB in these mutants. To address this point we say now in the Discussion of our manuscript: &quot;Moreover, an increase in BrdU positive cells in the GCL was observed in BAX conditional mutant mice (Kim et al., 2007; Sahay et al., 2011). While this could indicate that cell death is a regulating factor in the OB target layers, it is also in agreement with a scenario where neurons are selected during exit from the RMS…&quot;. We hope this answers the reviewer’s question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is it possible that activity dependent competition plays a role at a later stage?</p><p>- Neuronal competition is suggested to guide integration of adult-born dentate granule cells (Tashiro Nature 2006, Adlaf et al.

All population that we observed for prolonged time windows (up to 6 months) show a high degree of stability and very little neuron loss. Only when we challenge the system using complete odor deprivation we see cell death of mature neurons (Figure 4 but see also our recent paper by Angelova et al., 2019).</p><p>As mentioned above, we believe that in the OB neurogenic system competition occurs before arrival at their final destination. We agree that the references cited by the reviewer strongly indicate that synaptic competition occurs in the hippocampus. However, the knowledge is far more fragmentary in the OB.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The missing aspects of this paper are the early time points and a quantitative analysis (i.e., model).

As we cannot image deep structures like the SVZ or the RMS we can only conclude on survival and death at once the new neurons arrived in their terminal positions in the OB. We agree that this was insufficiently clear in the original version. Now we say throughout the manuscript that our observations are valid only for time points &quot;… after arrival in terminal positions in the OB.&quot; In addition, we discuss that if selection occurs, this would likely occur in the RMS, which we cannot directly observe, limiting the conclusions. We agree that an extensive quantitative analysis and modeling approaches would be highly interesting. We started collaborations to this aim.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Concerns:</p><p>• Although provocative to make the main claim that adult born neurons do not show a &quot;critical period&quot;, this overall notion is still challenged by the fact that survival/integration is still directly influenced by sensory deprivation/enrichment.

In particular, we were cautious when using the term &quot;critical period' as this term is also used for the critical time window of synaptic plasticity that is associated to neuronal integration.

This is a key point, and if not directly addressed with further experimentation, must at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point raised by the reviewer. Indeed, we performed such an experiment: following individual neurons in the OB in the presence of BrdU. When we used 50 mg/kg BrdU we saw a slight increase in cell death during imaging, but did not reach significance levels at p&lt;005. When we use 300 mg/kg we observed significant death levels, however, well below 40%. The data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and we can introduce it in the manuscript, but we are not sure it is sufficiently strong and conclusive.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44830-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The reason underlying this phenomenon is like the following:</p><p>- Using nestin-CRE-ERT2 we express CRE in stem cells, type C cells and even some type A cells. All recombined cells will express equivalent levels of RFP once arrived in the OB and represent the population that we observe.</p><p>However, using thymidine analogue injections the situation is quite different:</p><p>- Some type C/type A cells will perform their last S-phase in the presence of BrdU/EdU and incorporate high levels of the analogues. These are likely prone to die in the OB.</p><p>- Many cells will not be in S-phase while BrdU is bio-available but will nevertheless induce CRE dependent RFP expression. These will likely live.</p><p>- Many cells in the SVZ will be in early phases of their amplification cycle and will dilute their BrdU/EdU content during subsequent divisions. As toxicity of thymidine analogues is dose dependent, cells that underwent several divisions will be less prone to die.</p><p>As a consequence only few RFP positive neurons on the OB will contain high amounts of BrdU/EdU in their DNA. This is probably why we need considerably higher doses of BrdU (4x300 mg/kg) to observe significantly increased death by in vivo imaging.</p><p>This interpretation is supported by a control experiment that we performed: Co-injection of tamoxifen in adult mice to induce RFP expression combined with BrdU injection at 4x50 mg/kg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows an example of cells in the glomerular layer two weeks later. Only one among the different RFP (red) and BrdU positive cells (green) is double positive. Thus, while all approaches that we used, Nestin-CRE-ERT2, CRE electroporation in neonates, viral transduction in the RMS and thymidine analogues label young neurons, we are far away from saturation and significant overlap. Even when we introduced various delays between tamoxifen and BrdU injection we never saw higher overlaps.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44830-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The study is lacking details in the Materials and methods section regarding viral injections and imaging methods.

The new approach is in detail described in Materials and methods. concerning the virus injection that is still in the paper, we added more information. In particular we say that: &quot;250 nL of undiluted virus (1:1 mixture of lenti-syn-tTAad and lenti-TRE-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s) was injected bilaterally at each of two depths to target the RMS (coordinates from bregma: A+3.3, L+/-0.82, from the brain surface: V-2.9 and -2.7). […] Supplementary Figure 1 in the Wallace et al. paper shows an example of the injection site in a sagittal slice and demonstrates that the virus does not diffuse into the bulb at the volume and titer we used.&quot;</p><p>Finally, the description of the selected field of view is now added to the Materials and methods section: “The imaging window was centered on the dorsal surface of the OB. The whole PG layer was imaged for periglomerular observation experiments (around 150 μm). For GC observation experiments we imaged from the surface of the olfactory bulb to a depth of 400 to 600 μm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The description of overall bulb growth using triangulation measurements is appreciated, especially with reference to other brain areas. But given the estimates of newborn neuron birth rates, and the posed limited turnover, it would be possible to generate models and/or estimates of how much the OB should expand.

Indeed, our estimation is very close from the ones obtained with genetic approaches (Imayoshi et al., 2008). We say:</p><p>“How many neurons are added to the adult OB? Our data, based on measurements of cell density and volume of the structure, allows to estimate that between 2 and 6 months about 8000 cells/day are added to the growing OB. […] However, these numbers are substantially lower than estimates based on thymidine analogue labeling (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002) and future experiments will be needed to address this discrepancy.”</p><p>We hope this addresses the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• For light sheet imaging, the authors use CUBIC-treated samples.
