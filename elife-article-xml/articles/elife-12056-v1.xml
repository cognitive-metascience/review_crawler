In a companion study, we found that reduced activity of the translation initiation factor eIF2α underlies the hypersensitivity of adolescent mice to the effects of cocaine. Here we report that nicotine potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons more readily in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adult mice with genetic or pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2α-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine’s synaptic effects, like adolescents. When we investigated the influence of allelic variability of the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> gene (encoding eIF2α) on reward-related neuronal responses in human smokers, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> gene modulates mesolimbic neuronal reward responses in human smokers. These findings suggest that p-eIF2α regulates synaptic actions of nicotine in both mice and humans, and that reduced p-eIF2α may enhance susceptibility to nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) during adolescence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12056.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12056.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12056.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nicotine addiction is a serious public health problem. People who start using nicotine during adolescence are more likely to become addicted to it during adulthood, but the reasons for this are not well understood. Nicotine causes long-lasting changes in the brain that are responsible for the feelings of pleasure and reward. In particular, nicotine strengthens the connections between neurons at structures called synapses and increases communication between reward-related neurons in key reward areas of the brain. This hijacking of the natural reward system requires new proteins to be made. However, the relationship between protein synthesis and adolescents being particularly vulnerable to nicotine addiction was not known.</p><p>In a related study, Huang et al. found that the reduced activity of a protein called eIF2α, which controls the production of new proteins, accounts for why adolescents are more likely to become addicted to cocaine than adults. Thus, Placzek et al. wanted to know whether the same was true for nicotine and whether the proteins controlled by eIF2α are involved in the way human nicotine addicts experience reward.</p><p>Placzek et al. found that adolescent mice are more susceptible than adult mice to the changes in synaptic strength that are caused by nicotine. This increased susceptibility results from reduced activity levels of the protein eIF2α. Reducing the activity of eIF2α in adult mice made their synapses as likely to change strength in response to nicotine as the synapses of adolescent mice.</p><p>Placzek et al. also used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that compared to non-smokers, the brain activity of human smokers was significantly reduced when given a natural reward. Further studies revealed a variation in the gene encoding the eIF2α protein that affects how smokers respond to a reward, suggesting that this variant is linked to the likelihood that a person will be addicted to nicotine.</p><p>This work raises several important questions. In addition to regulating the initial adaptive changes induced in the brain by nicotine, does eIF2α activity affect compulsive nicotine use? If so, could targeting parts of the eIF2α pathway help treat nicotine addiction? Finally, further studies could explore whether the gene variant identified by Placzek et al. affects how users of other drugs (such as cocaine or alcohol) respond to natural rewards.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12056.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12056.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nicotine-induced plasticity</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd><kwd>human fMRI</kwd><kwd>adolescents</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH096816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS076708, NS21229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA09411, DA026539, DA09167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Salas</surname><given-names>Ramiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PW</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VHA5I01CX000994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salas</surname><given-names>Ramiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An evolutionarily conserved mechanism involving translational control by p-eIF2α underlies vulnerability to nicotine addiction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco use is a major global health problem with enormous economic and social costs. It remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, with tobacco-related illnesses estimated to kill more than 6 million people annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>). In the United States, the direct and indirect financial costs of smoking are estimated at more than $300 billion each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Adolescents are particularly at risk for initiating tobacco use, with a vast majority of all smokers beginning at age 18 or younger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2014</xref>). A growing body of evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that adolescents are more susceptible than adults to the cellular and behavioral effects of nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriani and Laviola, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Counotte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lydon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Nicotine modifies dopamine (DA) signaling in key regions of the brain’s reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jasinska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Biasi and Dani, 2011</xref>). Human neuroimaging studies of smokers have shown that exposure to nicotine alters reward-related activity in dopaminergic reward regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rose et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in rodents, while nicotine is known to potentiate excitatory synaptic connections to DA neurons in the reward-related ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mansvelder and McGehee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saal et al., 2003</xref>), the precise molecular mechanism underlying nicotine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) remains unclear. In a companion article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), we found that the translation initiation factor eIF2α regulates adolescent vulnerability to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine. Briefly, adolescent (5 weeks old) mice proved to be more sensitive to a lower dose of cocaine than adult (3–5 months old) mice with regard to reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α, the induction of LTP, and cocaine-induced behavior [conditioned place preference (CPP), a common behavioral task that reflects behavioral reinforcement underlying the development of drug addiction] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these findings, genetic and pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2α-mediated translational control increased the susceptibility of adult mice to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine, making adult mice resemble adolescents in this respect. Furthermore, other drugs of abuse (including nicotine), that are known to induce LTP in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saal et al., 2003</xref>), also reduced p-eIF2α in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), thus highlighting the role of p-eIF2α as a common effector implicated in the initiation of addictive behavior. In the present study, we found that, like cocaine, mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine-evoked synaptic potentiation in the VTA. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, we identified a functional genetic variation in the promoter of the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> gene encoding eIF2α that alters brain responses to rewarding stimuli in human tobacco smokers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adolescent mice are more susceptible than adult mice to nicotine-induced LTP in VTA DA neurons</title><p>In the accompanying study, we found that adolescent mice are more susceptible to cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation in VTA DA neurons. We therefore asked whether this was also true for nicotine. To answer this question, we measured glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in VTA DA neurons from adolescent (5 weeks old) and adult (3–5 months old) mice 24 hr after single intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of either saline or different doses of nicotine. The peak amplitudes of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and <italic>N</italic>-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated components of the evoked EPSCs (recorded at +40 mV) were isolated and used to calculate the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). An increase in this ratio was taken as an index of LTP. We found that a relatively low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) was sufficient to induce LTP in VTA DA neurons from adolescent mice, but not in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test whether the same is true for nicotine, we injected adolescent and adult mice with a low (0.4 mg/kg) and a relatively high (1 mg/kg) dose of nicotine, respectively. Consistent with our findings with cocaine, we found that a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) reduced p-eIF2α only in the VTA of adolescent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, d</xref>), whereas a higher dose of nicotine (1 mg/kg) was required to reduce p-eIF2α in the VTA of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Thus, like cocaine, low doses of nicotine selectively reduce p-eIF2α in the VTA of adolescent mice, highlighting the involvement of p-eIF2α-mediated translational control during this period of heightened vulnerability to the effects of drugs of abuse.</p><p>Based on these findings, we predicted that adult mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control would be more susceptible to the synaptic effects of nicotine. To test this prediction, we injected both adult control and <italic>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></italic> mice (in which p-eIF2α in VTA is reduced by about 50% because the phosphorylation site is mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) with a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.). This low dose does not typically induce LTP in adult wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), and as expected, it failed to induce LTP in control WT <italic>Eif2s1<sup>S/S</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). By contrast, the same low dose of nicotine elicited LTP in adult <italic>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Thus, like adolescent mice, adult mice with reduced eIF2α phosphorylation are more susceptible to the synaptic effects of nicotine.</p><p>To further support these findings, we used the recently discovered small molecule ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>), which selectively blocks p-eIF2α-mediated translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, adult WT mice were acutely injected with both ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) and a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) and LTP was recorded in VTA DA neurons 24 hr later. Indeed, a low dose of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) induced LTP only in adult mice in which p-eIF2α-mediated translation was blocked pharmacologically with ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Hence, like adolescent mice, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control are more susceptible to nicotine-induced LTP. Thus, our findings that reducing p-eIF2α-mediated translational control renders animals more susceptible to the effects of both cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) and nicotine underscores a key role of p-eIF2α as a common regulator of drug-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Polymorphic variation in the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> gene affects reward signaling measured by fMRI in human tobacco smokers</title><p>Several studies in rodents have shown that certain genes or signaling pathways are implicated in the behavioral effects of drugs of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Robison and Nestler, 2011</xref>), but their clinical relevance to humans remains unknown. Because p-eIF2α crucially regulates drug-induced changes in synaptic strength and behavior in mice, we sought to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the eIF2α signaling pathway could be associated with reward-induced changes in neuronal activity in human smokers. Indeed, by studying specific SNPs chosen on the basis of this hypothesis, we bypassed the problems inherent to large exploratory data analyses and multiple comparisons typical of genome-wide association studies. In this way we increased the chances of finding true effects related to biological processes, while reducing the possibility of false positives.</p><p>According to neuroimaging studies, neuronal activity in key reward areas of the human brain is strongly associated with indices of drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rose et al., 2014</xref>).

Several different mechanisms could be at play. Overexpression of <italic>Eif2s1</italic> could affect eIF2α-mediated translation by altering: a) the assembly of eIF2 complex [eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha (encoded by <italic>Eif2s1)</italic>, a beta (encoded by <italic>Eif2s2</italic>), and a gamma subunit (encoded by <italic>Eif2s3</italic>), b) the binding of eIF2 to key regulatory proteins (e.g., eIF2B and/or eIF5), or c) by titrating the phosphorylated alpha subunit away from the eIF2 complex. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>Eif2s1</italic> could alter the expression of a given eIF2α kinase or phosphatase. Such compensatory translational homeostatic mechanisms have been observed when the levels of key translation initiation factors (e.g., eIF4E, 4E-BPs, PABP, Paips) are either increased or decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khaleghpour et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yanagiya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our mouse and human data suggest that reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control mediates a genetic predisposition to greater risk for drug-induced changes in synaptic strength, which may account for the greater vulnerability of adolescents, even as first time drug users. For instance, mice with reduced eIF2α-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine-induced changes in synaptic function. Similarly, smokers carrying the G variant, who also have reduced eIF2α-mediated translation, show reduced reward-induced activity in the caudate and putamen, suggesting that such individuals are likely to consume more drugs to obtain reward activity comparable to that of non-smokers. Finally, these insights may hold promise for new p-eIF2α-based approaches to treating drug abuse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were conducted on male and female mice from the C57BL/6 background. <italic>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup> </italic>mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>).

Smoking history and dependence were evaluated using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heatherton et al., 1991</xref>), Shiffman-Jarvik Withdrawal Questionnaire (SJWQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shiffman and Jarvik, 1976</xref>), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Watson and Clark, 1994</xref>). All participants read and signed an Informed Consent to participate in this research protocol.</p><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but sample sizes were similar to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Salas et al., 2010</xref>). The subjects were either smokers (<italic>n</italic>=35, average age=43.26 years ± 12.19 years, 77.1% males, 22.9% females, smoking at least 10–15 cigarettes per day and had smoked for at least the past year) or non-smokers (<italic>n</italic>=54, average age=31.37 ± 11.60 years, 44.4% males 55.5% females, lifetime incidence of smoking less than 50 cigarettes or no cigarettes for the last year). For more information on participant demographic, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Participants were scanned in 3T Siemens Trio scanners in the Center for Advanced MRI at Baylor College of Medicine. Structural MPRAGE images were collected as 160 1×1×1 mm axial slices (TE=2.66 ms, TR=1200 ms, flip angle=12°, 256 × 256 matrix) while functional images were collected as 2x2x2 mm epi scans (TR 2 s, TE 40 ms) over a 44 mm “slab” covering the regions of interest. Light-juice pairings were presented during functional scanning using ePrime software (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA). For each of a maximum of 55 light-juice pairings, a Standard Infuse/Withdraw Harvard 33 Twin Syringe Pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) delivered 1 mL of juice 7s after a light cue. Prior to scanning, participants were given a choice of sugar-free sweet drinks (such as lemonade, iced tea with peach or fruit punch, and the preferred juice was given during scanning). fMRI data were analyzed using a standard AFNI processing stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cox, 1996</xref>). Briefly, the first four TRs were removed to establish a stable baseline. Data were then corrected for slice-time acquisition (3dTshift), aligned to the first image and measured for motion (3dvolreg), registered to the high resolution MPRAGE, and transformed to MNI space using a single spatial transform (@auto_tlrc, 3dAllineate). A 4.5 mm smoothing kernel was applied in 3dmerge and submitted to a General Linear Model (GLM) regression in 3dDeconvolve. GLM regressors for linear, quadratic, and cubic linear trends; x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw motion parameters; and the two stimulus conditions: visual cue and juice reward were included. An analysis of the interaction between smoker/non-smoker group and genotype (e.g. rs10144417 AA vs. GG/AG) was performed using a 3D multivariate model (3dMVM) and family-wise error correction. The percent signal change in BOLD activation for individual subjects was extracted from caudate and putamen regions of interest (ROIs) and restricted to those voxels identified as having a <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 and alpha&lt;0.05 in the multivariate model of group by genotype interaction. No effect of age, number of years smoking, average number of cigarettes per day, gender, or ethnicity was observed in the fMRI analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Human genotype</title><p>DNA was isolated from buccal swabs and genotyping was completed using Illumina (San Diego, CA) HumanOmniExpress-12 v1.1 BeadChip arrays (cat# WG-312-1120) containing approximately 741K SNPs. Genomic DNA (200 ng) from each sample was processed following Illumina’s Infinium HD Ultra Assay protocol. BeadChip images were captured using Illumina iScan System. The Illumina chip contained the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> rs10144417 SNP (Global minor allele frequency MAF:0.2993). fMRI activity was studied according to the genotype of analyzed subjects. Subjects with AG and GG genotypes were pooled for analysis and compared to subjects with the AA genotype using AFNI’s statistical software.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses were performed with SigmaPlot (Systat Software). Data distribution normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. The statistics were based on the two-sided Student’s t test, or one- or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD (or HSD for unequal sample sizes where appropriate) to correct for multiple <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons. Within-groups variation is indicated by standard errors of the mean of each distribution, which are depicted in the graphs as error bars. <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, ****<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hongyi Zhou for assisting in the maintenance of the mouse colony and members of the Costa-Mattioli laboratory for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The authors should be clearer about what their experiments show and do not show. For example, they do not have any evidence, as they claim, that &quot;reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control is a genetic modifier of risk for drug addiction&quot;.

The study did not seem to look at drug addiction in either mice or human subjects. Instead the authors studied reward responses. There is an important and clear distinction between the two.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and have now replaced “drug addiction” by “drug-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior”. The sentence quoted above now reads as follows: “Collectively, our mouse and human data suggest that reduced p- eIF2α-mediated translational control mediates a genetic predisposition to greater risk for drug-induced changes in synaptic strength, which may account for the greater vulnerability of adolescents, even as first time drug users” (Results and Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) Regarding the results from rodents, the authors should provide a direct evidence for the phosphorylation level of eIF2alpha in adolescent mice versus adult ones, as well as after nicotine treatment. It is arguable that changes in eIF2α activity can underline the differential effect nicotine-mediated in adolescent mice compared to adults. A direct assay exploring this issue, if it can be performed rapidly, could be of relevance to further support the electrophysiological finding.</italic> </p><p>As recommended by the reviewers, we administered different doses of nicotine to adult and adolescent mice and found that a low dose of nicotine reduces eIF2α phosphorylation in the VTA of adolescents, but not adult mice (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref> and subsection “Like adolescent mice, adult mice with reduced eIF2α-mediated translational control are more susceptible to nicotine-evoked LTP”, first paragraph). Thus, like cocaine, our new experiments with nicotine highlight the involvement of p-eIF2α phosphorylation-mediated translational control during this period of heightened vulnerability to the effects of drugs of abuse.</p><p>While basal p-eIF2α levels are similar in the VTA of adults and adolescent mice (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 4 in the accompanying paper by Huang et al.), phosphorylation of eIF2α in the brain is dynamically regulated by kinases: double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and Heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI); as well as by two phosphatase complexes: protein phosphatase 1/growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible protein (PP1/GADD34) and PP1/constitutive reverter of eIF2α phosphorylation (PP1/CReP)<sub>1,2</sub>. Thus, in the Discussion section of our accompanying paper (p. 12), we speculate that nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) either inhibit the activity of a given eIF2α kinase or promote the activity of eIF2α phosphatases, processes to which we suspect adolescents are more prone. We are currently investigating the precise mechanism by which drugs of abuse decrease p-eIF2α in the VTA and other reward-related areas.</p><p> <italic>3) Did the authors test the higher dose of nicotine in adolescent mice? It would be an additional and interesting information whether in adolescent mice the nicotine effect has already reached a saturated level or the LTP could further increase at higher concentration of nicotine.</italic> </p><p>As now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, similar LTP is produced in adolescent mice by both a low (0.4 mg/kg) and a high dose of nicotine (1 mg/kg), indicating that even at lower doses of nicotine the LTP reaches a plateau in adolescence.</p><p> <italic>4) Although the nicotine-mediated effect on AMPAR/NMDAR ratio is clearly significant, the number of 4 observations is too low and only slightly above the minimal required number for the statistical power. Strong recommendation to increase the N.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and have increased the N. Even with a larger sample size, the conclusion of our work remained unchanged.</p><p><italic>5) The selection criteria of participants, especially smoker subjects, should be specified. Did they have history of any other drug dependence? A table depicting the participants' demographics would be useful for readers.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have now provided a supplemental figure that includes two tables with relevant information about our subjects (demographic, gender and age of the individuals; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The presentation of the polymorphism data was confusing. Especially the relationship between the mouse work and human results should be made clear and caveats in the link pointed out. It is important to note that the strength of the paper is the connection between the mouse and human data and anything that would strengthen that connection would consequently strengthen the paper. The relation between FLUC and RLUC assays is also murky and confusing. This should also be explained better. Finally, the reviewers wonder which mechanisms could cause increased expression of Eif2s inhibits p-eIF2α−mediated translation.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have better explained the connection between the human and mouse data (subsection “Polymorphic variation in the Eif2s1 gene affects reward signaling measured by fMRI in human tobacco smokers”, last paragraph). In addition, we have made clearer the description of the luciferase experiments (in the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).</p><p>Finally, in the Discussion section, we now hypothesize different mechanisms by which expression of Eif2s could block eIF2α−mediated translation (subsection “Polymorphic variation in the Eif2s1 gene affects reward signaling measured by fMRI in human tobacco smokers”). As this is beyond the scope of the current paper, our intention is to further investigate this process in detail and publish the results separately.</p><p><italic>References</italic></p><p>1) Buffington, S.
