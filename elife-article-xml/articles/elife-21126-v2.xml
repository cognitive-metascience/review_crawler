To understand how the underlying neural circuit turns the behavior on and off, we optically recorded circuit activity in behaving animals while manipulating circuit function using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs. In the active state, the circuit shows rhythmic activity phased with the body bends of locomotion. The serotonergic HSN command neurons initiate the active state, but accumulation of unlaid eggs also promotes the active state independent of the HSNs. The cholinergic VC motor neurons slow locomotion during egg-laying muscle contraction and egg release. The uv1 neuroendocrine cells mechanically sense passage of eggs through the vulva and release tyramine to inhibit egg laying, in part via the LGC-55 tyramine-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel on the HSNs. Our results identify discrete signals that entrain or detach the circuit from the locomotion central pattern generator to produce active and inactive states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21126.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21126.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21126.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It has been said that if the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t. This quote neatly captures the challenge of working out how 80 billion neurons collectively generate our thoughts and behavior. Fortunately, the nervous system is also organized into simpler units called circuits. Each consists of a relatively small number of neurons, which communicate with one another to control as little as a single behavior. These circuits should in principle be simple enough for us to understand, particularly if we study them in nervous systems less complex than our own.</p><p>Despite this, there is currently not a single circuit in any organism in which we can explain how communication between individual neurons generates behavior. Collins et al. therefore set out to characterize a simple neural circuit in one of the simplest model organisms: the egg-laying circuit of the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Using mutations, drugs and molecular genetic techniques, Collins et al. systematically altered the activity and signaling of each of the neurons within the egg-laying circuit. The experiments revealed that cells called command neurons trigger egg laying by producing signals that switch on the rest of the circuit. Once activated, the circuit is able to respond to waves of activity from a second circuit – called the central pattern generator – that also controls the worm’s movement. Finally, laying an egg activates a third set of neurons, which release a signal that returns the circuit to its inactive state.</p><p>The use of distinct signals and neurons to activate the circuit, to coordinate its ongoing activity, and to inactivate the circuit when its task is complete also applies to many other neural circuits. Now that these signals have been identified in one circuit, it should be possible to build on these findings to better understand how others work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21126.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21126.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>neuromodulator</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>tyramine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship, POST4990016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS086932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name><name><surname>Koelle</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009680</institution-id><institution>Yale Liver Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK34989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koelle</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koelle</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neural circuit that regulates egg-laying behavior in nematode worms is activated by egg production, coupled to the circuit that generates movement, and inhibited by sensory feedback from egg release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits are the functional units underlying all thoughts and behaviors, but there is as yet no neural circuit in any organism for which we know with precision how the many signaling events among its cells together generate its activity. This would require, among other things, understanding how neuromodulators shape activity at chemical and electrical synapses to alter the excitability of specific cells in the circuit to generate regulated, dynamic patterns of circuit responses and a coherent behavioral output. One approach to this problem is to analyze small neural circuits typical of invertebrate model organisms, so that both the simplicity of the circuits and the powerful experimental approaches uniquely possible within these systems can provide a penetrating analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marder, 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21126.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-specific reporters of activity in the <italic>C.elegans</italic> egg-laying behavior circuit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the circuit.

This circuit, diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, consists of two serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and six cholinergic Ventral C neurons (VCs), each of which synapse onto a set of vulval muscles whose contraction expels eggs. Four neuroendocrine uv1 cells also regulate egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jose et al., 2007</xref>). Despite its anatomical simplicity, the egg-laying circuit produces a regulated, rhythmic behavior that alternates between quiescent periods of about 20 min during which no egg laying occurs, and active states lasting a few minutes during which ~5 eggs are laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). Active states appear to result when the HSNs release serotonin that signals through G protein coupled receptors on the vulval muscles to increase their excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hapiak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>). Strong regulation by sensory stimuli is superimposed on the pattern of alternating behavioral states. For example, carbon dioxide regulates neuropeptide release from head sensory neurons that signal through receptors on the HSNs to inhibit egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallem et al., 2011</xref>). Worms also halt egg laying in the absence of food and restart the behavior when re-fed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying has been studied for decades, and dozens of genes have been identified by mutations that either reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 1988</xref>) or increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bany et al., 2003</xref>) egg laying. Some of the identified genes encode ion channels that regulate cell and synaptic electrical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elkes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnstone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weinshenker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jospin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jose et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>). Other identified genes encode components of G protein signaling pathways that act in specific cells of the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brundage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koelle and Horvitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hajdu-Cronin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porter et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest neuromodulators, including serotonin, signal through G proteins to regulate the excitability of specific cells in the circuit to control circuit activity and egg laying.</p><p>The ability to leverage egg-laying mutants to understand the molecular mechanisms that initiate, sustain, and terminate the active state of egg laying has been limited by the tools available to analyze activity in the cells of the egg-laying circuit. Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in cells in the circuit was initially optically recorded in immobilized animals, which have limited ability to engage in egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). More recently we developed methods to optically record Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the vulval muscles in moving animals as they engage in normal egg-laying behavior. Using ratiometric imaging to correct for movement and focus artifacts, and recording at 20 frames/sec for periods of up to one hour, we were able to measure activity of the vulval muscles as animals cycled through active and inactive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Our recordings showed that the vulval muscles are excited rhythmically in phase with the body bends of animal locomotion, and we proposed this was due to signaling from the cholinergic motor neurons, including the VCs, that are rhythmically active during locomotion. We found that a conserved ERG K<sup>+</sup> channel depresses response of the vulval muscles to excitation, thus maintaining the inactive behavior state, and we proposed that serotonin signaling onto vulval muscle receptors enhances vulval muscle excitability to allow the strong muscle contractions and egg release seen in the active state. We have now generated tools to carry out Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings in moving animals for each neuron type in the egg-laying circuit. Combining these recordings with precise manipulations of the circuit using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs allows us to deduce how specific signals from these cells drive specific features of circuit activity and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct patterns of activity in the egg-laying circuit accompany the active and inactive behavior states</title><p>We carried out long-term Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings of HSN and VC neuron activity in behaving animals using methods we developed previously for the vulval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>). We generated transgenic strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> co-expressing the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter GCaMP5 and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent fluorescent protein mCherry specifically in the HSN or VC neurons, and used ratiometric imaging to record cell activity and egg-laying behavior as animals moved through active and inactive egg-laying states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because of the large size of the egg-laying synapse, we were able to clearly observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients localized to the presynaptic terminus in HSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

We defined the active state as one minute before the first egg-laying event and one minute after the last egg-laying event.</p><p>We found that HSNs displayed long (~4 s at half-maximum amplitude) Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were largely consistent in waveform and amplitude, but that varied in occurring either as single events or trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). There was also significant HSN activity outside of the active state, but HSN transients were more frequent during the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Active state HSN transients typically occurred in bursts, within which HSN transients occurred every ~20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Only 11% of HSN transients were accompanied by an egg release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), but almost every egg-laying event occurred during an HSN transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; out of 49 total egg-laying events observed, 48 occurred within an HSN transient).</p><p>VC transients were shorter than HSN transients (~2 s at half-max) and variable in amplitude.

Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were most intense in the VC presynaptic varicosities and axonal processes, they were also visible in all six VC cell bodies, especially those of the VC4 and VC5 neurons that most closely flank the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Vulval muscle twitching and egg-laying contractions caused significant mechanical deformation of the VC neurons. 34% of VC transients were accompanied by an egg release, a larger fraction than seen for HSN and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (p&lt;0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). Every egg-release event was accompanied by a VC transient. There was no correlation seen between the magnitudes of VC or HSN transients that did or did not coincide with egg release, while the magnitude of muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that resulted in egg laying were ~four fold larger than the muscle twitch transients that did not release eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>The close apposition of HSN, VC, and vulval muscle synaptic regions prevented us from simultaneously imaging more than one cell type, but we were able to compare timing of activity in the different cells using the moment of egg release as an objective landmark. HSN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients peaked ~2 s prior to egg release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and decayed slowly. Shorter VC Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients followed HSN activity, peaking ~0.1 s before egg release. Vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients peaked with egg laying. We also tracked vulval muscle contraction by measuring the size and fluorescence intensity of the mCherry labeled muscles, and saw that muscle relaxation and decay of vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> immediately followed egg release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HSN, VC, and vulval muscle activity are rhythmic and phased with animal locomotion</title><p>Previous work showed that timing of egg-laying events was not rhythmic but followed a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>).

We previously observed that vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients tend to occur when the vulva is at a particular phase of the locomotion body bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>), suggesting rhythmic activity in the locomotor circuit may be the source of rhythmicity in the egg-laying circuit. Using our video recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in moving animals, we examined whether HSN and VC activity, like vulval muscle activity, are phased with locomotion. Thus we determined timing of the peaks of HSN, VC, and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients relative to when the vulva passed through the previous and subsequent most contracted or relaxed state of a body bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and Methods). The results were plotted on histograms with ventral contraction at 0 and 360°, ventral relaxation at 180°, and intermediate phases of body bends at the angles in between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). We found that the HSN, VC, and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurred when the vulva was at particular phases of the locomotor body bend. HSN transients just prior to egg release reached their maximum at ~180°, when the vulva and adjacent body wall muscles were at their most relaxed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). VC and vulval muscle transients that accompanied egg laying occurred later, starting at ~225° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). HSN transients that did not result in egg laying showed no clear evidence of phasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, VC transients and vulval muscle twitch transients that did not lead to egg release were still phased, but delayed by ~45° toward the most ventral contracted state. These results confirm our previous observations that vulval muscle twitching and egg-laying activity are phased with locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>). These results extend that analysis to show that HSN, VC, and vulval muscle activity during egg laying events are rhythmic, phased with locomotion, and occur earlier in the body bend cycle, when the adjacent body wall muscles are in a more relaxed state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optogenetic activation of HSNs initiates the egg-laying active state</title><p>To directly test how neurotransmitter signaling from the HSNs regulates egg-laying circuit activity, we used the <italic>egl-6</italic> promoter to express Channelrhodopsin-2 in the HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>), allowing us to drive neurotransmitter release specifically from the HSNs with blue light.

Some differences from a spontaneous active state were notable. Almost every VC transient after optogenetic HSN activation was accompanied by an egg-laying event, whereas only one third of VC transients during spontaneous active states were accompanied by egg-laying events.

Careful observation shows that the most dramatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes during vulval muscle twitching occur at the ventral tips of the vm1 muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The VCs innervate vm2 muscles but not the vm1 muscles. The vm1 muscles are instead innervated by the VB6 and VA7 neurons that also release acetylcholine to drive body wall muscle contraction for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>). Consistent with this, vm1 twitching occurs at the same time the adjacent ventral body wall muscles are contracting during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Increased electrical excitability of the vulval muscles during a spontaneous or optogenetically-induced active state may allow for vm1 excitation by VB6/VA7 with each body bend.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>VC neuron activity helps coordinate egg laying and locomotion</title><p>Our observation that VC activity always accompanies egg release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>) is consistent with a proposal that the VCs release acetylcholine that signals through vulval muscle nicotinic receptors to drive egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2001</xref>).

How VC activity during egg laying might affect body wall muscle contraction has not been examined. We optogenetically activated the HSNs to induce active states and recorded animal speed around egg-laying events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We expected to find that loss of HSNs led to a dramatic reduction in vulval muscle activity. Surprisingly, we found the opposite; animals lacking HSNs had more frequent vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the inactive state and robust activity during infrequent active states that led to multiple eggs being laid in a short period (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We found that exogenous tyramine reduced egg laying in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Using recordings of cell activity in behaving animals as they transition from the inactive to active egg-laying states, we were able to show that circuit activity is diminished during the inactive state, strongly increased and rhythmic during the active state, and this rhythm is phased with sinusoidal locomotion. Sterilization eliminated the active state rhythm, locking animals in the inactive state. Our results suggest that activity in the egg-laying circuit, like that of many other modulated motor circuits, responds to rhythmic input from central pattern generators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marder et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> explains how different inputs into the egg-laying circuit are responsible for the inactive state and the active state rhythms observed during egg-laying behavior. Active state vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients peak rhythmically each time the vulva approaches a ventral body bend, the point at which the cholinergic VB and VA motor neurons release acetylcholine to rhythmically excite both the vm1 muscles and adjacent ventral body wall muscles during locomotion. During the inactive state, K<sup>+</sup> channels including ERG depress vulval muscle excitability below threshold, explaining why we fail to observe vulval muscle activity with each body bend during this state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>). While we observe rhythmic activity in the HSNs in the active phase, the periodicity and phasing of HSN activity does not correlate with that of locomotion. Consistent with this, previous work found changes in osmolarity can drive rhythmic HSN activity even in immobilized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus HSN rhythmic activity is independent of locomotion, although we found HSN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that happen to fall at a specific phase of locomotor body bends are more likely to be followed by egg release. We propose that release of serotonin from the HSNs, along with an unknown signal resulting from mechanical stretch of the uterus by accumulating eggs, together raise vulval muscle electrical excitability to result in the active state during which the vulval muscles undergo rhythmic twitching or egg laying contractions in response to the same cholinergic VA and VB neurons that drive locomotor body bends. This model accounts for the phasing of vm1 transients with body bends, although egg-laying events require additional activity in the vm2 muscles that results in the coordinated contraction of all vm muscles that results in egg release. We found that vm transients that lead to egg release are on average slightly phase advanced relative to those that do not. This phase advance could from the excitatory input onto the vm2 muscles occurring earlier in the body bend, and candidates for this input are the HSNs and VCs, both of which synapse onto the vm2 muscles and have phased activity during egg-laying events. The functional purpose of this phase advance may be mechanical. Passage of each 25 × 40 µm egg requires contraction of vm1 and vm2 muscles on both the anterior and posterior sides of the vulva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>). There may not be sufficient room for vulva to fully open and release egg unless the adjacent body wall muscles are in a contracted state.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21126.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model of how circuit connectivity, signaling, and activity contribute to the observed rhythms that accompany the active and inactive egg-laying behavior states.</title><p>VA and VB motor neuron synapses release acetylcholine (ACh) that rhythmically excites the body wall muscles (bwm) and vm1 vulval muscles during each locomotion body bend, every ~10 s.

Sustained bursts of HSN command motor neuron activity trigger serotonin release that drives ~2 min active states. HSN also makes synapses and gap junctions with the cholinergic VC motor neurons, and VC makes synapses and gap junctions with the vm2 muscles whose contraction allows egg release.

Optogenetic activation of HSNs recapitulates features of the active state including phased VC and vulval muscle activity and multiple egg-laying events. However, stimulation of the HSNs fails to drive tetanic contraction of the vulval muscles as would be predicted for a motor neuron releasing a fast-acting neurotransmitter. Instead, HSN makes and releases the neuromodulator serotonin which signals through G protein coupled serotonin receptors to activate the vulval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hobson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hapiak et al., 2009</xref>). The HSNs also release serotonin onto the AVF interneurons in the nerve ring to promote a state of locomotion arousal that accompanies the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardaker et al., 2001</xref>). Animals defective in serotonin signaling have reduced egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanis et al., 2008</xref>), but this defect is not as severe as that of <italic>egl-1(dm)</italic> animals missing HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trent et al., 1983</xref>), suggesting HSN releases additional neurotransmitters. We found that optogenetic activation of HSNs leads to rhythmic activity of VC neurons, which are not known to express serotonin receptors, so an unknown signal derived from HSN could directly activate VCs, as depicted in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> model.</p><p>How is HSN activity controlled? The HSNs receive little synaptic input near the vulval except from the PLM mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>). The PLMs inhibit HSN activity and egg laying in response to gentle touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), but recent work indicates the PLM neurons are also deformed during normal patterns of locomotion that could contribute to rhythmic activity seen in HSN during egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>). Neuroendocrine signaling also regulates HSN activity. <italic>flp-10</italic> and <italic>flp-17</italic> neuropeptides are released from the CO<sub>2</sub>-responsive BAG neurons in the head, and these neuropeptides signal through EGL-6 receptor and Gα<sub>o</sub> to activate IRK channels that inhibit HSN activity and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallem et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>). Because loss of EGL-6 or IRK channels do not increase egg laying as much as cell-specific inhibition of Gα<sub>o</sub>, there must be additional receptors and effectors of Gα<sub>o</sub> that inhibit HSN activity. Gα<sub>q</sub> signaling opposes Gα<sub>o</sub> to increase serotonin release from the HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanis et al., 2008</xref>), but the ligands and receptors that activate Gα<sub>q</sub> have not yet been identified. Because we find that HSN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients vary more in frequency than amplitude, we propose that these diverse sensory signals increase or reduce the probability that HSN reaches a threshold potential that can initiate, sustain, or terminate HSN activity and thus the active behavior state of the egg-laying circuit.</p><p>We have also identified an HSN-independent mechanism that induces the active state. Mutants lacking HSNs are strongly egg-laying defective, but eventually enter active states with properly phased vulval muscle twitching and egg-laying transients. The active state was eliminated in animals sterilized by FUDR, reducing vulval muscle activity and phasing to that seen in the inactive state. Recent work has identified the gonad as an important site of regulation for adult-specific behaviors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the accumulation of unlaid eggs in the uterus, perhaps leading to mechanical stretch, provides an essential, permissive signal for entry into the active state. Several steps during embryo production and maturation could regulate entry into the active state to result in the ~20 min period of the egg-laying inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). Animals grown on food generate one new oocyte from each of two gonad arms every ~10 min, balancing out the 3–5 eggs laid in the ~2 min active state that occurs every ~20 min, to result in a ~constant number of unlaid eggs in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>). New embryos are moved by gonadal sheath contractions into the spermatheca for fertilization and deposition into the uterus. Excitable cells drive each of these steps, providing potential sources of regulation by cell signaling and sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kariya et al., 2004</xref>). Eight uterine muscles line the uterine lumen and form gap junctions with the vm2 muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>), and the addition of unlaid eggs into the uterus could induce a mechanical stretch that cross-excites the vm2 muscles. Future work will be required to understand how the accumulation of unlaid eggs promotes the active state.</p><p>Our results strongly imply that acetylcholine released from the VC motor neurons slows locomotion during vulval muscle contraction. We found that animal locomotion slows during egg release, and that optogenetic activation of the VC neurons halts movement and results in body wall muscle contraction and animal shortening. This function of the VCs is likely via acetylcholine signaling through nicotinic receptors expressed on ventral body wall muscles and neurons that regulate locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>). The effect of VC activity to slow locomotion and contract body wall muscles may help compress the body and uterus to encourage expulsion of eggs, analogous to the role of body wall muscle contraction in facilitating defecation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Thomas, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide more complex evidence as to whether VC acetylcholine also directly triggers egg release. We found that VC activity always accompanies egg-laying contractions of the vulval muscles. The vulval muscles also express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and receptor agonists including levamisole and nicotine stimulate egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weinshenker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>). However, we found little correlation between the strength of the VC activity and whether an egg is laid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), and that optogenetic activation of the VC neurons fails to drive egg laying. Further, VC-defective and acetylcholine-deficient mutants have <italic>increased</italic> egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bany et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>). These data together are consistent with a model in which acetylcholine released from the VA/VB motor neurons signal through nicotinic receptors on the vm1 muscles to stimulate rhythmic vulval muscle twitching, which combined with acetylcholine released from the VC neurons to similarly excite the vm2 muscles results in egg laying. High levels of VC activity, such as occurs during optogenetic activation, may drive release of additional signals, such as neuropeptides, that inhibit egg-laying circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bany et al., 2003</xref>; Banerjee and Francis, personal communication), or by freezing locomotion may feedback to halt the VA/VB activity required to drive vm1 contraction.</p><p>How is VC activity controlled? The VC neurons are unusual in that they are largely presynaptic, only receiving input from each other and the HSNs. As noted above, optogenetic activation of HSNs results in VC activity, suggesting a currently unknown signal from HSN directly activates VCs. A second possible input onto VCs is suggested by the fact that the VC neurons extend processes devoid of synapses dorsally along the vulval hypodermis that could be mechanosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, rhythmic VC activity could be stimulated mechanically by body bends or by a humoral signal released from the locomotor circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Further, VC activity could be mechanically stimulated by vulval muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), particularly as we observed mechanical deformation of VC presynaptic termini during strong twitching and egg-laying contractions. In this way, the VCs could act like baroreceptors–mechanically activated by vulval muscle contraction to drive contraction of the body wall muscles that results in animal slowing until the feedback of egg release. In this model, the coordination of locomotion and egg laying by tying both behaviors to the same central pattern generator allows productive egg release.</p><p>The uv1 neuroendocrine cells inform the circuit that eggs have been successfully laid. Passage of eggs through the vulva mechanically deforms the uv1 cells and triggers a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Our results suggest this activates uv1 to release tyramine that inhibits egg-laying, at least in part via the LGC-55 receptor on the HSN neurons. Active states last ~2 min, and inhibitory tyramine release from uv1 could provide a feedback signal that terminates activity in the circuit. The four uv1 cells have a unique structural position in the vulva that may explain how they become activated during egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Newman et al., 1996</xref>). uv1 cells extend processes that contact and make adherens junctions with the ventral vulF vulval cells. uv1 cells also makes dorsal attachments to utse, a large, H-shaped multinucleate uterine seam cell that attaches the uterus to the lateral epidermis and that functions as a hymen broken by the first egg-laying event. The acute mechanical strain on vulF, uv1, and/or utse during egg passage could mechanically activate ion channels. Previous work has shown uv1 expresses several TRPV channels that may be mechanosensory and contribute to this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jose et al., 2007</xref>). A dominant-negative OCR-2 mutant expressed in uv1 leads to hyperactive egg-laying behavior phenotype. We still observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in uv1 after egg-laying events in this <italic>ocr-2(vs29)</italic> mutant (data not shown), suggesting other channels contribute to the uv1 activity we see after egg laying. Although our results indicate that uv1 releases tyramine to inhibit the HSNs via LGC-55, this signaling event does not fully explain the ability of uv1 cells to inhibit the egg-laying circuit. We found that inhibition of egg laying by exogenous tyramine is reduced but not eliminated in <italic>lgc-55</italic> null mutants, suggesting other tyramine receptors help terminate the active state. The uv1 cells also make <italic>nlp-7</italic> and <italic>flp-11</italic>, two neuropeptides that inhibit HSN activity and egg-laying behavior (Banerjee and Francis, personal communication), and the identification of the receptors and signaling pathways through which they inhibit serotonin release will help to more fully understand how activity of the egg-laying circuit is terminated.</p><p>Every neural circuit may require specific signals to initiate activity when its function is required, signals to coordinate the dynamic activity of its various cells, and mechanisms to determine when the circuit has successfully completed its task and signal to turn off activity. Many circuits also must respond to specific signals from central pattern generators that coordinate the activity of multiple circuits. A great challenge is to reduce these abstract concepts to concrete, specific mechanisms in the case of a real circuit. For the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit, signals in each of the categories outlined above are now identified, albeit in varying levels of detail and completeness. Continuing analysis of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit using recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in behaving animals, combined with genetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological manipulation, provides a path towards detailed understanding the mechanisms that control activity of this model circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode culture, strains, and maintenance</title><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains were maintained as hermaphrodites at 20°C on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 as a source of food as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Egg-laying behavior was analyzed in six independent transgenic lines expressing LGC-55 or GFP, and one strain of each were kept for long-term storage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging</title><p>Animals were mounted between glass coverslips and chunked sections of NGM plates for imaging as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The stage and focus were adjusted manually to keep the egg-laying system in view during recording periods. Long-term recordings were cropped to 10–30 min with the first egg-laying event at 5 min. Three different imaging systems were used to collect recordings, and each gave quantitatively similar results. First, single, two-channel confocal slices (18 µm thick) of GCaMP5 and mCherry fluorescence were collected through a 20x Plan Apochromat objective (0.8NA) using a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope and recorded at 20 fps at 256 × 256 pixel resolution, 16-bit depth using a 710 Duo LIVE scanner as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Second, widefield GCaMP5 and mCherry fluorescence was imaged through a 20x Plan Apochromat objective (0.8NA) using a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope, and the GCaMP5 and mCherry fluorescence was separated using a W-View Gemini image splitter at 20 fps at 256 × 256 pixel resolution, 16-bit depth onto a single, 4 × 4 binned Hamamatsu ORCA Flash 4.0 V2 sCMOS sensor after excitation with 470 nm and 590 nm LEDs (Zeiss Colibri.2). Third, single, two-channel confocal slices (20 µm thick) of GCaMP5 and mCherry fluorescence were collected using an inverted Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with the resonant scanner running at 8000 Hz and collected at 20 fps at 256 × 256 pixel resolution, 12-bit depth after 2x digital zoom.</p><p>Quantitative ratiometric analysis was performed after importing image sequences into Volocity (Perkin Elmer). GCaMP5/mCherry ratios were calculated, and pixels with mCherry fluorescence intensities ~2 standard deviations above background were selected as objects for mean ratio measurement. While the Volocity algorithm set with these parameters typically identified the vulval muscles and uv1 cells as a single object, the complex morphology of the HSN and VC neurons often led to the cells being found as two or more objects within each video frame. These were rejoined using a custom script in MATLAB (Mathworks). The ratio of the joined object was scaled in proportion to the area of each component object to generate an area-adjusted GCaMP5/mCherry ratio. The ratio data were then smoothed using a 150 msec (three timepoint) rolling average, and the lowest 10% of the GCaMP5/mCherry ratio values over the entire recording period were averaged to establish a ∆R/R baseline. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and their features (peak amplitude and width at half-maximum) were identified from ratio traces using the <italic>findpeaks</italic> algorithm in MATLAB, and peaks were confirmed by visual inspection of GCaMP5/mCherry recordings and ratio traces. Egg-laying events were observed by allowing a small amount of bright field light to transmit into the mCherry channel whose gain was increased for egg visualization. The egg-laying active state was defined in recordings to include those transients that occurred one minute before and one minute after each egg-laying event. Those transients not found within an active state were considered to be in the inactive state. Inter-transient intervals were calculated by measuring the elapsed time between successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaks during the inactive and active state. Because some inactive states were devoid of detectable activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, VC Ca<sup>2+</sup>), inter-transient intervals during such periods were operationally defined as the time before the first or after the last transient in the recording. Because the recordings were cropped to focus on the egg-laying active state, the inactive state inter-transient intervals reported here should be considered a lower estimate. To facilitate comparisons of ∆R/R between different reporters and recording conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>), the maximum peak amplitude was normalized to 1. Spectral analysis of active phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces was performed by Fast Fourier Transform method of estimation using the Signal Analyzer app in the MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox (R2016b). Quantitatively similar results were obtained using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram function and using auto-correlation analysis (data not shown). The largest amplitude frequency peak between 0 and 250 mHz from each active state periodogram was compared using one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Locomotion phasing analysis</title><p>We recorded the position of the vulva during each sinusoidal body bend of locomotion relative to observed HSN, VC, and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We recorded the timing of each ventral contraction and/or relaxation flanking each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak. To approximate the phasing of that Ca<sup>2+</sup> relative to locomotion, we operationally defined 0° and 360° as when the vulva was positioned when the adjacent body wall muscles were at their most ventrally contracted state, and we defined 180° when the vulva was positioned when the adjacent body wall muscles were at their most relaxed state. The relative timing of each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak or behavior event was calculated as fraction of time elapsed between the previous and subsequent contraction or relaxation, regardless of whether the animal was engaged in forward or reverse locomotion, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins and Koelle, 2013</xref>). For example, if a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaked exactly 2 s after the vulva passed through its most ventrally relaxed state (180°) and 2 s prior to the ventral contracted state (360°), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient phasing would be halfway between 180° and 360°, or 270°. If a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaked halfway between ventral contraction (0°) and ventral relaxation (180°), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient phasing of that peak would be 90°. This method of estimation allows for phasing information to be extracted and compared independent of differences in individual animal speed and locomotion direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressing strains were grown in the presence or absence of the ChR2 cofactor all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal (ATR). ATR was prepared at 100 mM in 100% ethanol and stored at −20°C. To prepare NGM plates for behavior analysis, ATR was diluted to 0.4 mM with warmed cultures of OP50 bacteria in B Broth, and 200 µl of culture was seeded onto each 60 mm NGM plate. The plates were allowed to grow for 24 hr at 25–37°C, after which late L4 worms were staged onto prepared plates for behavioral assays 24 hr later. During Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, ChR2 was activated with the same light used for GCaMP5 excitation. For timed behavior recording experiments on plates, a OTPG_4 TTL Pulse Generator (Doric Optics) was used to trigger image capture (Grasshopper 3, 4.1 Megapixel, USB3 CMOS camera, Point Grey Research) and shutter opening on a EL6000 metal halide light source generating 8–16 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (depending on the magnification used) of ~470 ± 20 nm blue light via a EGFP filter set mounted on a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope.

Your article has been very favorably reviewed by two peer reviewers, including L René García (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Oliver Hobert, and a Senior Editor.</p><p>You can see the reviewers’ comments below. We will gladly accept the manuscript pending some very minor editorial revisions suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Overall I think this is a very nice paper. Egg-laying is one of the best-described <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaviors, but the mechanistic details of how specific neurons and muscles control egg-laying have not been well-understood. The authors use optical imaging of neural and muscle cell activity in behaving worms to define the roles of specific motor neurons and accessory cells in generating egg-laying events. In particular they do a nice job relating their imaging data to previous work on the behavioral timing of egg-laying. The experiments are well-controlled and thorough, and justify the authors' conclusions. I am supportive of publication more or less as is.</p><p>One comment: in several places (for example subsection “Distinct patterns of activity in the egg-laying circuit accompany the active and inactive behavior states”, second paragraph) the authors refer to &quot;rhythmic&quot; activity in various cells in the egg-laying circuit. Although the traces seem like the activity could be rhythmic (i.e. events separated by more or less periodic intervals) they do not provide evidence for this. This is particularly relevant since some earlier behavioral work has described egg-laying events within the active phase as stochastic rather than periodic. It should be straightforward to see if the intervals between neuronal spikes have a regular period or alternatively follow some sort of random distribution; either outcome would be interesting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The article, &quot;Activity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behavior circuit is controlled by competing activation and feedback inhibition,&quot; primarily uses the fluorescence changes of G-CaMP5 to detect the temporal activities of cellular components used for egg-laying behavior. The theoretical foundations for how egg-laying behavior might be executed and regulated have been proposed in many earlier reports; however, this report uses G-CaMP-mediated real time calcium imaging of unrestrained behaving hermaphrodites to validate or re-qualify these ideas, and to generate more precise temporal measurements of activities between the HSN neurons, the VC neurons, the vulva muscles and the UV1 uterine endocrine cells.</p><p>The technical execution of measuring calcium- induced G-CaMP changes (relative to stable mCherry fluorescence) in moving hermaphrodites have been described in the authors' earlier 2013 report (my lab also does a lot of calcium imaging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, albeit not in hermaphrodites, and generating this kind of data and analyzing them is not trivial). The methodology is sound and I do not have any concerns about how the experiments were conducted in this report.</p><p>In this report they use the G-CaMP imaging technology to support their idea that egg-laying behavior is coordinated with locomotion. The authors brought up this possibility in their 2013 J. Neuroscience paper, but in this study they measured several additional parameters to demonstrate that egg deposition has a higher probability of occurring when the ventral body wall muscles transitions between a relaxed and contracted state. Here they correlated the angles of worm postures with calcium transients of the HSN, VC neurons and vulva muscles with egg-laying events. What was surprising was the broad activity profiles of these excitable cells, but that only when the worm was in a specific posture (during locomotion), these cells activities correlated to an egg-laying event.</p><p>Although I know that correlation is not causation, I am excited (from a pure curiosity-loving standpoint) to see that kind of activity profile occurring in the hermaphrodite. The relationship between the specific phases in locomotion and the broad temporal activities in egg-laying components also suggested to the authors that ventral cord neurons (VA/VB) and gonadal cells are also supplying information to the HSN, VC neurons and vulva muscles. The authors followed up these interactions by perturbing other components of the egg-laying system.</p><p>Previous work has implicated that under certain laboratory conditions (such as laser-ablations, mutant backgrounds and pharmacological treatments), the HSN and VC neurons have some overlapping functions in regulating vulva muscle contractions. The authors here revisited some of these conditions using cell-targeted CH2R-activation, the <italic>egl-1(n986dm)</italic> allele and exploring tyramine signaling, to report a more detailed picture of the temporal activities of the HSN VC and vulva muscle changes relative to the locomotor and fertility state of the hermaphrodite. The work presented in these sections summarizes and clarifies some of the hypothesis made in earlier reports.</p><p>In summary, I enjoyed reading the report. I do not believe that there are any radical ideas or discoveries made in this report, but the report is a solid careful analysis of a complicated behavior. I also believe that the authors are deeply excited about understanding egg-laying behavior and very few other groups would put in the attention and detail to further our understanding of the problem. The approach of correlating HSN, VC UV1 and vulva muscle calcium activities with locomotion and egg-laying events is sound and validates hypotheses made in earlier reports by the authors and other in the field. The Discussion is well-written and summarizes the results, as-well-as raises a more mature way of thinking about how egg-laying behavior is executed in the hermaphrodite.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C, and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref> took me awhile to understand, probably because these diagrams condense a lot of information in a presentation that is not standard.
