We used event-related potentials (ERP) to test the hypothesis that infants extract crossmodal statistics implicitly while adults learn them when task relevant. Participants were passively exposed to frequent standard audio-visual combinations (A1V1, A2V2, p=0.35 each), rare recombinations of these standard stimuli (A1V2, A2V1, p=0.10 each), and a rare audio-visual deviant with infrequent auditory and visual elements (A3V3, p=0.10). While both six-month-old infants and adults differentiated between rare deviants and standards involving early neural processing stages only infants were sensitive to crossmodal statistics as indicated by a late ERP difference between standard and recombined stimuli. A second experiment revealed that adults differentiated recombined and standard combinations when crossmodal combinations were task relevant. These results demonstrate a heightened sensitivity for crossmodal statistics in infants and a change in learning mode from infancy to adulthood.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>On a crowded city street, we automatically attribute the sounds of cars to the cars we see driving past, and not to the motorcycles or trucks on the same road. Similarly, we assign the voices we hear to the pedestrians around us, and not to the dogs those pedestrians are walking. As adults, we cope with these everyday challenges effortlessly, but how do infants first learn to match what they see with what they hear?</p><p>When young animals are exposed to new stimuli, their brains undergo changes. Similar changes only occur in adult animals if they deliberately pay attention to the stimuli and if they are associated with rewards. Rohlf, Habets et al. therefore predicted that human infants would automatically learn to associate sights and sounds upon being passively exposed to them. Adults, on the other hand, would learn these associations only if explicitly asked to do so.</p><p>To test this prediction, Rohlf, Habets et al. presented tones and colored shapes to 6-month-old infants and healthy adult volunteers while using scalp electrodes to monitor the electrical activity in their brains. Certain shapes and tones occurred frequently together, whereas other combinations of the same stimuli were rare. The 6-month-olds consistently outperformed the adults in associating the tones and shapes: the electrical activity in the infant brains reliably distinguished between common versus rare combinations. Adult brains made this distinction only when the adults were asked to pay attention to the tone-shape combinations as part of a task.</p><p>This high sensitivity to combinations of sights and sounds that regularly occur together enables infants to quickly learn about the world around them. As adults will have done this previously, the most effective strategy for adults is to update their existing knowledge only when such learning enables them to achieve a goal. Further research is needed to find out what happens in the brain to cause this change in learning strategy. Understanding how learning differs in infants and adults will help identify stages of development in which the brain learns particularly easily. This may ultimately help us optimize learning strategies for individuals of different ages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>crossmodal learning</kwd><kwd>statistical learning</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>event-related potentials</kwd><kwd>age-dependent learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2009-AdG 249425 CriticalBrainChanges</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>City of Hamburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Crossmodal Learning</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Röder</surname><given-names>Brigitte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological activity indicates superior implicit crossmodal learning in infants and a change in learning mode from infancy to adulthood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>After birth infants are immediately exposed to a sensory world comprising input of multiple sensory modalities. The developing brain must adapt to the statistical properties of the sensory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiser et al., 2010</xref>) since genetically defined neural circuits are usually crude. Indeed a high sensitivity of infants to statistical regularities within single sensory systems has often been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fantz, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiser and Aslin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulf et al., 2011</xref>). The seminal study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffran et al. (1996)</xref> reported that eight-month-old infants quickly learn transitional probabilities between syllables by pure exposure to an artificial language. This ability was interpreted as a basic mechanism allowing infants to segment a language. Similar results were found for non-linguistic auditory sequences and for visual patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saffran et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiser and Aslin, 2002</xref>), demonstrating a modality independent sensitivity of infants to statistical patterns in their sensory environment which moreover is not unique to linguistic material. For example, in the visual domain, there is strong evidence that infants are able to implicitly learn subtle statistical relationships among visual objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiser and Aslin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirkham et al., 2002</xref>). Nine-month-old infants who were exposed to multi element visual scenes, showed greater interest in element pairs which co-occurred more frequently than in pairs which co-occurred less frequently. Moreover, the infants were sensitive to the predictability between elements of the pairs as manifested by the conditional probability relations between these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiser and Aslin, 2002</xref>). The ability to extract statistical patterns of visual stimuli was found even in younger age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirkham et al., 2002</xref>); two-, five-, and eight-month-old infants were habituated to sequences of discrete visual stimuli whose ordering followed a statistical predictable pattern. Subsequently the infants were shown the previously encountered pattern alternating with a novel pattern of identical stimulus components. Infants of all age groups looked longer at the novel sequences providing evidence for the detection of visual statistical regularities at an early developmental stage. These results suggest that infants own powerful mechanisms for extracting the statistical properties of their sensory input without any instructions, explicit feedback, or intentional awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lany and Saffran, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krogh et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The ability of infants to detect crossmodal statistical regularities within their sensory environment is less well understood, but some basic multisensory abilities, such as multisensory temporal synchrony detection seem to exist within the first month of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewkowicz, 1992</xref>). In the next months the capability to perceive higher-level and more complex multisensory relations starts to develop. For example, at the age of six months infants were shown to perceive duration-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewkowicz, 1992</xref>) and spatio-temporal based crossmodal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheier et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that similar to adults, infants take advantage of crossmodal events in terms of a better discrimination and a faster responsiveness to bimodal compared to unimodal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahrick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewkowicz and Kraebel, 2004</xref>). First evidence for multisensory facilitation was found in eight-month-old infants as indicated by faster eye movements to spatially aligned auditory and visual cues compared to eye movements to each of these stimuli alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neil et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, other studies revealed multisensory benefits for perceptual learning in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahrick and Lickliter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2009</xref>). Five-month-old infants were habituated to either an audio-visual rhythm or the same rhythm presented unimodally. In the crossmodal condition, infants were able to discriminate between the familiar and a novel rhythm, whereas no discrimination was observed for the unimodal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahrick and Lickliter, 2000</xref>). Corresponding results were found for the learning of an abstract rule in five-month-old infants: they were able to learn the sequence if defined by redundant visual shapes and speech sounds but not if only one sensory modality was involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that infants are able to learn and use associations between auditory and visual stimuli. However, it must be taken into account that the multisensory effects in infants were not tested against statistical facilitation (probability summation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller, 1982</xref>).</p><p>Several studies on crossmodal association learning have reported that infants at the age of three months, but not younger, were able to learn specific voice-face combinations; infants were habituated to different unfamiliar voice-face pairings. In the post-familiarization test the infants showed higher attention to the learned voice-face pairs as compared to the novel combinations. The latter category comprised a voice and a face they had heard and seen previously, but the combination of the voice and face was new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brookes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrick et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to test whether infants are able to learn crossmodal associations between arbitrary auditory and visual stimuli. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emberson et al. (2015)</xref> used an audio-visual omission paradigm with six-month-old infants and found similar visual cortex activation as a response to an auditory stimulus alone, which had been previously combined with a visual stimulus, as for the presentation of the same visual stimulus. The authors interpreted their findings as evidence for top-down mechanisms to be in place as early as six month of age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al. (2015)</xref> exposed twelve-month-old infants to pictures of faces paired with one sound and pictures of flowers paired with a second sound. During the test phase the sound preceded the visual stimulus and was either congruent or incongruent with the learned combinations (additionally no sound was used in one third of the trials). An enhanced early positive ERP for congruent visual stimuli as well as an enhanced late negative ERP for incongruent visual stimuli were found. Both studies demonstrate that infants are able to learn crossmodal combinations to which they were exposed. However, none of these studies used an adult control group. Thus, it remains an open question of whether developmental and adult crossmodal learning recruit similar mechanisms. In this context it is interesting to notice that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janacsek et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated superior implicit statistical learning of visual sequences in young children (&lt;12 years) compared to older children and adults; a follow-up study indicated that this advantage was lost when they became more reliant on explicit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nemeth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on non-human animal studies it has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keuroghlian and Knudsen, 2007</xref>) that developmental and adult plasticity, and thus learning, differ due to different brain states: during the sensitive phase molecular mechanisms dominate that allow for quick and extensive functional and structural synaptic plasticity (synaptogenesis, synaptic strengthening and elimination) allowing the emergence of a functional adaptive connectivity. By contrast, in adulthood these functionally tuned and to some degree stabilized neural circuits undergo adaptations when relevant to the system. Such age dependent changes from developmental to adult plasticity are impressively demonstrated by a study on auditory cortex plasticity in rats: while passive exposure to sounds of a specific frequency results in a permanent reorganization of auditory cortex during the sensitive phase, adult rats reorganized only those aspects of the auditory cortex which were task relevant: for example, rats were exposed to sounds which varied both in sound frequency and level. When they had to discriminate the sounds with respect to sound frequency the frequency representation of auditory cortex changed while the level representation changed when level rather than sound frequency was task relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Villers-Sidani et al., 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that adult learning depend to a larger degree on attention and context such as task relevance and reward expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keuroghlian and Knudsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riedel and Burton (2006)</xref> who investigated whether learning of auditory sequences is influenced by task demands; when using a serial reaction time task related to a feature of the auditory stimulus they found learning effects in adult participants while a passive exposure did not result in learning. Similarly, the statistical relations of concurrently presented visual streams were only learned by adults for the attended but not for the unattended streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turk-Browne et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emberson et al. (2011)</xref> extended these findings by providing evidence in adults that attention was necessary for implicit statistical learning in both the visual and auditory modality.</p><p>In the present study we investigated multisensory associative learning in infants and adults to test the hypothesis that infants as young as six months are not only able to learn arbitrary auditory-visual associations but that their sensitivity to crossmodal statistics is even higher compared to adults when crossmodal associations are passively encountered. Thus, in the first experiment we included a group of six-month-old infants (Experiment 1a) and a group of young adults (Experiment 1b). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we presented two frequently occurring audio-visual standard combinations (A1V1, A2V2, p=0.35 each, ‘Frequent standard stimuli’), two rare recombinations of the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ (A1V2, A2V1, p=0.10 each, ‘Rare recombined stimuli’) and one rare audio-visual combination of an infrequent auditory and an infrequent visual stimulus (A3V3, p=0.10, ‘Rare deviant stimuli’). Recombining the auditory and visual elements of the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ controls for the likelihood of the auditory and visual elements of the employed crossmodal stimuli. Thus, in order to detect ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ it is necessary to have learned the precise crossmodal combination. By contrast, the likelihood of both the visual and the auditory elements of ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ were lower than for all other auditory and visual elements. Therefore, the present experimental design allowed us to differentiate between the processing of the likelihood of sensory elements (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare deviant stimuli’) and the processing of the conditional probabilities of crossmodal combinations (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare recombined stimuli’).</p><p>We predicted ERP differences between the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ in both infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheour et al., 2000</xref>) und adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schröger and Wolff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Näätänen and Alho, 1995</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesized that only infants display an ERP difference for ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ due to a higher sensitivity to crossmodal statistics during infancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>In Experiment 1 we investigated a group of infants (Experiment 1a) and a group of young adults (Experiment 1b) with the same experimental design.

Only infants displayed a significant ERP deviant effect for ‘Rare recombined stimuli’. By contrast, both groups showed at a relatively earlier time epoch a ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ effect, suggesting that the overall experimental power had been sufficient to detect ERP deviant effects. In fact, the effect size for the ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ effects was smaller, both in infants (<italic>d</italic> = 0.65) and adults (<italic>d</italic> = 0.63), than the effect size for the ERP effects comparing ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ in infants (<italic>d</italic> = 0.73). Thus, since smaller effects (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare deviant stimuli’) than the missing effect (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare recombined stimuli’) were detected in adults, it seems justified to conclude that the null effect in adults was not caused by a lack of power. Nevertheless, we ran a second Experiment (Experiment 2a) to replicate with a more adequate design for adults the lack of learning arbitrary crossmodal conditional probabilities when they were not related to a task. Moreover, in an additional experiment (Experiment 2b) we tested the requirements for adult learning of crossmodal statistics. We will discuss the results of Experiment 1a and 1b in light of the results of these additional experiments in the general Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>As we did not find any ERP difference between ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ in the adult group in Experiment 1b, we ran a second study in adults comprising two experiments, in which we systematically manipulated the task relevance of crossmodal combinations. Both experiments were very similar to Experiment 1 but comprised essential adaptations: (a) to enhance the power of the experiment, we increased the number of trials; (b) in Experiment 2a we included a fourth visual stimulus (V4), which had to be detected by participants (target) while all other stimuli remained task irrelevant: This manipulation guaranteed that participants attended the stimuli; (c) in Experiment 2b one of the ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ (either A1V2 or A2V1) served as the target: this manipulation rendered crossmodal combinations task relevant to the participants.

Two recent studies addressing crossmodal statistical learning found that six-month and twelve-month-old infants learned to predict a visual stimulus based on a preceding auditory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emberson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al., 2015</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that infants at the age of twelve months were able to learn an association between an arbitrary sound and a visual object category (faces vs. flowers), they did not include an adult control group and were thus not able to demonstrate differences in learning between adults and infants, nor were they able to distinguish processes related to the detection of crossmodal combinations and processes related to the familiarity with certain sensory elements.</p><p>Thus, the present study extends previous research by showing that the conditional probabilities of crossmodal combinations were extracted by infants as young as six months after a short exposure period while adults failed to learn crossmodal statistics under this condition. It is important to notice that we controlled for the likelihood of the auditory and visual elements of the employed crossmodal stimuli by infrequently recombining the auditory and visual elements of the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’. We provide ERP evidence demonstrating that the processing of the conditional probabilities of crossmodal combinations and the processing of the likelihood of sensory elements can be dissociated: in infants, ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ elicited a left negative potential starting at about 420 ms post-stimulus while ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ elicited a right lateralized positivity starting at 200 ms post-stimulus (Experiment 1a). Adults tested under identical conditions were only sensitive to ‘Rare deviant stimuli’, which differed from ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ in the frequency of their auditory and visual elements (Experiment 1b, ERP effect starting 180 ms post-stimulus) but not for rare crossmodal stimuli which only differed from the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ in the way the auditory and visual elements were combined. These results demonstrate that infants were able to learn arbitrary crossmodal associations as early as six months of age and thus much earlier than suggested by the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al. (2015)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emberson et al., 2015</xref>). This finding is in line with behavioral studies employing natural stimuli, which showed that infants from three months onwards were able to learn specific face-voice-parings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brookes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrick et al., 2005</xref>). Our results extended these behavioral findings by providing first evidence that the learning of crossmodal statistics in infancy is particularly sensitive and superior to adults when crossmodal stimuli are not task relevant. It could be argued that the signal to noise ratio of the ERPs in adults was not sufficient in Experiment 1b to demonstrate crossmodal learning in the adult group. However, such an account is highly unlikely given that an effect of smaller size were detected in Experiment 1b and the fact, that in Experiment 2a an ERP difference between ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ was not significant either despite a much higher signal to noise ratio in comparison to Experiment 1b.</p><p>Thus, our results provide evidence that crossmodal statistics are better implicitly learned in the developing than in the adult system. An enhanced sensitivity for low-level statistical patterns during development compared to adulthood has been reported by other studies as well. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janacsek et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nemeth et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that children are superior in implicit statistical learning of sequences compared to adults but later lose this advantage and become more reliant on explicit learning. A similar developmental time course was found in a study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jost et al., 2011</xref>, who had investigated the neurophysiological correlates of visual statistical learning in children and adults: children showed learning related ERP effects earlier in the acquisition phase than the adult group indicating that they had quicker acquired the statistical structurer. It is, however, important to notice that not all studies investigating statistical learning during development have found enhanced learning performance in infants or children as compared to adults. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffran et al. (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">1999</xref>) reported similar abilities in eight-month-old infants and adults in the extraction of the underlying statistical structure of auditory sequences. Other studies observed better learning for older children and young adults than in younger age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maybery et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirkham et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arciuli and Simpson (2011)</xref> tested children between the age of 5 and 12 years in a visual triplet learning task and reported better learning with increasing age. At first glance, these findings seem to be at odds with the present results. However, a closer look at the employed paradigms suggests that these different outcomes might be related to the complexity of the implemented statistical patterns. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arciuli and Simpson (2011)</xref> tested the incidental learning of four visual base triples which draws to a much larger extend from working memory than learning the conditional probability of two audio-visual combinations as used in the present and previous crossmodal learning studies in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emberson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it is well known that working memory improves during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zelazo et al., 2008</xref>) and thus working memory demands might have been the limiting factor in some studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arciuli and Simpson, 2011</xref>). In addition, triples are usually embedded in a continuous stream while the crossmodal stimuli of the present study were individually presented with relatively long interstimulus intervals, thereby clearly demarking the individual events. Furthermore, studies have revealed that the ability to extract statistical patterns from sensory input during infancy improves from the simple tracking of event probabilities early in the development (from three months onwards, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fantz, 1964</xref>) to the learning of more complex and higher-level statistical patterns at a later developmental stage (from twelve months onwards, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gómez and Maye, 2005</xref>). Thus, what most likely declines during development seems to be the sensitivity to simple conditional probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janacsek et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janacsek et al. (2012)</xref> speculated that a decline in the sensitivity to ‘base probabilities’ is necessary for the acquisition of higher order representations and a switch to model-based (in contrast to model-free) learning.</p><p>In line with this suggestion, adults did not learn crossmodal statistics when they were irrelevant for the task but became sensitive to them when a specific crossmodal combination was of behavioral relevance. Studies in non-human animals have suggested that during the sensitive phase, neural networks are elaborated in response to a pure exposure to the environment while during later development and in adulthood learning is context-specific and depends on task relevance (e.g. reward) and instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keuroghlian and Knudsen, 2007</xref>). Currently, we can only speculate about the neural underpinnings of the age-dependent neuroplasticity as observed in the present study. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke (2015)</xref> feedforward connectivity seems to be to a larger degree genetically determined than feedback connectivity and the latter seems to be mostly experience dependent. The detection of ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ was associated with a relatively late ERP effect in both infants and adults. Indeed, multisensory binding has been found to rely on later processing stages in adults and the involvement of feedback connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruns and Röder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonath et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emberson et al. (2015)</xref> provided evidence that the crossmodal connectivity is at least partially in place at the age of six months. Here we speculate that this initial crossmodal connectivity might even be more extensive in the developing brain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johannsen and Röder, 2014</xref>) and thus might be the neural underpinning of the enhanced sensitivity to simple crossmodal statistics in development which allows for quicker and a passive learning during infancy. We further assume in line with the ‘multisensory perceptual narrowing’ idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewkowicz and Ghazanfar, 2006</xref>) that experience narrows down the initial crossmodal connectivity by eliminating non-confirmed connections while elaborating connections which are useful for an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johannsen and Röder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewkowicz, 2014</xref>). These functionally tuned networks (including the experience dependent feedback connectivity) constitute models of the sensory world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiser et al., 2010</xref>). Their elaboration might go together with a switch towards model-based learning which is characterized by a larger context dependency. As some parts of the neural networks stabilize, learning must partially involve additional neural systems to guarantee that the adaptations necessary throughout life are realized without risking the loss of essential crossmodal knowledge. For example, prism wearing during the sensitive phase has been reported to change the connectivity between the central (ICC) and external (ICX) inferior colliculus of the auditory midbrain of barn owls. By contrast, crossmodal adaptation to prisms later in the critical period seems to be mediated by a reorganization of the optical tectum to which the ICX projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knudsen, 2002</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergan et al. (2005)</xref> reported that crossmodal adaptions to prims were enhanced in adult owls when they were allowed to hunt, that is, when such adaptations were particular needed. In accord with these findings in owls, we demonstrated that adult learning of crossmodal combinations depended on task relevance (Experiment 2b). Thus, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keuroghlian and Knudsen (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavelier et al. (2010)</xref>, neuroplasticity in adults seem to require to a larger extend attention and behavioral relevance and thus the involvement of additional higher order neural systems. Task relevance or attention constitute specific top-down influences on sensory representations and are thus mediated via the feedback connections which become progressively tuned and elaborated during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present study was able to dissociate the processes for the learning of probabilities of sensory elements and for the learning of conditional probabilities of the sensory elements comprising crossmodal stimuli. All groups were sensitive to ‘Rare deviant stimuli’. To detect ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ the frequency of sensory elements rather than conditional probabilities had to be traced. Indeed, it was possible to detect ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ only based on one of the two sensory elements. The ERP effect to ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ started earlier than the ERP effects to ‘Rare recombined stimuli’. Such early deviant effects are typical for an auditory mismatch negativity (MMN, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schröger and Wolff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheour et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the observed ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ effect, similarly as has been proposed for the MMN reflects, indicates a sensory memory trace, which represents the frequency of sensory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Näätänen and Alho, 1995</xref>). By contrast, the detection of conditional probabilities of crossmodal stimuli cannot be based on such (unisensory) sensory memory traces. Thus, we speculate that the detection of ‘Rare deviant stimuli’, is based on modality specific systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frost et al., 2015</xref>). Although it has been reported that auditory mismatch responses are enhanced by redundant crossmodal (somatosensory) information in adults such a multisensory enhancement was only observed for later time epochs (&gt;200 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler et al., 2012</xref>) than the first ‘Rare deviant stimulus’ effect of the present study.</p><p>Since we argue that the change in learning mode during development is related to functional specialization, the strong lateralization of both ERP effects in infants seems rather surprising. The differentiation of ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ requires the detection of conditional probabilities. This ability has been postulated as a precursor of language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffran et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown with structural imaging techniques that many hemispheric asymmetries, in particular those related to the language system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friederici, 2009</xref>), exist at birth or shortly thereafter (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dehaene-Lambertz and Spelke, 2015</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the strong left lateralized ERP difference between ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ might reflects a recruitment of similar neural circuits that have been proposed to enable the detection of word boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffran et al., 1996</xref>), non-adjacent transitional probabilities and possibly syntactical rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friederici, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friederici et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, this neural system might, partially independently of sensory modality and domain, allow for detecting any type of statistical relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuhl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslin and Newport, 2014</xref>). In fact, a correlation of syntactic competence and statistical learning skills in children has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kidd and Arciuli, 2016</xref>). The right lateralized ERP effect to ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ was not unique to the infant group, but was as well observed in the adults tested with the same passive design (Experiment 1b). Interestingly such a lateralization was neither found for Experiment 2a nor for Experiment 2b, in which the adult participants were actively engaged in a task. We speculate that ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ elicited a reflexive and exogenous attention shift to the rare sensory features. Such reflexive spatial attention orienting has often been associated with right parietal brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mort et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chica et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, in Experiment 2a and 2b, participants had to allocate attention to a specific stimulus or stimulus combination and it was adaptive to avoid exogenous attention shifts.</p><p>In the present study ERP effects in adults were of different polarity and had a shorter latency compared to the infant group. We linked ERP effects in infants and adults based on the experimental manipulations and their relative timing. Due to the immature brain (e.g. incomplete myelination) of infants and children it is a common finding that absolute latencies of ERP effects are longer in the developing brain. Moreover, it has repeatedly been reported that polarities of effects differ in infancy or children and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kouider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neville et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Haan and Halit, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that six-month old infants were able to quickly learn crossmodal statistics through a mere passive exposure, whereas adults learned the same crossmodal combinations only when they were task relevant. Thus, we provide first evidence for a higher sensitivity for crossmodal statistics in infants compared to adults, indicating age-dependent mechanisms for the learning of arbitrary crossmodal combinations. We speculate that initial passive association learning allows infants to quickly form first internal models of their sensory environment. In adulthood these internal models are adjusted if this is behavioral adaptive.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants: Experiment 1a</title><p>Sixty-two six-month-old infants (±10 days) took part. Infants were recruited from the local registration offices. All participating infants were born full-term (38–41 weeks), had a typical prenatal and perinatal history and no known neurological or developmental problems. Parents gave their written consent and were informed about their right to abort the experiment at any time. They received a small present for their children (toy or picture book) for taking part. Thirty-three participants were excluded from the analyses because of too many artifacts in the EEG recordings, leaving a total of twenty-nine data sets for the final statistical analyses (17 female, 12 male). Note that an exclusion rate of approximately 50% due to artifacts is not uncommon in infant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeBoer et al., 2007</xref>).

The visual and auditory stimuli were always simultaneously presented. All three auditory stimuli had the equal loudness but differed in sound frequency (400, 1000 or 1600 Hz); they were presented for 500 ms each via two loudspeakers. The visual stimuli consisted of three geometric shapes (circle, triangle, and square; size: 10°) combined with three different colors (green, red, and blue) and were presented in the middle of a computer screen for 500 ms.</p><p>Participants were exposed to two frequently occurring audio-visual standard combinations (A1V1, A2V2, each with p=0.35, ‘Frequent standard stimuli’) and three infrequently occurring audio-visual deviant combinations. The latter consisted of (1) two rare recombinations of the auditory and visual stimuli comprising the ‘Standard stimuli’ (A1V2, A2V1, each with p=0.10, ‘Rare recombined stimuli’) and (2) one rare audio-visual combination of a deviant auditory and a deviant visual stimulus (A3V3, p=0.10, ‘Rare deviant stimuli’), not occurring in the combinations of the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ and the recombined stimuli. Due to the recombining of the auditory and visual elements of the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’, the likelihood of the auditory and visual elements comprising the ‘Frequent Standard stimuli’ and the ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ were identical. By contrast, ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ consisted of auditory and visual elements, which had an overall lower likelihood. Thus, it was possible to distinguish processes related to the likelihood of sensory elements (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare deviant stimuli’) and processes related to the detection of crossmodal combinations (‘Frequent standard stimuli’ vs. ‘Rare recombined stimuli’).</p><p>The inter stimulus interval between the different crossmodal stimuli amounted to 1500 ms. The visual and auditory stimuli used for each crossmodal condition was consistently for each participant but was counterbalanced over participants. The experiment was divided into five experimental blocks, each comprising 60 trials resulting in a total of 300 trials. For each block the proportion of the three conditions was 70: 20: 10% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

During the experiment, the infants sat on their parents’ laps. The computer screen, displaying the visual stimuli, was positioned on a table at a distance of approximately 60 cm from the participants. Infants’ heads were aligned with the center of the screen. The two loud speakers were positioned behind the computer screen.</p><p>To make sure that the infants attentively observed the stimuli, a black and white video was continuously played in the background. This video consisted of 30 different sequences of centrally moving patterns, e.g. randomly moving stars or flying balloons focusing the viewing direction to the center of the computer screen. All sequences were ten seconds long and were presented without intermediate breaks. To control whether the infants were actually looking at the computer screen when the experimental visual stimuli were presented, a small camera, placed on top of the computer screen, recorded the infants’ heads. The camera was connected to the EEG recording computer to enable a continuous control of the child’s attention as well as the EEG signal during the course of the experiment. If the infant did not look at the screen during the presentation of the stimuli, a marker was manually inserted by the experimenter in the EEG data file and the associated EEG segments were later taken out of the analysis. To avoid interfering signals, parents were instructed not to talk to their children during the time the EEG was recorded. Whenever the infant showed signs of discomfort or restlessness, the experiment was paused. Occasionally, a hand puppet was used during such breaks to keep the infants alert and to make sure that they attended to the computer screen when the experiment was continued. The EEG recording only continued if both the child and the parent were content. The testing time for all infants ranged between five and ten minutes (M = 7.2 min, SD = 1.6).

EEG Data were recorded continuously using a band-pass filter of 0.01–250 with a sampling rate of 500 Hz (Brain Products, Munich, Germany). The electrode FPz served as online reference electrode and the ground electrode was applied at AF3. Data were re-referenced offline to the average of the recordings of electrodes TP9 and TP10, which are located close to the mastoids. Artifacts were rejected manually after visual inspection of each individual EEG trial. Trials with artifacts such as head movements, eye blinks, eye movements or electrical noises were removed from further analyses. The first 15 trials of each dataset were excluded since the participants were not yet familiarized with the relative proportions of each stimulus condition. Noisy channels were interpolated by calculating the average of the four adjacent electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Picton et al., 2000</xref>). On average, three electrodes were interpolated for each participant.

In contrast to Experiment 1b, adults were engaged in a task and had to detect a target stimulus rather than being passively exposed to a sequence of crossmodal stimuli. The target stimulus was either unrelated to the crossmodal combinations (Experiment 2a) or addressed a specific crossmodal combinations (Experiment 2b), resulting in two different experiments.</p><p>In Experiment 2a the ‘Frequent standard stimuli’ (A1V1, A2V2) were presented with a probability of p=0.30 each while the ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ (A1V2, A2V1) and ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ (A3V3) had a probability of p=0.10 each. An additional unimodal visual stimulus (p=0.10, V4) served as target stimulus (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>). We used an additional unimodal stimulus as target to guarantee that participants were attending the stimuli. A visual rather than an auditory or crossmodal stimulus was used as target stimulus to guarantee that participants did not close their eye and to render crossmodal stimuli totally task irrelevant in Experiment 2a.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28166.011</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Experimental design of (A) Experiment

unimodal V4 was included, but one of the ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ (either A1V2 or A2V1) was defined as the target stimulus rendering crossmodal combinations task relevant. A1V1 and A2V2 were presented with a probability of p=0.35 each while the probability for A1V2, A2V1, and A3V3 was p=0.10 each (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4B</xref>). All participants took part in both experiments. The order of the two experiments as well as the specific audio-visual combinations used for the different conditions were counterbalanced over participants. However, the assignment of auditory-visual combinations to conditions was kept the same for each participant in Experiment 2a and 2b. Stimuli were presented in six blocks with 200 trials per block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment took place in a dimly lit, sound-attenuating, and electrical shielded room. The participants were seated in a comfortable chair at a table approximately 85 cm from the box that contained the visual LED. The target stimulus was presented three times prior to the start of the experiment, to allow participants to get acquainted with the target. Responses to the target stimuli were made by means of a custom made button box, placed near the dominant hand. Participants were instructed to sit as still as possible and to keep their eyes focused on the LED. Experiment 2a and 2b lasted for twenty to thirty minutes each (including breaks). The total testing time, which included briefing of the participant, practice trails and EEG application, was approximately 1 hr and 45 min for both experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>All button presses within 100 and 1000 ms following stimulus presentation were considered as valid responses. Hit, miss and false alarm rates were calculated and average reaction times to targets were derived for both Experiment 2a and 2b.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Electrophysiological recording and data analysis</title><p>EEG data were collected from 74 scalp sites using active Ag/AgCl electrodes (Brain Products, Easycap GmBH, Herrsching) mounted on an elastic cap (Electro Cap International, Inc.). Data were recorded continuously using a band-pass filter of 0.01–250 with a sampling rate of 500 Hz (Brain Products, Munich, Germany). The electrodes were placed according to the international 10–10 system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One additional electrode was positioned below the left eye to record vertical eye movements. A left earlobe electrode served as online reference electrode. EEG data were filtered offline with a low-pass filter with a 40 Hz cut-off and were re-referenced offline to an average reference. Electrodes positioned close to the outer canthi of each eye (F9 and F10) served for recording horizontal eye movements. An independent component analysis (ICA) was run for each EEG data set, which defined 30 time-independent components representing the data (Makeig, Debener, Onton &amp; Delorme, 2004). Components representing artifacts such as eye blinks, eye movements, electrical noise or heart beat were manually detected and rejected from further analyses. The first 75 trials (Experiment 2a and 2b) or the first 15 trials (Experiment 1b) of each dataset were excluded since the participants were not yet familiarized with the relative proportions of each stimulus condition. The lateral electrodes were grouped into six clusters for each hemisphere; each cluster comprised five electrodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): (1) Frontal (F): F1, F3, F5, F7, F9 (2) Fronto-central (FC): FC1, FC3, FC5, FT7, FT9 (3) Central (C): C1, C3, C5, T7 (4) Centro-parietal (CP): CP1, CP3, CP5, TP7, TP9 (5) Parietal (P): P1, P3, P5, P7, P9 (6) Parieto-occipital (PO): PO3, PO7, PO9, O1, O9) and for the right hemisphere: (1) Frontal (F): F2, F4, F6, F8, F10 (2) Fronto-central (FC): FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, FT10 (3) Central(C): C2, C4, C6, T8 (4) Centro-parietal (CP): CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, TP10 (5) Parietal (P): P2, P4, P6, P8, P10 (6) Parieto-occipital (PO): PO4, PO8, PO10, O2, O10). The midline electrodes Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, POz, and Oz were separately analyzed. EEG data were segmented into epochs starting 100 ms before the stimulus onset and lasting for 1000 ms post stimulus onset. Epochs were baseline corrected with a pre-stimulus interval of 100 ms. Mean amplitudes were calculated separately for each condition and participant for the following time epochs based on visual inspection of the group mean average: (1) 80–160 ms and (2) 250–850 ms. The statistical analyses were the same as described for Experiment 1a.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28166.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Electrode placement for Experiment 2a and 2b; the grey electrodes were included in the statistical analyses.</title><p>Clusters are indicated by black connecting lines and were named according to their location along the anterior-posterior axis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-28166-fig6-v2"/></fig></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC-2009-AdG 249425 CriticalBrainChanges) and grant ‘Crossmodal Learning’ of the City of Hamburg.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall the three reviewers are positive on the experimental design and the interesting findings. However, each reviewer has concerns about the manuscript many of which concern the analyses of the ERP data but also the theoretical framing and interpretation of the Results section.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Each reviewer raises largely unique concerns but that are convergent on (a) the soundness of selection criteria for the ERP analyses (reviewer #1: time-window selection; reviewer #3: ROIs, baseline); (b) the justification and power for the adult ERP studies (reviewer #2); (c) the interpretation and theoretical framing of largely null findings in the adult ERPs (reviewer #1 and #2). Reviewers #2 and #3 also provide suggestions for rewriting and reorganizing the manuscript that will aid the reader and also make the manuscript more suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors present 4 experiments (3 adults, 1 infants) examining statistical learning of audio-visual stimuli in infants and adults. Their experimental design allows them to examine both learning for the basic frequency of audiovisual stimuli (standard vs. deviant stimuli) and also the recombinations of audiovisual stimuli (standard vs. recombined stimuli). They find evidence of robust and consistent ERP signatures of the former type of learning across ages and experiments. However, while they find evidence of the latter type of learning in infants in a single experiment, they find evidence of differential neural responses across standard vs. recombined stimuli only in the last experiment in adults. Overall, the study is very interesting and a timely and theoretically-central topic. However, the results particularly for the emergence of this audiovisual combination learning in adults is weaker without clear justification for why this type of learning is similar to what is being demonstrated in infants. Moreover, the theoretical explanation of the specific pattern of phenomena reported is at times not explicitly reasoned and at others is not clearly consistent, even within the paper.</p><p>Reconcile the argument for better infant learning in this paper with evidence that, particularly for visual SL, there are well-documented increased in SL abilities across childhood (e.g. Arciuli &amp; Simpson, 2011). In the Discussion section, the authors do mention that some studies have found better learning in older than younger children and that it could be that greater complexity is better learned at older ages. This also runs contrary to the current findings where it is the more complex aspect of learning that is better in infants than adults.</p><p>The authors present an argument that learning would be more passive in infants and more active or task-relevant in adults. However, their hypotheses are really about learning standard vs. deviant as opposed to crossmodal associations. The referenced theoretical paper from the Knudsen group is simply about auditory learning and doesn't make assumptions about cross-modal learning per se. Why would the authors hypothesize this dissociation between passive vs. task-relevant learning across these different types of learning (standard/deviant VS. cross-modal associations)?</p><p>Feedback vs. feedforward. If standard vs. deviants are more consistent with feedforward connections and crossmodal associations are more consistent with feedback. It could be evidence of greater feedback, crossmodal connectivity in infants. This is very indirect evidence (the authors are clear that it is speculative) but it is not clear how it is consistent with the authors claim that feedback connections are better tuned later in development (as per Dehaene-Lambertz &amp; Spelke, 2015) and thus would support less learning. It is not clear how these two views are consistent especially given that the cross-modal associations are learnable when they are task-relevant: Task-relevance presumably doesn't create broader feedback connectivity.</p><p>Analyses:</p><p>Visual inspection was used to select different time-windows for analysis even across experiments where the stimuli were identical (Experiments 2A and 2B) and indeed even the participants were identical. Is there an independent justification for selecting different time-windows beyond visual inspection? Would the same results obtain with identical time-windows across the two experiments?</p><p>Differences between frequent vs. deviant-recombined stimuli were with a more negative response in infants that is late vs. a more positive response in adults. why do the authors conclude that these are equivalent or evidence of a similar learning mechanism?</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>Early discrimination of standard vs. deviant stimuli. Consider in relation to Kouider et al., 2015 where early components were modulated by cross-modal associations.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors report that 6-month-old infants rapidly learn cross-modal associations implicitly, while in adults there is no evidence of such learning unless the particular associations are explicitly attended to. This is an impressive study with interesting and important results which add to our knowledge of the organisation of human multisensory processing and learning. I have only minor comments, generally related to structure and presentation.</p><p>The plan of experiments and results is rather hard to follow and keep in mind. We get methods for multiple experiments using slightly different setups, then a lot of different results (which are not interpreted/summarised in an interim way), before discussion. The rationale for the specific design (why we have those particular three conditions) is nowhere spelled out either. It is a clever design, and a good choice by the authors, but the authors should take some time to explain the logic behind their choice (why these conditions) in the Introduction or Materials and methods section. E.g. there is clearly logic behind matching the (low) frequencies of the &quot;rare recombined&quot; and &quot;deviant&quot; stimuli but the point of this manipulation is never explicitly explained or discussed.</p><p>I would suggest a few things to make the paper more accessible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) presenting the experiments as a sequence – with 2A and 2B as follow-ups after interim conclusions based on Experiment 1, rather than the (not very plausible to me) suggestion in intro that they were all planned and predicted from the outset, as if Experiments 2A and 2B were run without knowing any results from Experiment 1. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref>) as suggested above, explaining rationale for the choice of different conditions and how they are matched (e.g. in terms of probability) more clearly when these are introduced. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">3</xref>) Within the Results section, add some interim summaries of what each set of results/analyses has shown (&quot;In summary…&quot;). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">4</xref>) Consider some kind of table or other way of summarising the results of the different analyses. I found myself writing the 3 condition names (FS / RR / RD) for each analysis and joining these with lines to show where some differed – one easily visualisable outcome from this is that many clusters / epochs / ages show a FS-RD difference whereas the FS-RR difference (of most interest) is much rarer. A high-level table or visualisation that makes this clear would be helpful.</p><p>My other substantive comment is on power of the adult vs infant analysis to find the effects of interest – this is mentioned in the Discussion section, but the argument would be more convincing with a quantitative treatment (e.g. comparing the size of effect that was detected successfully with adults with the size of effect that was seen in infants but not detected in adults).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors show that infants can learn a cross-modal predictive mapping implicitly while adults can only learn when the mapping is task-relevant, demonstrating superior cross-modal plasticity in infants.</p><p>This is potentially an interesting finding although the paper does not strike me as being optimally written for <italic>eLife</italic>. The paper is very long, structured like a classical experimental psychology paper and contains many details, which is not the standard for this kind of papers in <italic>eLife</italic>. I would strongly recommend shortening it and maybe presenting it as a brief article because at the end the main message is lost in many details which are much less relevant.</p><p>Another major issue is the design and analysis of the data. As I understand it, the baseline correction is made out of the period just preceding the visual stimulus. This would mean that it includes auditory potentials. The baseline should be subtracted in the period before the whole pair of stimuli, otherwise the visual ERPs will necessarily be contaminated by the (inverse of) the auditory potentials. This might fully explain the effect induced by the rare deviant stimuli condition, where there was also a new auditory stimulus (A3).</p><p>Another issue is about the region of interest approach. Because the analysis is made on the visual stimuli, one might expect a focus on visual electrodes and their modulation as a function of condition. For infants, the cluster CP seems to show an effect, but it does not appear on the figures of the ERPs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28166.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors present 4 experiments (3 adults, 1 infants) examining statistical learning of audio-visual stimuli in infants and adults.

In the revised manuscript we discuss this idea in more detail. We link the ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ effect to a typical mismatch negativity (MMN) which was related to a sensory memory trace. We discuss that likely intramodal processing was sufficient to detect ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ (Discussion section). By contrast, ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ could only be detected based on the crossmodal statistics which involved knowledge of conditional probabilities of the auditory and visual elements. We consider both processes as qualitatively distinct rather than more or less complex. Actually, the crossmodal statistics or conditional probabilities were relatively simple compared to e.g. the visual and auditory sequences used by Aciuli &amp; Simpson, 2011. Thus, more complex rules and a higher number of possible sequences seem to be better learned the older the children are. Working memory (WM) may be an involved factor. Simple crossmodal associations of two auditory and two visual stimuli as used in the present study unlikely touch the limits of WM. This discussion has been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present an argument that learning would be more passive in infants and more active or task-relevant in adults. However, their hypotheses are really about learning standard vs. deviant as opposed to crossmodal associations. The referenced theoretical paper from the Knudsen group is simply about auditory learning and doesn't make assumptions about cross-modal learning per se. Why would the authors hypothesize this dissociation between passive vs. task-relevant learning across these different types of learning (standard/deviant VS. cross-modal associations)?</p></disp-quote><p>Detecting ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ required that participants kept track of the probability of sensory elements, while detecting ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ involved the learning of conditional probabilities across sensory systems. An unimodal experiment with an analogous design as employed in the present study would be necessary to test whether the enhanced sensitivity of infants can be observed for simple conditional probabilities in general or whether it is specific for crossmodal conditional probabilities. The Knudsen lab indeed provided evidence that task relevance enhances crossmodal learning. (Bergan et al., 2005). Though this study on prism adaptation is cited in Keuroghlian &amp; Knudsen, 2007 (Figure 9), we explicitly refer to Bergan et al., 2005 in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Feedback vs. feedforward. If standard vs. deviants are more consistent with feedforward connections and crossmodal associations are more consistent with feedback. It could be evidence of greater feedback, crossmodal connectivity in infants. This is very indirect evidence (the authors are clear that it is speculative) but it is not clear how it is consistent with the authors claim that feedback connections are better tuned later in development (as per Dehaene-Lambertz &amp; Spelke, 2015) and thus would support less learning. It is not clear how these two views are consistent especially given that the cross-modal associations are learnable when they are task-relevant: Task-relevance presumably doesn't create broader feedback connectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>This part of the discussion has been majorly revised. We first discuss how the maturation of crossmodal connectivity including feedback connectivity might be related to the age-dependent learning effects observed in the present and some previous (unimodal) studies (Discussion section). In the consecutive paragraph we discuss how detecting ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ might differ from detecting ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ (see 1.1 and 1.2 as well) (Discussion section). In the revised manuscript we do not associate the detection of the ‘Rare deviant stimuli’ with feedforward connectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analyses:</p><p>Visual inspection was used to select different time-windows for analysis even across experiments where the stimuli were identical (Experiments 2A and 2B) and indeed even the participants were identical. Is there an independent justification for selecting different time-windows beyond visual inspection? Would the same results obtain with identical time-windows across the two experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We reanalyzed the data using identical time windows for Experiment 2A and 2B. The result patterns did not change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Differences between frequent vs. deviant-recombined stimuli were with a more negative response in infants that is late vs. a more positive response in adults. why do the authors conclude that these are equivalent or evidence of a similar learning mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We base this interpretation on the common observation that what are negative effects in infants or children are often positive effects in adults and vice versa. For example, Kouider et al., (2015) recorded a “surprise” slow negativity in infants which corresponds to a typical P3 (slow positive wave) in adults. Moreover, latencies of experimental effects are known to decrease with increasing age. We link effects in infants and adults based on the eliciting experimental manipulation and relative timing (early vs. late). We added a short paragraph on this issue at the end of the Discussion section. Finally, typical crossmodal binding effects have been observed to start in adults 200 ms after stimulus onset (Bruns and Röder, (2010) and Bonath et al., (2007)). We do not talk about identical mechanisms though, which would indeed be too strong given the extensive differences between infants’ and adults’ brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section:</p><p>Early discrimination of standard vs. deviant stimuli. Consider in relation to Kouider et al., 2015 where early components were modulated by cross-modal associations.</p></disp-quote><p>Kouider et al., (2015) interpreted their early effects as attentional enhancement. They used a cuing paradigm where the auditory cue predicted the visual stimulus. By contrast, such crossmodal predictions prior to stimulation were not possible in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors report that 6-month-old infants rapidly learn cross-modal associations implicitly, while in adults there is no evidence of such learning unless the particular associations are explicitly attended to. This is an impressive study with interesting and important results which add to our knowledge of the organisation of human multisensory processing and learning. I have only minor comments, generally related to structure and presentation.</p><p>The plan of experiments and results is rather hard to follow and keep in mind. We get methods for multiple experiments using slightly different setups, then a lot of different results (which are not interpreted/summarised in an interim way), before discussion. The rationale for the specific design (why we have those particular three conditions) is nowhere spelled out either. It is a clever design, and a good choice by the authors, but the authors should take some time to explain the logic behind their choice (why these conditions) in the Introduction or Materials and methods section. E.g. there is clearly logic behind matching the (low) frequencies of the &quot;rare recombined&quot; and &quot;deviant&quot; stimuli but the point of this manipulation is never explicitly explained or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We more explicitly explain the rationality of the design in the revised manuscript. (Introduction; Materials and methods section (Experiment 1A and 1B; Experiment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would suggest a few things to make the paper more accessible.</p><p>1) Presenting the experiments as a sequence – with 2A and 2B as follow-ups after interim conclusions based on Experiment 1, rather than the (not very plausible to me) suggestion in intro that they were all planned and predicted from the outset, as if Experiments 2A and 2B were run without knowing any results from Experiment 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the organization of the manuscript accordingly. The original order actually had historical reasons since we indeed ran the adult experiments 2A and 2B first followed by Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b (the latter to link Experiment 1 to Experiment 2). The main reason why we started with the adult study was to make sure that the paradigm in principle is useful before running the time consuming infant study. However, we think that the reader will easier understand the rationale of the 2*2 experiments in the suggested and now new organization of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As suggested above, explaining rationale for the choice of different conditions and how they are matched (e.g. in terms of probability) more clearly when these are introduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a more detailed description of the design at the end of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Within the Results section, add some interim summaries of what each set of results/analyses has shown (&quot;In summary…&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We added interim Results sections (see Results section of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Consider some kind of table or other way of summarising the results of the different analyses. I found myself writing the 3 condition names (FS / RR / RD) for each analysis and joining these with lines to show where some differed – one easily visualisable outcome from this is that many clusters / epochs / ages show a FS-RD difference whereas the FS-RR difference (of most interest) is much rarer. A high-level table or visualisation that makes this clear would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We summarize the main findings of all four experiments (1A/B and 2A/B) in the new <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> of the revised manuscript. We refer to this table at the beginning of the Discussion section when we summarize the main results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My other substantive comment is on power of the adult vs infant analysis to find the effects of interest – this is mentioned in the Discussion section, but the argument would be more convincing with a quantitative treatment (e.g. comparing the size of effect that was detected successfully with adults with the size of effect that was seen in infants but not detected in adults).</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated effect sizes for Experiment 1A and 1B. The effect size for the ‘Rare recombined stimuli’ deviant effect of Experiment 1A was larger than the effect size for the rare deviant stimulus effect in both infants (Experiment 1A) and adults (Experiment 1B). Thus, power is unlikely an explanation for the missing ‘Rare recombined stimulus’ effect in Experiment 1b since we were able to detect an effect of a smaller size. We added these calculations to the Results section (Experiment 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors show that infants can learn a cross-modal predictive mapping implicitly while adults can only learn when the mapping is task-relevant, demonstrating superior cross-modal plasticity in infants.</p><p>This is potentially an interesting finding although the paper does not strike me as being optimally written for eLife. The paper is very long, structured like a classical experimental psychology paper and contains many details, which is not the standard for this kind of papers in eLife. I would strongly recommend shortening it and maybe presenting it as a brief article because at the end the main message is lost in many details which are much less relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We report four extensive EEG experiments including one experiment with infants. Since we directly compared the results across these experiments we presented them in a very standardized manner and in a way that the reader would be easily able to recognize the parallels and crucial differences among the experiments. However, in order to address the needs of those readers of <italic>eLife</italic> who are not interested in all details, we added the basic rationale of the study at the end of the Introduction. Moreover, we included short summaries of the main results both at the beginning and end of each part of the Results section.</p><p>Furthermore, as a response to the suggestion of another review we restructured the manuscript and now present first all parts of Experiment 1A/B followed by the main ideas and a presentation of Experiment 2A/B. Finally, we added a new <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">table 2</xref> which graphically summarizes the main results of all four experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major issue is the design and analysis of the data. As I understand it, the baseline correction is made out of the period just preceding the visual stimulus. This would mean that it includes auditory potentials. The baseline should be subtracted in the period before the whole pair of stimuli, otherwise the visual ERPs will necessarily be contaminated by the (inverse of) the auditory potentials. This might fully explain the effect induced by the rare deviant stimuli condition, where there was also a new auditory stimulus (A3).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we make more explicit that the auditory and visual elements of a crossmodal stimulus were presented simultaneous, that is, with the same onset too (Materials and methods section). Thus, the baseline used is the epoch preceding both the visual and auditory elements of a crossmodal stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is about the region of interest approach. Because the analysis is made on the visual stimuli, one might expect a focus on visual electrodes and their modulation as a function of condition. For infants, the cluster CP seems to show an effect, but it does not appear on the figures of the ERPs.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to show the complete topography of the experimental effects we use topographic maps. We report and mark all clusters/electrodes were effects were significant in the text and in the new <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">table 2</xref>, respectively. In addition, we display ERPs only for selected clusters a) to show “real” ERPs what we consider essential for allowing the reader to evaluate the quality of the recordings (morphology of the ERP, timing of the effects etc.); b) in order to avoid overwhelming the reader unfamiliar with ERPs with too many details not essential for the understanding of the results. We report ERPs to synchronously presented crossmodal (AV) stimuli while Emberson et al., (2015) analyzed NIRS-activity to visual vs. omitted visual stimuli; Kouider et al., (2015) looked at ERPs to visual stimuli correctly or incorrectly cued by a preceding sound.</p></body></sub-article></article>
