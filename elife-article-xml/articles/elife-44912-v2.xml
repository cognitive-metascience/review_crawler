Lysis in response to these drugs requires the activity of cell wall hydrolases called autolysins, but how penicillins misactivate these deadly enzymes has long remained unclear. Here, we show that alterations in surface polymers called teichoic acids (TAs) play a key role in penicillin-induced lysis of the Gram-positive pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>). We find that during exponential growth, <italic>Sp</italic> cells primarily produce lipid-anchored TAs called lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) that bind and sequester the major autolysin LytA. However, penicillin-treatment or prolonged stationary phase growth triggers the degradation of a key LTA synthase, causing a switch to the production of wall-anchored TAs (WTAs). This change allows LytA to associate with and degrade its cell wall substrate, thus promoting osmotic lysis. Similar changes in surface polymer assembly may underlie the mechanism of antibiotic- and/or growth phase-induced lysis for other important Gram-positive pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>S. pneumoniae</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>teichoic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI36431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores-Kim</surname><given-names>Josué</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI109764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM073831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC2 GM092616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI139083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI083365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Penicillin induces bacterial cell lysis by altering cell surface polymer biogenesis to cause the misactivation of a cell wall degrading enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Penicillin and related beta-lactams are some of our oldest and most effective antibiotics. These drugs disrupt the cell wall biogenesis pathway in bacterial cells and in doing so elicit explosive lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park and Strominger, 1957</xref>). Despite the long history of their use in the clinic, we still know relatively little about how beta-lactams trigger this catastrophic event. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this lethal activity has the potential to provide fundamental new insights into the cell wall assembly process and to reveal novel ways of inducing bacteriolysis for future therapeutic development.</p><p>The main targets of the beta-lactams are cell wall synthases called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strominger and Tipper, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</xref>), of which there are two varieties: class A (aPBPs) and class B (bPBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goffin and Ghuysen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>). These enzymes build the peptidoglycan (PG) matrix that surrounds most bacterial cells and protects them from osmotic rupture. The aPBPs are bifunctional and possess PG glycosyltransferase (PGT) and transpeptidase (TP) activity to polymerize the glycan strands of PG and form the inter-strand crosslinks of the network, respectively. The bPBPs, on the other hand, only possess TP activity. They work in concert with a second class of PG polymerases called the SEDS (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) family proteins to synthesize and crosslink new cell wall material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sjodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Beta-lactams covalently modify the TP active site of the PBPs to block the PG crosslinking activity of the aPBPs and SEDS-bPBP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</xref>). The first models of the lytic mechanism following TP inhibition by these drugs proposed that lysis resulted from the gradual weakening of the wall as it was made with fewer and fewer crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park and Strominger, 1957</xref>). However, pioneering studies from Tomasz and co-workers in the Gram-positive pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>) changed this view by showing that lysis in this organism was dependent on the activity of a PG cleaving enzyme called LytA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). Beta-lactam-induced lysis in other bacteria was subsequently shown to also be dependent on factors with PG processing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, these PG hydrolases are often referred to as autolysins, and from genome sequencing data we now know that most bacteria encode a large variety of enzymes capable of breaking bonds in the PG network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In normally growing bacteria, PG hydrolases are thought to participate in a number of critical cellular processes. Their activity is important to create space in the existing wall matrix to allow for the insertion of new material during cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carballido-López et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). They also remodel the cell wall formed at the division site (septal PG) to shape the new poles and promote daughter cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Las Rivas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lominski et al., 1958</xref>). Given their potential to induce cell lysis, it has long been appreciated that bacteria must possess robust mechanisms to control when and where PG hydrolases are activated to cut bonds in the PG network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). However, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory systems that control these potentially deadly enzymes or how they are subverted by antibiotics like beta-lactams to lyse bacterial cells.</p><p>To better understand PG hydrolase regulation and penicillin-induced lysis, we used <italic>Sp</italic> as a model system. It has the advantage of requiring a single PG hydrolase called LytA for lysis-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). The problem is therefore more genetically tractable in <italic>Sp</italic> than in other model organisms where multiple PG hydrolases are implicated in lysis-induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). Another benefit of <italic>Sp</italic> is its propensity to lyse following prolonged growth in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernebro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellroth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). Like penicillin-induced lysis, autolysis in stationary phase is LytA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernebro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellroth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). This property of <italic>Sp</italic> cells enabled us to develop a genetic screen for LytA regulators. The screen revealed a key role for surface polymers called teichoic acids (TAs) in controlling LytA activity. TAs are major constituents of the cell surface in Gram-positive bacteria and are either lipid-anchored (lipoteichoic acids, LTAs) or wall-anchored (wall teichoic acids, WTAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Percy and Gründling, 2014</xref>). Our results indicate that <italic>Sp</italic> cells primarily produce LTAs during normal exponential growth, which bind and sequester LytA. However, entry into stationary phase and penicillin-treatment were both found to trigger the degradation of the <italic>Sp</italic> LTA synthase, causing a switch to the production of WTAs. This change allows LytA to associate with and degrade its cell wall substrate, thus promoting osmotic lysis. We propose that changes in surface polymer assembly may similarly underlie the mechanism of antibiotic-induced lysis for a number of other important Gram-positive pathogens.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44912.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Beta-lactam induced lysis of <italic>Sp</italic> and overview of its cell envelope.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The indicated strains were grown in THY at 37 ˚C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Based on this observation, we hypothesized that LytA activity is negatively regulated during normal exponential growth by an inhibitory factor(s). In this scenario, inhibition would be relieved upon entry into stationary phase or exposure to cell wall synthesis inhibitors triggering lysis. If correct, this hypothesis predicts that the putative LytA inhibitory factor(s) should be essential for growth in wild type (LytA<sup>+</sup>) cells but become non-essential in cells lacking LytA (<italic>∆lytA</italic>). Therefore, to identify the potential LytA inhibitor(s), we used transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) to screen for <italic>Sp</italic> genes displaying the expected pattern of essentiality/non-essentiality. Transposon libraries were prepared in a wild-type strain D39 without its capsule (WT) and a derivative deleted for <italic>lytA</italic> (<italic>ΔlytA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fenton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Land and Winkler, 2011</xref>). When the insertion profiles were compared, we found that the gene <italic>tacL</italic> (SPD_1672) was virtually devoid of insertions in the WT library, but readily inactivated by insertions in the <italic>ΔlytA</italic> library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

When TacL was produced (+Zn), cells were viable regardless of their LytA status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, when TacL was depleted (-Zn), viability was severely compromised only in cells producing LytA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, TacL depletion during growth in liquid medium caused premature LytA-dependent autolysis in exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with these findings, a high-throughput CRISPRi study in <italic>Sp</italic> cells showed that TacL depletion led to increased lysis in stationary phase and aberrant cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

To test this possibility, recombinant LytA (rLytA) was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and added to exponentially growing cultures of <italic>ΔlytA</italic> or <italic>ΔlytA ΔtacL</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Our results thus provide additional support for the idea that TacL is the LTA ligase. Furthermore, the finding that WTAs increase when LTA synthesis is blocked suggests that the two pathways are antagonistic and are likely competing for the shared Und-P linked precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A switch from LTA to WTA synthesis occurs at the onset of autolysis</title><p>Our results thus far indicate that loss of TacL function during exponential growth leads to a change in teichoic acid synthesis from LTA to WTA and the induction of LytA-dependent autolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Connecting these two phenomena is that LytA not only has a cell wall cleaving amidase domain, but also possesses an array of six choline-binding domains (CBDs) that promote its association with PCho-modified teichoic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sandalova et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that the LytA-dependent lethality observed upon TacL depletion may result from a switch in LytA localization from LTAs to WTAs where the enzyme will have better access to its substrate to promote cell wall degradation and lysis.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we monitored the association of LytA with the membrane (LTA) and cell wall (WTA) in both TacL<sup>+</sup> and TacL<sup>-</sup> cells through different stages of growth. To avoid complications arising from autolysis, we used a catalytically inactive variant of LytA, LytA(H26A) to monitor its localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellroth et al., 2012</xref>). However, to guide the collection of samples, particularly those corresponding to the onset of autolysis (A), we grew a WT (LytA<sup>+</sup>) strain alongside the LytA(H26A) producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In TacL<sup>+</sup> cells, we observed robust LTA production in exponential phase (E) and low levels of WTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). A significant portion of LytA(H26A) in these samples was found in the membrane fraction, presumably through association with LTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The remaining portion of LytA was most likely retained in the cytoplasm awaiting export as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellroth et al., 2012</xref>). In early stationary phase (S), LTAs continued to be detected and the amount of WTAs were observed to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The majority of the extracellular LytA(H26A) remained associated with the membrane fraction, but a small amount was detected in the cell wall fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, as cells reached late stationary phase when autolysis normally begins, LTA levels were dramatically reduced while the amount of WTA had increased relative to the early stationary phase time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Now, LytA(H26A) was no longer found associated with the membrane fraction but instead its localization switched almost entirely to the cell wall fraction where it was presumably bound to the WTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In similar experiments performed in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, the WTAs were the only detectable teichoic acids at all growth stages, and LytA(H26A) was found associated with the cell wall fraction at every time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44912.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A switch from LTA to WTA synthesis and LytA localization occurs at the onset of autolysis.</title><p>(<bold>A and C</bold>) Growth curves of the indicated strains cultured at 37 ˚C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

To further investigate this phenomenon, cell membrane fractions and culture supernatants were harvested from LytA-defective cells before and during an autolysis time-course induced by either PenG treatment or stationary phase growth. As above, a WT (LytA<sup>+</sup>) strain was used as a reference to guide sample collection. In both cases, LTAs were detected in the membrane at early time points (E and B), but choline-containing material was absent from the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, as autolysis progressed, an increase in choline-containing material in the supernatant was observed, while at late time points, LTAs in the membrane were barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The rationale for the screen was that mutants unable to degrade TacL should be defective in the induction of autolysis and therefore more tolerant than WT cells to penicillin treatment. We used our original transposon library prepared in the WT strain and grew it either without drug or in the presence of a sub-lethal concentration of penicillin G that caused a mild growth defect without affecting viability. We then compared the transposon insertion profiles observed in the Tn-Seq data from these two conditions. A few genes were identified in which transposon insertions were significantly enriched in the penicillin treated condition versus the no drug or unrelated drug control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). One of these genes was <italic>ftsH</italic>, encoding a highly conserved ATP-dependent zinc metallopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito and Akiyama, 2005</xref>). FtsH has two transmembrane segments and a well-known role in the degradation of membrane protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Langklotz et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore focused on FtsH as a candidate for the protease targeting TacL.</p><p>To test whether FtsH targets TacL for degradation, we compared TacL-FLAG levels as well as LTA and WTA production in cells with or without FtsH. Unlike cells with functional FtsH, TacL-FLAG remained stable in Δ<italic>ftsH</italic> cells following penicillin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Moreover, these cells did not undergo the switch in teichoic acid production from LTAs to WTAs, nor did LytA<sup>+</sup> cells lacking FtsH autolyze in response to penicillin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Similar observations were made comparing FtsH<sup>+</sup> and FtsH<sup>-</sup> cells during prolonged stationary phase growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Specifically, TacL-FLAG remained stable in cells lacking FtsH and LTAs continued to be produced in stationary phase where their levels were dramatically reduced in FtsH<sup>+</sup> cells. Altogether, our results support a model in which autolysis in response to cell wall targeting drugs or stationary phase growth is caused by a switch in surface polymer biogenesis triggered by FtsH-mediated degradation of TacL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Autolysis of <italic>Sp</italic> cells following entry into stationary phase was described by Walther Goebl and Oswald Avery almost a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avery and Cullen, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goebel and Avery, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neufeld, 1900</xref>). Although the biological relevance of this phenomenon remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldholm et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirst et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kietzman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martner et al., 2009</xref>), it is medically significant due to its relationship with antibiotic-induced bacteriolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernebro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellroth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). The connection between these lytic events was made half a century later by Tomasz and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). Their seminal studies demonstrated that both types of lytic events require the activity of the PG hydrolase LytA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>). Several decades have now elapsed since these discoveries were reported yet the regulatory systems controlling LytA during normal growth and how they are relieved to induce lysis have remained ill-defined. Here, we show that a change in cell surface polymer biogenesis underlies the onset of autolysis, providing a mechanistic framework to understand the process and exploit it for the development of novel lytic antibiotics.</p><p>Our data indicate that LTAs and WTAs have antagonistic effects on cellular LytA activity. LTAs are required to prevent LytA-induced lysis during exponential growth whereas an increase in WTA synthesis at the expense of LTAs is associated with conditions that promote cell wall destruction by LytA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The polymeric structure of LTA and WTA is identical in <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 1993</xref>). LytA is therefore unlikely to have a different enzymatic potential when bound to these molecules through its choline-binding domains. Although it is possible that the association of LytA with WTA is required to properly orient the amidase domain with respect to its substrate for productive cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mellroth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pérez-Dorado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sandalova et al., 2016</xref>), we favor a model in which the differential control exerted by these polymers is the result of how they affect the localization of LytA within the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44912.013</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for LytA regulation.</title><p>During exponential growth, TacL-dependent LTA synthesis dominates over LCP-dependent production of WTA. LytA bound to the phosphocholine moeities (purple/black balls) on LTA is sequestered away from WTA preventing LytA from targeting the cell wall. Upon entry into stationary phase or exposure to cell wall targeting antibiotics (penicillin), TacL is degraded in an FtsH-dependent manner leading to a reduction in LTA synthesis and an increase in WTA levels. Association of LytA with newly synthesized WTA leads to cell wall cleavage and lysis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44912-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Cryoelectron microscopy studies of Gram-positive bacteria by Beveridge and co-workers revealed that the PG layer is spatially separated from the cytoplasmic membrane, forming what has been referred to as the Gram-positive ‘periplasm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matias and Beveridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matias and Beveridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matias and Beveridge, 2006</xref>). Evidence has also been presented that LTAs are likely to be restricted to this ‘periplasmic’ space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matias and Beveridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reichmann et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore propose that in <italic>Sp</italic> cells, the protective function of LTAs is mediated by their ability to bind and sequester LytA in the membrane-proximal zone of the envelope thereby limiting its access to the cell wall and ability to cut bonds in the PG network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is noteworthy that Tomasz and co-workers previously observed that purified LTAs were capable of inhibiting LytA-mediated autolysis by a mechanism that was unclear at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briese and Hakenbeck, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Höltje and Tomasz, 1975</xref>). Based on our findings, we infer that these results reflect the ability of micellar forms of LTAs to similarly bind and sequester LytA to prevent its association with cell wall substrate. After several hours in stationary phase or following penicillin treatment, we observed a dramatic reduction in cellular LTAs through the inhibition of their synthesis and what appears to be their release from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This drop in LTA levels is associated with a corresponding increase in the level of WTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). At this time, LytA is similarly shifted from the membrane to cell wall fractions where it is likely bound to WTAs, its association with which has long been known to be required for cell wall cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giudicelli and Tomasz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Höltje and Tomasz, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mellroth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Waks and Tomasz, 1978</xref>). Therefore, our results support a model in which it is the change in TA polymer synthesis and subsequent recruitment of LytA from membrane-anchored LTAs to its cell wall substrate that underlies autolysis induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Although we do not currently know the mechanism by which <italic>Sp</italic> cells preferentially make LTAs during exponential growth, our results establish that the switch to WTA synthesis under autolytic conditions involves the degradation of TacL, the likely ligase involved in making LTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heß et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, inactivation of the membrane-bound protease FtsH was shown to prevent TacL degradation and protect cells from LytA-dependent autolysis, suggesting that TacL is a direct substrate of FtsH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). What remains to be determined is how TacL degradation by FtsH is triggered by conditions that induce autolysis.</p><p>The physiological signals governing FtsH activity are not known in any organism but are best understood in <italic>E. coli</italic>. As in <italic>Sp</italic> cells, <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsH controls an important branch point in an envelope biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ogura et al., 1999</xref>). In this case, its key substrate is LpxC, the enzyme catalyzing the committed step in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the Gram-negative outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Führer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ogura et al., 1999</xref>). The LPS and phospholipid synthesis pathways compete for fatty acids in the form of acyl-ACP precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Normark et al., 1969</xref>). Therefore, flux between the two pathways must be balanced for proper membrane assembly. Indirect evidence suggests that the turnover of LpxC by <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsH may be regulated by the availability of certain acyl-ACP precursors or the accumulation of downstream products in the LPS synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">May and Silhavy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Normark et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ogura et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, in <italic>Sp</italic> cells, FtsH may similarly respond to precursors or products of the TA polymer assembly pathways it governs. As in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the sensing mechanism might normally function in the homeostatic control of LTA and WTA levels, which may be needed for more precise activation of LytA to promote septal PG cleavage and cell separation. Autolytic conditions would then be expected to somehow short-circuit the normal balancing mechanism, swinging it too far in favor of WTA synthesis such that destructive levels of LytA activity are stimulated. Further work will be required to test this and other possible models for the upstream signals governing <italic>Sp</italic> FtsH activity, their role in normal physiology, and how they are corrupted to induce autolysis.</p><p>TAs have been implicated in the control of PG hydrolases in other Gram-positive bacteria. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the major autolysin Atl that acts at division septa to promote cell separation specifically localizes to the septal PG and this localization requires WTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schlag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamada et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, localization studies suggest that WTA levels are lowest at the septum in <italic>S. aureus</italic> suggesting that Atl preferentially localizes to PG lacking attached TA polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schlag et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the cell separase LytF localizes to septal PG in a manner that depends on both WTA and LTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiriyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the major autolysin AcmA in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> specifically localizes to the septum while galactosyl-containing TA polymers are largely absent at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steen et al., 2003</xref>). In all of these cases the presence of TA polymers appears to interfere with autolysin binding to the cell wall, however the mechanisms underlying the temporal and spatial organization/localization of TAs is not known. Although it remains to be investigated, our results in <italic>Sp</italic> cells suggest that rather than one polymer or the other predominating, it may be the interplay between the LTA and WTA synthesis pathways that plays the key role in controlling PG hydrolysis and autolytic-induction in these and other Gram-positive organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

They show that inactivation of TacL (aka as waaL, rafX, spr1708, SP_1893 or SPD_1672), the Lipo teichoic acid (LTA) synthase, increases the levels of wall TAs and leads to LytA-dependent lysis. This suggests that LTAs sequester LytA away from the cell wall. As LTAs are mainly made during exponential growth cells are protected from LytA autolytic activity. The authors also identify FtsH as the main protease responsible for degradation of TacL during stationary phase or when cells get treated with Penicillin G. How this exactly works is not yet clear. This work provides several new insights into the long-standing question on how LytA activity is controlled. In addition, it provides some leads as to the regulation of autolysins in other bacteria via controlled production of LTA and WTA.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Additional verifications to improve the paper are listed below:</p><p>1) Activation by WTAs.

So, although TacL and FtsH seem important, their identification does not explain the entire process because even though TacL is degraded, if the pre-synthesized LTA remains on the cell membrane, LytA should stay sequestered at the cell membrane and prevent lysis.

In theory, depleting factors required for the biogenesis TA precursors should reduce cellular levels of WTA and LTA simultaneously. Thus, according to our model, with reduced WTAs for LytA to associate with, cells should likely be more resistant to LytA autolysis. However, the TA biogenesis genes are essential, and in our experience depletion strains that block WTA synthesis become quite sick and grow poorly under depletion conditions. Therefore, in practice, the proposed experiment is one in which the results will likely be difficult to interpret (and hard to control for) due to the sickly state of the cells being studied. Nevertheless, a choline-binding requirement for LytA activity is well supported by the literature such that the proposed experiment is not necessary to support our model.</p><p>It is well-established that LytA is a choline binding protein that requires association with choline-modified TA polymers to degrade the cell wall and promote autolysis (see Tomasz, Albino and Zanati, 1970; Giudicelli and Tomasz, 1984; Severin et al., 1997). Combining our results that LTAs are protective against autolysis with historical studies showing a choline-binding requirement for LytA action, we think it is reasonable to conclude that WTAs are required for LytA-induced autolysis. We have added this line of reasoning to our overview of the model in the Discussion section (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Link between LytA and LTA release.</p><p>– the authors show that TacL is the crucial enzyme regulating the switch from LTA to WTA</p><p>– the switch is controlled by the FtsH integral membrane protease degradation of TacL</p><p>This is consistent with data generated by Tomasz and colleagues that observed that lysis could be blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis with chloramphenicol and that this inhibition was not related to LytA abundance.

The degradation of TacL to block new LTA synthesis is clearly an important component of the autolytic process, but it is also likely to involve the release of existing LTAs. We have assayed for released TA material in the supernatant during stationary-phase and penicillin-induced autolysis. We indeed find released choline-containing material in the supernatant of cultures, and the appearance of this released material is coincident with the loss of LTAs. Given that WTAs and LTAs share the same polymeric structure, we cannot conclude with certainty that the released material is LTA. However, the timing of its appearance is consistent with the material being LTA released during autolysis. TacL does not appear to be involved in the release because it is degraded at the time release is observed. These new experiments are now described in the Results section (subsection “TAs are released from cells at the onset of autolysis”) and presented in Figure 7, and the notion that LTAs are likely being released as part of the autolytic process has been incorporated into our discussion of the model (Discussion, third paragraph). We are actively searching for the factor responsible for LTA release, but its identification is beyond the scope of the current report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other suggested modifications:</p><p>– Subsection “A switch from LTA to WTA synthesis occurs at the onset of autolysis”, last paragraph.

However, the experiment was performed as reported so that we had enough cell material for detecting LytA and the TAs in the various fractions. Although the graphs look similar due to the semi-log scale, we never see stationary-phase autolysis until cells reach an OD<sub>600</sub> &gt; 1. The response we see from PenG addition at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4-0.5 is immediate such that we think it is safe to conclude that the observed effects are the result of PenG addition and not stationary-phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Identification of TacL as a potential LytA control factor”.
