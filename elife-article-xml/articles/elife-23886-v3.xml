Here, we show that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key ω−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in synaptic membranes, enhances the agonist-induced transition to the desensitized state in the prokaryotic channel GLIC. We determined a 3.25 Å crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23886.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23886.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23886.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nerve cells (or neurons) in the brain communicate with each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters that bind to ion channels on neighboring neurons. This ultimately causes ions to flow in or out of the receiving neuron through these ion channels; this ion flow determines how the neuron responds.</p><p>One family of ion channels that is found at the junction between neurons, and between neurons and muscle fibers, is known as the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (or pLGICs). These channels act as ‘gates’ that open to allow ions through them when a neurotransmitter binds to the channel. In addition to the open ‘active’ state, the channels can take on two different ‘inactive’ states that do not allow ions to pass through the channel: a closed (resting) state and a desensitized state (that is still bound to the neurotransmitter). Understanding how channels switch between these states is important for designing drugs that correct problems that cause the channels to work incorrectly.</p><p>Problems that affect the desensitized state have been linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Medically important molecules such as anesthetics and alcohols are thought to affect desensitization, and drugs that target desensitized ion channels may present ways of treating neurological disorders with fewer side effects.</p><p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an abundant lipid molecule that is present in the membranes of neurons. It is one of the key ingredients in fish oil supplements and is thought to enhance learning and memory. DHA affects the desensitization of pLGICs but it is not clear exactly how it does so.</p><p>Basak et al. now show that DHA affects a bacterial pLGIC in the same way as it affects human channels – by enhancing desensitization. Using a technique called X-ray crystallography to analyze the channel while bound to DHA revealed a previously unobserved channel structure. The DHA molecule binds to a site at the edge of the channel and causes a change in its structure that leaves the upper part of the channel open while the lower part is constricted. Basak et al. predict that molecules such as anesthetics target this desensitized state.</p><p>The next step will be to obtain the structures of bacterial and human pLGIC channels in a natural membrane environment. This will allow us to better understand the changes in structure that the channels go through as they transmit signals between neurons, and so help in the development of new treatments for neurological disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23886.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23886.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Cys-loop receptors</kwd><kwd>allosteric modulation</kwd><kwd>nanodiscs</kwd><kwd>site-directed spin labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12SDG12070069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R01GM108921-03S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakrapani</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance desensitization in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fast synaptic transmission throughout the central and peripheral nervous system is mediated by pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), also referred to as Cys-loop receptors. The vertebrate channels of this superfamily include both inhibitory anion-selective channels (γ-aminobutyric acid receptors- GABA<sub>A</sub>R and glycine receptors- GlyR) and excitatory cation-selective channels (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors- nAChR and serotonin receptors- 5HT<sub>3A</sub>R). The binding of a neurotransmitter initiates a cascade of protein motions that lead to transitions between resting, open, and desensitized conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Unwin and Fujiyoshi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ionic fluxes, and hence the post-synaptic responses, are critically governed by the transition rates and equilibrium populations of these functional states. Aberration of these molecular events underlies many neurological disorders and therefore, pLGICs are therapeutic targets for treating these conditions. To develop a molecular understanding of the pLGIC gating mechanism and its modulation requires high-resolution structures of the channel in multiple functional states. While there has been ground-breaking progress in determining the structures of several members of the pLGIC family, from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, an unequivocal assignment of functional states to these conformations has not been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Unwin and Fujiyoshi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hassaine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>).

In addition, they regulate the allosteric effects of alcohols, anesthetics, neurosteroids, and free fatty acids. These molecules partition into the lipid bilayer and affect channel properties by either interacting directly with the channel or by altering the interaction of the channel with surrounding lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Howard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Changeux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Campagna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mihic et al., 1997</xref>). In particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an <italic>ω</italic>−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with 22 carbons and six double bonds) has previously been reported to modulate nAChR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R function by increasing the rate and extent of desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hamano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nabekura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bouzat and Barrantes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Witt et al., 1999</xref>). DHA is a major polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in the brain and is found in high concentrations (up to 50 mol% of the total acyl chains of phospholipids) in synaptic plasma membranes. Reduced levels are linked with impaired learning ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Janssen and Kiliaan, 2014</xref>). DHA is readily esterified and incorporated into membrane phospholipids, altering both the physical properties of the membrane and the expression and function of associated membrane proteins. Free DHA released by intracellular enzymes such as phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and diacylglycerol lipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Piomelli and Greengard, 1990</xref>) also influences membrane protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Moreno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boland and Drzewiecki, 2008</xref>). While there are numerous reports describing the effects of DHA on several channel types, the mechanism of its action remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>). Mutational analysis and subunit/isoform specific effects in a number of channels have implicated direct interaction with DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ottosson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hoshi et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2013b</xref>), however evidence for a DHA binding site on these channels is still lacking.</p><p>Although the prokaryotic pLGIC are significantly less stringent in their need for specific membrane constituents, their function is modulated by lipids in an analogous way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Labriola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>). Here, we show in electrophysiological recordings that desensitization in GLIC, a prokaryotic pH-gated pLGIC, is enhanced in the presence of DHA. GLIC has previously been crystallized in its resting (closed) and putative open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>), however, the desensitized state of the channel has been structurally elusive. Co-crystals of GLIC in the presence of DHA allowed us to successfully stabilize the channel in a novel state that is likely to be a desensitized conformation. The structure reveals a DHA molecule bound at the channel periphery, close to the M4 segment, and interacting with Arg118 in the Cys-loop (β6-β7 loop) through a salt-bridge. Both the M4 segment (also referred to as the ‘lipid-sensor’ in nAChR) and the Cys-loop are implicated in transducing agonist-induced conformational changes from across the extracellular domain (ECD) to the transmembrane domain (TMD). Mutations in the ECD-TMD interfacial region have been shown to affect desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bouzat et al., 2008</xref>). The most striking feature of our structure is the new pore conformation, which provides a molecular view of how ion permeation could potentially be occluded in a desensitized state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DHA modulates the pH-elicited response in GLIC</title><p>To test the effect of DHA on GLIC function, we expressed GLIC in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and measured currents by two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) techniques (Materials and methods).

Upon deactivation at pH 7.0, subsequent pH change to 4.5 resulted in currents with peak amplitudes and decay phases indistinguishable from the first pulse, revealing that the effect of DHA was fully reversible. In addition to the effect on current decay, DHA decreases the amount of steady-state current (measured at 2.2 min from the start of application) as shown in the plot of the steady-state-to-peak ratio, suggesting that both the rate and the extent of desensitization are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows a detailed analysis of the effect of DHA at different concentrations and at various activating pH. The effect on desensitization was observed at DHA concentrations above 5 μM, and was more pronounced at higher proton concentrations, suggesting that channel activation promotes the effect of DHA. Additionally, in the presence of DHA, a small left-shift in pH-response is observed for GLIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings are in fact expected for a modulator that promotes desensitization (the conformational state with the highest agonist-affinity). Further, outward current decay was also accelerated in the presence of DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), similar to the effect on inward currents. Upon pre-application of DHA (at pH 7.4) prior to co-application at pH 4.5, additional decrease in peak amplitudes is observed, suggesting that enhanced availability of DHA could result in larger effects on GLIC currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The effects of DHA were fully reversible in all of the measured conditions.</p><p>To further confirm that DHA indeed promotes an agonist-induced desensitized state rather than a pre-open resting state, we studied the effect of DHA on an alanine mutation at the Ile9’ position in M2. Mutation at the equivalent position in several pLGIC has been shown to increase agonist sensitivity and slow desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Labarca et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Filatov and White, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akabas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yakel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Revah et al., 1991</xref>). The prediction is that perturbations that destabilize the desensitized state should lower the effect of DHA. The I9′A mutant exhibits a gain-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Parikh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>) resulting in leaky oocytes, an effect that can be offset with a background mutation (H11′F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Rienzo et al., 2014</xref>]) that reduces pH-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Schmandt et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the double-mutant (I9′A/H11′F) shows robust non-desensitizing currents with a pH<sub>50</sub> 5.17 ± 0.19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Quite remarkably, DHA had no effect on this mutant over a range of pH conditions, and even up to a 100 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the mutant’s pH response is close to wt, the DHA effect cannot be explained by stabilization of the resting or pre-open states. We would like to point out that the technical limitations of TEVC, which include slower perfusion rates, preclude us from resolving fast kinetic components of desensitization. We therefore, at this point, cannot ascertain which of the multiple desensitized states that DHA stabilizes. Nevertheless, above findings demonstrate that transitions to the desensitized state are necessary for the DHA effect, and that DHA may stabilize a desensitized conformation induced by the agonist during gating.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23886.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DHA has no effect on the non-desensitizing GLIC I9′A/H11′F mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized pH-response for GLIC-wt (red) and GLIC I9′A/H11′F double mutant (orange) at −60 mV.

Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Well-defined electron density was found for DHA in all the subunits in a pocket at the channel periphery; lined by M4, the M2-M3 linker, and the β6-β7 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DHA molecule appears bent with a twisted/curled orientation, and makes a salt-bridge interaction with an arginine sidechain (Arg118) in the β6-β7 loop. Besides this interaction, DHA does not appear to engage with the rest of the protein. However, it must be noted that the density for the DHA tail is not resolved beyond C13, and therefore was not built in the model. Considering the high degree of conformational flexibility in the polyunsaturated aliphatic tail of DHA, it is not surprising that this region is less well defined. We therefore cannot exclude additional interactions of the protein with the flexible fatty acid tail. Several residues in the vicinity of the DHA binding site (in the β6−β7 loop, the M2-M3 linker, M1, M3, and M4) show small changes in rotameric orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), although the overall conformation of these regions is similar to the GLIC-pH4 structure. In the GLIC-pH4 structure, the Arg118 side-chain lines a phospholipid-binding pocket within the intra-subunit cavity formed by M1, M3, and M4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>).

The conformation of the GLIC-pH4-DHA pore does not align with either the resting (GLIC-pH7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>) or the putative open state (GLIC-pH4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>) GLIC structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).

While the electron density was observed for the bundle of six dodecyl-maltoside molecules in the upper M2, they were more disordered in comparison to the GLIC-pH4 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The reduced detergent occupancy is expected, due to the effect of pore constriction at Ile9′. Additionally, the channel pore in the GLIC-pH4 structure (PDB ID: 4HFI) reveals a cation binding site (at the level of Thr2′ coordinated by water molecules beneath it) and an ordered pentagonal-ring of water molecules that are in-plane with the γ-O atoms of Ser6’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These densities were also noted in lower-resolution structures (comparable in resolution to GLIC-pH4-DHA), although they appeared more diffuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the GLIC-pH4-DHA structure shows a distinctly different hydration profile at the intracellular half of the pore, with loss of densities for water and ions. Interestingly, the orientation of Ser6 sidechains is implicated in directly influencing the organization of the water ring at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>). A small change at this position in GLIC-pH4-DHA brought about by the compression at Ile9’ may thus be responsible for the loss of ions and water.</p><p>With the exception of changes in M2, GLIC-pH4-DHA adopts a conformation almost identical to GLIC-pH4 (RMSD for alignment of ECD pentamer (residues 5–191) with 4HFI is 0.34 Å and that for the TMD (residues 192–315) is 0.49 Å). Surprisingly, DHA had minimal effect on the protein conformation in and around M4. Similarly, crystal structures of GLIC at neutral and acidic pH also reveal minimal positional differences in M4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is somewhat unexpected considering that M4 plays a role in relaying modulatory effects of lipid-protein interactions on to the channel pore, and that M4 perturbations have functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bouzat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lasalde et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Mitra et al., 2004</xref>). The lack of a structural change could potentially result from the absence of a membrane environment in crystallographic conditions, with the effect being most pronounced on the lipid-exposed M4 segment. Additionally, crystal packing and lattice forces may overwhelm the energetics of conformational equilibrium, thereby masking the effect induced by ligands and mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2012</xref>). To better understand the role of M4 in regulating lipid-sensitive gating, it is important to first know how M4 moves during channel activation and desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conformational changes in M4 during transition to the ligand-induced desensitized state</title><p>To probe the conformational changes in M4 during the transition to the desensitized state, we used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and Continuous-Wave (CW) EPR spectroscopic methods in membrane-reconstituted GLIC. Single-cysteine mutations were made along the length of the segment (~31 positions) on a cysteine-less background template. Previous studies have also shown that M4 mutations are well-behaved, with the exception of Pro300, where no pH-activated currents were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carswell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hénault et al., 2015</xref>) Individual cys-mutants were purified, labeled with MTSL, and reconstituted into asolectin membranes for EPR studies. As with any study involving side-chain perturbations, attachment of spin-probes could lead to functional alterations of the channel. We therefore tested the functionality of representative purified cysteine mutants upon spin-labeling and reconstitution by patch-clamp recordings of excised membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the spin-labeled M4 mutants exhibit pH-activated currents, the current traces show qualitative differences in decay profiles. These differences in desensitization kinetics may arise from cys mutagenesis and/or SDSL. Functional perturbation accompanying SDSL remains a caveat of this approach. However, since EPR measurements are made at steady-state conditions, the changes in ‘faster’ components of kinetics may not significantly impact the overall interpretation.</p><p>The CW spectral analysis included the determination of two parameters: (1) ΔH<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup>, which is measured as the inverse of the central linewidth. This lineshape parameter has been routinely utilized to assess changes in mobility. However, in some cases changes in ΔH<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> may arise from alterations in oxygen accessibility that result in line broadening and may not reflect a change in mobility. Nevertheless, this lineshape parameter is useful to reflect changes occurring among the states. (2) Π, accessibility to either membrane or water measured in the presence of lipid-soluble oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and water-soluble Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid (NiEDDA), respectively. Each of these measurements was made for samples at pH 7.0 and at pH 3.0. Since in membranes, exposure to acidic pH activates and subsequently desensitizes GLIC, under steady-state EPR conditions, the channels are expected to be predominantly in their closed conformation at pH 7.0 and in their desensitized conformation at pH 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Velisetty et al., 2012</xref>).

In the desensitized conformation, spectra at the intracellular end (Pro285-Ala294) show minimal changes in lineshape. However, there are dramatic changes in lineshapes for residues above Ala294 that are reflective of an increase in mobility (particularly Ser295, Arg296, Ile297 and Ala298, <italic>grey</italic> box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; compare the dark blue and cyan dotted lines that indicate the mobile and immobile components of the spectra, respectively). The flexibility in this region is likely due to the hinge/kink introduced by the conserved Pro300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, marked by a green star), arising from steric hindrance of the sidechain and the loss of the backbone hydrogen bonds between Pro300 and Arg296. Proline-induced local distortion of the helix and increases in flexibility are predicted to have global effects on protein conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cordes et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this idea, mutational perturbation of the conserved proline side-chain leads to non-functional channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hénault et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the helix-bending at this position may play a role in channel gating. Above this region (towards the extracellular end), for the TMD-facing side of M4, a large change in lineshape (observed as a decrease in spectral broadening and an increase in amplitude; also see the changes in mobile and immobile spectral components marked by the dotted lines) is noted at several positions (Phe299, Val302, Phe303, Phe314, and Phe315) and modest changes are observed at others (Ala306, Asn307, and Leu310). In contrast, for the membrane-facing side of M4, the spectral changes are small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, indicated by black circles), indicating that channel gating is accompanied by rearrangement of the packing-interface of the intra-subunit cavity.</p><p>A complete plot of ΔH<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> and accessibility parameters for M4 residues is presented for the closed and desensitized conformations (see Materials and methods for details on the estimation of these parameters), and the difference in values of individual parameters between the two states are mapped on the GLIC-pH4 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the closed conformation, positions with low values of ΔH<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> appear to be three to four residues apart and line up on the inward-face of M4 (marked by green asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Further, high ΠO<sub>2</sub> values for the membrane-exposed residues and low values for the tertiary contacts show that M4 is closely associated with the rest of the TM helices, such that one face of M4 is protected from lipids in this state. In the desensitized conformation, there is an overall increase in ΠO<sub>2</sub>, which indicates an increase in the membrane exposure of M4. Although, potential differences in membrane permeability of O<sub>2</sub> in the two pH conditions could affect this measurement. Nevertheless, in comparison to the membrane-facing residues, a larger increase in ΠO<sub>2</sub> is observed for the TMD-facing residues (Ala289, Ile291, Ser295, Phe299, Val302, Phe303, Ala306, Asn307, Leu310, Phe314, and Phe315) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that the intimate association of M4 with M3 and M1 helices is disrupted in the desensitized conformation. Consistent with the observed lineshape changes of residues in the vicinity of the Pro300 kink (295-299), these positions also show high ΠO<sub>2</sub> values in the desensitized state. Overall, the C-terminal half of M4 shows the most dramatic changes in the CW lineshapes, which are correlated with increases in ΠO<sub>2</sub>. Further, the membrane boundaries of M4 are clearly defined by high ΠNiEDDA values at the extracellular and intracellular end with little water penetration observed in the M4 vicinity. Besides a decrease in water exposure at the C-terminal tip of M4, no major differences are observed in the ΠNiEDDA pattern in the two conformations. A lack of NiEDDA accessibility for the residues facing the intra-subunit cavity is inline with the hydrophobic nature of this region.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23886.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Solvent accessibility changes in M4 during desensitization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A plot of residue environmental parameters for the closed (shown in grey) and desensitized (shown in color) states.

Notably, a decrease in water exposure accompanied by an increase in membrane accessibility at the M4 tip is also consistent with an outward M4 motion that would bury the tip further within the membrane.</p><p>To quantify the extent of M4 movement, we measured average interspin distances in the closed and desensitized conformations for several positions in M4 (Ser295, Arg296, Phe303, and Leu304) with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Although CW spectra suggest a smaller conformational change compared to the C-terminal end, these positions were chosen because they were closer to the distance range that can be reliably measured by DEER (20–60 Å). Since DEER measurements of longer distances are particularly challenging to determine in liposomes, we reconstituted labeled GLIC in nanodiscs using the membrane scaffolding protein, MSP1E3D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ritchie et al., 2009</xref>). Previous work has shown that the use of nanodisc technology in combination with Q-band for data collection improved DEER sensitivity by lowering background contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zou and McHaourab, 2010</xref>). As expected for a pentameric system with five labels, the distance distribution for all the positions showed at least two main components, one corresponding to the short adjacent distance and the other to the long non-adjacent distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DEER distances in the closed state were broadly consistent with the GLIC-pH7 structure (PDB ID: 4NPQ) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Positions S295R1 and L304R1 also reveal multiple components for the adjacent distances indicative of conformational heterogeneity of the M4 helix. However, the DEER distances in the desensitized state were consistently longer (for three of four positions) than those predicted from the GLIC-pH4 structure (PDB ID: 4HFI) and the GLIC-pH4-DHA structure. For positions Arg296, Phe303, and Leu304, both distributions move toward longer distances in the desensitized state compared to the closed state. Increases in DEER distances are a consequence of M4 moving away from the five-fold axis, up to 4 Å at the mid-M4 region and likely to be greater at the tip of M4. Based on CW and DEER measurements, we conclude that M4 undergoes major conformational changes during its transition to the ligand-activated desensitized state, with an increase in lipid exposure of this segment, particularly at positions along the protein-facing side of M4.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23886.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Changes in M4 distance measured by DEER for GLIC in nanodiscs.</title><p>GLIC structure showing the positions investigated by DEER and the two expected distance distributions (from the adjacent and non-adjacent subunits).

This conformational state, which is distinct from the desensitized state, is refractory to agonist-induced transitions and is characterized by lower agonist-affinity (similar to the closed state). To determine if the DHA-stabilized state is similar to the ‘uncoupled’ state, we measured CW-spectra at representative positions on M4 under steady-state conditions of neutral and acidic pH (that favor the closed and desensitized conformations, respectively), each in the presence and absence of DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). If the observed effect of DHA was through an increase in the rate of agonist-induced desensitization, under conditions of prolonged agonist exposure, the equilibrium population, both in the presence and absence of DHA, is likely to be shifted towards the desensitized state. However, if DHA were to stabilize the uncoupled conformation, then a mixture of closed and uncoupled states, with very little population of the desensitized states, is expected in the acidic pH condition. A comparison of the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) shows that there is indeed no effect of DHA on the lineshapes of the two end-states (closed and desensitized).

A comparison of GLIC-pH7 and GLIC-pH4 structures suggest that activation involves an outward tilting of M2 from the pore-axis leading to channel opening with a radius &gt;5 Å at the extracellular end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>). In the GLIC-pH7 structure, the M2 helices come together to form a tightly packed bundle with the pore constricted to less than ~2.5 Å at Ile16′, Ile9′, Ser6′, and Thr2, effectively occluding ion permeation (the metal-oxygen distance of hydrated monovalent cations is ~2.1–3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Marcus, 1988</xref>). In the GLIC-pH4 structure, the narrowest region of the pore is formed by the selectivity filter region (between Thr2′ to Glu-2′) with a radius ~2.5 Å at Thr2′. Although the pore in this region is too narrow to allow fully-hydrated cations to pass, polar side-chains at Ser6′, Thr2′ and Glu-2′ could potentially coordinate partially hydrated ions. Since it is not known whether GLIC can permeate partially hydrated ions, the conformational state of GLIC-pH4 (open, pre-open, or desensitized) is still debatable. In contrast, in the GLIC-pH4-DHA structure, while the extracellular end remains open, the intracellular-half of M2 (lined by Ile9′, Ser 6′, and Thr2′) undergoes constriction, with the largest effect seen at Ile9′ (pore radii ~2.5 Å). In this conformation, occupancy of the ions and water molecules in the selectivity filter area is greatly reduced, which could be induced by the closure at Ile9′. The pore radii at Glu-2′ is unchanged. However, lower resolution of our structure limits us from making significant interpretations about the side-chain conformation at the −2′ position. We therefore suggest that the GLIC-pH4-DHA structure represents a desensitized conformation (perhaps a lipid-induced, deeper state), where ion permeation is occluded in the intracellular-end of M2 below the 9′ position. Consistent with this idea, reducing the side-chain volume or hydrophobicity at the conserved 9′ position increases the open state stability and decreases the apparent desensitization rate in many members of the pLGIC family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Labarca et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Filatov and White, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akabas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yakel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Revah et al., 1991</xref>). Further, constriction of the inner half of M2 in the desensitized state was previously predicted based on our EPR spectral broadening information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Velisetty et al., 2012</xref>). This mechanism is also consistent with lidocaine slowing desensitization by a ‘foot-in-the-door mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>). Other studies have suggested that lidocaine accelerates GLIC desensitization (although these were measured at lower lidocaine concentrations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gonzalez-Gutierrez and Grosman, 2015</xref>). Pore dehydration and loss of ion occupancy at the selectivity filter region have been implicated in C-type inactivation in voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>). Our structure lends strong support to the original ‘two-gate’ hypothesis that suggests the presence of two structurally distinct activation and desensitization gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auerbach and Akk, 1998</xref>). This model is also consistent with accessibility measurements of the pore lining residues in the three conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wilson and Karlin, 2001</xref>). At the functional level, pLGICs are known to display multiple desensitized states with dwell times ranging from milliseconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elenes and Auerbach, 2002</xref>). Although, an unequivocal assignment to one of these states is not discernable, prolonged agonist exposure favors a long-lived desensitized state, and we therefore hypothesize that this state may be favored in the crystal form.</p><p>Recently, structures of GABA<sub>A</sub>R-β3, GlyR, and nAChR-α4β2 were solved in the presence of agonists and are likely to represent desensitized conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). In these structures, a local constriction was noted in the M2 intracellular end, closer to the −2′ position, which is consistent with findings that picrotoxin binding at −2′ slows desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gielen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the extent of pore closure at −2′ appears to bear some correlation with the desensitization properties of the these channels: a stronger desensitization was observed for GABA<sub>A</sub>R-β3 and nAChR-α4β2 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>) in comparison to ivermectin/glycine evoked currents for GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Du et al., 2015</xref>). In terms of the structures, the pore is narrower in GABA<sub>A</sub>R-β3 and nAChR-α4β2 (~1.5–2 Å radius) compared to GlyR (~2.5 Å radius). Furthermore, in ELIC (a GABA-gated cation channel), the intracellular compression is suggested to also involve residues further up (6′ to −2′ positions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kinde et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, these mechanistic differences may underlie the broad range of desensitization kinetics observed within the family, encompassing time constants that span several orders of magnitude (&lt;1 ms for α7-nAChR, tens of seconds for GLIC and ELIC, and very little current decay observed for ρ1 GABA<sub>A</sub>R and α GlyR, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Keramidas and Lynch, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A notable aspect of the new conformation reported here is that it is stabilized by a physiologically relevant lipid molecule. The question still remains as to how DHA induces the observed conformational state. The DHA binding-site in the M4 vicinity was not surprising, considering the extensive functional and biophysical studies that have implicated M4 as the ‘lipid-sensor’ in pLGIC. Further, earlier studies predicted that the effect of free PUFA on nAChR inhibition occurs through allosteric mechanisms that alter lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Villar et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreasen and McNamee, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fernández Nievas et al., 2008</xref>) rather than through changes in bulk membrane fluidity. Although the M4 segment is least conserved in sequence, mutations (including those at the lipid-facing side of the helix) have been shown to alter gating, presumably by perturbing the protein structure or the lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bouzat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lasalde et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Li et al., 1992</xref>). Similarly, DHA appears to alter the interaction of the channel with an annular lipid molecule (PLC) in the M4 groove and, perhaps as a consequence, exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore conformation. Consistent with this idea, the occupancy of PLC in this site appears to be influenced by the conformational state of the channel. Particularly, the GLIC-pH7 and locally-closed GLIC structures show no electron density at this PLC site, suggesting that the open conformation may stabilize the binding of this lipid molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>). Further, the most notable consequence of propofol binding in the GLIC structure was the change in the orientation of PLC, suggesting that alterations in channel properties may arise from changes in lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Nury et al., 2011</xref>). In remarkable agreement, our EPR data show that residues lining the PLC pocket in the crystal structure (302–316 in M4 and the 118–121 in the β6-β7 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Velisetty et al., 2014</xref>]) show an increase in O<sub>2</sub> accessibility in the desensitized state, indicating that the lipid-accessibility of this pocket is increased upon activation. However, the pathway for allosteric coupling between the DHA binding site and the pore is not clear, since the conformations of M4, the M2-M3 linker, and the β6−β7 loop are nearly identical to those observed in the GLIC-pH4 structure. One possibility is that this region undergoes minimal structural change between the open and desensitized states. Further studies to stabilize the open GLIC conformation in membranes are needed to fully address this question.</p><p>Based on our EPR data, which show that the lipidic environment of M4 changes quite dramatically between the closed and desensitized states accompanied by an increase in intra-subunit distances, we propose that the M4 segment undergoes an outward tilt upon activation, mediated by the hinge/bend at the conserved proline residue in the middle of M4. The structural changes observed in EPR are consistent with the study in GLIC M4 that shows that mutational perturbations in the extracellular half of M4 have a greater effect on pH<sub>50</sub> in comparison to the intracellular end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hénault et al., 2015</xref>). The proposed M4 conformational change is also consistent with the lipid-mediated M4 tilt observed in isolated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antollini et al., 2005</xref>). Since this proline residue is also present in other members of the family including GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GlyRs, the proposed M4 movement could be a conserved mechanism. The outward M4 motion is associated with changes in both the polarity and the volume of the intra-subunit cavity and such a conformational change may underlie state-dependent accessibility of several lipophilic modulators (such as alcohols and anesthetics) of the pLGIC which are shown to bind in these cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mihic et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Nury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Howard et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, several residues on the TMD-facing side of M4lining this hydrophobic cavity, are proposed to bind allosteric modulators such as PNU-120596 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Young et al., 2008</xref>) and endogenous steroid (THDOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hosie et al., 2006</xref>), that modulate desensitization in nAChR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R, respectively. From a structural point of view, it is intriguing that the M4 position appears to be fixed with respect to the rest of the TM helices in the pLGIC structures, even though these structures may represent different conformational states. In contrast, functional analysis of M4 mutations and our EPR data seem to suggest that M4 is dynamic and experiences extensive change in environment during gating. Although we cannot explain this disparity with certainty, it is conceivable that M4 movements could be masked in a detergent environment. It is also possible that the lipidic environment around M4 changes without a significant change in the M4 backbone. We believe that high-resolution structural studies of pLGIC in a membrane environment, such as nanodiscs, are needed to address these differences.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that distinct regions of the pore control activation and desensitization in pLGICs, in contrast to the mechanisms proposed in tetrameric ligand-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sobolevsky, 2015</xref>). Pore dehydration and collapse of the selectivity region during desensitization/inactivation appears to be a conserved mechanism across many channel types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). The present work provides a structural view of the long-studied allosteric modulation of lipids on pLGIC desensitization and opens up new avenues for the investigation of more complex regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and functional measurements in oocytes: </title><p>The gene encoding GLIC was inserted into the pTLN vector for oocyte expression and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

First derivative absorption spectra were recorded at an incident microwave power of 2.0 mW, modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and modulation amplitude of 1.0 G. The EPR signal is normalized to the total number of spins in the sample by dividing the spectra by the peak-to-peak value of the double integral (which is proportional to the total number of spins). Our analyses were centered on two types of dynamic EPR structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Farahbakhsh et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altenbach et al., 2005</xref>): the first is lineshape parameter ΔH<sub>o</sub><sup>−1</sup>, calculated as the inverse of the central line width of the first derivative absorption spectra, which often times correlates with the mobility. ΔH<sub>o</sub><sup>−1</sup> is governed both by the local steric contacts in the immediate vicinity of the probe and by the flexibility of the backbone to which it is attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mchaourab et al., 1996</xref>).

Reversibility of structural changes was ensured by switching back to pH 7.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Expression of membrane scaffolding protein and GLIC reconstitution in nanodisc</title><p>Membrane scaffold protein (MSP1E3D1) was expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boldog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>) with some modifications. The MSP1E3D1 gene in pET-28a (a gift from Stephen Sligar: Addgene plasmid # 20066) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Denisov et al., 2007</xref>) was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and plated on LB-agar plates supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>). An overnight culture from a single colony was set up with LB supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and 1% glucose. The overnight culture was used to inoculate a 1L culture of Terrific broth supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and 0.2% glucose. The culture was grown at 37°C with shaking to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1.0, and induced by with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hr at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet resuspended in Buffer A containing 1 mM PMSF and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and lysed by homogenization. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 x g for for 30 min and the supernatant was bound to Ni-NTA equilibrated with Buffer A. The resin was washed with four bed volumes of Buffer B (300 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, and pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, four bed volumes of Buffer B containing 50 mM sodium cholate, four bed volumes of Buffer B, four bed volumes of Buffer B containing 20 mM imidazole, and eluted with Buffer B containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluted MSP1E3D1 was passed through a desalting column equilibrated with Buffer C (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and pH 7.5), and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient = 29,910 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>). The purity was assessed by SDS–PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography.</p><p>Detergent-solubilized spin-labeled GLIC mutants passed through gel-filtration columns were incorporated into lipid nanodiscs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, asolectin dissolved in chloroform was dried using nitrogen stream and rehydrated in Buffer A supplemented with 2 mM DDM. Each spin labeled mutant was mixed with rehydrated lipids and MSP1E3D1 in the GLIC:MSP:lipid = 1:3:360 molar ratio. The mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min with gentle rotation. Bio-beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were added to initiate reconstitution overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation. Bio-beads were then removed and the reconstitution mixture assessed by size-exclusion chromatography and SDS–PAGE. Samples were equilibrated in pH 7.0 (closed state) or pH 4.0 (desensitized state). We used pH 4.0 for DEER measurements due to potential instability issues of membrane scaffolding proteins in nanodisc at more acidic pH conditions. The peak corresponding to pentameric GLIC reconstituted into nanodiscs was collected and flash-frozen in 20% glycerol for DEER measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DEER measurements</title><p>Inter-subunit distances (&lt;50 Å) were measured using Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zou and McHaourab, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Jeschke et al., 2002</xref>) for spin-labeled samples reconstituted in nanodiscs. Four-pulse DEER experiments were performed using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer equipped with a SuperQ-FT pulse Q-band system with a 10 W amplifier and EN5107D2 resonator. The sample was loaded into a 1.1 mm inner diameter quartz capillary (Wilmad LabGlass, Buena, NJ) and mounted into the sample holder (plastic rod) inserted into the resonator. Dipolar time evolution data were obtained at 80K using a standard DEER four-pulse sequence (π/2)mw1–τ1–(π)mw1–τ1–(π)mw2–τ2–(π)mw1–τ2–echo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pannier et al., 2000</xref>) at Q-band frequency (~33.9 GHz). The experimental conditions were: pulse lengths for (π/2)mw1 and (π)mw1 were 10 and 20 ns, respectively, and 24 ns for (π)mw2, 80 MHz of frequency difference between probe and pump pulse, shot repetition time determined by spin-lattice relaxation rate (T<sub>1</sub>), 100 echo/point, and 2-step phase cycling. Data were collected out to ~2.0 µs for overnight data acquisition time. DEER signals were background-corrected assuming a 3D homogeneous background and analyzed by the Tikhonov regularization in the DEER Analysis 2014 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Jeschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chiang et al., 2005</xref>) to determine average distances and distributions in distance. The regularization parameter in the L curve was optimized by examining the fit of the time domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Membrane reconstitution and electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological measurements were made by patch clamp recordings in channel-reconstituted liposomes prepared as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Delcour et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cortes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chakrapani et al., 2007</xref>). Purified and spin-labelled GLIC mutants were reconstituted into preformed asolectin vesicles by diluting in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.0 (reconstitution buffer). The detergent was removed by incubating the proteoliposome suspension with biobeads overnight at 4°C. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hr and the pellet re-suspended in reconstitution buffer. A drop of the proteoliposome was placed on a glass slide and dried overnight in a desiccator at 4°C. The sample was then re-hydrated with 20 μl of buffer, which yielded giant liposomes. Channels were reconstituted in 1:10000 protein:lipid (molar ratio) for macroscopic currents. All currents measurements were made at room temperature by inside-out patch-clamping of proteoliposome under symmetrical NaCl concentrations. Recording pipettes were pulled from thin walled borosilicate glass, heat polished to a resistance of 1.5–2 MΩ, and filled with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.0. Currents were elicited in response to pH jumps (to pH 3.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM sodium citrate buffer) using an RCS-200 fast solution exchanger (switch time 2 ms) fed by gravity (BioLogic, Knoxville, TN). Currents were measured using Axopatch 200B, digitized at 10 kHz sampling frequency and were analysed using Clampfit 10.2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Crystallization</title><p>GLIC <italic>wt</italic> in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mM DDM was concentrated to between 9–10 mg/ml with an Amicon Ultra 50 KDa cutoff concentrator (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Prior to crystallization setup, the protein was supplemented with 50 μM DHA (from 300 mM DHA stock in ethanol) and 0.5 mg/ml <italic>E.coli</italic> polar extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) and incubated on ice for 1 hr. The protein was crystallized at 4°C by sitting drop vapor diffusion in Cryschem plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) with a 1:1 mixture (1 μl each) of protein and reservoir solution (225 mM ammonium sulfate, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.9–4.2 and 9–12% PEG4000). Crystals typically formed within one week and typically took 2–3 weeks to reach full size. The crystals were cryoprotected by adding 6 μL reservoir solution supplemented with 30% ethyleneglycol to the drop, and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen using appropriately sized microloops (MiTeGen, Ithaca, NY) or cryoloops (Hampton Research).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Structure determination</title><p>X-ray diffraction data were acquired on NE/CAT beamlines 24ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity:Lucia Sivilotti (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The prokaryotic ligand gated ion channels like the GLICs and ELICs serve as excellent models to lay the groundwork for structural understanding of mechanisms that underlie gating of pentameric ligand activated ion channels. Despite the fact that there are structures of GABAAR, GlyR and nAChR in a presumably desensitized states there are open questions as to what represents a desensitized conformation (see PMID 20863833). Here, the authors describe the x-ray structure of GLIC, a bacterial pH-gated pentameric ligand gated ion channel, in complex with DHA, a polyunsaturated fatty acid. The structure represents a novel desensitized pore conformation and also provides insight into how DHA, a naturally occurring modulator of nAChR and GABAAR, alters channel function. The structure reveals a heretofore unseen pore conformation, where the lower half of the channel is closed and the upper half is open. To further test whether these conformational changes are observed in a lipid environment, the authors have used EPR and DEER experiments to map conformational changes in transmembrane helices. While the reviewers appreciate the comprehensiveness of this work, they have significant concerns that should be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The connection between the x-ray structure with the new pore conformation and the EPR experiments studying the M4 helix is confusing to me. All of the referenced studies on the M4 helix being a lipid sensor are from the muscle/torpedo nicotinic receptor. To my knowledge GLIC is not known to sense lipids through M4, and unlike in the nicotinic receptor, mutants in GLIC's M4 helix are well tolerated. Moreover, from what I gather DHA does not interact with M4, and in this new structure, M4 superposes perfectly with that of GLIC in other conformations. Lastly, for all pLGIC for which structures are available in multiple conformations, the M4 helix does not appear to move independently relative to the rest of the helical bundle. The EPR experiments herein are thus hard to reconcile with the current and earlier findings, and might better fit as an independent study. Another reviewer noted that the discrepancy between the structure (very little movement except M2 cf open) and the EPR and DEER data (quite a bit of M4 rearrangement) should be clearly stated. I don't think that we in the field have enough information yet to form a plausible hypothesis to explain the discrepancies of the latter two points. I would not have a particular problem with admitting that we do not understand why these discrepancies occur- these are different proteins in different environments. The work remains interesting and relevant.</p><p>2) The GLIC-pH4-DHA structure shows a constriction at I9' position whose radius is 2.5 A. It is not clear why this is considered a gate for desensitized conformation. In the conducting GLIC-pH4, a constriction of similar dimension is seen below at T2' position. In fact, the structure at this position is essentially identical between the conducting and desensitized conformations. It does not appear that this is a steric hindrance for ion flux. Therefore, why is I9' position a desensitized gate. Did the authors make that determination based on lack of resolvable waters and ions below that position?</p><p>3) From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplementary subsidiaries, it appears that DHA is interacting with GLIC solely via its carboxylate to the arginine guanidinium, and the rest of the lipid is hanging out in space. No contacts are made with the rest of the receptor? Is the Arg118 side chain in a different conformation than in other GLIC structures? Is the beta6-beta7 loop in a different conformation? If there are other contacts and my impression is incorrect, please make a new figure panel or two illustrating in detail the atomic interactions. The conformation of the pore and the mechanism by which lipid stabilizes it stand out to me as the high impact aspects of the study.</p><p>4) Patch clamp data from all the mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> all look quantitatively and qualitatively different, which suggests that labeling may have a dramatic effect on function. What are your thoughts on the functionality of these labeled mutants, and is there an estimate of labeling stoichiometry?</p><p>5) Related to the above point- The reviewers had concerns as to why the extent of densensitization varies so much. The two electrode voltage clamp is not ideal technique to measure desensitization, as its slow exchange rate means that the peak measurement will be already somewhat distorted. Therefore, the patch clamp data and TEV data are not comparable. Unless not feasible for technical reasons, the authors should stick to just using the patch clamp method with fast exchange for functional characterization. Previous work from the same lab used the much more appropriate technique of fast agonist application to outside-out patches. If you plan to still show both patch clamp and TEV data, please be sure to clarify this in the figure legend to avoid any confusion.</p><p>6) In the Introduction, there are several statements that in my opinion should be toned down, as they overemphasize the significance and the robustness of various reports in the literature that do not sound terribly convincing. Desensitization is important, this is a good paper, there is no need to go over the top like this to persuade us that the work is important and had to be done. Introduction paragraph two physiological role of desensitization.… crucial role… I would tone this down. The contribution of desensitisation to synaptic transmission mediated by wild-type receptors is still a subject of discussion. Desensitization is hard to measure. In paragraph two membrane lipids are the key drivers of gating transitions… again please moderate this statement. Paragraph three “Reduced levels [of DHA] are linked with impaired learning ability….” (one of the papers cited is on cardiac channels…). Another reviewer states that it is probably an overstatement to say that a molecular understanding of desensitization is only now beginning to emerge, as there are decades of elegant functional studies and now several structures of eukaryotic receptors that are likely in desensitized states, and moreover, the low pH GLIC structures may represent a desensitized state (see e.g. PMID 20863833).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Crystal Structure and Dynamics of a Lipid-induced Potential Desensitized-State of a Pentameric Ligand-gated Channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

These can be addressed by moving some of the speculative parts into the Discussion section.</p><p>– Related to the discussion of the desensitization 'gate' paragraph five of subsection “Crystlal structure of GLIC bound to DHA”: there are two underlying assumptions in this paragraph that are supported by little or no experimental evidence. First, the idea that GLIC allows permeation of dehydrated ions, mechanistically akin to what happens in K<sup>+</sup> channels. Is there experimental evidence (not simulations) that support the notion of GLIC conducting dehydrated ions? Measurements made by Hille and others on eukaryotic members of the family concluded that permeation (in eukaryotes) is mediated by hydrated ions, with open pores having minimum diameters of 6-7.5A (for one example see PMID 6247422). The second assumption is that the low-pH structures of GLIC represent bona fide open states. To be fair we do not really know whether the low pH structures of GLIC represent open, desensitized or some kind of intermediate state. Careful fast-perfusion patch clamp experiments suggest that GLIC should be desensitized at steady state, as per the comment in the first round of review. To my knowledge no one has put a series of inorganic and organic cations through GLIC to define a minimal open channel diameter. In the absence of that kind of data, it seems safest to assume that the GLIC open channel looks roughly like a mammalian receptor open channel- with a constriction of 6-7.5A in diameter, like in the glycine receptor structure, which is even more open than that (from Gouaux's group). This paragraph may fit better in the discussion- up to the authors. Regardless I suggest it is reasonable to in this section discuss the possibility that we are looking rather at a second, perhaps deeper (and lipid-stabilized) desensitized state in this new structure (the authors very nicely touch upon this idea in the discussion). Additionally, there is a large body of structural and functional work now that supports the major desensitization gate being at the base of the channel (classical SCAM experiments, several recent structures, Trevor Smart's GABA-A recent paper on desensitization). GLIC may be different and lets through dehydrated ions, or this observed conformation may only be relevant to GLIC, we do not yet know. I fear that stating strongly that the desensitization gate in GLIC is at the 9' site, and not at the base of the pore, will confuse people, and that the data are not strong enough to support that single interpretation. I do appreciate the point about slowing/decreasing extent of desensitization with polar substitutions at the 9' position. What I would be more comfortable with is modifying this section just a bit to say the conformation of the pore observed in the structure is most likely impermeable to hydrated ions from 9' to the base of the pore, suggesting that the whole lower half of the pore forms the 'gate' in this conformation of GLIC.</p><p>7) Reviewers are still concerned that the limitations of TEVC recordings were not acknowledged. We are not asking additional experiments but just that you make it clear that the observed effects on desensitization may be in large part due to shortcomings of the TEVC system for rapid concentration jumps.</p><p>– I think I may be misunderstanding something in the author's response to point 5, related to using oocytes and TEVC because little rundown and complete recovery from desensitization are observed. The key point to me about fast perfusion vs. TEVC is that one does not observe the fast desensitization component in TEVC recordings. Thus, one cannot tell in TEVC if there is recovery or not- the observation in the response that recovery is not observed in patches further solidifies the argument that the TEVC results may be misleading. Again, though, I may not be understanding well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23886.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The connection between the x-ray structure with the new pore conformation and the EPR experiments studying the M4 helix is confusing to me.

I would not have a particular problem with admitting that we do not understand why these discrepancies occur- these are different proteins in different environments. The work remains interesting and relevant.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer in that GLIC is not as sensitive to membrane lipid composition as nAChRs and mutations in M4 are better tolerated. However, from a structural point of view, it is intriguing that the M4 position appears to be fixed with respect to the rest of the TM helices in the pLGIC structures, even though these structures may represent different conformational states. In contrast, functional analysis of M4 mutations in different members of the pLGIC and our EPR data seem to suggest that M4 is dynamic and may undergo a change in environment during gating. Although we cannot explain this disparity with certainty, it is conceivable that M4 movements could be masked in a detergent environment. It is also possible that the lipidic environment around M4 changes without a significant change in the M4 backbone. We believe that high-resolution structural studies of pLGIC in a membrane environment, such as nanodiscs, are needed to address these differences.</p><p><italic>2) The GLIC-pH4-DHA structure shows a constriction at I9' position whose radius is 2.5 A. It is not clear why this is considered a gate for desensitized conformation. In the conducting GLIC-pH4, a constriction of similar dimension is seen below at T2' position. In fact, the structure at this position is essentially identical between the conducting and desensitized conformations. It does not appear that this is a steric hindrance for ion flux. Therefore, why is I9' position a desensitized gate. Did the authors make that determination based on lack of resolvable waters and ions below that position?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this point. Given the hydrophobicity of the pore-facing of I9’ sidechains, the permeating ion is likely to be hydrated at this position (radius of hydrated sodium ion: 2.76 Å), and will therefore be occluded in the GLIC- DHA conformation (pore radius 2.4 Å), while it can still permeate through this region in the GLIC-pH4 conformation (pore radius 3.2 Å). On the other hand, although the pore radii at T2’ (GLIC- DHA: 2.5 Å and GLIC-pH4: 2.6 Å) are roughly similar to that of the I9’ position in GLIC-DHA, the T2’ region will not sterically hinder ion permeation since it can coordinate dehydrated sodium ions through T2’ side-chains (radius of dehydrated sodium ion: 1.02 Å). This closure at Ile9’ could also underlie the loss of ion and water occupancy below this position. However, resolution limitation precludes us from making significant interpretations about the conformation at 2’ position.</p><p><italic>3) From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplementary subsidiaries, it appears that DHA is interacting with GLIC solely via its carboxylate to the arginine guanidinium, and the rest of the lipid is hanging out in space. No contacts are made with the rest of the receptor? Is the Arg118 side chain in a different conformation than in other GLIC structures? Is the beta6-beta7 loop in a different conformation? If there are other contacts and my impression is incorrect, please make a new figure panel or two illustrating in detail the atomic interactions. The conformation of the pore and the mechanism by which lipid stabilizes it stand out to me as the high impact aspects of the study.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have modified the panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. Conformational changes in M4 and the β6–β7 loop (including Arg118) are rather small. Besides, a salt-bridge interaction with Arg118, DHA does not appear to engage with the rest of the protein. However it must be noted that the lipid chain is not fully resolved in this structure. We do not exclude the possibility of additional interactions given the remarkable flexibility of the unsaturated fatty acid chain. This is now discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>4) Patch clamp data from all the mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> all look quantitatively and qualitatively different, which suggests that labeling may have a dramatic effect on function. What are your thoughts on the functionality of these labeled mutants, and is there an estimate of labeling stoichiometry?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we agree that although spin-labeled M4 mutants exhibit pH dependent activation, the current traces reflect differences in functional properties. These variations may arise from a combination of impacts from cys mutagenesis as well as spin-labeling. The effect on gating kinetics did not come as a surprise considering previous reports in several pLGIC that show large gating changes in M4 mutants. Functional perturbation accompanying SDSL remains a caveat, and we acknowledge this in the text now. Having said that, we also note that since EPR measurements are made at steady-state conditions, the changes in “faster” components of kinetics may not significantly impact the interpretation. We have not determined the labeling stoichiometry for M4 since membrane exposed and peripheral regions of the channel typically have good labeling efficiencies (as was previously determined for the extracellular end of M2 ~90%) (Velisetty, et al. 2012). The signal-to-noise ratio of EPR signals (both in liposomes and nanodisc) were also indicative of good labeling.</p><p><italic>5) Related to the above point- The reviewers had concerns as to why the extent of densensitization varies so much. The two electrode voltage clamp is not ideal technique to measure desensitization, as its slow exchange rate means that the peak measurement will be already somewhat distorted.

If you plan to still show both patch clamp and TEV data, please be sure to clarify this in the figure legend to avoid any confusion.</italic> </p><p>It is rightly pointed out that these studies would be much more informative when carried out by patch-clamp electrophysiology using a fast perfusion system. We chose TEVC as the method to study modulation since we were able to observe complete channel recovery during several consecutive DHA pulses with minimal rundown. Patch-clamp measurements from spin-labeled and reconstituted channels were made under conditions that match those of EPR to show that the line shape and environmental parameter changes likely reflect gating conformational changes. We have included this information now in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>6) In the Introduction, there are several statements that in my opinion should be toned down, as they overemphasize the significance and the robustness of various reports in the literature that do not sound terribly convincing.
