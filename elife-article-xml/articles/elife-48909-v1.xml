Association between these domains forms the functional unit that enables transporters to adopt distinct conformations necessary for function. The small multidrug resistance (SMR) family provides an ideal system to explore the role of mutations in altering conformational preference since transporters from this family consist of antiparallel dimers that resemble the inverted repeats present in larger transporters. Here, we show using NMR spectroscopy how a single conservative mutation introduced into an SMR dimer is sufficient to change the resting conformation and function in bacteria. These results underscore the dynamic energy landscape for transporters and demonstrate how conservative mutations can influence structure and function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48909.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are bound by a thin membrane layer that protects the cell’s interior from the outside environment.

Structural and functional experiments have shown support for the alternating access model in which a transporter samples at least two different conformations that expose the substrate to the inside and outside environment of the cell membrane. The presence of inverted structural repeats within a single polypeptide chain is widespread in membrane protein transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shimizu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forrest and biology, 2013</xref>) and has been proposed as a mechanism to enable alternating access exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>). Proteins with structural repeats are thought to arise evolutionarily from the fusion of smaller membrane protein genes, such as three or four transmembrane (TM) domain transporters that associate into oligomers to achieve the functional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bay and Turner, 2009</xref>). One class of these proteins is the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schuldiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuldiner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paulsen et al., 1996</xref>) found in bacteria and archaea that contain four TM domains and assemble into antiparallel homodimers or heterodimers which resemble the inverted repeat structure in larger transporters. Homodimer transporters such as the multidrug efflux pump EmrE are able to insert into two opposing directions in the membrane (i.e. dual topology) whereas heterodimers are comprised of two genes that each insert into the membrane in a single orientation (i.e. single topology). The latter form the paired SMR (pSMR) subfamily and are thought to arise from gene duplication and evolution of dual topology SMR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bay and Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rapp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolbusz et al., 2010</xref>). The similarity of the quaternary structure displayed by the SMR family with the pseudo two-fold symmetry seen in larger transporters suggests a role for gene duplication and fusion of smaller genes to give rise to transporters commonly found in higher level organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lolkema et al., 2008</xref>). The widespread prevalence of inverted repeats and divergent evolution from homo-oligomeric proteins suggests that asymmetry between functional subunits may have a fitness advantage, such as for evolving substrate specificity and direction of transport.</p><p>This work aims to establish a structure-function correlation for how single mutations introduced into one subunit of the EmrE dimer – <italic>a minimal heterodimer</italic> – induce a shift in the conformational equilibrium between inward-open and outward-open states. EmrE is a native <italic>E. coli</italic> transporter that couples drug efflux of cationic/aromatic compounds with the proton gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuldiner, 2009</xref>). It has recently been shown that the coupling stoichiometry can proceed in a 1:1 or 2:1 proton:drug ratio, where the protons are bound by the glutamic acid residues at position 14 in the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). Since EmrE consists of an asymmetric and antiparallel homodimer, the relative energies between inward-open and outward-open states are identical for the wild-type protein. NMR spectroscopy has been a sensitive technique to probe this asymmetry by revealing a separate set of signals in the spectrum for monomers A and B within the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gayen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morrison et al., 2012</xref>). Determining the effect of a single mutation in the dimer would provide insight into the energy landscape by mimicking a primitive evolutionary event such as those that may have led to the pSMR subfamily. Previously, we discovered that conservative mutations located within or close to loop 2 of EmrE modulated the overall rate of conformational exchange between inward-open and outward-open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayen et al., 2016</xref>). Loop 2 is comprised of a short stretch of residues (approximately Tyr53, Ile54, and Pro55) and adjoins TM2 and TM3 of EmrE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Loop 2 of monomer A is located on the open side of the transporter and does not make intermolecular contacts with monomer B in the tetraphenylphosphonium bound form, while loop 2 from monomer B is proximal to loop 3 of monomer A and near the bottom of the substrate cavity formed by TM1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vermaas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ovchinnikov et al., 2018</xref>). The differential contacts in the structure and distinct chemical shifts for each monomer suggest a minimal heterodimer might influence the conformational equilibrium. Indeed, our preliminary experiments showed that a heterodimer formed between wild-type and a mutant from loop 2 (I54L) or a mutant from the N-terminal region of TM3 (I62L) could induce a change in the conformational equilibrium between inward-open and outward-open states when bound to the high affinity compound tetraphenylphosphonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayen et al., 2016</xref>). While these measurements support the presence of differential contacts of loop 2 within monomers A and B, no biological significance was offered for these findings or whether the conformational equilibrium was perturbed for other essential forms of the transporter needed to accomplish transport (i.e., proton-bound states, apo states).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48909.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conservative mutations within EmrE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top panel shows the primary sequence of EmrE and indicates the TM helices and loops.

These measurements revealed that both protonated and deprotonated drug-free forms of the L51I/wild-type heterodimer displayed a greater change in the conformational equilibrium relative to the drug-bound state.

EmrE samples were prepared in magnetically aligned bicelles consisting of a 3.5/1 molar ratio of long chain (<italic>O</italic>-14:0-PC) and short chain (6:0-PC) phospholipids at a pH value of 5.8 that corresponds to the Glu14 proton-bound form of EmrE. Solid-state NMR experiments were carried out using the PISEMA experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 1994</xref>), since this technique gives the largest frequency separation between peaks corresponding to the two monomers within the asymmetric dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gayen et al., 2013</xref>). PISEMA spectra of homodimer samples of wild-type, L51I, and I62L selectively labeled with <sup>15</sup>N-tyrosine are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

In each experiment, only the wild-type or mutant was isotopically enriched with <sup>15</sup>N-tyrosine and mixed with its partner protein at natural abundance. Using this approach, only one protein was NMR active, while the other was NMR silent. PISEMA spectra corresponding to wild-type/L51I or wild-type/I62L where wild-type was isotopically enriched showed a primary set of intense peaks that corresponded to monomer B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These signals were superimposable onto those peaks in the wild-type EmrE PISEMA spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we carried out the reverse experiments where the mutants were isotopically enriched and wild-type was NMR silent. In these spectra, the isotopically enriched mutant (L51I or I62L) in the mixed dimer also showed an intense set of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), yet these signals did not overlap with those of isotopically enriched wild-type in the mixed dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The peak positions did however match onto the corresponding peaks in the L51I and I62L homodimer PISEMA spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate that wild-type EmrE has a preference for monomer B in the heterodimer while L51I or I62L prefers monomer A for the proton-bound form of EmrE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is important to note that the mixture of wild-type EmrE and the L51I or I62L mutant produces a statistical fraction of heterodimers and homodimers in the samples. While our analysis focused on the most intense set of signals, we were able to resolve a weaker set of signals that likely corresponded to homodimers at a lower contour level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The latter was possible due to the increased sensitivity of methyl detection in solution NMR spectroscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectrum of isotopically enriched wild-type EmrE in a mixed dimer sample with L51I. From this spectrum, we observed an intense set of signals corresponding to monomer B, which confirms the results of our solid-state NMR experiments in aligned lipid bicelles. Thus, under sample conditions used to collect solution and solid-state NMR spectra (i.e. isotropic and aligned bicelles, respectively), the skewed conformational equilibrium is preserved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48909.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Determination of conformational equilibria among different states within the transport cycle probed with solution NMR.</title><p>HMQC spectra of wild-type (middle row, green spectra) or isotopically enriched wild-type mixed with 3-fold excess L51I at natural abundance (bottom row, black spectra).

Previously, we reported pH induced chemical shift perturbations within EmrE’s NMR methyl spectrum that were centered at a pH value of 7.0 and corresponded to a biologically relevant <italic>pK<sub>a</sub></italic> of Glu14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayen et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we acquired a <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C HMQC spectrum with a mixed sample of <sup>13</sup>C enriched EmrE and natural abundance L51I at a pH value of 9.1. Similar to the proton-bound dataset, this spectrum showed intense peaks that corresponded to the signals stemming from monomer B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the spectrum of wild-type EmrE at high pH that showed approximately equal intensities of monomer A and B peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result supports the conclusion that the skewed conformational equilibrium is preserved under conditions in which Glu14 is deprotonated. Note that we also observed monomer A signals at a lower contour level, which arises due to the statistical nature of mixing as discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using the relative peak intensities of A and B signals in the spectrum, we estimated the equilibrium population of wild-type EmrE to assume monomer B in the heterodimer at ~96% (range of 90% to 99% based on standard deviation). This value corresponds to a free energy of ~1.8 kcal/mol induced by the L51I mutation in the heterodimer.</p><p>To determine the effect of drug binding on the conformational equilibrium, we acquired NMR spectra for the mixed dimers in the presence of ethidium and tetraphenylphosphonium. These drug substrates are commonly used in the EmrE literature for measuring resistance, transport, and binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yerushalmi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Curnow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>). Addition of ethidium induced a significant amount of spectral broadening and ablation of peak intensities in both the wild-type sample and that of the mixed dimer where wild-type was isotopically enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest intermediate chemical exchange, which likely stems from motion corresponding to exchange between inward-open and outward-open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). From these data, it is likely that the equilibrium is less skewed in the mixed sample upon ethidium binding. Namely, if the populations were maintained to the same extent as in the mixed dimer sample at pH 9.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the effect of intermediate chemical exchange would not induce peak broadening beyond detection. Hence, the effect of ethidium binding suggests that the conformational bias is reduced when the heterodimer is bound to a drug substrate. Furthermore, the line-broadening supports the presence of drug-induced dynamics in the heterodimer, which would enable conformational exchange needed for drug transport.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the effect of tetraphenylphosphonium binding on the conformational equilibrium. Unlike ethidium, tetraphenylphosphonium binds with greater affinity to EmrE and significantly reduces the rate of conformation exchange (i.e. slow chemical exchange regime) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morrison and Henzler-Wildman, 2014</xref>). We carried out the same NMR experiment by adding tetraphenylphosphonium to a mixed dimer sample of <sup>13</sup>C<sup>δ</sup>-Ile labeled EmrE mixed with natural abundance L51I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Unlike the effect of ethidium binding, the spectra were nicely resolved in the presence of tetraphenylphosphonium. We observed that monomer B peaks were more intense relative to those of monomer A; however, the signal intensities stemming from monomer A were significantly greater compared to any of the drug-free samples (see I58<sup>A</sup>, I62<sup>A</sup>, and I88<sup>A</sup> peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Specifically, the ratio of monomer B to A peak intensities were reduced upon addition of tetraphenylphosphonium relative to the deprotonated sample. Using the relative peak intensities of A and B, we estimated the equilibrium population of wild-type to assume monomer B in the heterodimer at ~86% (standard deviation range of 79% to 92%), which corresponds to ~1.1 kcal/mol induced by the single mutant in the heterodimer. This result is in agreement with the ethidium binding experiment. These data also provide evidence that drug binding would not <italic>trap</italic> the transporter into a single conformation in the transport cycle and is consistent with previous work proposing the substrate controls the rate of conformational exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morrison and Henzler-Wildman, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional assays in <italic>E. coli</italic> reveal biological significance for equilibrium changes</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> growth inhibition assays against ethidium bromide were carried out to determine the biological significance of our NMR observations.

Remarkably, when EmrE<sup>in</sup> was co-expressed with L51I or I62L, we observed a significant reduction in ethidium resistance on LB agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To the contrary, EmrE<sup>out</sup> co-expressed with L51I or I62L retained the same phenotype as the single-site mutant alone. To provide additional support, we carried out resistance assays in liquid media. These experiments were performed by growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures containing plasmids to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0, then adding ethidium and recording the culture density as a function of time. Similar to the LB agar plate results, we found that the L51I or I62L mutant expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> displayed a faster drop in the optical density, which signified a reduced ability to confer resistance relative to the same mutant expressed with EmrE<sup>out</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). It is important to note that if heterodimers of L51I or I62L and EmrE<sup>in</sup> did not form, we would have observed the same resistance phenotype of L51I or I62L alone. However, the reduced phenotype and the control experiments discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicate a specific association in the transporter complementation experiments that are influenced by the conformational equilibrium within the assembled heterodimer in the cell membrane.</p><p>To provide direct evidence that the overall rate of ethidium transport was different between the mutant co-expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> and EmrE<sup>out</sup>, we performed an ethidium efflux assay by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of ethidium. <italic>E. coli</italic> were treated with ethidium bromide and the ionophore carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which causes the cytoplasmic ethidium concentration and fluorescence to increase. Upon addition of glucose and removal of CCCP, the membrane potential is reestablished, and the fluorescence decreases as ethidium is transported out of the cytoplasm. This assay was performed with L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> or EmrE<sup>out</sup>. Immediately following the addition of glucose, the fluorescence dropped ~3 fold faster for L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>out</sup> than L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the fluorescence value at steady state (3600 s) was significantly lower for L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>out</sup> compared to L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This indicates a reduced cytoplasmic ethidium concentration for the L51I/EmrE<sup>out</sup> sample. Taken together, these data are consistent with the resistance assay results and support the conclusion that a change in the conformational equilibrium can influence the overall rate of drug efflux. Note that a previous study reported an ethidium efflux rate difference of 1.6-fold between wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> and an AcrAB-TolC efflux pump knockout strain that led to a 30-fold difference in the minimum inhibitory concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paixão et al., 2009</xref>). This shows that somewhat modest transport rate differences can have deleterious effects on bacterial growth, which stems from increased ethidium accumulation that leads to irreversible binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jernaes and Steen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lambert and Le Pecq, 1984</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rationalization for why a change in the conformational equilibrium influences phenotype</title><p><italic>How does the NMR observed conformational change of the heterodimer correlate with the functional results?</italic> The transporter complementation experiments create topologically defined heterodimers due to the single topology of EmrE<sup>in</sup> and EmrE<sup>out</sup> and the antiparallel association of the dimer quaternary structure. Using this information and knowledge from NMR experiments that the mutant had a preference for monomer A in the heterodimer, we can make inferences about how a shift in the conformational equilibrium influences function. Specifically, the mutant paired with EmrE<sup>out</sup> in a heterodimer would favor the inward-open/cytoplasmic-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Likewise, the mutant paired with EmrE<sup>in</sup> will bias toward the outward-open/periplasmic-facing conformation under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Hence, the resistance assay results suggest that the conformational equilibrium favoring the outward-open/periplasmic state has a deleterious impact on the overall transport cycle. In contrast, a heterodimer with a conformation favoring the inward-open/cytoplasmic facing conformation gives no measurable reduction in phenotype. This finding is in harmony with our prior observation that the role of the pH gradient is to favor the inward-open conformation that is poised for drug binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayen et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, reducing the effect of the pH gradient by biasing the equilibrium in the opposite direction apparently is sufficient to alter the net transport as observed in growth inhibition experiments and efflux assays.</p><p>It is important to underscore that the equilibrium constant between inward-open and outward-open states of the heterodimer ultimately stems from differential kinetic rate constants pertaining to the inward-open to outward-open and outward-open to inward-open transitions (see kinetic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the primary kinetic steps in the transport cycle that influence the observed phenotype are the inward-open to outward-open and outward-open to inward-open rates for the drug-free heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, see double asterisks). We make this conclusion based on two observations. First, the populations were more skewed for the drug-free states than those for the drug bound states. Second, NMR experiments with ethidium indicate that the conformational exchange was not halted in the heterodimer. The latter means that the conformational bias does not result in a <italic>locked-state</italic> that would ultimately lead to loss-of-function (i.e. no substrate turnover).</p><p>To provide support for this conclusion, we performed a numerical simulation of pH-driven transport into liposomes using the kinetic model and parameters introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al. (2017)</xref>. The differences were to change the inward-open to outward-open and outward-open to inward-open conformational exchange rates based on the populations observed in our heterodimer experiments and to account for the fact that drug binding affinities to wild-type(A)/mutant(B) and mutant(A)/wild-type(B) are not necessarily the same (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using these simulations, we found that the rate of drug transport was ~5.6 fold faster for a heterodimer of mutant and EmrE<sup>out</sup> versus a heterodimer of mutant and EmrE<sup>in</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the former achieved a small but significant increase in the final concentration of drug within the vesicles, which further suggests that differences in kinetic rates in EmrE’s transport cycle give rise to a change in the cytoplasmic drug concentration between heterodimers with opposite insertion topologies in <italic>E. coli</italic>. These calculations correlate with the enhanced phenotype and increased rate of ethidium efflux and provide evidence that shifting conformational equilibria via specific rate constants in a transport cycle has a direct impact on functional output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the prominence of inverted repeat domains within transporters, there are only a few examples of mutational studies to influence conformational equilibria. These experiments involve the creation of loss-of-function, non-conservative mutations (e.g. Trp to Gly) at key structural contacts with the goal of crystallographically trapping particular conformations in the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smirnova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Latorraca et al., 2017</xref>). Our observations demonstrate that a minimal heterodimer comprised of a single conservative mutation is sufficient to disrupt the preferred resting conformation and underscore the presence of a dynamic energy landscape where relatively small energy differences exist among conformations in the transport cycle. From an evolutionary perspective, we hypothesize there might be fitness advantages for having separate genes that form a hetero-oligomer or a single polypeptide chain where the structural repeats are contained within one protein. In these cases, a single mutation can be introduced within the functional assembly that is not possible for a homo-oligomeric protein. Functional differences between closely related proteins stemming from one mutation in a hetero-oligomer versus multiple mutations in a homo-oligomer could potentially include influencing the propensity of a transporter to carry out antiport or symport. In fact, in addition to EmrE’s known antiport activity, it is also able to carry out symport under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>), including import of polyamines upon mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brill et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the observation that conservative mutations can display skewed conformational equilibria and influence function opens the possibility of somewhat modest evolutionary paths for achieving symport or antiport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Protein expression and purification was carried out as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gayen et al., 2013</xref>).

Ethidium bromide (10 μg/mL) was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C while shaking. Cells were spun down for 10 min and the pellet was kept on ice until the florescence experiment. For the efflux assay, cells were resuspended in minimal media A with 10 μg/mL ethidium bromide. To initiate the assay, 0.2% (w/v) glucose was added. Control experiments were carried out by treating the cells in the same manner except without adding glucose. The fluorescence decays were measured with a Molecular Devices FlexStation 3 instrument using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm. The fluorescence was recorded over a time period of 3600 s. Each experiment was acquired in duplicate and repeated at least two times. The error bars reflect the duplicate experiments carried out on the same day.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH (R01 AI108889) and NSF awards (MCB 1506420) to NJT.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy A Cross (Reviewer #1).</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors examine the conformational equilibrium of homodimeric EmrE transporter. Individual EmrE promoters insert and assemble in anti-parallel manner and each assumes conformation A or confirmation B. Their structural transition from A to B and from B to A conformations leads to the transition between states open to the periplasm or cytoplasm. Because protomers are identical, there is no conformational bias toward either outward or inward facing states. The authors introduce single subtle mutations into a protomer and show that when such protomers assemble with WT protomers they demonstrate conformational preference for conformation A, while WT protomers assume preferentially conformation B. Now, when mutants are assembled with WT protomers whose insertion topology is fixed by additional mutations relying on &quot;positive inside&quot; principle, the authors presumably generate in cells assemblies that have preferential outward- or inward-facing configurations. They show that conformational preference for the inward-facing states results in active assemblies, while conformational preference for the outward-facing state leads to reduced activity. This is an elegant study that probes the role of the so-called &quot;energy landscape&quot; in defining the rate of transport. The reviews have found both the solid-state and the solution NMR spectroscopies to be well done and cell assays appropriate and informative. There were several aspects of the work that, however, raised concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key experiments in this manuscript cover ground that was already covered in the authors' 2016 Nature Chemical Biology paper (Gayen et al., 2016). It is a really interesting observation that a single mutation in only one subunit changes the energy landscape. This observation, originally reported in Gayen et al., is replicated using a different NMR strategy here. It would be critical for the authors to articulate what is different and new in the current study. It was also puzzling why different mutants were used in this paper compared to the 2016 paper. On the related note, the Introduction section was perceived as insufficient to introduce non-specialists to the EmrE class of transporters and to explain what the goals of the current experiments are.</p><p>2) The reviewers were surprised by how facile the preparation of the heterodimers was. Mixing for 1 hour at 37 °C is often insufficient to achieve subunit exchange in membrane proteins. Slower kinetics is typical for membrane proteins in general (Jefferson…Bowie, JACS, 2013), and has been reported for EmrE specifically (Rotem…Schuldiner JBC 2001). The authors should present evidence that complete mixing has been achieved. Further, fast kinetics also raises question whether monomers are present in the mix at significant levels during data collection. The authors should address this concern. Finally, there exists the possibility that the subunits actually exchange during the experiment. The experiments with labeled Tyr have very close to equal amounts of labeled and unlabeled protein, so the effect of subunit exchange would be expected to be pretty substantial. How would this change the results?</p><p>3) The reviewers further felt that the paper would be significantly strengthened if the authors took more quantitative approach to the analysis of populations. &quot;Conformational preference&quot; is an imprecise term. The authors should consider analyzing populations quantitatively to estimate free energies associated with preferred conformations. This is particularly pertinent because mutations are, indeed, very subtle and putting numbers on their effects would be informative.</p><p>4) The reviewers were surprised further by how detrimental to the bacterial survival the mutations were. How significant should be the population shift to lead to a complete loss of resistance to ethidium bromide? Even in the authors' simulations, the difference in uptake rate is only three-fold and it is difficult to reconcile such relatively subtle kinetic effects with complete loss of resistance. It would be important for the authors to comment on this more explicitly.</p><p>5) The Figure 5D is confusing. Why is there a conformational preference for the inward-facing state in EmrE<sup>in</sup>/EmrE<sup>out</sup> dimer? Should not it, like WT, have no conformational preference? What is exactly depicted in the middle panel? Here, the preference should be for the outward-facing state shouldn't it? Perhaps, the figure should be remade to make the point the authors are making clearer. It might be better to show the entire transport cycle and point out which rates are likely affected by the asymmetry generated by mutations within the assemblies with EmrE<sup>in</sup> or EmrE<sup>out</sup> variants. Such depiction may also allow to clarify which conclusions are fully supported by the data and which are more speculative in nature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I found this work to be very clever and the results to be exciting. Both the solid-state and solution NMR spectroscopies were well done as were the assay studies. However, as a membrane protein spectroscopist and as someone who has not kept up with the EmrE literature, I found the start of the Results and Discussion text very difficult to comprehend. The Introduction did not include an introduction to EmrE, but only to the class of transporters – as a result I found the Results and Discussion section difficult to comprehend – a paragraph in the Introduction about EmrE in/out, EmrE A and B etc. would be helpful for a broader audience.</p><p>The study involves the functional characterization of two conservative mutants of an antiparallel dimeric transporter, EmrE. These mutants L51I and I62L result in preferential roles when paired with a WT monomer. Furthermore, these WT/mutant hybrids result in modified functionality. Clever mutation of EmrE by changing the inward facing charge on the structure results in an inward facing structure EmrE<sup>in</sup> and an outward facing structure EmrE<sup>out</sup>, these mutants in combination displayed resistance to ethidium. Furthermore, the EmrE dimers of L51I and dimers of I62L display resistance to ethidium, but L51I with EmrE<sup>in</sup> and I62L with EmrE<sup>in</sup> both displayed reduced resistance to ethidium. However, the mutants paired with EmrE<sup>out</sup> displayed WT resistance to ethidium. Based on the structural studies with NMR spectroscopy the authors were able to note that the conservative EmrE mutants have a preference for monomer A in the heterodimers with WT. For EmrE<sup>out</sup> with a mutant the heterodimer preference is inward-open/cytoplasmic-facing conformation and for EmrE<sup>in</sup> the preference was for the outward-open/periplasmic-facing conformation under the same drug free conditions. This led the authors to justifiably make two conclusions: 1) that the &quot;outward-open/periplasmic (facing) state has a deleterious impact on the overall transport cycle&quot; and 2) that the &quot;inward-open/cytoplasmic facing conformation&quot; gives no such deleterious effect. This is really an elegant detective story involving these subtle mutations at the ends of two TM helices that anchor an extramembrane loop.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript from the Traaseth lab investigates the effect of a pair of conservative mutations, L52I and I62L, on protein conformation and drug export function in EmrE.</p><p>The best experiments in this manuscript cover ground that was already covered in the authors' 2016 Nature Chemical Biology paper (Gayen et al., 2016). It is a really interesting observation that a single mutation in only one subunit changes the energy landscape. This observation, originally reported in Gayen et al., is replicated using a different NMR strategy here. However, my overall impression of the manuscript is that the follow-up experiments are too observational and qualitative. There are a lot of aspects of this study that I find surprising (beyond the fact that a one methyl group alteration does anything at all!), and presenting these surprising observations without deeper digging is somewhat unsatisfying.</p><p>I'm surprised that the subunit mixing is so extensive. The 1 hr, 37 °C incubation that the authors use to achieve heterodimers suggests faster subunit exchange kinetics than is typical for membrane proteins in general (Jefferson…Bowie, JACS, 2013), or what has been reported for EmrE specifically (Rotem…Schuldiner JBC 2001). Are there monomers in equilibrium too? I would feel more comfortable if the authors had some way to assess monomer vs. heterodimer vs. homodimer populations in their samples. Moreover, I do not know what temperature/acquisition time was used to collect the NMR data shown here (or how the kinetics differ in detergent vs. bicelles vs. solid state bilayer), but if subunit mixing reaches equilibrium in an hour, there certainly exists the possibility that the subunits actually exchange during the experiment. The experiments with labeled Tyr have very close to equal amounts of labeled and unlabeled protein, so the effect of subunit exchange would be expected to be pretty substantial. How would this change the results?</p><p>The term &quot;conformational preference&quot; is used throughout. Is there some reason the authors don't frame this as conformational equilibrium? I assume that this is some kind of equilibrium process - the heterodimers also go through conformational exchange, except that now the equilibrium more strongly favors the mutant subunit in one state, and the wildtype subunit in the other. This is one area where a more rigorous analysis of equilibrium constants would be very useful. Can the differences in peak volume be measured/reported? A numerical ratio comparing two residues in the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; positions would be a better metric than trying to evaluate how peak intensity and width change from the bird's eye view. For example in Figure 3A, I'm just not able to evaluate the author's assertion that the heterodimer has shifted the population towards &quot;B.&quot; There aren't, to my eye, enough assigned peaks and direct A:B comparisons.</p><p>I'm also very surprised that the EmrE-in/mutant heterodimers are so sensitive to ethidium (as sensitive as abolishing one of the glutamates!). Survival changes by four orders of magnitude! While this paper is short on quantitation, in the previous Nat. Chem Biol paper, the authors estimated that the heterodimer favors one conformation over the other by about 2:1 (compared to 1:1 for WT). In terms of Delta G, this is a small change. The authors agree that their data does not indicate that the mutant locks the transporter in one configuration, and have shown that conformational exchange still occurs for the homodimeric mutant. So I'm puzzled by the extent to which this mutant disables drug export.</p><p>In addition, I have some concerns about data presentation. Even though the authors are forthright about doing so, I don't like the maneuver of cutting the contour levels to obscure non-A or non-B peaks in Figure 2. I think the spectra included in the supplement, which show both populations of peaks, are a more faithful visual representation of the actual data. I also don't like showing part of the Figure 1B spectrum at 4x noise, and the rest of the spectrum at 5x noise. I'm guessing that some unexplainable peaks appear elsewhere in the spectrum at 4x noise, which could indicate sample heterogeneity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, the authors examine the conformational equilibrium of homodimeric EmrE transporter.

Why is there a conformational preference for the inward-facing state in EmrE<sup>in</sup>/EmrE<sup>out</sup> dimer. Should not it, like WT, have no conformational preference? What is exactly depicted in the middle panel. Here, the preference should be for the outward-facing state, right? I think that this figure should be remade. It might be better to show the entire transport cycle and point out which rates are likely affected by the asymmetry generated by mutations within the assemblies with EmrE<sup>in</sup> or EmrE<sup>out</sup> variants. My first take on this is as follows: the conformational exchange of the drug-bound transporter is comparatively fast and is not rate-limiting to the cycle. Thus, it is the rate of the transition of the substrate-free transporter that determines the overall rate. In the transport cycle, where drug extrusion is coupled to influx of protons, the outward to inward translocation of the protonated transporter would determine the overall rate. Thus, if mutation favors the inward-facing conformation of Mut/EmrE<sup>out</sup> dimer, it might do so through accelerating the rate of outward to inward transition and therefore speeding up the cycle. Or, alternatively, it could slow the reverse transition from outward to inward and increase the amount of time for the drug to be successfully released into the periplasm.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48909.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key experiments in this manuscript cover ground that was already covered in the authors' 2016 Nature Chemical Biology paper (Gayen et al., 2016).

On the related note, the Introduction section was perceived as insufficient to introduce non-specialists to the EmrE class of transporters and to explain what the goals of the current experiments are.</p></disp-quote><p>The novelty of the current work is to show how the energy landscape is perturbed by a single mutation for several states in the transport cycle and to provide functional support for these in vitro observations. The previous publication in 2016 reported a change in the conformational equilibrium for only the tetraphenylphosphonium bound state and did not report any functional significance for the observation. The revised submission underscores the structure-function relationship we aim to develop while clearly delineating what was previously studied and what is novel about our current work (see Introduction, second and third paragraphs).</p><p>With regard to mutations, our initial report in 2016 utilized the I54L and I62L mutations. Since this publication, we discovered that the L51I mutation has the most prominent effect in influencing the conformational equilibrium when paired with a wild-type monomer. For this reason, the majority of our studies were performed with this mutation. The revised version states this point in the Introduction section (second and third paragraphs).</p><p>As referenced above, the Introduction has been revamped to provide additional background information on EmrE and to more clearly articulate the goals of our experiments. We also highlight what was accomplished in the 2016 paper, which will enable the reader to identify the novelty of our current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers were surprised by how facile the preparation of the heterodimers was. Mixing for 1 hour at 37 °C is often insufficient to achieve subunit exchange in membrane proteins. Slower kinetics is typical for membrane proteins in general (Jefferson…Bowie, JACS, 2013), and has been reported for EmrE specifically (Rotem…Schuldiner JBC 2001). The authors should present evidence that complete mixing has been achieved. Further, fast kinetics also raises question whether monomers are present in the mix at significant levels during data collection. The authors should address this concern. Finally, there exists the possibility that the subunits actually exchange during the experiment. The experiments with labeled Tyr have very close to equal amounts of labeled and unlabeled protein, so the effect of subunit exchange would be expected to be pretty substantial. How would this change the results?</p></disp-quote><p>The EmrE dimer has been shown to be at least 1000-fold more stable in lipids compared to dodecyl maltoside (DDM) detergent micelles (Dutta et al., 2014). This is pertinent to the monomer exchange experiments reported by Rotem et al., since they were carried out by solubilizing <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes with DDM (i.e., native lipids were present). This is in contrast to the preparation of our heterodimer samples, which were carried out on purified proteins in DDM (i.e., few native lipids present). In our hands, purified EmrE in DDM in the drug-free state cannot be heated above ~40 °C without noticeable precipitation after 1 hr. This likely reflects the presence of monomers during the mixture procedure that would increase kinetics relative to the Rotem et al. study. To provide evidence that the mixing is complete, we prepared two parallel samples, where one was incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr and the other was incubated at 37 °C for 19 hrs. Solution NMR samples were prepared in the same way. The ratio of subunit A and B signals was statistically the same between the samples, which supports that complete mixing has been achieved (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The next question was whether there are monomers in our NMR samples. The EmrE dimer is at least 1000-fold more stable in lipid bilayers and ~100-fold more stable in lipid bicelles compared to DDM detergent micelles (Dutta et al., 2014). Furthermore, NMR spectra show only two peaks per residue, where each set of signals stems from one monomer in the asymmetric dimer. This has been confirmed by NMR spectroscopy on cross-linked dimers that give the same peak position as wild-type samples (Cho et al., 2014) and also agrees with the asymmetry seen in cryoEM (Tate et al., EMBO J, 2001, 20, 77-81) and X-ray datasets (Chen et al., 2007). This fact is further underscored by the heterodimer experiments presented in the current work, where each monomer in the heterodimer gives rise to one set of signals.</p><p>The last question is whether exchange of labeled and unlabeled proteins occur during the NMR experiments. While exchange is theoretically possible, to the extent that it occurs, it would not change any of our conclusions for two reasons. First, exchange in bicelles would be a slow process on the NMR timescale since the peak positions do not move relative to those of the respective homodimers. This is consistent with the stability of the EmrE dimer reported in bicelles (Dutta et al., 2014). Second, the system is at equilibrium as established from the 1 hr and 19 hr mixing experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), so any subunit exchange would be offset to maintain identical peak intensities of monomers A and B. The fact that the Tyr labeled PISEMA experiments used a lower ratio of isotopically enriched protein to natural abundance protein only changes the expected statistical fraction of homodimers and heterodimers in the sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers further felt that the paper would be significantly strengthened if the authors took more quantitative approach to the analysis of populations. &quot;Conformational preference&quot; is an imprecise term. The authors should consider analyzing populations quantitatively to estimate free energies associated with preferred conformations. This is particularly pertinent because mutations are, indeed, very subtle and putting numbers on their effects would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>In the resubmission, we quantified the relative populations in the heterodimer equilibrium corresponding to wild-type and the L51I mutant:</p><p>WTA∙mutantB⇌mutantA∙WTB</p><p>The calculation is described in detail in the Materials and methods section “Quantification of Populations from Heterodimer Samples”. The populations are reported in the Results section “Assessing Conformational Preference for Different States within the Transport Cycle” for the drug-free deprotonated and the tetraphenylphosphonium bound heterodimers derived from solution NMR experiments shown in Figure 3. The populations of wild-type assuming monomer B in the heterodimer were estimated to be 96% for the apo form and 86% for the tetraphenylphosphonium bound form. These values correspond to free energies of ~1.8 kcal/mol for the apo form and ~1.1 kcal/mol for the tetraphenylphosphonium-bound form. In the Results section, we also report the error range which reflects the deviation among residues used for the calculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers were surprised further by how detrimental to the bacterial survival the mutations were. How significant should be the population shift to lead to a complete loss of resistance to ethidium bromide? Even in the authors' simulations, the difference in uptake rate is only three-fold and it is difficult to reconcile such relatively subtle kinetic effects with complete loss of resistance. It would be important for the authors to comment on this more explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We realized that the drug binding constants for the heterodimer in the simulation is not the same for wild-type(A)/L51(B) and L51I(A)/wild-type(B). In the resubmission, the binding constants were adjusted by the ratio of the equilibrium constants governing the AB to BA transition for the heterodimer in the absence and presence of the drug. The revised simulations (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) show that the concentration of drug into the liposome mutant/EmrE<sup>out</sup> is slightly greater than for the mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup> sample. However, there is a notable difference in the initial rate of transport. Based on these simulations, we hypothesized that the difference in the transport rate by mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup> and mutant/EmrE<sup>out</sup> would lead to a greater cytoplasmic accumulation of ethidium for mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup>. The higher accumulation would display a reduced minimum inhibitory concentration, causing mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup> to be more susceptible at the ethidium concentration used in growth inhibition assays. To provide evidence that the overall rate of ethidium transport was different between mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup> and mutant/EmrE<sup>out</sup> in vivo, we carried out an ethidium efflux assay by following the intrinsic fluorescence of ethidium. In this assay, the membrane potential is disrupted with the ionophore carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), causing the cytoplasmic ethidium concentration in the cell to increase and give rise to higher fluorescence. Upon addition of glucose and removal of CCCP, the membrane potential is re-established and the fluorescence decreases as ethidium is effluxed out of the cytoplasm.</p><p>The ethidium efflux assay was carried out for L51I/EmrE<sup>out</sup>, L51I/EmrE<sup>in</sup>, and a control plasmid not expressing EmrE. These results showed that the rate of ethidium efflux was ~3-fold faster for L51I/EmrE<sup>out</sup> than for L51I/EmrE<sup>in</sup> (Figure 5D), which is in agreement with the simulation results. Furthermore, the fluorescence value at which ethidium fluorescence levels off was lower for L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>out</sup>, indicating a reduction in ethidium accumulation relative to L51I co-expressed with EmrE<sup>in</sup> (Figure 5E). Overall, these new results support the hypothesis that the L51I/EmrE<sup>out</sup> heterodimer is able to achieve a lower cytoplasmic ethidium concentration, which enables it to grow at higher ethidium concentrations relative to L51I/EmrE<sup>in</sup>. Based on these data, we conclude that the altered kinetic rate constants between L51I/EmrE<sup>in</sup> and L51I/EmrE<sup>out</sup> give rise to the ability of the latter to confer resistance at higher ethidium concentrations. Note that previous work by Paixão et al. (Paixão et al., 2009) found that an ethidium efflux rate difference of 1.6-fold between wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> and its efflux pump knockout strain led to a 30-fold difference in the minimum inhibitory concentration. Therefore, there is literature precedence that a somewhat modest efflux rate difference can have a deleterious effect on bacterial growth. The underlying reason stems from the fact that ethidium accumulation in the cell ultimately leads to irreversible DNA binding that impacts bacterial growth (Jernaes et al., 1994; Lambert et al., 1984).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Figure 5D is confusing. Why is there a conformational preference for the inward-facing state in EmrE<sup>in</sup>/EmrE<sup>out</sup> dimer? Should not it, like WT, have no conformational preference? What is exactly depicted in the middle panel? Here, the preference should be for the outward-facing state shouldn't it? Perhaps, the figure should be remade to make the point the authors are making clearer. It might be better to show the entire transport cycle and point out which rates are likely affected by the asymmetry generated by mutations within the assemblies with EmrE<sup>in</sup> or EmrE<sup>out</sup> variants. Such depiction may also allow to clarify which conclusions are fully supported by the data and which are more speculative in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5F (previously 5D) was revised to show a simple depiction that reflects the observed bias in vitro. Namely, EmrE<sup>in</sup>/EmrE<sup>out</sup> has no skewed equilibrium, the mutant/EmrE<sup>in</sup> favors the periplasmic-facing conformation, and the mutant/EmrE<sup>out</sup> favors the cytoplasmic-facing conformation. We also included the EmrE transport cycle in Figure 5G proposed by Robinson et al., 2017, that was used for the simulations. Within this figure, we indicate steps influenced by the change in equilibrium constant measured in the heterodimer samples. Rate constants we predict to be most affected are indicated with double asterisks, while more minor changes are indicated with a single asterisk.</p></body></sub-article></article>
