This phenomenon can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and many questions regarding its genesis, fate and evolutionary role remain unanswered. Here, we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing different centromere histones H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Lastly, heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable, natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06516.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06516.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06516.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genome of an individual organism contains all the instructions needed to build and maintain that individual. Any changes to the DNA in the genome can alter the instructions that are given to cells, which can lead to cancer and other diseases. However, changes to the genome can sometimes be beneficial as they can introduce more variety into the instructions carried by different individuals, which increases their potential to adapt to changes in their environment.</p><p>In plants and animals, DNA is arranged into structures called chromosomes. Generally, an individual's genome contains two copies of each chromosome; one inherited from their mother and one from their father. However, occasionally during reproduction, all the chromosomes from one of the parents are left out from the cells of the offspring in a process called ‘genome elimination’. This makes individuals that carry only half the normal number of chromosomes, known as haploids. Sometimes the process of genome elimination is disrupted, which leads to individuals that have incomplete genomes or chromosomes that carry big rearrangements of the DNA, as if they had been shattered and put back together incorrectly.</p><p>In a small plant known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, genome elimination frequently happens in the offspring of two individuals that carry different versions of a gene called centromeric histone H3 (CENH3). However, it is not clear how this works, or what roles genome elimination plays in evolution and disease.</p><p>Here, Tan et al. studied genome elimination by cross-breeding <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that carried a mutant form of CENH3 with plants that have a normal version of the protein. The experiments found that many of the offspring were haploid. Some of the others carried an extra copy of an entire chromosome or a section of a chromosome. A third group had an extra copy of a chromosome that was missing some sections or had been rearranged. These ‘shattered’ chromosomes were always formed from chromosomes that came from the parent plant with a mutant form of CENH3.</p><p>Tan et al. also found that a protein called DNA Ligase 4, which helps reconnect broken DNA strands, is involved in repairing the breaks in these shattered chromosomes. Some of the genetic rearrangements documented in the experiments were passed on to subsequent generations of plants, which suggests that these genomic changes can be stable enough to be inherited.</p><p>The genomic rearrangements observed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants are similar to those seen in patients with cancer and other genetic diseases. Tan et al. findings show that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants provide a useful system for studying these genome rearrangements, which may inform efforts to treat these human diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06516.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06516.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Isabelle M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>Maruthachalam</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradnam</surname><given-names>Keith R</given-names></name><name><surname>Marimuthu</surname><given-names>Mohan PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Korf</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><name><surname>Comai</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Isabelle M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>Maruthachalam</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradnam</surname><given-names>Keith R</given-names></name><name><surname>Marimuthu</surname><given-names>Mohan PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Korf</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><name><surname>Comai</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P501/12/G090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandakova</surname><given-names>Terezie</given-names></name><name><surname>Lysak</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandakova</surname><given-names>Terezie</given-names></name><name><surname>Lysak</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramalingaswami fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>Maruthachalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complex chromosomal rearrangements similar to those described in cancer and developmental syndromes occur in plants during postzygotic genome elimination, a centromeric-derived incompatibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleosomes containing variant histone (centromeric histone H3, CENH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Verdaasdonk and Bloom, 2011</xref>) (also known as CENP-A) determine centromeres. In the absence of the endogenous CENH3, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mitotic and meiotic functions can be complemented by chimeric CENH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravi et al., 2010</xref>) or CENH3 from diverged plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maheshwari et al., 2015</xref>), but crossing these strains to wild-type individuals results in frequent loss of the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3. Following stochastic genome elimination in the early mitotic divisions, the progeny can be haploid, aneuploid or diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ravi et al., 2014</xref>). In nature, similar phenomena involve defective CENH3 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanei et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, mating of individuals that express diverged CENH3s, can lead to mitotic catastrophe.</p><p>The consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity can be dire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McClintock, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). Missegregated chromosomes can lead to aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>), but also to extensive and catastrophic restructuring resulting in, sequentially, chromosome sequestration in micronuclei, endonucleolytic damage, defective repair, and finally rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crasta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting structurally rearranged chromosomes may contribute to cancer or developmental syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stephens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones and Jallepalli, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, chromosomal rearrangements are not necessarily deleterious: some may influence fitness by altering recombination or gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Comai et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that pathways leading to disease and to diversity share a common mechanistic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Genome elimination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> provides a previously lacking organismal system to investigate genome instability during mitotic catastrophes, connected mechanisms, and consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used the <italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap haploid inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ravi et al., 2014</xref>) in the experimental setup illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This strain is in the Col-0 background and carries a homozygous <italic>CENH3</italic> null mutation whose function is partially complemented by a chimeric CENH3 in which an N-terminal <italic>GFP</italic> fused to the H3.3-like N-terminal tail replaces the native CENH3 N-terminal tail. We crossed this strain to polymorphic accession L<italic>er gl1-1</italic> to track haplotypes in the F1 progeny and obtained the expected haploid induction frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ravi et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The recessive <italic>gl1-1</italic> mutation confers trichomeless leaves in paternal L<italic>er gl1-1</italic> haploids while it is masked in Col/L<italic>er</italic> diploid hybrids. We sequenced 10 of the phenotypically diploid Col/L<italic>er</italic> individuals with wild-type phenotype, performed dosage plot and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and found that 100% of these were diploid with 50% Col and L<italic>er</italic> genomes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Plants from the aneuploid class exhibited multiple pleiotropic and morphological defects and had trichomes, except in the rare exception when the <italic>GL1</italic> locus was lost. The five recognizable primary trisomic (2n + 1) phenotypes were represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Steinitz-Sears, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koornneef and Vanderveen, 1983</xref>): Chromosome 1 (Chr1) trisomics have dark green, serrated leaves and are dwarfed, Chr2 trisomics exhibit round leaves and are late flowering, Chr3 trisomics have narrow, yellow green leaves, Chr4 trisomics display narrow and smaller flat leaves, and Chr5 trisomics display light green and narrow leaves. However, aneuploid plants with more severe or unusual phenotypes were also observed, suggestive of other chromosomal combinations or more serious chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome dosage analysis based on whole genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Henry et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) distinguished three chromosomal alteration types in aneuploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar outcomes were obtained using independently derived haploid inducers, either expressing <italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or CENH3 from other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maheshwari et al., 2015</xref>). The most common type, numerical aneuploids, display whole chromosome aneuploidy such as in the classical primary trisomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows an example for a numerical Chr3). In our dataset, single primary trisomics (2n + 1) account for 75% of the numerical class. Other individuals from the numerical class with two or more extra whole chromosomes included 16% double primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1), 2% triple primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1 + 1) and 3% quadruple primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1). Additionally, we obtained disomic Chr4 haploids (n + 1, a type of numerical aneuploidy that were not included in this analysis) as well as Chr2 or Chr3 monosomic diploids (2n − 1) at 4% frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These have never been described in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> before<italic>,</italic> possibly because, if they were to arise from meiotic defects, they would result from nullisomic gametes, which are not viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henry et al., 2009</xref>).

This shattered class was found to occur in 11% of the aneuploid population. Additionally, some of the aneuploids exhibited a combination of numerical, truncated and shattered chromosome types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Alteration of copy number for Chr1, 2 and 3 are represented at similar frequencies based on the average copy number alteration of all five chromosomes, with Chr4 and 5 alterations being, respectively, over- and under-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Duplicated and triplicated blocks could therefore, have different origins. To address this question, we asked whether breakpoint junctions of the two different copy number states display differential association to various genomic and chromatin features such as genes and repeated elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lamesch et al., 2012</xref>), DNA replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Costas et al., 2011</xref>), DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and nine non-overlapping chromatin states that partition the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). When analyzing windows of 1000 bp centered around the breakpoints of duplicated blocks, we observed an enrichment in genic DNA (from 53% background level to 70%, p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,F</xref>). A subtler, but still significant, increase was observed when using larger windows (10,000 bp , from 53% background level to 62%, p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistently, 42% of breakpoint junctions from FRAG00062 are predicted to generate chimeric gene products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In the same analysis, we noted that the breakpoint regions of duplicated and triplicated blocks contained some genomic features that differed in frequency. In particular, replication origins, which occupy less than 1% of 10,000 bp windows around the borders of duplicated blocks, are present in almost 8% around the borders of triplicated blocks (compared to a genome average of 3.5%, p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>). The association of the breakpoints flanking duplicated DNA to genic DNA and of those flanking triplicated DNA to replication origins suggests the contribution of two distinct mechanisms to restructuring of the same chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The first, chromothripsis acting through breakage and ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stephens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Korbel and Campbell, 2013</xref>). The second, chromoanasynthesis, via replication fork collapse and template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kloosterman and Cuppen, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06516.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The process of genome elimination and connected models for chromosomal rearrangements.</title><p>Genome elimination ensues when a haploid inducer expressing a variant CENH3 protein mates with the wild type. In many cases, the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3 missegregate in the embryo and are compartmentalized in micronuclei. DNA damage, NHEJ repair and restitution of the micronucleus to the euploid pole nucleus can result in aneuploidy or diploidy. Alternatively, shattered chromosomes result from chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis. The former involves fragmentation and random ligation, the latter replication fork collapse and microhomology-mediated strand switching. As a consequence, the pulverized and reassembled chromosome forms a single unit and can be meiotically inherited. The schematics for chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis are shown sequentially for convenience, but their order has not been determined. In addition, our results obtained using <italic>DNA ligase4-2</italic> mutants suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny, such that when NHEJ is inhibited, haploid induction frequency increased.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06516.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06516.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06516-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Our in silico reconstruction suggests that NHEJ is involved in repairing breaks that occurred on the shattered chromosomes. To test this explanation, we created a haploid inducer carrying a homozygous null mutation in <italic>LIG4</italic> (DNA Ligase IV), a conserved component of the canonical NHEJ pathway. Pollinating it with wild-type <italic>LIG4/LIG4</italic> pollen (from L<italic>er gl1-1</italic>) resulted in normal haploid induction frequencies. However, when mutant <italic>lig4-2/lig4-2</italic> pollen was used, the frequency of haploids doubled at the expense of aneuploids and diploids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This effect was still observed when the seed parent carried the WT allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). It is possible that parental-specific haploinsufficiency results from early loss of the wild-type <italic>LIG4</italic> allele located on the chromosome targeted for elimination, which in this case is the maternal chromosome. This result indicates that NHEJ contributes to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued (i.e., restituted to a haploid or diploid nucleus) through a pathway requiring NHEJ, resulting in aneuploidy. Therefore, more haploids are produced when the NHEJ pathway is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06516.018</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Haploid induction frequency from genome elimination crosses using <italic>lig4-2</italic> mutants</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06516.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06516.018</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Haploid Inducer ♀</th><th>♂</th><th>Total</th><th>Aneuploid</th><th>Diploid</th><th>Haploid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap</td><td>L<italic>er gl1</italic></td><td>606</td><td>33%</td><td>28%</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td><italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap</td><td><italic>lig4-2</italic></td><td>148</td><td>8%</td><td>9%</td><td>83% *</td></tr><tr><td><italic>lig4-2 GFP</italic>-tailswap</td><td>L<italic>er gl1</italic></td><td>173</td><td>29%</td><td>31%</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td><italic>lig4-2 GFP</italic>-tailswap</td><td><italic>lig4-2</italic></td><td>159</td><td>14%</td><td>5%</td><td>81% *</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Haploid inducer lines or haploid inducer line with the <italic>lig4-2</italic> mutation were crossed to wild-type L<italic>er gl1</italic> or <italic>lig4-2</italic> mutant pollen (*Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, p &lt; 0.001).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06516.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Dosage plots for <italic>lig4-2</italic> haploids isolated from a haploid induction cross using diploid <italic>lig4-2</italic> as the male donor.</title><p>Dosage plots of <italic>lig4-2</italic> haploids based on 150 kbp non-overlapping bins across all five <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chromosomes.

This phenomenon studied here depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maheshwari et al., 2015</xref>), indicating the effectiveness of natural and artificial variation. While the genesis and fate of restructured chromosomes is difficult to study in humans, their formation, effects, and even transmission in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are within experimental reach, as demonstrated by the enhancing effect of NHEJ mutants on haploid induction. The range of phenotypes, the formation of copy variants and of chimeric genes at junctions, and their occasional meiotic transmission, suggest that catastrophic chromosomal restructuring, could contribute to heritable genetic variation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All plants were grown in Sunshine Professional Mix Peat-Lite Mix 4 (SunGro Horticulture, Agawam, MA) under 16hr/8hr light/dark photoperiod in a growth room set at 21°C.

Although this particular study principally involves <italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap haploid-inducer lines, it has clear relevance to general biological phenomena resulting from hybridization of related species and aneuploidy. The authors have used cytogenetics complemented by a NGS approach to carry out a clear and coherent analysis of chromosome elimination and reorganization at the genome-wide level in these plants. This is a most interesting paper that follows up on a recent PLoS Genetics paper that showed that crossing plants with differing CENH3 N-terminal tails frequently resulted in genome instability. The present paper extends these studies and definitively analyzes the nature of the chromosome shattering, showing that the instability most likely arises in post-meiotic mitoses and likely most involves two different processes are implicated.</p><p>The data appear to be solid, are presented clearly and support the authors' conclusions. Overall the text is concise, clearly written and referenced. However several aspects need to be clarified. In particular, analyses of the genomic features at breakpoints and the role of <italic>lig4</italic>.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Presentation of the events: It is quite difficult to get a clear picture of the relationship between the different classes of aneuploidy and the genome rearrangements. An improved presentation of the data is necessary: A more precise description of the numerical class should be provided in particular with presentation of frequency of trisomies and monosomy and the phenotypes. The category of diploids (25%) appears to be based only the wild type phenotype? A diploid sample should be analyzed for copy number variation and rearrangements as control.</p><p>2) The experiment performed to address the meiotic origin is not convincing: The key experiment is to test progeny of <italic>GFP</italic>-tailswap. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravi et al., 2010</xref> indicate that this line is not fully fertile suggesting a meiotic defect. In addition, aneuploids are detected in the progeny of selfed plants. With the current information, the authors cannot exclude a meiotic origin of the truncated and shattered chromosomes identified in aneuploids.</p><p>3) Genomic features at breakpoints: The analysis of genomic features is very weak and not convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-G</xref>). This analysis should be removed or validated by statistically tests. The abstract should be modified accordingly.</p><p>4) The effect of <italic>Lig4</italic> should be clarified: why such an effect when heterozygous in L<italic>er</italic> ecotype? What is the genotype/genomic structure of the haploids? If the absence of NHEJ leads to loss of recovery of shattered chromosomes, why is the proportion of haploids (relative to diploids) increased? How does it fit with the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is unclear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06516.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Presentation of the events: It is quite difficult to get a clear picture of the relationship between the different classes of aneuploidy and the genome rearrangements.

Of 96 sequences individuals, 94 were diploid and 2 were numerical aneuploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>).

It is possible that parental-specific haploinsufficiency results from early loss of the wild-type <italic>LIG4</italic> allele located on the chromosome targeted for elimination, which in this case is the maternal chromosome.”</p><p><italic>What is the genotype/genomic structure of the haploids</italic>?</p><p>Because the null <italic>lig4-2</italic> mutant used in the cross is in the Col-0 background, we could not use SNP after visual identification of <italic>lig4-2</italic> haploids to determine their genome's parental origin. Instead, the genotype of the <italic>lig4-2</italic> haploids was assessed by PCR using primers (included now in Materials and methods) that distinguish the T-DNA tagged <italic>lig4-2</italic> knock-out allele from the wild-type <italic>LIG4</italic> allele. This confirmed the absence of the latter allele, consistent with genome elimination having occurred as expected. We next performed dosage analysis on these individuals and observed that all tested were euploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>If the absence of NHEJ leads to loss of recovery of shattered chromosomes, why is the proportion of haploids (relative to diploids) increased? How does it fit with the model presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>is unclear</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded the explanation of this observation: “We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued (i.e. restituted to a haploid or diploid nucleus) through a pathway requiring NHEJ, resulting in aneuploidy. Therefore, more haploids are produced when the NHEJ pathway is impaired.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
