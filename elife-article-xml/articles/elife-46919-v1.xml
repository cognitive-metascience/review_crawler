Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability, yet it is unknown how FMRP function varies across brain regions and cell types and how this contributes to disease pathophysiology. Here we use conditional tagging of FMRP and CLIP (FMRP cTag CLIP) to examine FMRP mRNA targets in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, a critical cell type for learning and memory relevant to FXS phenotypes. Integrating these data with analysis of ribosome-bound transcripts in these neurons revealed CA1-enriched binding of autism-relevant mRNAs, and CA1-specific regulation of transcripts encoding circadian proteins. This contrasted with different targets in cerebellar granule neurons, and was consistent with circadian defects in hippocampus-dependent memory in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice. These findings demonstrate differential FMRP-dependent regulation of mRNAs across neuronal cell types that may contribute to phenotypes such as memory defects and sleep disturbance associated with FXS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd><kwd>FMRP</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>CA1 pyramidal neurons</kwd><kwd>cTag CLIP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS034389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1UM1HG008901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD040647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Jennifer C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI 240432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identifying FMRP-bound mRNAs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons reveals cell-type specific regulation of autism-candidate and circadian mRNAs and FMRP-mediated control of memory across the circadian cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and leading monogenic cause of autism, results from loss of function of the RNA binding protein FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hagerman et al., 2017</xref>).

Early in vitro experiments led to identification of high affinity targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>) and subsequent in vivo studies from whole mouse brain revealed robust FMRP binding to a discrete subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). The identified FMRP targets were enriched in mRNAs encoding synaptic and chromatin regulatory proteins, and significantly overlapped with autism susceptibility genes identified through genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Purcell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There is increasing evidence that there are brain region and cell-type specific deficits in the absence of FMRP. For example, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit synapse- and region-specific defects in synaptic plasticity, inhibitory and excitatory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahlhaus, 2018</xref>), dendritic spine morphology and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">He and Portera-Cailliau, 2013</xref>) and mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sawicka et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic studies using the <italic>Fmr1</italic> cKO mouse have also demonstrated that specific cell populations contribute to specific deficits in cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mientjes et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is as yet unknown if FMRP binding or function varies across cell types.</p><p>We recently developed a means of assessing regulatory protein-RNA interactions in specific cell types in vivo. This method, termed cTag CLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ule et al., 2018</xref>), combines CLIP (UV cross-linking immunoprecipitation) technology with the specificity that can be conferred by Cre-lox technology. RNA binding proteins are modified by homologous recombination to allow Cre-dependent knock-ins of epitope tags that are then used for CLIP purification. This cell-type specific Cre-lox mediated switching of epitope tags allows for minimal perturbation of the stoichiometry and regulation of the RNA binding protein of interest, a key factor in ascertaining biologically relevant RNA-protein interactions in vivo. Using antibodies to epitope tags confers uniformity on CLIP protein-RNA purification, while allowing cell-type specific RNA-protein complexes to be extracted from complex brain tissue.</p><p>For example, cTag CLIP applied to the ubiquitous poly(A) binding protein PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hwang and Darnell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jereb et al., 2018</xref>) allowed dissection of different PABPC1-bound poly(A) mRNAs from cortical excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, microglia and astrocytes, and in the cerebellum, from excitatory granule neurons and inhibitory Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jereb et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, we have also applied cTag CLIP to discern differential regulation of the same transcripts by the splicing factor, NOVA2, in excitatory versus inhibitory cortical and cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the interest in FMRP cell-specific function in specific brain regions and cell types, we developed cTag FMRP CLIP in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the mouse hippocampus, a cell type which plays a critically important role in long-term memory and spatial related tasks. The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse exhibits abnormal synaptic plasticity and spine morphology in this cell type which has been linked to altered hippocampal function and defects in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbab et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceolin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grossman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nosyreva and Huber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Talbot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we have combined these studies with cell-type specific assessment of ribosome bound transcripts in this same cell type, to allow a comprehensive, unbiased and normalized approach to assessing FMRP-bound transcripts. Furthermore, comparative analysis of FMRP binding and regulation in hippocampal CA1 versus cerebellar excitatory neurons revealed CA1-specific enrichment of binding to transcripts related to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Unexpectedly, these analyses also revealed FMRP-dependent regulation of mRNAs encoding circadian proteins in hippocampal CA1, but not cerebellar granule cells, and that loss of FMRP results in circadian-dependent defects in learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FMRP cTag CLIP in CA1 neurons</title><p>To determine FMRP-binding maps in specific cell types, we generated <italic>Fmr1</italic>-cTag mice, which enable conditional expression of AcGFP (Aequorea coerulescens Green Fluorescent Protein) tagged FMRP using the Cre-lox system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Van Driesche et al., 2019</xref>).

Secondly, we used raw counts rather than RPKM values to compare CLIP and TRAP data. This alternative count-based approach incorporated a dispersion estimate and used a negative binomial distribution to determine significance.

A significant effect of genotype was observed only when mice were trained during the night (Two-way ANOVA, main effect of genotype F(1,18) = 12.36, p=0.0025).

A significant positive value indicates a preference for the displaced object and that the mouse remembers the original object positions. Consistent with intact spatial memory, WT mice showed a clear preference for the displaced object at both times of day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bi</xref>; One sample t-test vs theoretical 0 mean: day p=0.0004, night p=0.0012, n = 10 mice). In contrast the KO mice showed a deficit in spatial memory, and this was only evident during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bi</xref>; One sample t-test vs theoretical 0 mean: day p=0.57, night p=0.0015, n = 10 mice). This was not due to a difference in locomotor activity or exploration during the day and night as the KO mice showed similar total exploration time during the testing phase for the two objects at both times of day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii</xref>; two-way ANOVA effect of time of day F(1,36) = 0.00201, p=0.965, n = 10 mice per genotype). Interestingly, we observed an increase in object exploration in the KO mice compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii</xref>; two-way ANOVA effect of genotype F(1,36) = 9.729, p=0.0036, n = 10 mice per genotype), which may be linked to the hyperactivity phenotype previously reported in these animals, but this behavioral difference between the genotypes was not dependent on time-of-day indicating that only selective behavioral deficits in the Fmr1 KO mice are likely to show aberrant circadian regulation.</p><p>We further tested circadian dependent memory in a second learning paradigm, contextual fear conditioning, which involves both the hippocampus and amygdala. This test involves placing the animal in a novel environment and providing an aversive stimulus in the form of a foot shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). When the animal is returned to the same environment, if it remembers a formed association between the context and the aversive stimulus, it will demonstrate a fear-related freezing response. To examine the effect of time of training and time of recall, we trained the mice at either ZT2 or ZT14 and then tested their recall by placing them in the same context 24, 36 and 48 hr after the initial training session. Consistent with most previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Peier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Van Dam et al., 2000</xref>), we found no deficit in contextual fear conditioning in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO when training occurred during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Di</xref>; post hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, p=0.832). However, there was a significant memory deficit in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice trained at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Di</xref>; post hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, p=0.0023). Both genotypes showed a similar pattern of recall across the three testing sessions suggesting that the time of day of the training event rather than the time of day of recall was the main factor in the observed deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Dii, iii</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the transcripts which FMRP binds provides an essential lens through which to view the pathophysiology of FXS. However, given the involvement of specific neuronal populations in FXS, interrogation of its relevant target transcripts necessitates cell-type-specific approaches. Here we develop FMRP cTag CLIP, which utilizes conditional Cre-lox-dependent epitope tagging of endogenous FMRP followed by CLIP to define cell-type-specific targets. This new technology allows a complex tissue such as the brain (here hippocampus and cerebellum) to be molecularly dissected in a non-invasive manner to directly examine cell-specific protein-RNA regulatory interactions in the brain. We have previously used this approach to identify differences in alternative polyadenylation in cerebellar excitatory (granule) neurons and inhibitory Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jereb et al., 2018</xref>), and differences in Nova-regulated alternative splicing in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the hippocampus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Saito et al., 2018</xref>). Here we employ FMRP cTag CLIP to identify FMRP-bound transcripts in CA1 pyramidal neurons and to identify previously unrecognized roles for FMRP in these neurons that relate to ASD and circadian rhythm.</p><p>To facilitate normalization of FMRP binding to overall transcript abundance, we undertook here TRAP analysis of ribosome-bound transcripts in the same CA1 neurons (by driving epitope tagging of the endogenous ribosomal protein RPL22 using the same Camk2a Cre driver that we used to tag FMRP). This in turn allowed us to demarcate moderately to highly stringent sets of FMRP target transcripts in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and to pursue their biology in more detail. Interestingly, we find that FMRP targets are globally decreased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice in both CA1 hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule cells suggesting that FMRP may stabilize its target transcripts, perhaps either in conjunction with or downstream of its effects on their translation. This is consistent with prior observations made in CA1 neurons using CA1 TRAP alone in combination with our previously published list of whole brain FMRP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceolin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>). A decrease in abundance but not ribosome association of FMRP targets has also been reported in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO adult neuronal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We have now confirmed and extended these studies by refining this observation specifically to FMRP-bound CA1 transcripts and demonstrating that the decrease in transcript abundance upon loss of FMRP is directly proportional to the amount FMRP binding.</p><p>The exact mechanism through which loss of FMRP binding leads to a decrease in mRNA abundance remains to be determined. FMRP may stabilize its target mRNAs directly as has been suggested for PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zalfa et al., 2007</xref>) or changes in ribosome association and translation of FMRP targets in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO may result in compensatory change in RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it is well established that mRNA translation and stability are inherently linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Roy and Jacobson, 2013</xref>). Given our previous findings that FMRP is associated with stalled ribosomes on targets identified by CLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>), we suggest that FMRP may protect these mRNAs from degradation. Thus, while stalled ribosomes may often target the associated mRNA for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayes and Sauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sunohara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>), FMRP binding may directly or indirectly block such degradation. Consistent with this model, a recent ribosome profiling study examining the cortex of Fmr1 KO mice showed that many of the same gene ontology groups are significantly changed in their ribosome association as a result of alterations in translation elongation in the same direction as seen in our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das Sharma et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While our studies have strengthened the link between FMRP binding to changes in mRNA abundance, future research will be needed to more clearly establish underlying mechanisms, and to demonstrate how translation and protein levels are altered in specific cell types in vivo in the Fragile X brain, using, for example, new ribosome profiling or single cell-type proteomics methods. Such studies, in combination with the data presented here, will provide a more complete understanding of the complex post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by FMRP and may elucidate additional functional consequences of loss of this RNA-binding protein.</p><p>Prior work has established that FMRP mRNA targets identified by whole-brain CLIP are significantly enriched for transcripts arising from protein coding loci that are genetically altered in autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Purcell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Steinberg and Webber, 2013</xref>). Our data extend these observations, indicating that the higher the probability of a gene being causative to ASD phenotypes, the more highly its transcript is bound by FMRP in CA1 neurons. Whilst FMRP binding to autism-relevant transcripts is observed in both CA1 neurons and cerebellar granule cells, we find that CA1 targets have significantly higher ASD gene scores compared to granule cell targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These observations point to the possibility that FMRP plays an important role in CA1 excitatory neurons, relative to cerebellar excitatory neurons, and suggests that loss of FMRP in the CA1 is relevant to the autism-related phenotypes associated with FXS.</p><p>The overlap with ASD genes is likely driven by the fundamental observation that FMRP regulates transcripts that are biologically important in brain function and are evolutionarily constrained (exhibiting genetic loss of function intolerance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>), and reflects the enrichment of binding we observe on long transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It is therefore worth noting that we have made every attempt to minimize and test for length bias in our data, including the use of RPKM in our CLIP score determination, the use of parallel approaches (CLIP, TRAP and FACS RNA-Seq) and validation of our results by RT-qPCR. Thus, we think it is unlikely that sequencing bias has a significant effect on our determination of FMRP targets, although it is impossible to completely rule out any such effect, which could in turn lead to some influence on our observation that FMRP targets are enriched for long transcripts. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that our selection of targets is biologically relevant and not an artifact of length bias is the fact that the differences seen in the Fmr1 KO by TRAP are specific to targets even when comparing to length-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Using an unbiased approach to study CA1 neuronal FMRP targets, we identified circadian genes as the most significant set of CA1 transcripts enriched in both CLIP-binding and showing changes in ribosome association in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO by CA1 TRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Among our list of stringent CA1 targets are Npas2, a core component of the circadian clock, Ppargc1a, a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), Ncoa2, a coactivator of the key transcription BMAL1:CLOCK regulatory complex of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Stashi et al., 2014</xref>) and Crebbp, a coactivator of circadian transcription and a regulator of circadian behavior downstream of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Maurer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously noted that children with Fragile X syndrome experience sleep difficulties, including disturbances consistent with circadian clock shifts (early rising or late onset sleep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaufmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kronk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Richdale, 2003</xref>). Moreover, sleep disturbances are more prevalent among Fragile X children with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaufmann et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show limited changes in their overall sleep-wake cycle behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Saré et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) however they do exhibit abnormal sleep architecture with fewer bouts of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boone et al., 2018</xref>) and a shorter free-run period of locomotor activity in continuous darkness indicating a slightly shortened internal circadian cycle in the absence of light entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, cortical neurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have abnormally high firing rates during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonçalves et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO CA1 pyramidal cells are hyperactive in all sleep and wake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boone et al., 2018</xref>). Effects on circadian activity are more dramatic if the FMRP paralog FXR2 is also deleted. <italic>Fmr1/Fxr2</italic> double KO mice display arrhythmic circadian activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and a similar result is seen in dfmr1-null flies which have only one FMR1 family gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dockendorff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Morales et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that in mammals the FXR2 paralog may compensate for some of the effects of loss of FMR1. Circadian rhythm-dependent alteration of gene expression has been observed in dfmr1 mutant fly heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Xu et al., 2012</xref>) and liver tissue from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, <italic>Fxr2</italic> KO and <italic>Fmr1/Fxr2</italic> double KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and a decrease in expression of circadian-related genes has been observed in lymphoblastoid cell lines from FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mullegama et al., 2015</xref>). However, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the central brain region for regulation of circadian rhythm, <italic>Fxr2</italic> was found to have a greater effect on circadian gene expression, with significant differences in the expression of core circadian genes observed only in <italic>Fxr2</italic> KO and <italic>Fmr1/Fxr2</italic> double KO mice but not <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by the SCN in the hypothalamus which serves as the ‘master clock’ for the brain and body. However, clock genes are rhythmically expressed throughout many brain regions and play a critical role in the regulation of normal brain processes. In particular, the hippocampus is a convergence point of sleep and memory. Clock genes are expressed rhythmically in the hippocampus in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jilg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ma et al., 2016</xref>) and hippocampal slices continue these oscillations in culture indicating an intrinsic circadian expression independent of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Circadian rhythms have also been shown in hippocampal long term potentiation at CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhury et al., 2005</xref>), in firing rates of CA1 place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Munn and Bilkey, 2012</xref>) and in memory acquisition and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Smarr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Snider et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, conditional deletion of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in forebrain excitatory neurons but not in the SCN, using <italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic>, causes deficits in Barnes maze performance and novel object location and novel object recognition tasks in the absence of any change in circadian locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Snider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Snider and Obrietan, 2018</xref>). These findings support a direct role for clock gene expression outside of the SCN in hippocampal function and demonstrate that circadian rhythms in learning and memory can be independent of locomotor rhythms.</p><p>Our data indicate for the first time a direct role for FMRP in the regulation of transcripts critical for circadian function in the hippocampus and allow us to establish a molecular correlate of circadian defect in excitatory neurons in the brain. We find a specific regulation of circadian transcripts in CA1 pyramidal cells but not cerebellar granule cells, despite similar expression of these transcripts in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To date, since in vivo cell-type-specific identification of FMRP binding and analysis of downstream regulation has only been performed in CA1 pyramidal neurons and cerebellar granule cells, it remains unclear if dysregulation of circadian transcripts exists in other circadian-relevant cell types in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse and whether this may also contribute to the behavioral phenotypes observed here. Nonetheless, the finding of cell-type specific circadian control in general, and additionally that such regulation can be FMRP-dependent, are important new observations.</p><p>Given the nature of the functions attributed to CA1 neurons, aberrant regulation of circadian transcripts in this cell type suggested the possibility of a circadian defect in memory in the absence of FMRP. While the absence of FMRP in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schmitt et al., 2019</xref>) and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drozd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Till et al., 2015</xref>) is well-established to cause memory defects, our studies are able to extend these observations by demonstrating that defects in at least two modes of learning and memory are dependent on the phase of the circadian cycle. Specifically, we found that in the object location memory task, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had marked deficits in spatial memory when trained and tested in the inactive phase of their circadian cycle (light phase/day) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Whereas in contextual fear conditioning, a memory deficit was observed only when the animal was trained during the active phase of their circadian cycle (dark phase/night) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our findings that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show deficits in object location memory but not contextual fear conditioning during the day, is consistent with findings of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">King and Jope, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Peier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Van Dam et al., 2000</xref>) but reveal an unexpected dependence of these findings on the phase of the circadian cycle in which they are tested. Moreover, consistent with our findings that circadian transcripts are specifically regulated by FMRP in the CA1, circadian differences are not observed in other behavioral characteristics that are less dependent on the hippocampus, including hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Saré et al., 2016</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Saré et al., 2016</xref>). Memory consolidation, including spatial memory encoded by hippocampal place cells, is believed to occur during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>) and FMRP has been shown to play an important role in sleep-dependent synaptic homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the deficits observed in spatial and contextual memory may be the result of sleep disturbance or an independent function of the circadian genes in learning and memory within the hippocampus. While our results combined with previous findings of others are suggestive of a direct link between altered circadian gene expression in the hippocampal CA1 region and altered CA1-dependent circadian behaviors, it remains to be tested whether other cell types or brain regions also contribute to these phenotypes. Future work, for example using CA1 specific deletion of FMRP, will be necessary to establish a direct link. Together our findings indicate that altered circadian brain rhythms may contribute to the deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in FXS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>),strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-cre)T29-1Stl/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005359">IMSR_JAX:005359</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Referred to as <italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic>.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>),strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6N.129-Rpl22<sup>tm1.1Psam</sup>/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:011029">IMSR_JAX:011029</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Referred to as RiboTag.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>),strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup>/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Referred to as TdTomato.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>),strain background <break/>(<italic>C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.129P2-Fmr1<sup>tm1Cgr</sup>/J</td><td valign="top">Gift from W.T.

The CA1 pyramidal cells from these mice are labeled with tdTomato to enable their separation based on fluorescence. The hippocampi were washed with ice-cold HABG [Hibernate A (Brainbits) supplemented with 2% B-27 supplement (Gibco) and 0.25% Glutamax (Gibco)] and cut into 300 µm slices with a McIlwain tissue chopper. Tissue slices were washed once with papain buffer [Hibernate A minus calcium (Brainbits) supplemented with 0.25% Glutmax] and then digested with 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 50 µg/ml DNase I dissolved in papain buffer at 37°C for 30 min with mixing. Tissue was washed twice with HABG and then gently triturated ten times with a P1000 pipette tip. Triturated tissue was filtered through a cell strainer and cells pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (3% BSA in PBS with 100 ng/ml DAPI) and transferred to a 5 mL round Bottom polystyrene tube via a 35 µm cell strainer.

During the dark cycle, mice were transported to the behavior rooms in black boxes to avoid disruption of the circadian clock by exposure to white light. Behavior testing was conducted either starting at 9am (ZT2) or 9pm (ZT14). Mice for novel object location were 8–12 weeks old. Mice for fear conditioning were 2–4 months old.</p><p>For novel object location, the task was conducted in a clear Plexiglas open arena (58 × 58 × 46 cm) using two types of objects (pyramids constructed of transparent plastic with colored edges and half-inch threaded gate valves). The task consisted of three phases: habituation, sample, and choice, conducted successively. During habituation, the mouse was placed in the empty arena and allowed to freely explore for 10 min. The sample phase was conducted 24 hr later. Two identical objects were fixed to the floor in the northeast and northwest corners of the box (10 cm from the walls) and the mice were allowed to explore for 10 min. The choice phase was conducted 1 hr after the sample phase in which one of the objects was moved to the opposite corner of the arena (either the NE object moved to the SE corner or the NW object moved to the SW corner, whichever object was explored less during the sample phase). The type of object used was counterbalanced across groups. The mice were allowed to explore the objects again for 10 min. The arena and objects were cleaned with 30% (vol/vol) alcohol between each animal.</p><p>After 3 days rest, the mice went through a second round of the same 3 phases of habituation, sample, and choice but at the opposite time of day. Half of the mice were tested in the first round at ZT2 and then subsequently at ZT14 (in the second round). The other half were tested first at ZT14 and then subsequently at ZT2. For the second testing session the arena was the same but different objects were used.</p><p>EthoVision tracking software (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, Virginia) was used during the task. Object exploration was scored manually from the videos using Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friard and Gamba, 2016</xref>). Object exploration was scored only when the mouse’s nose touched the object. All scoring was performed blind to genotype and time of testing. Mice were excluded if they spent less than a total of 5 s exploring the objects during the choice phase.</p><p>For fear conditioning, the mouse was placed in a 18 cm x 18 cm x 30 cm testing chamber where the floor consisted of metal bars through which a foot shock could be delivered (Coulbourn Instruments). The testing room was illuminated with red light and the testing chambers themselves were enclosed with no external light source. Video was recorded using infrared light only. During the training session the mice were allowed to explore the chamber for 3 min, then subjected to three 2 s 0.4 mA foot shocks at 40 s intervals. 24, 36 and 48 hr after the initial training session the mice were returned to the testing chamber and their activity recorded for 5 min before being returned to their home cage. Automated scoring of freezing behavior was performed using FreezeFrame three software (Coulbourn Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bioinformatics</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>TRAP</title><p>Paired-end reads from input and TRAP samples were aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>).

All reads mapping to protein coding genes were included in the differential expression analysis, which was performed using DESeq2 with normal log fold change shrinkage and taking into consideration pairing of samples among replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

In contrast to our study they used the <italic>Wfs1-CreERT2</italic> mouse line and induced recombination by administration of tamoxifen in adult animals (2–6 months old).</p><p>For comparison of TRAP and CLIP data, WT TRAP reads were also aligned to the mm10 RefSeq transcriptome using STAR with quantMode GeneCounts TranscriptomeSAM. RPKM was determined for each transcript and a single transcript with the highest mean RPKM across all WT replicates was selected per gene. Having reduced the transcriptome to a single transcript per gene the RPKM values were recalculated and the transcriptome was further filtered for RPKM ≥ 1.

Briefly, raw reads were filtered for quality and demultiplexed using indexes introduced during the reverse transcription reaction. PCR duplicates were collapsed and adapter sequences removed. Reads were mapped to the mm10 RefSeq genome and transcriptome using STAR with quantMode GeneCounts TranscriptomeSAM. Mapped reads were further collapsed for potential PCR duplicates by coordinates and taking into consideration the degenerate barcodes introduced during the reverse transcription.

Only reads that mapped to these transcripts were included in the analysis. Overall 67% of all reads mapped to this subset of transcripts. Each read was assigned a position relative to the start and stop codon based on the center of the read and reads were then selected that fell within the region of interest, for example 1 kb upstream or downstream of the stop codon. The total number of reads within each 10 nt window across the region was calculated. To ensure equal representation of the 1000 transcripts in the meta-transcript representation each read was weighted according to the total number of reads that mapped to that transcript within the region of interest. The data was further normalized for the proportion of the 1000 transcripts that were represented within that window since not all transcripts had a sufficiently long coding region or UTR to cover the full region of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>CLIP score calculation</title><p>CLIP scores were calculated for each biological replicate individually.

Firstly, the same linear regression method as above was calculated but substituting TRAP RPKM per transcript for FACS RNA-Seq RPKM values as a measure of transcript abundance.</p><p>Secondly, we used raw counts rather than RPKM values to compare CLIP and TRAP data. This alternative approach incorporated a dispersion estimate and used a negative binomial distribution to determine significance. Counts per CDS region were determined from CLIP and TRAP replicates. For CLIP counts CreNeg counts were subtracted from CrePos counts as before to give the final CLIP counts used in the analysis. All transcripts with at least one CLIP count across the 3 CLIP replicates were included. We modelled the FMRP CLIP read counts driven by mRNA abundance as following a negative binomial distribution with mean μ and dispersion α. We estimated the dispersion parameter α for any μ by leveraging the observed per-transcript CLIP count variability across replicates using the approach implemented in DESeq2 (i.e. estimateDispersions). For each replicate, the expected CLIP count μ for each transcript based on mRNA abundance was estimated by linear regression that was fitted to the logarithm of the CLIP CDS vs TRAP CDS counts. CLIP scores were determined as before based on residuals from the fitted line. In addition, the significance of deviation of the observed CLIP count compared to the expected count (μ) was calculated as a one-sided p-value for the negative binomial distribution, using the estimated dispersion parameter (α). P-values from individual replicates were combined using Fisher’s method and converted to false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Comparison of CLIP across cell types</title><p>For comparison of CLIP scores between CA1 neurons and cerebellar granule cells, only transcripts which had at least one CLIP tag in every biological replicate across both cell types were included as these are the transcripts for which the most accurate CLIP score can be determined.

and circadian memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study aims to identify neuronal cell-type specific functional roles of FMRP with implications in FXS pathophysiology. The authors take advantage of their elegant cTag CLIP approach to endogenously tag FMRP with AcGFP in CA1 pyramidal neurons or cerebellar granule cells and perform CLIP-Seq to determine FMRP direct targets in these cell types in the mouse brain. The cTag CLIP-seq data are compared with TRAP data from the same cell types in WT and Fmr1 deficient mice to assess effects of loss of FMRP binding on gene expression. Analysis of these data resulted in several interesting observations including that FMRP stabilizes targets and that FMRP targets are enriched for autism- as well as circadian-related transcripts, particularly in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The authors complement these observations with behavioural analyses revealing that FMRP deficiency has differential effects on memory depending on the state of the circadian cycle. Overall, this is an interesting study that provides timely cell type-specific insights into FMRP function in vivo. However, there are several technical concerns and additional comments that the authors are requested to address before their manuscript can be considered further.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' approach of using CA1-specific TRAP data may be problematic for assessing transcript abundance for the purpose of normalizing FMRP-binding. This is especially a concern given evidence of reduced ribosome occupancy over transcripts bound with high affinity by FMRP (e.g. Sharma et al., 2019). We recommend that the authors perform the following experiment to address this concern, or at the very least more clearly explain the caveats/justification of their approach and how it may affect interpretations.</p><p>Perform FACS of CA1 labelled neurons, followed by RNA-seq to assess transcript abundance and use these data to normalize FMRP cTag CLIP signal. A significant correlation between FMRP targets detected by this approach and those detected using TRAP data would provide more confidence in the current results.</p><p>2) The Cre-lox dependent tagging of FMR1 could affect downstream interpretation since Fmr1 harbours alternative last coding exons and other processing events (eg. Zimmer et al., 2016; Tseng et al., 2017). It is recommended that the authors provide RT-PCR and western evidence from FMRP-tagged as well as wild type animals to show that the Cre-lox tagging strategy captures the majority of FMRP isoforms.</p><p>3) Figure 1B. Related to (2), it is recommended that the authors perform immunofluorescence microscopy with an antibody against FMRP to confirm whether the GFP tagged protein co-localizes with endogenous protein.</p><p>4) The authors use unpublished data (cited as Van Driesche et al., in submission) in their manuscript, yet the corresponding methods are not described, and their paper is not available in BioRxiv. As such, analyses involving these data (especially in the section &quot;Comparison of CLIP across cell types&quot;) are difficult to interpret and assess. The authors are requested to provide a more detailed description of these data and methods, and their paper should be made available to the reviewers. Related to this, the reviewers have several questions/concerns about the data analysis which the authors are requested to address.</p><p>5) In the CLIP score calculation, the formula for RPKM used by the authors (which is somewhat unclear because of how it is typed out in the methods section) appears to be as follows:</p><p>〖RPKM〗_i = ((〖CrePos Counts〗_i-〖CreNeg Counts〗_i)(1000000)) / ((L/1000)(CrePos Total Counts-Cre Neg Total Counts))</p><p>where i is a specific transcript, L is the CDS length, and all counts originate in the CDS. It is recommended that Equation Editor is used to write the equation, but there is no way to do this in the review submission site, so just for clarity:</p><p>Numerator = (〖CrePos Counts〗_i-〖CreNeg Counts〗_i)(1000000)</p><p>Denominator = ((L/1000)(CrePos Total Counts-Cre Neg Total Counts))</p><p>This formula seems strange because if the Cre+ and Cre- samples are sequenced to the same depth (which is probably what the authors would attempt to do), then the denominator would be zero. I'm guessing that the actual formula probably comprises two separately normalized terms for the Cre+ and Cre- counts, but I could be misunderstanding something. Please clarify.</p><p>6) The authors use a linear regression model to identify high-affinity binding targets for FMRP based on their CLIP score analysis. This seems problematic because the data used as input are counting data, and this analysis does not appear to take counting noise and overdispersion into account. It is also unclear whether any statistical test was applied to this analysis. In order to compute the cumulative histograms in, for example, Figure 2, the authors used the generalized linear model in DESeq2 and applied it in a sophisticated way that takes sample pairing into account. Why not apply this same approach to the CLIP analysis (after taking into consideration the issues with normalization raised in point 1)? In principle, DESeq2 will account for coverage differences between samples and genes, account for overdispersion, and provide a test statistic for each transcript.</p><p>7) The authors show a handful of cell type-specific transcripts on a volcano plot in Figure 2A to demonstrate the cell type-specificity of their TRAP experiments. The authors should consider an unbiased and systematic assessment with larger gene sets using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which the authors deployed in other parts of the paper. There are now numerous sources of cell type-specific gene sets for various neuronal and glial cell types from both bulk RNA-seq (e.g. from Barres and colleagues) and single-cell RNA-seq (e.g. from Linnarsson, McCarroll, and others).</p><p>8) The authors are requested to clarify how they controlled for possible length biases in their calculations. This is especially important when determining the validity of the observations in Figure 3E. The use of RPKM is valid as long as transcript length is stable (i.e. FMRP is not affecting transcript length).</p><p>9) In the section investigating FMRP regulation of circadian rhythm transcripts, the authors should describe the background and cutoffs used in their functional analysis. This section would be strengthened if the authors could address whether FMRP affects the circadian-dependent changes in the expression of these genes by performing RT-(q)PCR and western blotting (as they have in Figure 2D-F).</p><p>10) At present it is unclear whether the circadian genes regulated by FMRP are only expressed and/or bound in CA1 or whether such binding occurs in other brain regions important for circadian regulation. It is also unclear whether there are alterations in the rhythmic expression of clock genes in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mutants (related to point 9). At present, evidence relies heavily on the behavioural read-outs reported in the manuscript, which can be confounded by various factors affecting behaviours that are independent of FMRP's role in the regulation of circadian genes in the CA1 region. These caveats should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46919.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' approach of using CA1-specific TRAP data may be problematic for assessing transcript abundance for the purpose of normalizing FMRP-binding.

We acknowledge that TRAP will only enable isolation of mRNAs that are ribosome associated and therefore is not a perfect measure of transcript abundance. In optimizing our TRAP protocol we have taken care to titrate the antibody to maximize depletion of the ribosome-associated pool of mRNAs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and thereby capture as best as possible even those transcripts with low numbers of associated ribosomes.</p><p>To confirm that our TRAP data is representative of the transcriptome, we have taken the reviewer’s suggestion and used FACS to isolate CA1 neurons labelled in vivo with tdTomato (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While this technique is also not perfect for defining the in vivo transcriptome (due to the potential for changes to the transcriptome during the dissociation and sorting process and the loss of neuronal processes), we agree with the reviewers that concordance of the FMRP targets defined using these two different measures of transcript abundance provides more confidence in our findings.</p><p>We found that TRAP and FACS sequencing data were remarkably similar, with a correlation of R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). Those genes that were found to be differentially expressed between these two methods, are easily interpretable. For instance, histone transcripts were enriched in TRAP vs FACS since poly(A) selection was used in the preparation of FACS RNA-seq data and histone transcripts are not polyadenylated. In contrast, transcripts from the mitochondrial genome were only observed in FACS since these are translated by the mitochondrial ribosome which does not contain the labelled RPL22 ribosomal protein. Other transcripts that were enriched in TRAP vs FACS, include those encoding synaptic proteins and mitochondrial proteins (from the nuclear genome) that may be locally translated in neuronal processes removed during tissue dissociation.</p><p>We also compared CLIP scores determined by normalization to FACS RNA-seq to those calculated by normalization to TRAP as the measure of RNA abundance. Consistent with the high correlation between the read counts obtained with the two methods, the CLIP scores are also highly correlated (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A). Furthermore, the set of stringent targets defined in both cases showed the same decrease in CA1 TRAP in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Cre-lox dependent tagging of FMR1 could affect downstream interpretation since Fmr1 harbours alternative last coding exons and other processing events (eg.

These publications all agree that by far the most common splice variants are (1) the alternative splicing of exon 12, and (2) alternate splice acceptor sites in exons 15 (two) and 17 (one). However, a very small percentage of total FMRP in brain (perhaps 4-6%) is present as nuclear isoforms resulting from the exclusion of exon 14 (Brackett et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2015). This is significant for our work because it results in an alternate C-terminus on the FMRP protein. Our C-terminal tagging strategy will miss these FMRP isoforms because of the novel C-termini. In the paper describing the <italic>Fmr1</italic>-cTag mouse, we acknowledge and discuss that we are unable to query the RNA binding properties of these isoforms and we have added a statement to the current manuscript to make it clear that we are only assaying the predominant isoforms with the usual C-terminus but missing the minority which splice exon 14 out.</p><p>Subsection “FMRP cTag CLIP in CA1 neurons”: “The addition of the AcGFP-tag.… enables capture of all major isoforms of FMRP with the exception of a small minority of nuclear isoforms with an alternative c-terminus resulting from exclusion of exon 14”</p><p>Of relevance, the antibodies we used in the past for native FMRP CLIP were all generated against C-terminal epitopes (to avoid immunoprecipitating FXR1 and FXR2 which are very homologous through exon 14) and so they also fail to capture FMRP isoforms with alternate C-termini. While it’s unfortunate that we can’t capture all isoforms of FMRP with the cTag approach we are confident that the isoforms that we are able to capture make up the vast majority of FMRP in neurons and those associated with polyribosomes, and that the current data adds to our understanding of important functions of FMRP in specific cell types.</p><p>In the paper describing the generation of the cTag mouse we used RT-PCR to amplify sequences from exon 11 to the native 3’UTR in exon 17 in Cre(-) littermates or from exon 11 to the novel GFP tag in new exon 17 following Cre-dependent recombination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, which is data from Van Driesche et al., 2019). We found a very similar pattern of isoforms in both cases. We also used Western blotting to detect FMRP bands after running SDS-PAGE gels longer than usual to resolve the higher MW isoforms containing the GFP tag. Here we found that FMRP resolved into additional isoforms that appear similar in ratio to the endogenous forms, but cannot be quantitative about the identity or abundance of each (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46919-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, we realize we are missing a potentially important group of nuclear FMRP isoforms and acknowledge this in both papers.

The manuscript containing a full description and analysis of FMRP cTag CLIP in cerebellar neurons has been uploaded to BioRXiv (Van Driesche et al., 2019) and a copy of the manuscript has also been included in the resubmission of the current manuscript for the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the CLIP score calculation, the formula for RPKM used by the authors (which is somewhat unclear because of how it is typed out in the methods section) appears to be as follows:</p><p>〖RPKM〗_i = ((〖CrePos Counts〗_i-〖CreNeg Counts〗_i)(1000000)) / ((L/1000)(CrePos Total Counts-Cre Neg Total Counts))</p><p>where i is a specific transcript, L is the CDS length, and all counts originate in the CDS. It is recommended that Equation Editor is used to write the equation, but there is no way to do this in the review submission site, so just for clarity:</p><p>Numerator = (〖CrePos Counts〗_i-〖CreNeg Counts〗_i)(1000000)</p><p>Denominator = ((L/1000)(CrePos Total Counts-Cre Neg Total Counts))</p><p>This formula seems strange because if the Cre+ and Cre- samples are sequenced to the same depth (which is probably what the authors would attempt to do), then the denominator would be zero. I'm guessing that the actual formula probably comprises two separately normalized terms for the Cre+ and Cre- counts, but I could be misunderstanding something. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and we hope that the revised description of the CLIP score calculation provided in the methods is now clearer. In addition to using an equation editor to display the equations, we have also added further explanation in the methods section which describes how our library preparation methods enables the sequencing depths of the Cre positive and Cre negative samples to be representative of the number of RNA fragments immunoprecipitated in each case.</p><p>Subsection “CLIP score calculation”: “Fmr1-cTag<sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup> samples and parallel Cre negative Fmr1-cTag control samples were indexed at the reverse transcription step of the library preparation and pooled immediately after, such that both DNA libraries were purified and amplified together. Addition of a degenerate sequence in the RT primers enabled collapse of PCR duplicates. These steps enabled the size of the Fmr1-cTag<sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup>and Fmr1-cTag control libraries to have differing read depths that were relative to the number of CLIP tags isolated in the initial immunoprecipitation.</p><p>The coding region RPKM for a specific transcript i was calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>CrePoscounts</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>CreNegCounts</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CDSLength</mml:mtext><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TotalCrePoscounts -TotalCreNegCounts</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors use a linear regression model to identify high-affinity binding targets for FMRP based on their CLIP score analysis. This seems problematic because the data used as input are counting data, and this analysis does not appear to take counting noise and overdispersion into account. It is also unclear whether any statistical test was applied to this analysis. In order to compute the cumulative histograms in, for example, Figure 2, the authors used the generalized linear model in DESeq2 and applied it in a sophisticated way that takes sample pairing into account. Why not apply this same approach to the CLIP analysis (after taking into consideration the issues with normalization raised in point 1)? In principle, DESeq2 will account for coverage differences between samples and genes, account for overdispersion, and provide a test statistic for each transcript.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the valid concerns raised about the linear regression model used to determine the CLIP score, we have explored different ways in which to determine FMRP targets from our data.</p><p>Whilst DESeq2 is a powerful method for the comparison of RNA-Seq datasets, we feel that it is unsuitable for comparison of CLIP and RNA-seq which have very different depths, noise and dispersion, since DESeq2 applies a single dispersion estimate across all samples. Instead of using a standard DESeq2 analysis pipeline for the comparison, we have established an alternative analysis method that uses the raw counts across the coding region as the input, makes use of some of the elements implemented within the DESeq2 package in conjunction with a linear regression method and uses a negative binomial distribution to determine significance. This enables incorporation of a dispersion estimate and a statistical test. For further details please see a full description within the updated methods section (subsection “Alternative methods for normalizing CLIP”).</p><p>Stringent targets, as defined by this alternative method and an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, were similar to those identified by our original linear regression model and showed an equal decrease in abundance in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO TRAP (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Ultimately, given that none of the methods we have tested (use of FACS RNA-Seq data instead of TRAP or analysis incorporating a dispersion estimate and using a negative binomial distribution) seem to out-perform any of the others, we have chosen to keep with the original analysis pipeline. This has the advantage of using RPKM rather than direct count data for the regression analysis which should reduce length bias in our calculations. Furthermore, we find that mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins are more highly represented in TRAP than FACS and therefore normalization to FACS RNA-Seq could potentially bias towards these locally translated mRNAs in our CLIP analysis. For transparency, we have included in the revised manuscript a description of the individual methods (subsection “Alternative methods for normalizing CLIP”), comparisons of the different methods (Figure 2—figure supplement 4) and a full table of results for each method as Supplementary file 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors show a handful of cell type-specific transcripts on a volcano plot in Figure 2A to demonstrate the cell type-specificity of their TRAP experiments. The authors should consider an unbiased and systematic assessment with larger gene sets using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which the authors deployed in other parts of the paper. There are now numerous sources of cell type-specific gene sets for various neuronal and glial cell types from both bulk RNA-seq (e.g. from Barres and colleagues) and single-cell RNA-seq (e.g. from Linnarsson, McCarroll, and others).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed the proposed GSEA with two available single-cell RNA-Seq datasets from mouse hippocampus, one from the Linnarsson lab (Zeisel et al., 2015) and one from the McCarroll lab (Saunders et al., 2018). These corroborate our findings with a smaller subset of cell type specific markers and demonstrate enrichment of CA1 pyramidal cell-specific genes and depletion of markers of other hippocampal cell types in our immunoprecipitation. These data are provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors are requested to clarify how they controlled for possible length biases in their calculations. This is especially important when determining the validity of the observations in Figure 3E. The use of RPKM is valid as long as transcript length is stable (i.e. FMRP is not affecting transcript length).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this perceptive comment. Although we cannot completely rule out some length bias in our data (as with all sequencing-based datasets), we have taken all possible measures to control and test for this. As the reviewer noted, we have used RPKM rather than raw count data for our analysis to minimise the influence of transcript or coding region length in our analysis – something that we consider to be an important difference and improvement over our previously published FMRP whole brain CLIP target list. To confirm that transcript length is stable, we ran DEXSeq analysis on our WT and KO TRAP datasets and found no evidence for a change in exon usage or isoform expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse.</p><p>Given the correlation we observe between transcript length and FMRP binding, we have confirmed that our identification of targets is not driven by length alone, something that could imply a source of bias. Towards this end, we examined whether the decrease observed in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO TRAP was specific to our identified targets based on CLIP score or was seen across all long transcripts. We took a randomly selected length-matched set of control transcripts that had a CLIP score &lt; 1 and compared them to our stringent FMRP targets. In this analysis, no difference in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO was observed for the length-matched control transcripts, only the identified FMRP targets (Figure 3F). This provides strong evidence that we are selecting a specific subset of FMRP-regulated long transcripts in our analysis. We have also confirmed that our identification of targets is not biased towards highly expressed genes using the same approach by comparing stringent targets to a randomly selected expression-matched set of control transcripts. Again only the targets were found to be down-regulated in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>We have also considered whether 5’ or 3’ sequencing bias in our TRAP data could have led to an underestimation of the abundance of long transcripts and thereby an over-representation of long transcripts among our FMRP targets after normalization. To assess this, we compared CLIP scores calculated using only TRAP reads mapping within a 1 kb window at either the 5’ end or 3’ end of each transcript. CLIP scores were highly correlated regardless of whether transcript abundance was estimated from TRAP reads across the full transcript or either of these 1 kb windows (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Furthermore, the length distribution of stringent targets remained the same in each case (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>In summary, we have made every effort to control and test for length bias in our data but acknowledge that we cannot completely rule out an influence of sequencing bias in our calculations. As such, we have added a comment on length bias in the Discussion section of the manuscript to address the potential for length bias in our data and its possible implications on our findings.</p><p>Discussion section: “… we have made every attempt to minimize and test for length bias in our data, including the use of RPKM in our CLIP score determination, the use of parallel approaches (CLIP, TRAP and FACS RNA-Seq) and validation of our results by RT-qPCR. Thus, we think it is unlikely that sequencing bias has a significant effect on our determination of FMRP targets, although it is impossible to completely rule out any such effect, which could in turn lead to some influence on our observation that FMRP targets are enriched for long transcripts. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that our selection of targets is biologically relevant and not an artefact of length bias is the fact that the differences seen in the Fmr1 KO by TRAP are specific to targets even when comparing to length-matched controls (Figure 3F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the section investigating FMRP regulation of circadian rhythm transcripts, the authors should describe the background and cutoffs used in their functional analysis. This section would be strengthened if the authors could address whether FMRP affects the circadian-dependent changes in the expression of these genes by performing RT-(q)PCR and western blotting (as they have in Figure 2D-F).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any lack of clarity in our description of the functional analysis performed. We have supplied further explanation here and also when describing these results within the manuscript.</p><p>We identified circadian genes as targets of FMRP using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) tool from the Broad Institute. This algorithm takes a user supplied ranked list of genes (in this case a list of CA1 transcripts ranked either according to their CLIP score, or their log fold change in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO TRAP) and searches for gene sets that are statistically enriched at either end of the ranked list. The gene sets used are from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDb), a publicly accessible collection of curated gene sets that is maintained by the GSEA team. In our plots, we have displayed two primary statistical outputs from the GSEA analysis, the normalized enrichment score (NES) and the false discovery rate (FDR). The NES reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes normalized for differences in gene set sizes. The FDR is the estimated probability that a gene set with a given NES represents a false positive finding. Thus, in this type of analysis there is no specific background dataset since the analysis uses the complete ranked list. As a cutoff we considered only those gene sets that were statistically significantly enriched (FDR &lt; 0.05) in either our CLIP or TRAP ranked data.</p><p>Subsection “FMRP regulated mRNAs are enriched in specific biological functions”: “… we performed Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on our CLIP score ranked list and Fmr1 KO TRAP fold change ranked lists. This is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. bound vs unbound by CLIP or down-regulated vs up-regulated by TRAP). The algorithm takes a user supplied ranked list of genes and performs an unbiased search for gene sets that are statistically enriched at either end of the ranked list.”</p><p>Figure legends: “Normalized enrichment score (NES) reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes normalized for differences in gene set sizes and the q-value (false discovery rate) is the estimated probability that a gene set with a given NES represents a false positive finding. Black lines represent the position within the ranked list of each gene in the gene set.”</p><p>As additional validation that circadian-related FMRP target mRNAs are down-regulated in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, we have performed RT-PCR using hippocampal tissue from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT littermates for three stringent FMRP targets, Ppargc1a, Npas2 and Ncoa2. As anticipated, all 3 were significantly decreased in abundance in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) At present it is unclear whether the circadian genes regulated by FMRP are only expressed and/or bound in CA1 or whether such binding occurs in other brain regions important for circadian regulation. It is also unclear whether there are alterations in the rhythmic expression of clock genes in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mutants (related to point 9). At present, evidence relies heavily on the behavioural read-outs reported in the manuscript, which can be confounded by various factors affecting behaviours that are independent of FMRP's role in the regulation of circadian genes in the CA1 region. These caveats should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an excellent point. At present, we only have cell-type-specific CLIP data from neurons in the CA1 and cerebellum. Whilst, our data support that dysregulation of circadian genes occurs in CA1 but not cerebellar granule cells, we cannot rule out that FMRP regulates circadian transcripts in other brain regions not yet investigated. We have added a discussion of these caveats, as well as the possible influence of other brain regions on the behavioral phenotypes observed, and have highlighted the importance of future studies to investigate this further.</p><p>Discussion: “We find a specific regulation of circadian transcripts in CA1 pyramidal cells but not cerebellar granule cells, despite similar expression of these transcripts in both cell types (Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). To date, since in vivo cell-type-specific identification of FMRP binding and analysis of downstream regulation has only been performed in CA1 pyramidal neurons and cerebellar granule cells, it remains unclear if dysregulation of circadian transcripts exists in other circadian-relevant cell types in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse and whether this may also contribute to the behavioral phenotypes observed here. Nonetheless, the finding of cell-type specific circadian control in general, and additionally that such regulation can be FMRP-dependent, are important new observations.”</p><p>Discussion: “While our results combined with previous findings of others are suggestive of a direct link between altered circadian gene expression in the hippocampal CA1 region and altered CA1-dependent circadian behaviors, it remains to be tested whether other cell types or brain regions also contribute to these phenotypes. Future work, for example using CA1 specific deletion of FMRP, will be necessary to establish a direct link.”</p><p>To address the question of whether there are alterations in the rhythmic expression of clock genes in the CA1 of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, we have performed additional experiments with tissue collected at multiple time points across the circadian cycle. We chose to examine 4 circadian transcripts in CA1 tissue from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and their WT littermates that have been shown to have the greatest oscillations in human hippocampus across the circadian cycle. As anticipated, all showed significant differences in mRNA levels by RT-PCR across the circadian cycle. Of these, 3 showed a significant difference in expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO at least one time point while having comparable expression at other times during the circadian cycle (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). These data suggest a possible dysregulation of circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in CA1 in the absence of FMRP and provide a molecular correlate to our behavioral data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
