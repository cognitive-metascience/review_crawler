show a decrease in brain mass and a preponderance of extracellular Amyloid-β plaques. These plaques are formed by aggregation of polypeptides that are derived from the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Amyloid-β plaques are thought to play either a direct or an indirect role in disease progression, however the exact role of aggregation and plaque formation in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is subject to debate as the biological effects of soluble and aggregated Amyloid-β peptides are difficult to separate in vivo. To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-β oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-β peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-β oligomers underlie the pathologies of A. We use <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. rerio</italic> to show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization of Amyloid-β were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-β oligomerization from Amyloid-β expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-β oligomers also recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD. We show that the lifespan deficit induced by Amyloid-β oligomers was reduced with Li<sup>+</sup> treatment. Our results present the first model to separate different aspects of disease progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that damages the brain over time. The cause is not clear, but a toxic molecule called Amyloid-β peptide seems to play a part. It builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, forming hard clumps called plaques. Yet, though the plaques are a hallmark of the disease, experimental treatments designed to break them down do not seem to help. This raises the question – do Amyloid-β plaques actually cause Alzheimer's disease?</p><p>Answering this question is not easy. One way to study the effect of amyloid plaques is to inject clumps of Amyloid-β peptides into model organisms. This triggers Alzheimer's-like brain damage, but it is not clear why. It remains difficult to tell the difference between the damage caused by the injected Amyloid-β peptides and the damage caused by the solid plaques that they form. For this, researchers need a way to trigger plaque formation directly inside animal brains. This would make it possible to test the effects of plaque-targeting treatments, like the drug lithium.</p><p>Optogenetics is a technique that uses light to control molecules in living animals. Hsien, Kaur et al. have now used this approach to trigger plaque formation by fusing light-sensitive proteins to Amyloid-β peptides in worms, fruit flies and zebrafish. This meant that the peptides clumped together to form plaques whenever the animals were exposed to blue light. This revealed that, while both the Amyloid-β peptides and the plaques caused damage, the plaques were much more toxic. They damaged cell metabolism and caused tissue loss that resembled late Alzheimer's disease in humans. To find out whether it was possible to test Alzheimer's treatments in these animals, Hsien, Kaur et al. treated them with the drug, lithium. This increased their lifespan, reversing some of the damage caused by the plaques.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease affects more than 46.8 million people worldwide and is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA. But, despite over 50 years of research, there is no cure. This new plaque-formation technique allows researchers to study the effects of amyloid plaques in living animals, providing a new way to test Alzheimer's treatments. This could be of particular help in studies of experimental drugs that aim to reduce plaque formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG17-LR001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolwinski</surname><given-names>Nicholas S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG17-BS101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG18-LR001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolwinski</surname><given-names>Nicholas S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012693</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-607-265-225-121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathuru</surname><given-names>Ajay S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optogenetic approach has been developed to model Alzheimer's disease allowing light-induced Amyloid-β aggregation and tested in three model organisms, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. rerio</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating, age-associated, neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 46.8 million people worldwide and represents the 6th leading cause of death in the United States of America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De-Paula et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Despite extensive efforts over the last 50 years, no disease-modifying therapy has been found and, most recently, several high-profile Phase III clinical trials have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim and Mathuru, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2018</xref>). The AD clinical trial landscape has largely been dominated by the amyloid cascade hypothesis, with more than 50% of the drugs targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) in Phase III trials alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cummings et al., 2018</xref>). The amyloid cascade hypothesis, in its original form, posits the deposition of Aβ, in particular the extracellular Aβ plaque, as the main driver of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardy and Higgins, 1992</xref>). However, the causative role of Aβ plaques has recently been challenged, because of the failure of numerous interventions targeting Aβ plaques in Phase III trials and the observation of Aβ plaques in brains of non-AD symptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cummings, 2018</xref>). Model organisms ranging from nematodes to mice have further shown that AD pathology can be modeled in the absence of obvious Aβ plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teo et al., 2019</xref>). These observations point to a different mechanism for Aβ neurotoxicity perhaps through Aβ’s intracellular accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LaFerla et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Amyloid plaques are macroscopic extracellular protein aggregates, but intracellular Aβ must function in smaller units of peptides, oligomers or aggregates. Of these, soluble Aβ oligomers appear to be the main toxic species in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira and Klein, 2011</xref>). For example, Aβ oligomers have been shown to induce neurotoxic effects including memory loss in transgenic animal models reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mroczko et al. (2018)</xref>. These studies, however, mostly rely on in vitro injection of synthetic Aβ oligomers or oligomers extracted from AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mroczko et al., 2018</xref>). There is currently a lack of tools that can directly control Aβ oligomerization in vivo, which would allow direct examination of the effects of Aβ oligomerization.</p><p>Here, we describe an optogenetic method to study Amyloid-β (Aβ) protein oligomerization in vivo in different model organisms and apply it to delineating mechanisms of disease progression. Optogenetics hinges on light responsive proteins that can be fused to genes of interest, allowing for the spatial and temporal regulation of proteins in a highly precise manner. Temporal-spatial control is achieved simply by the exposure of the target system to lights of a specific wavelength, without the need to introduce other external agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Möglich and Moffat, 2010</xref>). One such optogenetic protein, a modified version of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) protein, oligomerizes into photobodies quickly and reversibly in the presence of blue light at 488 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Más et al., 2000</xref>). In cultured cells, expression of the photolyase homology region of CRY2 fused to mCherry led to puncta within 10 s of exposure to blue light and these puncta dispersed within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bugaj et al., 2013</xref>). This basic unit of CRY2-mCherry attached to a variety of proteins have, for instance, been used to study cortical actin dynamics in cell contractility during tissue morphogenesis, the dynamics of Wnt and EGF signaling, plasma membrane composition and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugaj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guglielmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address the role of aggregation of intracellular Aβ in the pathophysiological effects of AD, we developed a light-inducible system for use in model organisms.

A second approach to making inducible aggregates using a chemically controlled fluorescent protein has been published, but not yet widely tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyazaki et al., 2016</xref>). Other previous approaches lacked an inducible oligomerization tool and could only demonstrate Aβ oligomers’ toxicity through exogenous injection of Aβ oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mroczko et al., 2018</xref>). We use a tool to investigate the pathological effects of intracellular Aβ oligomerization in nematodes and flies, human kidney cells, and in the vertebrate model organism zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Despite the reversibility of CRY2 clustering in previous findings, we find that CRY2 initiated clustering of Aβ appeared to be irreversible likely due to the structure of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antzutkin et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with existing literature showing that Aβ oligomers induce oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butterfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forloni and Balducci, 2018</xref>), we show that light-induced oligomerization of Aβ, but not Aβ expression alone, is necessary for the metabolic defects, loss of mitochondria and inflammation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Light-induced oligomerization also leads to physical damage of the nervous system in <italic>D. rerio</italic>, resembling the loss of brain tissue in AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The embryonic assay for physical damage phenocopies brain lesions only to some degree as the extent of the damage is enhanced by the forces applied to the developing neural tissue. The irreversibility of Aβ aggregates once initiated as seen here, also hints at intrinsic properties that may be unique or unusual to this peptide and warrants further investigation. It is also likely to prove a good model for testing anti-aggregation compounds.</p><p>We anticipate that our approach will serve as an attractive tool for carrying out drug screens and mechanistic studies for the treatment of AD. This optogenetic strategy will also undoubtedly complement other techniques due to the high level of spatiotemporal specificity. For example, it could be optimally positioned to gain insights into the unresolved mechanism of Aβ - whether oligomerization and subsequent accumulation or lack of effective clearance underpins AD pathologies. The separation of two phases of AD progression also suggests that single drug treatments will not suffice, and perhaps combinatorial approaches should be tried.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning of optogenetic transgenes</title><p>DNA sequences corresponding to the human Amyloidβ1–42 amino acid sequence were synthesized (IDT) into a Gateway technology (Invitrogen) entry vector.

Subsequently, the guts were carefully transferred onto a small droplet of 1x PBS on a 35 mm glass bottom dish. Using fine forceps, the gut was repositioned to resemble its natural orientation. PBS was then removed from the area surrounding the gut, leaving a small amount of excess PBS to hold the gut in place and prevent desiccation. The 3 mm glass bottom dish was then mounted onto the Zeiss LSM800 (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) for imaging. The super-resolution imaging function on the Zeiss LSM800 was used for the bleaching and fluorescence recovery. A small square within a cell was defined as the bleaching area and this same square was used for all bleaching experiments. Bleaching was performed at 4% laser power using the 488 nm laser for 1 s and the recovery was followed every 30 s for 20 minutes. The fluorescence intensity of the bleaching square (F<sub>S</sub>), the entire cell (F<sub>C</sub>) and the background (F<sub>B</sub>) at each time point was computed by the ZEN 3.1 (Blue edition) software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). For determination of percentage fluorescence recovery, the background fluorescence was subtracted from the fluorescence of the bleaching square (F<sub>S</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>) and the fluorescence of the entire cell (F<sub>C</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>). The (F<sub>S</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>)/ (F<sub>C</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>) was computed at each time point and the (F<sub>S</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>)/(F<sub>C</sub>-F<sub>B</sub>) before bleaching was set to 100%.

They provide evidence for light-induced oligomerization in each system and an initial characterization of phenotypes. Of note, is the fact that the authors generated four separate models that fall into three distinct categories: in vitro (cell culture), invertebrate (<italic>C. elegans, D. melanogaster</italic>), and vertebrate (<italic>D. rerio</italic>) to corroborate their findings and to demonstrate their utility. That the authors took the time and effort to generate multiple models, which could be of use to a variety of researchers working in the area of neurodegeneration is commendable. However, some significant limitations and missing controls were identified in the current manuscript that reduce the utility of the system and the strength of the conclusion. These should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key controls appear to be missing from several of the phenotypic characterization experiments. Non-transgenic animals under dark and light conditions should be shown for each experiment, so that any effects of the light treatment can be understood. It would also be useful to have control strains where amyloid-β-mCH is expressed without the CRY2 to demonstrate that the phenotypes are caused by the oligomerization rather than an interaction between the amyloid-β and/or mCH with light treatment.</p><p>2) We don't understand why the authors seem to assume that oligomerization does not also happen in the dark conditions. It has been shown that transgenically expressed amyloid-β in both worms and flies will aggregate in a time-dependent manner in the absence of the optogenetic system. Might these studies reflect a relative difference in the abundance of oligomers and aggregates rather than an all or none comparison. The text should be rewritten to reflect this or an explanation otherwise should be provided.</p><p>3) There is no evidence that the aggregates seen here are related to the aggregates found in neurodegenerative disease. Most of the aggregating protein consists of Cry and mCherry with only little Aβ. Some biochemistry or Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to characterize the light induced aggregates should be provided. Are these aggregates protease resistant?, Are the fluorescent aggregates really immobile or are they lose aggregates as determined by FRAP? The ThT stain in S4 suggest that they may even be amyloids. Especially given that the aggregates appear to be toxic, it would be really important to know what sort of aggregate is produced through light induced polymerization.</p><p>4) The authors hypothesize that Li<sup>+</sup> rescues the lifespan deficit induced by AB oligomers via Wnt signaling, however, no evidence is provided other than a reference to previously published studies. It would be good to know that Wnt signaling is indeed the mechanism in this case, and in addition to measure the physical and metabolic damage that the authors report in the first part of their study for at least one additional model rather than mixing and matching between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (ideally, one of the invertebrate models and the vertebrate model). Because this is the first in vivo report of its kind using optogenetics, it would be preferable to show that what is expected (i.e. Li<sup>+</sup> extending lifespan and curbing detrimental effects of AB oligomers) actually occurs via the expected/previously described mechanism.</p><p>5) Why were the physiology and/or health status parameters such as sensorimotor function, ATP deficit, number of mitochondria and oxidative damage not measured in the only vertebrate model? In addition to neuronal death, these endpoints would make a more convincing case for this model.</p><p>6) Information about replication for many of the phenotypic assays appears to be missing and should be provided. Figure 1 needs better quantification, with regards to number of aggregates as well as intensity to conduct statistical tests to determine real differences. Figure 7 needs quantification, with regards to number of aggregates as well as intensity of them in HEK293 cells. With quantitation this could be a very strong piece of data.</p><p>7) The use of the hsp-16 promoter in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is unfortunate as the need for heat shock creates a confound. Induction of chaperones from the heat shock itself is likely to impact the dynamics of amyloid-β, as has been previously shown in other transgenic lines. Optimally, the authors would create another inducible or constitutive system which could be compared to the heat shock system in order to understand the impact of chaperone induction. At a minimum a detailed description of this limitation and a justification for why the authors do not feel this is a significant limitation should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52589.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key controls appear to be missing from several of the phenotypic characterization experiments.

We did not perform all of the specific controls for CRY2 as the CRY2 system has been extensively studied in a variety of systems, for examples please see [1-12]. The discovery of the oligomerizing domain [13], led to its adoption for study of protein-protein interactions [14] and signaling in mammalian cells [2] and introduction into insect development [4, 10, 15], transcription [6], and signaling studies [8, 9, 12, 16]. Therefore, the comparison we undertook was mainly based on light conditions.</p><p>We have attempted to address the concerns by adding a control removing CRY2 from the construct making Aβ-mCherry expressed in zebrafish. This construct does not cause neuronal cell death, Video 5.</p><p>We have added controls for <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments for light and dark and heat shock, see below. For <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we cannot complete the additional controls in the two month window as it requires generating new lines expressing Aβ-mCherry, CRY2-mCherry, CRY2 and mCherry alone from the att40 site we used for the Aβ-CRY2-mCherry insertion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We don't understand why the authors seem to assume that oligomerization does not also happen in the dark conditions.

In this paper, we focus on intracellular oligomerization, comparing fast and slow, relating to our previous work on intracellular Aβ [17, 18].</p><p>We have added an experiment tracking a closeup of an aggregate. We have added the FRAP experiment looking at the dynamics of clusters and comparing it to an unrelated UAS-Arm-CRY2-mCherry construct[9].</p><p>The clusters appear to be mobile within cells as can be seen in the zebrafish video especially. They are much less dynamic than the comparable Arm construct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors hypothesize that Li<sup>+</sup> rescues the lifespan deficit induced by AB oligomers via Wnt signaling, however, no evidence is provided other than a reference to previously published studies.

We have changed the text to reflect the various possible mechanisms by which Lithium has been proposed to function in AD. The tissue culture results point to GSK3 as the target as both Li<sup>+</sup> and CHIR target it. A full analysis of Wnt isn’t feasible in the two month window, but is now underway.</p><p>We have added biochemical analysis of the vertebrate model zebrafish confirming the <italic>C. elegans</italic> findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why were the physiology and/or health status parameters such as sensorimotor function, ATP deficit, number of mitochondria and oxidative damage not measured in the only vertebrate model?

The choice was made based on the availability of Gateway ready vectors for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and new lines are being made in line with our recent AD model [18]. Since, as part of this study, we generated models in different model organisms in parallel, availability of reagents facilitating multiplexing was critical and this informed our choice. We agree that this imposes limitations and have therefore modified the main text of the manuscript to more fully reflect and discuss them.</p><p>To further understand how heat-shock treatment may impact the dynamics of Aβ in our transgenic strains and to separate the effects of heat-shock treatment from Aβ expression, we have included the following controls in all metabolic and phenotypic assays:</p><p>a) transgenic animals in both heat-shock (Aβ HS L) and non-heat-shock (Aβ -HS L)</p><p>b) non-transgenic control animals in both heat-shock (Ctrl HS) and non-heat-shock (Ctrl –HS)</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now added a detailed description of this limitation and a justification involving the comparison of the above controls in the text as follows:</p><p>“Induction of chaperones from heat-shock has previously been shown to impact the dynamics of Aβ. […] However, animals that had been heat-shocked had significantly higher Aβ levels compared to non-heat-shocked animals, suggesting that heat-shock, as intended, drove higher level of Aβ expression and that this was not compensated for by secondary induction of chaperones.”</p><p>“To further examine whether the metabolic detriments were mediated by heat-shock treatment, we have included a heat-shocked non-transgenic control in the metabolic and phenotypic assays. […] This suggests that regardless of the effects of heat-shock and chaperone induction, oligomerization still negatively impacts the phenotypes.”</p><p><bold>Reference:</bold></p><p>[1] Bugaj L, Spelke D, Mesuda C, Varedi M, Kane R, Schaffer D.
