Molecular chaperones are proteins that assist the covalent folding or unfolding of proteins and the assembly or disassembly of protein complexes. One major function of chaperones is to prevent both newly synthesized polypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into non-functional structures. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is called ER stress. The cell has an adaptive system against ER stress called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is the coordinated transcriptional upregulation of ER chaperones and folding enzymes that prevents the aggregation of unfolded and incompletely folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han and Kaufman, 2017</xref>). The UPR is initiated by the activation of the following three signal transducers located in the ER: IRE1Î±, PERK and ATF6. Disturbance of the UPR has important pathological consequences, including diabetes, neurodegenerative disease and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MartÃ­nez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To overcome ER stress-related diseases, the following two pharmacological strategies can be applied: the modulation of ER protein folding environments (by UPR modulators) and a reduction in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded ER proteins (by chemical chaperones). With the past decade of research, encouraging progress has been made in this area through the identification of several compounds. Several UPR modulators that show therapeutic benefits in mouse disease models have been developed. KIRA6, an inhibitor of the UPR regulator IRE1, and azoramide, an ER calcium modulator, have shown potent anti-diabetic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). Both Sephin1, a PPP1R15A inhibitor, and ISRIB, an eIF2B activator, modulate PERK signalling and have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halliday et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, several chemical chaperones that have shown therapeutic benefits in mouse disease models have also been developed. 4-Phenylbutyrate (4PBA) and taurourso-deoxycholic acid (TUDCA) have been reported to function as chemical chaperones and have shown therapeutic benefits for a wide variety of diseases, such as diabetes, ALS and Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozcan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cudkowicz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nunes et al., 2012</xref>). These data indicate that pharmacological intervention to alleviate ER stress is a promising approach for treating a range of diseases.</p><p>Although chemical chaperones represent an interesting potential novel class of therapeutics, due to limitations including high concentration treatment of currently known chemical chaperones, identifying novel chemical classes of chemical chaperones is desirable. Several approaches for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules have been used. First, a cell survival-based HTS approach to identify small molecules that protect cells against ER stress-induced cell death was attempted. Indeed, salubrinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyce et al., 2005</xref>) and compound 13d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan et al., 2017</xref>) were identified by HTS as small molecules to protect neuronal cells or pancreatic Î²-cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis, respectively. However, this phenotypic HTS has challenges in compound target identification. A molecular target-based approach for drug discovery was also attempted. For example, KIRAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axten et al., 2012</xref>), and the IRE1/PERK activator IPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendez et al., 2015</xref>) were identified or developed from an initial screening hit by structure-based design. Undoubtedly, molecular target-based screening has some advantages over phenotypic screenings, as a molecular target assay is often required for subsequent chemical optimization of lead compounds from HTS hit compounds. However, target-based drug discovery may have limitations because multiple targets and signalling pathways can be involved in pathological conditions. Having the best features of phenotypic and molecular target-based HTS, signalling pathway HTS has gained momentum for identifying UPR modulators. For instance, the PERK inhibitors GSK2606414 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axten et al., 2012</xref>) and ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>), the IRE1 inhibitors STF-083010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papandreou et al., 2011</xref>) and 4Î¼8c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cross et al., 2012</xref>), the ATF6 inhibitor Ceapins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>) and the ATF6 activator AA147 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plate et al., 2016</xref>) were identified using PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 reporter assays, respectively.</p><p>One of the key obstacles of HTS for chemical chaperones is the lack of a quantitative assay to directly monitor ER protein folding. We attempted to tackle this obstacle by utilizing a UPR signalling assay. Here, we employed a cell-based HTS with a highly sensitive UPR signalling reporter and discovered 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole derivatives (IBTs) as chemical chaperones. Biochemical and chemical biology approaches revealed that IBT21 directly binds unfolded or misfolded proteins to inhibit protein aggregation. Finally, IBT21 prevented cell death caused by chemically induced ER stress and a proteotoxin, an aggression-prone prion protein, indicating that IBT21, as a chemical chaperone, alleviates ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-based high-throughput screen for chemical chaperones</title><p>The UPR is mainly mediated by the following three transcription factors: XBP1 for the IRE1 pathway, ATF4 for the PERK pathway and ATF6 for the ATF6 pathway. Activation of each branch of the UPR can be reported by transcriptional reporters containing ER stress response element-2 (ERSE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kokame et al., 2001</xref>), unfolded protein response element (UPRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>) and amino acid response element (AARE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruhat et al., 2000</xref>), which are ATF6, XBP1 and ATF4 binding sequences, respectively. We established a UPR activation EGFP reporter (EUA-EGFP) cell line containing ten tandem repeats of ERSE2 (10X <underline>E</underline>RSE2), ten tandem repeats of UPRE (10X <underline>U</underline>PRE) and five tandem repeats of AARE (5X <underline>A</underline>ARE) in the region upstream of a minimal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We hypothesized that chemical chaperones could be identified by monitoring UPR activation for reductions under ER stress conditions. The EUA-EGFP reporter cells allowed us to perform 384-well HTS via a sensitive (signal-to-background ratioÂ =Â 5.09Â Â±Â 1.28) and robust (Zâ factorÂ =Â 0.78Â Â±Â 0.06) homogeneous assay using a microplate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We screened the 217,765-compound chemical library from the Drug Discovery Initiative at the University of Tokyo. The small molecule inhibition of EUA-EGFP cells was normalized to the untreated control (assigned to be 100% inhibition), as was the cell viability, allowing comparisons between the screening plates. A first screening was carried out with all compounds at a concentration of 5 ÂµM. We identified 1920 compounds for which the % EUA-EGFP inhibition was greater than the average + 5 SD of the Tm-treated control (hit cut-offÂ =Â 37%) and the % viability was greater than the average + 3 SD of the Tm-treated control (hit cut-offÂ =Â 78%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Confirmation screening was carried out with all compounds at a concentration of 0.5 ÂµM in the second screening round. To decrease the number of compounds for follow-up, we chose the top 10 inhibition hits. A maximum common substructure search identified a common scaffold in 4 of 10 compounds: the 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole skeleton (shown in red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). Although the other six compounds had the same high activity, they were all singletons with no common chemical structure. Therefore, we prioritized the analysis of the compounds with the 2-phenylimidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole scaffold. The other six compounds remain to be analyzed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structure-activity relationship study of imidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole derivatives (IBTs)</title><p>To define the common scaffold of the hits, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was conducted for the 28 compounds considered imidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole derivatives (IBTs). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for UPR activation was calculated using a five-point dose-response curve for the 28 compounds. Hierarchical structure clustering analysis revealed four major clusters in the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The active compounds belonged to two clusters, suggesting that both R1 and R2 in the IBTs are important for the observed activity. Removal of the phenyl group at the R1 position completely abolished UPR inhibition, indicating that the phenyl group is necessary for potency. Preferred substituents at the <italic>p-</italic>position of the R1 phenyl group include hydrogen groups (IBT6, IBT9, IBT15, IBT19 and IBT21), halogen groups (IBT2, IBT17 and IBT22), an ethyl group (IBT14) and a methoxy group (IBT3, IBT5, IBT8 and IBT12). In contrast, methyl groups (IBT4 and IBT10) and amino groups (IBT18) were not preferred. To investigate whether the activity decrease at R2 is caused by an amide bond or by bulkiness, we designed and synthesized a methyl-substituted amide-containing IBT (IBT29).

One of the limitations of the current screening is that the target proteins of the hit compounds were unidentified. Since small moleculeâtarget interaction profiles are useful for structure-based drug design to improve the lead compound, this compound should be capable of linker attachment to pull down a target protein. To obtain a bioactive IBT probe for pulldown, R1 could be an appropriate site for linker attachment because the SAR results predicted that linker attachment at the R2 position might lead to loss of activity. IBT21 is the only compound that has no substituent at the R1 phenyl group 2-position among the top five compounds. In terms of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, a compound with a lower logP value is preferred, and IBT21 was the compound with the lowest logP value. Given these considerations, we decided to further characterize IBT21, and synthesized IBT21 ourselves and confirmed its structure and activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison of IBT21 and the validated UPR modulator and chemical chaperone</title><p>Several compounds have been reported to mitigate ER stress, such as UPR modulators or chemical chaperones. To the best of our knowledge, IBT21 has a unique structure compared with previously reported UPR modulators or chemical chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). According to a database search, IBT21 was registered in PubChem (CID: 735314, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and SciFinder (CAS Registry Number 692744-81-3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scifinder.cas.org/">https://scifinder.cas.org/</ext-link>). Moreover, there were 3042 types of 2-phenyl IBT scaffold compounds in PubChem and 9878 types in SciFinder as of February 24, 2019, but no chemical chaperone-like activity has been reported. To assess the effects of IBT21, we next aimed to compare the activity of IBT21 to that of a validated UPR modulator and a chemical chaperone, azoramide (AZO) and 4PBA, respectively. To evaluate the activity with more information including the cell morphology, we first established a UPR inhibition assay using the EUA-EGFP reporter and high content image analysis. Cell morphology and EUA-EGFP reporter activation can be evaluated simultaneously with high sensitivity (signal-to-background ratioÂ =Â 15.3) and robustness (Zâ factorÂ =Â 0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C and D</xref>). At 10 ÂµM IBT21, Tm-induced UPR activation was inhibited 91.8% by IBT21 in 293A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>), as well as in another human cell line, Hap1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We utilized our high content image analysis to investigate the potential UPR modulation by small molecules. IBT21 demonstrated an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.95 Î¼M, consistent with the IC<sub>50</sub> (0.61 Î¼M) obtained from the HTS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To directly monitor each branch of the UPR, we established EGFP reporter cell lines containing twenty-five tandem repeats of ERSE2, UPRE or AARE in the region upstream of a minimal promoter to detect the activation of the ATF6, IRE1 or PERK branches of the UPR, respectively. As expected, IBT21 suppressed the Tm-induced activation of all three reporters in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâC</xref>). Indeed, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for ERSE2 (0.24 Î¼M), UPRE (0.33 Î¼M) and AARE (0.46 Î¼M) were similar to that of EUA-EGFP (0.61 Î¼M), producing a similar dose-response curve. To further rule out off-target effects through which IBT21 might induce a pseudo-response to the reporter, we assessed the effects of IBT21 by examining the expression levels of UPR downstream target genes by immunoblot analyses. As expected, the levels of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP, markers of PERK branch signalling, were increased by Tm, and IBT21 treatment abolished these increases in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, IBT21 decreased the levels of DNAJB9, a marker of IRE1 branch signalling, and SEL1L and HERPUD1, markers of ATF6 branch signalling, which were induced by Tm. By contrast, the UPR modulator AZO did not decrease any markers in the UPR by Tm, consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2015</xref>).

To demonstrate the chemical chaperone activity of IBT21, we conducted several experiments. First, we overexpressed active UPR transcription factor and examined the effects of IBT21 on transcriptional induction of UPR target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). IBT21 did not change the expression of CHOP or 4E-BP1, downstream targets of ATF4, in the ATF4-overexpressing cells. Additionally, IBT21 did not change the expression of BiP in the cells overexpressing an active form of ATF6 [ATF6 (N)], These data show that IBT21 does not affect the ability to induce UPR target genes. Next, we assessed the effects of IBT21 on protein translation by measuring protein synthesis based on the incorporation of puromycin into newly synthesized proteins through its detection with anti-puromycin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We evaluated that IBT21 does not affect protein translation. Furthermore, we tested whether IBT21 can also reduce ER stress caused by dithiothreitol (DTT), which does not require protein translation to induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We showed that IBT21 modestly reduced DTT-induced ER stress by monitoring the activation of EUA-EGFP reporter cells. In contrast, IBT21 could not suppress the induction of heat-shock response by heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>).

To monitor protein aggregation in vivo, we first took advantage of the ProteoStat dye, a molecular rotor that binds selectively to aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). Proteasomal inhibition is known to lead to the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins organized in perinuclear structures termed âaggresomesâ. As expected, aggregated protein cargo was visualized with a punctate red fluorescence pattern in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. When we treated cells with Tm, diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed that differed between the control cells and MG132-treated cells with discrete punctuate staining, indicating the accumulation of aggregated proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Quantification of the ProteoStat dye staining within cells revealed increased fluorescence intensity in the Tm-treated cells (2.29-fold of untreated (UT)) and MG132-treated cells (2.33-fold of UT), and lower fluorescence intensity in the cells co-treated with Tm and IBT21 (0.87-fold of UT), showing that IBT21 prevented protein aggregation induced by Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To validate the direct effect of IBT21 on protein aggregation inhibition, an in vitro protein aggregation assay was performed using human insulin and the ProteoStat dye.

Misfolded or aggregated proteins are prone to forming stable, detergent-insoluble, high molecular weight (HMW) oligomers together with molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>). We previously developed and modified a method to estimate the amount of misfolded or aggregated protein in the ER based on the levels of the molecular chaperone BiP (also known as HSPA5) in SDS-resistant HMW complexes (<bold>AGGREGATED</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hisanaga et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Compared with the levels of BiP in the INPUT fraction, the levels of BiP in the <bold>AGGREGATED</bold> fraction corresponding to misfolded or aggregated proteins in the ER were increased by Tm treatment (3.1-fold of UT), and this increase was significantly suppressed by IBT21 treatment (1.7-fold of UT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). IBT21 treatment did not change the levels of BiP under ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) or under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C,D</xref>), indicating that IBT21 did not lead to reduced expression or enhanced degradation of BiP. Having established that IBT21 reduced the levels of the SDS-resistant HMW BiP-containing complex induced by Tm, we next determined the profile of proteins in the SDS-resistant HMW BiP-containing complex to directly monitor proteostasis changes. The <bold>AGGREGATED</bold> fraction samples containing the SDS-resistant HMW BiP-containing complex were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, and 1233 proteins were detected by this LC-MS/MS analysis. To avoid false positive protein identification, we filtered 598 proteins identified withÂ â¥2 unique peptides per protein andÂ â¥5 peptide-spectrum matches. Then, to determine the proteins modulated by IBT21, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins among the 598 proteins with the following criteria: 1) 1.5-fold enrichment in the Tm-treated samples compared to the UT samples and 2) 1.5-fold enrichment in the Tm-treated samples compared to the Tm- and IBT21-treated samples. We found that 211 of 598 proteins (35.3%) were affected by Tm, and 125 of those 211 proteins (59.2%) were affected by IBT21 (IBT-<bold>SENSITIVE</bold> proteins), suggesting that IBT21 prevents Tm-induced protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, their subcellular localization and cellular functions were classified by Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Extracellular compartments were highly enriched in the category of cellular components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These enrichments support that IBT21 acts on the folding of proteins synthesized in the ER because secreted and membrane-bound proteins are synthesized in the ER. For example, the proteins we identified included Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and Transgelin-2 (TAGLN2), and these proteins represent the protein group affected by Tm and IBT21, as ANXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goulet et al., 1992</xref>) and TAGLN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) were reported or predicted to have <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites for secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition to ER client proteins, proteins required for proteostasis could also be affected by Tm and IBT21. As expected, protein folding was highly enriched in the category of biological function, as the representative proteins from the <bold>AGGREGATED</bold> fraction included the molecular chaperone HSPA5 and the ER folding enzyme PDIA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Thus far, our observations support that IBT21 has chemical chaperone activity against ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>In vivo target protein identification of IBT21 during ER stress</title><p>To examine the direct binding of IBT21 to unfolded or misfolded proteins in vivo, we took advantage of diazido photoaffinity labelling probes, which allow a chemical biology approach for profiling IBT21-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosoya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hosoya et al., 2005</xref>). We designed a diazido-functionalized IBT21 analogue, diazido-IBT21, as a candidate photoaffinity labelling probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The activity of diazido-IBT21 was comparable to that of IBT21, and we used the more potent compound IBT22 as a competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). With a promising diazido-IBT21 probe in hand, we performed in vivo target protein identification experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In principle, the target proteins were specifically captured by covalent bonding via photoreaction of the probe aromatic azido group. The remaining probe aliphatic azido group was subsequently subjected to biotin labelling via Cu-catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) for pulldown of the target proteins. In total, 1441 proteins were detected as IBT-BOU<bold>N</bold>DED proteins and were classified with the following criteria: 1) 1.5-fold change in the probe-treated samples compared to the probe- and competitor-treated samples (<bold>competed</bold>) and 2) 1.5-fold change in the probe-treated samples compared to the UT samples (<bold>selective</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The IBT-BOU<bold>N</bold>DED proteins were categorized into the following four groups: Competed and Selective (1205 proteins), Competed (11 proteins), Selective (185 proteins) and Non-Specific (40 proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The <bold>Competed and Selective prot</bold>ei<bold>ns were</bold> the majority (84%) of the IBT-<bold>BOUNDED</bold> proteins. To characterize the IBT21-targeted proteins to corresponding chemical chaperone activity, we analyzed the <bold>Overlapped</bold> proteins observed in both the IBT-<bold>SENSITIVE</bold> proteins and the <bold>Competed and Selective</bold> proteins. As expected, the Overlapped proteins included ANXA1 and TAGLN2, which were also identified as IBT21-rescued aggregation-prone proteins (IBT-<bold>SENSITIVE</bold> proteins), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The GO enrichment analysis revealed that groups of extracellular components were highly enriched in the <bold>Overlapped</bold> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). GO enrichment results of the IBT-<bold>SENSITIVE</bold> proteins were different from that of the IBT-bonded <bold>Competed and Selective</bold> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>) because IBT21 is stabilizing many more proteins that cannot be detected in the experiment that determined IBT-sensitive compounds. Nevertheless, the <bold>Overlapped</bold> proteins contained approximately 60% of the IBT-<bold>SENSITIVE</bold> proteins in each enriched GO group, indicating that the <bold>Competed and Selective</bold> proteins largely cover the IBT21-targeted proteins corresponding to chemical chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Prion disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded and protease-resistant form of prion protein (PrP). As a secretory protein, PrP is synthesized in the ER, and approximately 10% of PrP is naturally misfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yedidia et al., 2001</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that perturbations in ER homeostasis may contribute to neurodegeneration in prion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi and Dong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torres et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we chose mutant PrP, which was previously reported to cause ER stress, as an ER proteotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). To monitor the expression levels of PrP, EGFP was fused to wild-type PrP (WT PrP) or mutant PrP (mut PrP). Overexpression of mut PrP inhibited cell proliferation, and 5 Î¼M IBT21 treatment restored the cell growth inhibition caused by mutant PrP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Consistent with the results from the proliferation assays using the high content imaging system, the recovery of viability loss by IBT21 treatment in the mutant PrP-overexpressing cells was also confirmed by a biochemical assay with CellTiter-Glo. Collectively, these data provide in vivo evidence that IBT21 protects cells against ER stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, we aimed to identify a potent chemical chaperone <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aac.asm.org/content/54/5/1712.short">through the HTS of a small molecule chemical library</ext-link>. We discovered that IBTs function as chemical chaperones and directly bind unfolded or misfolded proteins to inhibit protein aggregation using the compound IBT21. Consistent with the protective nature of chemical chaperones, IBT21 protected cells from death caused by ER stress. The observed effects cannot be explained by a simple mechanism because these compounds have a planar conjugated ring system similar to many DNA intercalators; however, IBTs are promising scaffolds for chemical chaperones. Furthermore, based on our SAR studies, we might predict more potent IBT compounds. The combination of the methoxy group at the <italic>m-</italic>position of IBT3 or the chloro group at the <italic>p-</italic>position of IBT17 for R1 and the methoxycarbonyl group of IBT15 or methylamide group of IBT29 for R2 seems to be ideal. In addition to assessing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of IBTs, we will pursue lead compound optimization in future studies.</p><p>Chemical chaperones can be divided into the following two groups: osmoprotectants and pharmacological chaperones. Osmoprotectants are generally considered to stabilize protein structure by altering solvent properties. The major osmoprotectants can be categorized in the following three chemical classes: polyols, such as glycerol and sucrose; free amino acid derivatives, such as taurine and Î²-alanine; and methyl-amines, such as DMSO and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cortez and Sim, 2014</xref>). Among these osmoprotectants, TMAO is the most efficient and has been the most studied over the past two decades. For example, TMAO has been shown to prevent the conversion of the normal cellular form of prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into its infectious form (PrP<sup>SC</sup>) in scrapies-infected mouse neuroblastoma ScN2a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tatzelt et al., 1996</xref>). However, osmoprotectants are effective at high concentrations which may lead to toxicity. Thus, despite the high efficiency of the anti-aggregation properties of osmoprotectants, very few osmoprotectants have been applied in clinical trials. Another class of chemical chaperones is pharmacological chaperones, which are able to bind to and stabilize unfolded or misfolded proteins. Structurally, IBT21 was not particularly similar to osmoprotectants, and IBT21 was observed to preferably bind to unfolded or misfolded proteins in combined analyses such as the ER stress-induced aggregated protein profile and the IBT21-targeted protein profile. Therefore, we considered that IBT21 acted as a pharmacological chaperone. In unfolded or misfolded proteins, the hydrophobic region tends to be exposed, and protein aggregation occurs when the exposed hydrophobic portions of a protein interact with the exposed hydrophobic segment of other unfolded proteins. Pharmacological chaperones may prohibit protein aggregation by binding and masking hydrophobic parts of unfolded or misfolded proteins. The IBT21 core possesses hydrophobicity comparable to that of 4PBA and TUDCA, which are known to be hydrophobic compounds. This similarity supports the hypothesis that the hydrophobic core of IBT21 may interact with the exposed hydrophobic segments of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Currently, 4PBA and TUDCA are the only two pharmacological chaperones for proteotoxins approved by the FDA for human use. Notably, IBT21 shows much higher chaperone-like activity than 4PBA. In future studies, we will further examine the therapeutic effects of IBTs in model mice with a disease involving ER stress.</p><p>In theory, pharmacological chaperones for proteotoxin have one of the following three mechanisms of action: preventing protein aggregation by masking the aggregation-prone region (group I), increasing the folding rate by stabilizing the folding transition state (group II) or decreasing the misfolding rate by stabilizing the native state (group III). We demonstrated that IBT21 directly prevents protein aggregation in an in vitro aggregation inhibition assay, but the second and third mechanisms remain elusive. A recent report suggests that the action of chemical chaperones is determined by the proteins to be folded and the folding environment, as a chemical chaperone that behaves as a group II chaperone for one protein might behave as a group III chaperone for another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dandage et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, heat shock response is not influenced by IBT21. It would be difficult to generalize the mechanism of action of pharmacological chaperones based on their effect in one test stress condition or on one test protein. Hence, further characterization of IBT21 appears to require testing on disease-related misfolding-prone proteins and on disease-related stress conditions.</p><p>The chemical properties of IBTs that enable them to preferably bind to unfolded or misfolded proteins might be useful for developing diagnostic tools for ER stress-related diseases. Several positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracers for imaging Î²-amyloid deposits in Alzheimerâs disease have been used clinically or in a clinical trial. Alagille et al. designed and synthesized a series of 2-aryl-imidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazoles by a combination of the benzothiazole motif and the 2-arylimidazo motif from two potent Î²-amyloid imaging agents, PIB and IMPY, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alagille et al., 2011</xref>).

Together with our results, these findings indicate that IBT21 could be effective for PET and SPECT imaging of ER stress-related diseases.</p><p>Targeting improper protein folding and aggregate accumulation, which are the most upstream events in ER stress-related diseases, is an obvious therapeutic strategy with chemical chaperones. It is generally accepted that neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâs disease, Huntington disease and prion disease are caused by the accumulation of neurotoxic protein aggregates, and chemical chaperones have the potential to separate these neurotoxic aggregates. In the case of prion disease, the osmoprotectant TMAO was first applied for preventing PrP<sup>SC</sup> formation in vitro as a chemical chaperone in the late 1990 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tatzelt et al., 1996</xref>). PrP<sup>SC</sup> toxicity was reported to cause ER stress by increasing the intracellular calcium released from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hetz et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, a reduction in the levels of the ER molecular chaperone BiP accelerates prion pathogenesis in vivo, indicating that the accumulation of the misfolded form of PrP in the ER is a key event in prion propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Prion replication has been shown to cause sustained UPR induction with persistent eIF2Î± phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moreno et al., 2012</xref>). Repression of protein synthesis diminished the load of unfolded proteins in the ER, but overactivation of eIF2Î± phosphorylation leads to synaptic failure, spongiosis and neuronal loss. Pharmacological inhibition of PERK by the compound GSK2606414 mitigated neurodegeneration and clinical prion disease in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that IBT21 presents the most effective treatment effect and that the best treatment regimen may involve a combination of compounds, some of which fine-tune protein synthesis, such as GSK2606414, and others that reduce protein aggregates, such as the chemical chaperone IBT21. More studies with these promising compounds need to be performed to design therapies to treat prion diseases and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases associated with ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical compounds</title><p>A total of 217,765 library compounds were provided by the Drug Discovery Initiative at the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan). 7-Methylsulphonyl-2-phenylimidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole (IBT21) was purchased from Butt Park (Devon, UK). 2-(4-Chlorophenyl)â7-methylsulphonylimidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole (IBT22) was purchased from Specs (Zoetermeer, Netherlands).

Your article has been reviewed by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Claudio Hetz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kitakaze et al., use cell-based high throughput screening to identify new compounds that can mitigate tunicamycin (Tm)-induced ER stress. Using this approach, they identify a series of compounds containing the IBT substructure. They go on to demonstrate that their compounds have improved potency compared to other UPR modulators/chemical chaperones and that administration of their compounds attenuates UPR signaling in response to Tm-induced ER stress. Furthermore, they demonstrate that administration of their compound IBT21 attenuates Tm-induced protein aggregation in cells and DTT induced protein aggregation in vitro. Similarly, IBT21 improved cellular stress-resistance to two different proteotoxic insults (Tm and prion protein aggregation). These results are consistent with IBTs acting as chemical chaperones. Lastly, they use an MS/photocrosslinking approach to discern potential targets of IBT21, identifying numerous aggregation-prone proteins. Together, these results suggest that IBT21 functions as a chemical chaperone to attenuate ER stress.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major issue with the authors' central conclusion is that IBT21 may influence many of the observed readouts by reducing transcription/translation, rather than by functioning as a chemical chaperone. The authors primarily use Tm to induce ER stress in this manuscript. Tm requires new protein synthesis to induce ER stress. Thus, if IBT21 (or other compounds) reduce transcription or translation the stress would also be mitigated. The authors must conclusively address this possibility before the conclusion that IBT21 functions as a chemical chaperone can be properly evaluated. Three key experiments that are required are: (1) to overexpress an active UPR transcription factor and show that the compound does not affect the ability to induce UPR target genes; (2) demonstrate that IBT21 does not influence translation during ER stress using [35S] metabolic labeling or the like; (3) show that IBT21 can also reduce ER stress caused by Tg or DTT, two compounds that do not require protein translation to induce ER protein misfolding/aggregation. It is possible that the chemical chaperoning mechanism is correct, but especially considering that these compounds have a planar conjugated ring system similar to many DNA intercalators, it is important to really demonstrate that the observed effects cannot be explained by a simpler mechanism.</p><p>2) Similarly, in the experiment evaluating levels of BiP in the aggregated fraction (Figure 5E), the authors must evaluate whether compound treatment decreases total BiP to rule out changes in expression or degradation of BiP leading to the change in the aggregated fraction.</p><p>3) Is IBT21 chemical chaperone activity restricted to ER proteins? It seems unlikely that it would be, if the chemical chaperoning mechanism is correct. The authors should assess IBT21 effects on protein misfolding induced by heat shock or other cytosolic stressors. Does IBT21 suppress induction of heat shock factor I target genes induced by heat or proteotoxic compounds?</p><p>4) The azoramide positive control is not working in Figure 4D. This experiment should be repeated using alternative compounds, such as those employed in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>5) Another major issue is that the described SAR trends are not well-supported by the data. A key and important example is the claim that a 'short substituent endowed the scaffold with the desired activity.' All compounds that contain an extended R2 substituent have an amide bond and it is unclear from SAR whether the amide bond is the issue or the long chain. To justify such a claim, a control with a methyl-substituted amide is needed or, alternatively, the authors could append longer chains onto a sulfonyl or ester. The authors should also moderate other SAR claims as needed based on the data.</p><p>6) From the ten inhibitor hits chosen, the authors mention they reduce it to four with a shared scaffold, but they never mention if the other six have higher or lower biological activities, nor do they disclose the structures in the manuscript. This information should be provided, along with further discussion regarding why they were discarded.</p><p>7) In the MS experiments conducted to identify all proteins in the aggregated fraction and those that are IBT21-sensitive (Figure 5G), reproducibility needs to be addressed in independent MS experiments and/or by immunoblotting of selected proteins. For the corresponding GO analysis, the authors need to show that the GO results are different for the entire 1200 proteins compared to just IBT-sensitive for the results to be meaningful.</p><p>8) In the MS experiment shown in Figure 6E that is measuring the ability of IBT22 to block labeling of proteins by the photocrosslinking probe, the data presentation makes it difficult to determine which targets are the most significantly blocked from labeling and by how many fold compared to DMSO. It would be helpful if the authors would adopt a more standard presentation of the data such as that shown in Lanning et al., 2014). The authors must clarify what threshold (fold-change) is being used to determine a protein is a bona fide target versus nonspecific target. Furthermore, how many total proteins from Figure 6E overlap with those in the IBT-sensitive fraction from Figure 5G?</p><p>9) Finally, the authors must assess whether the IBT compound series functions similarly to ameliorate ER stress in other cell lines â preferably primary cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cell-based HTS Identifies a chemical chaperone for preventing ER protein aggregation and proteotoxicity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) New experiments are only included as supplementary figures.

The authors primarily use Tm to induce ER stress in this manuscript. Tm requires new protein synthesis to induce ER stress. Thus, if IBT21 (or other compounds) reduce transcription or translation the stress would also be mitigated. The authors must conclusively address this possibility before the conclusion that IBT21 functions as a chemical chaperone can be properly evaluated. Three key experiments that are required are: (1) to overexpress an active UPR transcription factor and show that the compound does not affect the ability to induce UPR target genes; (2) demonstrate that IBT21 does not influence translation during ER stress using [35S] metabolic labeling or the like; (3) show that IBT21 can also reduce ER stress caused by Tg or DTT, two compounds that do not require protein translation to induce ER protein misfolding/aggregation. It is possible that the chemical chaperoning mechanism is correct, but especially considering that these compounds have a planar conjugated ring system similar to many DNA intercalators, it is important to really demonstrate that the observed effects cannot be explained by a simpler mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further experimental evidence is needed to rule out the possibility that IBT21 mitigates ER stress by reducing transcription or translation in order to provide a more compelling conclusion. We thank the reviewers for suggesting these three important experiments and now show data to support the chemical chaperone function of IBT21 as follows:</p><p>1-(1) We demonstrated that IBT21 does not reduce transcriptional UPR induction. Namely, IBT21 did not change the expression of CHOP and 4E-BP1, downstream targets of ATF4, in ATF4-overexpressing cells. Additionally, IBT21 did not change the expression of BiP in cells overexpressing an active form of ATF6. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âInhibitory effects of IBT21 on activation of the three UPR branches under ER stress conditionsâ, and in Figure 4âfigure supplement2.</p><p>1-(2) We noted that IBT21 does not affect protein translation using puromycin-labelled proteins. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âInhibitory effects of IBT21 on activation of the three UPR branches under ER stress conditionsâ, and in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3.</p><p>1-(3) We showed that IBT21 reduced DTT-induced ER stress by monitoring the activation of EUA-EGFP reporter cells. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âInhibitory effects of IBT21 on activation of the three UPR branches under ER stress conditionsâ, and in Figure 4âfigure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, in the experiment evaluating levels of BiP in the aggregated fraction (Figure 5E), the authors must evaluate whether compound treatment decreases total BiP to rule out changes in expression or degradation of BiP leading to the change in the aggregated fraction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the levels of BiP in the INPUT fraction (Figure 5E-F).To rule out the IBT21 effect on reduced expression or enhanced degradation of BiP, we have added data showing that IBT21 did not change BiP induction in the cells overexpressing an active form of ATF6. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âIn vivoeffects of IBT21 on protein aggregation during ER stressâ, and in Figure 5E-F and Figure 4âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is IBT21 chemical chaperone activity restricted to ER proteins? It seems unlikely that it would be, if the chemical chaperoning mechanism is correct. The authors should assess IBT21 effects on protein misfolding induced by heat shock or other cytosolic stressors. Does IBT21 suppress induction of heat shock factor I target genes induced by heat or proteotoxic compounds?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point; we too had initially assumed that IBT21 suppresses protein misfolding under heat shock conditions as a chemical chaperone. Unfortunately, IBT21 could not suppress the induction of the heat shock response by heat shock in our hands. One might expect that IBT21 preferably prevents protein aggregation in the ER rather than in the cytosol. However, these experiments are challenging because the results could be varied depending upon the stress conditions. This would be a significant undertaking and is out of scope for this initial study. The results of this experiment are shown on subsection âInhibitory effects of IBT21 on activation of the three UPR branches under ER stress conditionsâ, and in Figure 4âfigure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The azoramide positive control is not working in Figure 4D. This experiment should be repeated using alternative compounds, such as those employed in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the experiment with a PERK inhibitor, an S1P inhibitor and an IRE1 inhibitor as positive controls. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another major issue is that the described SAR trends are not well-supported by the data. A key and important example is the claim that a 'short substituent endowed the scaffold with the desired activity.' All compounds that contain an extended R2 substituent have an amide bond and it is unclear from SAR whether the amide bond is the issue or the long chain. To justify such a claim, a control with a methyl-substituted amide is needed or, alternatively, the authors could append longer chains onto a sulfonyl or ester. The authors should also moderate other SAR claims as needed based on the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We newly synthesized IBT29 with a methyl-substituted amide at R2. The stronger activity of IBT29 than IBT21 justifies our claim. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âStructure-activity relationship study of imidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole derivatives (IBTs)â, and in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2. The chemical structure required for the activity has been incorporated into the Discussion section, and the method for IBT29 synthesis is described in the subsection âChemical compoundsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) From the ten inhibitor hits chosen, the authors mention they reduce it to four with a shared scaffold, but they never mention if the other six have higher or lower biological activities, nor do they disclose the structures in the manuscript. This information should be provided, along with further discussion regarding why they were discarded.</p></disp-quote><p>The remaining six compounds were all singletons with no common chemical structure. Therefore, the analyses of the six compounds were prioritized lower, and further investigation is needed for publication. We would like to address the results in a future study. We have incorporated this explanation into the Results section subsection âCell-based high-throughput screen for chemical chaperonesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the MS experiments conducted to identify all proteins in the aggregated fraction and those that are IBT21-sensitive (Figure 5G), reproducibility needs to be addressed in independent MS experiments and/or by immunoblotting of selected proteins. For the corresponding GO analysis, the authors need to show that the GO results are different for the entire 1200 proteins compared to just IBT-sensitive for the results to be meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we repeated the MS experiment in triplicate for each treatment to address the reproducible proteins that are IBT21-rescued aggregation-prone proteins (IBT-SENSITIVE proteins). The highly reproducible IBT-SENSITIVE proteins are shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. As expected, the molecular chaperone HSPA5 and the ER folding enzyme PDIA4 were observed in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A. In the case of the representative ER client proteins, we present transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) as a secreted protein and annexin A1 (ANXA1) as a membrane protein instead of cathepsin D (CTSD) and neutral Î±-glucosidase AB (GANAB) because CTSD and GANAB are synthesized at the ER but located in the lysosome. TAGLN2 and ANXA1 were also observed in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B. The reproducibility of the IBT-SENSITIVE proteins was supported by the GO enrichment analysis shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. The results of these experiments are shown in subsection âIn vivo effects of IBT21 on protein aggregation during ER stressâ, and in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B.</p><p>Regarding the GO-based comparison, GO enrichment results for the IBT-SENSITIVE proteins shown in Figure 5H-I and 5âfigure supplement 1B-C were different from that of the IBT-bonded Competed and Selective proteins shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B-C. Nevertheless, the Competed and Selective proteins contained approximately 60% of the IBT-SENSITIVE proteins in each enriched GO group shown in Figure 6H, indicating that the Competed and Selective proteins largely cover the IBT21-targeted proteins corresponding to the chemical chaperone activity. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âIn vivoeffects of IBT21 on protein aggregation during ER stressâ, and in Figure 5, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the MS experiment shown in Figure 6E that is measuring the ability of IBT22 to block labeling of proteins by the photocrosslinking probe, the data presentation makes it difficult to determine which targets are the most significantly blocked from labeling and by how many fold compared to DMSO. It would be helpful if the authors would adopt a more standard presentation of the data such as that shown in Lanning et al., 2014). The authors must clarify what threshold (fold-change) is being used to determine a protein is a bona fide target versus nonspecific target. Furthermore, how many total proteins from Figure 6E overlap with those in the IBT-sensitive fraction from Figure 5G?</p></disp-quote><p>We re-examined the IBT-BOUNDED proteins in a pie chart in the same style as reported in Lanning et al., (2014) (Figure 6E). The threshold (fold-change) is added to the text in subsection âIn vivoeffects of IBT21 on protein aggregation during ER stressâ, and is also shown in Figure 6D. The number of overlapped proteins with those in the IBT-SENSITIVE fraction from Figure 5G is shown in Figure 6F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Finally, the authors must assess whether the IBT compound series functions similarly to ameliorate ER stress in other cell lines â preferably primary cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We successfully presented the same effects of IBT21 on another cell line, Hap1 cells. The results of this experiment are shown in subsection âStructure-activity relationship study of imidazo[2,1-<italic>b</italic>]benzothiazole derivatives (IBTs)â, and in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) New experiments are only included as supplementary figures.
