genomic translocations. This is supported by correlations between the frequency of inter-chromosomal contacts and translocation events in myriad systems. However, it remains unclear if CT formation itself influences the translocation potential of cells. We address this question in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells by modulating the level of Condensin II, which regulates CT organization. Using whole-chromosome Oligopaints to identify genomic rearrangements, we find that increased contact frequencies between chromosomes due to Condensin II knockdown leads to an increased propensity to form translocations following DNA damage. Moreover, Condensin II over-expression is sufficient to drive spatial separation of CTs and attenuate the translocation potential of cells. Together, these results provide the first causal evidence that proper CT formation can protect the genome from potentially deleterious translocations in the presence of DNA damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome territory</kwd><kwd>Condensin II</kwd><kwd>oligopaints</kwd><kwd>FISH</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd><kwd>genome integrity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000945</institution-id><institution>Pittsburgh Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KA2017-91787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyce</surname><given-names>Eric F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyce</surname><given-names>Eric F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The translocation potential of cells can be modulated by Condensin II activity during interphase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomes undergo an elaborate folding pattern in the interphase nucleus, ultimately occupying distinct domains known as chromosome territories (CTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bickmore and van Steensel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciabrelli and Cavalli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sexton and Cavalli, 2015</xref>). The partitioning of chromosomes into CTs limits inter-chromosomal interactions in the nucleus. CT formation has been observed across a wide range of species and cell types by both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromatin conformation capture-based techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Pombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cremer and Cremer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pecinka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smeets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanabe et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite the widespread prevalence and conservation of CTs, the molecular determinants and function of this level of organization has remained elusive.</p><p>Notably, levels of inter-chromosomal contact between different chromosome pairs have been correlated with increased translocation frequencies – both those occurring naturally in the human population and those induced experimentally in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arsuaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickmore and Teague, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Pombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engreitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hlatky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roukos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

However, while these correlative data support a role for inter-chromosomal contacts in directing the location of translocations, it remains unclear if translocations are attenuated by CT formation itself.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> cells provide a unique opportunity to directly test the role of CT partitioning in translocation genesis. Similar to human chromosomes, the three major <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes form robust CTs throughout interphase that can be labeled simultaneously with Oligopaint-based chromosome paints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen and Joyce, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, genome-wide chromosome paints provides a robust system to perform karyotype analysis in parallel and quantify the absolute frequency of translocation events in a cell population. Finally and most importantly, the extent to which chromosomes are packaged into CTs can be modulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells by altering the activity of Condensin II, a highly conserved SMC protein complex that is essential for large-scale chromosome folding and proper CT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>).

To create DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and induce translocations, we subjected BG3 cells to either a low dose (5 Gy) or high dose (20 Gy) of ionizing irradiation (IR). We found that most cells recovered by 48 hr after IR in both conditions based on a reduction in γ-H2Av staining, which marks sites of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>).

This strategy allowed us to quantify the color junctions that form as the result of translocation events and measure their frequency between each chromosome pair. Because this analysis is performed on a single-cell basis, these translocation junctions can be easily identified regardless of whether recurrent or variable breakpoints occur throughout the cell population. A total of 1402 metaphase spreads were scored for translocations across 3–5 biological replicates. In each replicate, we found that translocations were efficiently produced and detected following exposure to both 5 Gy and 20 Gy IR, with 3% and 14.8% of total cells harboring a translocation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found a few cases of spontaneous translocations in untreated cells (1.7%). Translocations between all chromosome pairs were recovered after 20 Gy IR, which we sub-classified as discrete translocations (mid-arm translocations where only two chromosomes were involved; 60.2%), compound chromosomes (fusions of seemingly whole chromosome arms from two different chromosomes; 32%), and complex rearrangements (resulting from multiple translocation events; 7.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Approximately 33% of translocations were reciprocal with a seemingly equal exchange of genetic material between the two chromosomes involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49553.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-chromosome Oligopaints can efficiently detect IR-induced translocations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: representative metaphase spread with chromosome paints in control BG3 cells.

As expected, the different frequencies of translocations between chromosomes can largely be explained by the total genomic length of the chromosomes involved (p=0.0005, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, there were variations in translocation frequency across the biological replicates for each chromosome pair. In particular, translocations between chromosomes 2 and 3 varied in frequency from 7% to 14% of the cell population depending on the replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).

We created an experimental scheme in which a single population of cells was divided into three groups. One group was immediately fixed and subjected to interphase FISH to analyze CT positioning prior to IR treatment. The other groups were either subjected to IR or left untreated as a no IR control and subsequently karyotyped by whole-chromosome painting to quantify translocations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We observed similar average volumes for all chromosomes, with chromosome X being slightly smaller than chromosomes 2 and 3 (18.9–20.4 µm<sup>3</sup> for chromosome X, 22.8–23.1 µm<sup>3</sup> for chromosome 2, and 24.1–25.9 µm<sup>3</sup> for chromosome 3), and minimal variability in the range of CT volumes between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, we did not find any cells where a single chromosome occupied more than 28% of the nucleus, indicating that CTs are stably compacted in BG3 cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We next measured the extent of CT intermixing and inter-CT contact frequencies for all chromosome pairs. CT intermixing was defined as the volume of voxel colocalization between two neighboring chromosomes and is measured on a cell-by-cell basis. Inter-CT contact frequency is the percentage of cells in which the chromosome pair exhibited at least a single voxel of colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The median intermixing volume between all chromosome pairs was minimal, ranging from 4 to 8 um<sup>3</sup>, which represents ~5% of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is consistent with previous Hi-C studies of CTs showing that <italic>trans</italic> interactions make up only ~7% of total chromosome contacts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite minimal CT intermixing volumes, our data show that CTs are in close proximity and contact each other in 93–99% of BG3 cells, depending on the chromosome pair and replicate line being examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This is consistent with our data from tetraploid Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>), showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes exhibit high levels of CT contact independent of their ploidy and karyotype. Following exposure to 5 Gy or 20 Gy IR, there were no significant changes in nuclear volume, CT volume, or inter-CT contact frequencies in BG3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the extent of intermixing between different CTs influences translocation potential, the median CT intermixing volume between chromosome pairs prior to IR in each replicate line was then plotted against the frequency of their translocations measured after exposure to 20 Gy. Surprisingly, we found only a weak correlation between intermixing volume and translocation frequency for each chromosome pair and replicate population (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, p=0.21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Instead, we found a significant positive correlation between the frequency of inter-CT contacts and translocation frequency (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, p=0.02), such that higher frequencies of inter-CT contact increase the chances of translocation events occurring between those two chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For example, the chromosome pair and population with the lowest contact frequency overall (X-2, 92.5% contact) had the lowest number of translocations after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, purple arrow), whereas the chromosome pair and population with the highest CT contact frequency overall (2–3, 99% contact) harbored a translocation in nearly 14% of cells after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, orange arrow). Indeed, a linear regression analysis of the data predicts a 1% increase in translocation frequency for every 1% increase in contact frequency. This indicates that efficient translocation formation requires a high frequency of CT contact and yet is extremely sensitive to subtle differences in inter-CT contact frequencies across cell populations. Considering that increased intermixing between two chromosomes does not predict an increase in translocation frequency, additional points of contact between chromosomes do not necessarily increase the likelihood of translocation formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CT disruption following knockdown of Cap-H2 increases the translocation potential of long chromosomes</title><p>Our findings in BG3 cells suggest that higher contact frequencies between two chromosomes in the nucleus increase translocation potential.

This suggests that DSB repair between homologous, versus heterologous, chromosomes is not increased following Cap-H2 depletion.

Also, no defects in DNA repair kinetics or viability were observed in Cap-H2 OX cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–K</xref>), indicating that Cap-H2 OX does not acutely impact DNA repair or cell survival within these time-points.

In contrast to population-based methods that can measure relative translocation breakpoint usage, chromosome painting offers absolute translocation frequency in the cell population. We find that translocation frequencies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells strongly correlate with chromosome size, and variations in translocation frequencies between cell populations can be explained by changes in inter-CT contact frequency. Indeed, in the presence of DNA damage, a 1% increase in inter-CT contact in a cell population yields a 1% increase in translocation frequency. Surprisingly, the extent of intermixing between chromosomes does not correlate with translocation potential, in contrast to what has been observed in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Pombo, 2006</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained by the relatively larger number of chromosomes in human cells, which would limit the probability of contact between any two chromosomes in the nucleus. In this context, the median intermixing volume measured between each chromosome pair may be completely dependent on the frequency of their contact in the cell population, with an increased number of cells in contact yielding a higher median intermixing volume. This would support a model in which inter-CT contact frequencies in the cell population are the predominant spatial risk factor for translocation genesis, consistent with previously observed correlations between preferential CT neighbors and translocation frequency in a number of systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arsuaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Pombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engreitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hlatky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>What has remained unclear is whether a loss of CT integrity would lead to increased translocation potential. Using Condensin II depletion as a genetic tool to disrupt CT partitioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we establish that increasing inter-chromosomal interactions does indeed predispose large chromosomes to increased translocations in the presence of DNA damage. Moreover, by overexpressing Condensin II directly or by removing its negative regulator SLMB, we are able to enhance the spatial separation of CTs prior to IR and demonstrate that this is sufficient to reduce the translocation potential of chromosome pairs by up to 50%. Importantly, we cannot rule out the possibility that Condensin II impacts translocation frequency independent from its role in CT formation. For example, genome instability due to altered chromatin structure or chromosome segregation defects could contribute to translocation genesis. However, we do not observe any increased DNA damage or chromosome segregation defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> BG3 cells following either Condensin II depletion or overexpression. Moreover, we observed a 1:1 decrease in inter-CT contact and translocation frequency between specific chromosome pairs following Cap-H2 overexpression. Therefore, these data are more consistent with a causal role of CT organization in maintaining genome integrity. Considering the only method currently available to modulate CT organization is through altering Condensin II activity, further testing of this model awaits the identification of additional factors.</p><p>Although Condensin II is essential for proper CT compaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>), it remains unclear if this function is conserved in mammals due to the essential role of this complex in chromosome segregation. Intriguingly, however, loss of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex component ARID1A in human cells has recently been shown to disrupt NCAPH2 localization during interphase and lead to increased chromosome volumes and inter-CT interactions by both Hi-C and FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, NCAPH2 loss significantly negatively correlated with increased inter-chromosomal interactions observed in the Hi-C analysis, suggesting Condensin II’s role in CT partitioning during interphase may be conserved in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is also worth noting that Condensin II has been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leiserson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, both loss of Condensin II subunits and disruption of their loading onto chromatin in mice has been reported to drive lymphomagenesis with highly rearranged chromosomes in the transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atchison, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Giovanni Bosco (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers were fairly divided in their assessment of this work. Two referees were very positive about the findings, and offered only minor suggestions to improve the presentation, while a dissenting opinion questioned the novelty of the work as well as some important aspects of the presentation. I have found it difficult to reconcile these disparate views, and have dithered in coming to a decision, for which I apologize. Ultimately, I feel that the story is quite interesting and establishes an important test of the significance of chromosome territories, but the work should be presented in a way that addresses the key caveats raised by reviewers. One key concern is that the only method currently available to modulate chromosome territories is to manipulate the levels of Condensin II; thus, it is not currently possible to demonstrate that the effects observed on translocation frequencies are directly due to altered CTs rather than other effects of condensin overexpression or depletion. I think this should be addressed more directly in the Discussion.</p><p>One reviewer also felt that the cytological measures of inter-CT contacts should be further supported by Hi-C analysis. However, this would require extensive additional work, and I think it would not markedly change the key conclusions. Moreover, the effects of modulating Condensin have previously been analyzed by Hi-C (albeit in different cells) in the cited work from the Corces lab (Li et al., 2015). I would thus encourage you to integrate their findings more directly into your presentation, perhaps by re-analyzing their data, and at the least by summarizing their findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As requested by reviewer #2, I think it is essential to avoid implying that depleting Condensin II levels leads to &quot;loss&quot; of territories, and to be more precise and quantitative in describing these effects throughout the manuscript. In addition, I ask that you address the criticisms raised in a response letter and in a revised manuscript to the extent that you are able.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study by Rosin and colleagues seeks to understand whether the 3D organization of chromosomes into spatially separated territories have any consequences on how broken chromosomes are repaired. Specifically, whether inter-chromosomal translocations are prevented by robust chromosome separation. This is an inherently interesting question, while it is also relevant to understanding mechanisms that give rise to genome instability and chromosomal rearrangements. Although previous studies have sought to show that physical proximity of specific genomic loci are prone to participate in recombination events leading to translocations, until now there has not been a way to modulate chromosome territories in living cells so as to ask directly how or if changes in chromosome spatial organization affects the occurrence of translocations. This study adds two innovative approaches that allow the authors to query unbiased whole genome recombination events with single cell resolution while also genetically manipulating chromosome territory formation/maintenance. First, they use Oligopaints to detect each of the major <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes, and this allows them to detect simple and complex inter-chromosomal translocations on metaphase arrested cells. Second, by changing the levels of a key condensin II complex subunit, Cap-H2, the authors are able to modulate the degree to which cultures <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells form and maintain chromosome territories. Because Oligopaint probes allow single cell resolution and is amenable to quantitative analysis of 3D spatial separation, the authors determined how changes in spatial organization cause chromosomal rearrangements.</p><p>As expected, chromosomes with the largest amount of DNA suffered the most number of rearrangements. However, the authors also nicely demonstrate that the higher the level of chromosome territory contact between two different chromosomes the higher the likelihood that those two chromosomes participated in translocation events. Conversely, the chromosome pairs with the lowest territory interface contacts had the fewest translocation events. Interestingly, they report a linear relationship between frequency of chromosome territory contacts with incidence of translocations. This relationship was not true for chromosome territory volume overlap, suggesting that inter-chromosomal contacts at the periphery of territories are somehow more prone to damage and/or recombination. RNAi depletion of Cap-H2 resulted in more territory contacts and moderately more translocations, while increasing Cap-H2 levels led to highly separated chromosomes and a 35% decrease in the overall level of translocations. When specific chromosome pairs were analyzed separately, frequencies of translocations were decreased even further.</p><p>This is a very convincing, first of its kind study that demonstrates spatial separation of chromosomes indeed is biologically relevant and attenuates translocations after chromosome breakage. This study further implicates the condensin II complex and its interphase compaction activities as important factors that decrease the frequency of translocations by virtue of maintaining robust separation of chromosome territories. Given that condensins are conserved and essential in all species, this new insight into the interphase activities of condensin II and how they serve to protect the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome from potentially deleterious chromosomal rearrangements should be of wide interest to many <italic>eLife</italic> readers. This reviewer is very enthusiastic about this study as it represents a highly significant advance in our mechanistic understanding of how 3D spatial organization of chromosomes directly impacts processes such as repair of broken chromosome and the origins of translocations. I found the manuscript to be concise, clearly written and without jargon. It was a pleasure to read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Rosin and colleagues extend their work published in PLoS Genetics last year in which they show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> loss of a condensin II component (CAPH2) alters the structure of chromosome territories in interphase cells.</p><p>They now go on to show in cell lines that this has some (modest) impact on the frequency at which chromosomal translocations are formed after irradiation. In its current form, I think that this manuscript submission is too preliminary and, as detailed below, the conclusions are over-stated.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript the authors describe their condensin knockdown phenotype as &quot;loss of chromosome territories&quot;. This is not correct – the CTs are not &quot;lost&quot;. If the CTs were completely 'lost' the FISH hybridization signals would encompass the entire nucleus and there would be complete overlap between the three colors in Figure 3A. The authors should refer to their knockdown cells as having an &quot;altered&quot; CT conformation.</p><p>2) The authors interpret their data as evidence that it is the loss of CTs and the increased spatial overall between chromosomes in the condensin knockdown cells that is directly responsible for an elevated frequent of translocations. However, it is well known that chromatin structure at multiple levels affects the susceptibility to DNA damage and so it could also be that the altered chromatin structure in condensin knockdown cells makes the chromosomes more susceptibility to DNA damage, and that it is this that affects translocation frequency. The authors need to assess the level of endogenous DNA damage (γ-H2A.X staining) in control vs condensin knockdown cells.</p><p>3) The authors conclusion that there are increased interactions between chromosomes in condensin knockdown cells is based entirely on the interpretation of imaging data. The authors need to perform Hi-C on their control and condensin knockdown cells and to then quantify the increase in inter- vs intra-chromosomal contacts.</p><p>4) The authors need to be clearer about the limited spatial resolution of their imaging. Using wide-field epifluorescence the spatial resolution limit is going to be 200nm in x and y and 500nm in z. Therefore, any overlap between the hybridization signals has to be &gt; than this before any claim can be made about overlaps between chromosome territories. For instance, I do not think that the data in Figure 2 can be used to conclude that (subsection “Inter-CT contacts correlate with translocation frequency in <italic>Drosophila”</italic>) 'CTs exhibit contact with each other in 93-99% of cells' and that a linear regression model for translocation frequency vs% CT contact can be reliably established with such low resolution imaging data. Quantitative CT contact data would come from Hi-C data (see point above).</p><p>5) Subsection “CT loss following knockdown of Cap-H2 leads to a moderate increase in translocation frequency”. It is overstating the data in Figure 3 to claim that knockdown of CapH2 leads to a 'moderate' increase in translocation frequency. For the most part (Figure 3F) there is no significant increase in translocation frequency scored between control and CAPH knockdown cells – it is only by adding all of the data together (no IR, 5 Gy and 20 Gy) that they can just squeak over the p&lt;0.05 threshold for significance.</p><p>6) The authors need to do a better job of discussing the implications of their work to other systems. In the mouse a hypomorph of condensin II has been shown to have no effect on chromosome territories and chromatin compaction in the interphase nucleus. The genome instability in the mutant mice is shown to result from mitotic defects (Woodward et al., 2016). The same is true in humans (Martin et al., 2016).</p><p>7) Introduction. The authors refer to translocations that occur &quot;naturally in the human population&quot;. However, the references cited – Arsuga et al., 2004; Holley et al., 2002 and Hlatky et al., 2002 – all refer to translocations induced by cell irradiation, i.e. they are not &quot;naturally occurring&quot;. The correct citation for natural translocation frequencies in the human populations, and the relationship to chromosome organization is Bickmore and Teague, 2002.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Chromosome territory formation attenuates the translocation potential of cells&quot; by Rosin et al., examines the relationship between chromosome territory contacts and chromosomal translocations and addresses the question of whether the formation and maintenance of chromosome territories (CTs) is necessary to prevent chromosome translocations in cultured <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells. The authors induce chromosomal translocations by irradiating diploid BG3 cells and then use Oligopaints to elegantly label the translocations. The authors present data showing that knockdown of the Condensin II subunit, Cap-H2, which had been previously shown to cause loss of CTs, results in small increases in translocation frequency for specific chromosome pairs. They also show that overexpression of Cap-H2 in these cells has the opposite effect and significantly inhibits translocations, even prior to irradiation. Combined, the data is convincing, thorough, and well-controlled, and they represent a significant advance in our understanding of the role that interphase chromosome territories play in the maintenance of genome stability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49553.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study by Rosin and colleagues seeks to understand whether the 3D organization of chromosomes into spatially separated territories have any consequences on how broken chromosomes are repaired.

We do note however that, as shown in Figure 3C, the Oligopainted chromosomes do in fact decondense so severely as to essentially fill the entire euchromatic portion of the nucleus following Condensin II loss (the regions that remain unpainted are only the heterochromatin compartment and nucleolus, which the paints do not label; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49553-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors interpret their data as evidence that it is the loss of CTs and the increased spatial overall between chromosomes in the condensin knockdown cells that is directly responsible for an elevated frequent of translocations. However, it is well known that chromatin structure at multiple levels affects the susceptibility to DNA damage and so it could also be that the altered chromatin structure in condensin knockdown cells makes the chromosomes more susceptibility to DNA damage, and that it is this that affects translocation frequency. The authors need to assess the level of endogenous DNA damage (γ-H2A.X staining) in control vs condensin knockdown cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this accidental omission to our attention. We have now included the endogenous levels of DNA damage before IR in both control and Cap-H2 knockdown cells (added to Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). We do not see increased DNA damage after Cap-H2 RNAi alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclusion that there are increased interactions between chromosomes in condensin knockdown cells is based entirely on the interpretation of imaging data. The authors need to perform Hi-C on their control and condensin knockdown cells and to then quantify the increase in inter- vs intra-chromosomal contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As the editor as pointed out, this Hi-C data already exists for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells published by Li et al., 2015. Although the authors noted increased trans interactions, the quantification was not included in their manuscript. Therefore, we have now reanalyzed their Hi-C data for control and Cap-H2 KD cells, which shows a 7-17% increase in trans interactions between different chromosome arms (CTs). While it is difficult to make direct comparisons between population-averaged sequencing data and single-cell imaging data, we believe this fully supports our observation that inter-CT contacts are increased in the absence of Cap-H2. An accompanying graph along with the Hi-C subtraction map has now been included in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors need to be clearer about the limited spatial resolution of their imaging. Using wide-field epifluorescence the spatial resolution limit is going to be 200nm in x and y and 500nm in z. Therefore, any overlap between the hybridization signals has to be &gt; than this before any claim can be made about overlaps between chromosome territories. For instance, I do not think that the data in Figure 2 can be used to conclude that (subsection “Inter-CT contacts correlate with translocation frequency in Drosophila”) 'CTs exhibit contact with each other in 93-99% of cells' and that a linear regression model for translocation frequency vs% CT contact can be reliably established with such low- resolution imaging data. Quantitative CT contact data would come from Hi-C data (see point above).</p></disp-quote><p>To address the spatial limit of resolution with deconvolved wide-field microscopy images, we used a threshold of signal colocalization greater than 500 nm<sup>3</sup> (our 3D voxel volume) to define inter-CT contact. This threshold is described in the methods section, and we now have more specifically described how CT intermixing and inter-CT contact frequencies are calculated in the main text (subsection “Inter-CT contact frequency correlate with translocation frequency in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”).</p><p>Regarding Hi-C, there are numerous reports showing beautiful population-based correlations between relative translocation breakpoint usage and relative chromosome contact frequencies by Hi-C. Here, our main goal was to determine if absolute translocation frequencies are related to absolute frequencies of chromosome contacts and thus required single-cell information to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “CT loss following knockdown of Cap-H2 leads to a moderate increase in translocation frequency”. It is overstating the data in Figure 3 to claim that knockdown of CapH2 leads to a 'moderate' increase in translocation frequency. For the most part (Figure 3F) there is no significant increase in translocation frequency scored between control and CAPH knockdown cells – it is only by adding all of the data together (no IR, 5 Gy and 20 Gy) that they can just squeak over the p&lt;0.05 threshold for significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We were initially struck by the reproducible increase in translocation frequency, albeit small, for each condition and replicate following Cap-H2 KD. However, we do note that none of these increases were significant on their own and, for clarity, we have removed the combined data from Figure 3. Instead, we highlight in Figure 3H that chromosome pairs 2 and 3 specifically do show a significant increase across all three replicates. Different sensitivities across different chromosome pairs was something we observed through this entire study, including for Cap-H2 overexpression, and most likely reflects the increased genomic length of the two chromosomes involved. Overall, the relative small increase in translocation frequency further supports our model that it is influenced more by inter-CT contact frequency, which is moderately changed, rather than the total extent of intermixing, which is dramatically increased following Cap-H2 KD. This idea and relationship to observations made in mammalian systems is discussed further in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors need to do a better job of discussing the implications of their work to other systems. In the mouse a hypomorph of condensin II has been shown to have no effect on chromosome territories and chromatin compaction in the interphase nucleus. The genome instability in the mutant mice is shown to result from mitotic defects (Woodward et al., 2016). The same is true in humans (Martin et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing this out and agree that these mammalian phenotypes in NCAPH2 hypomorphs need to have been better discussed. We have included these references and summarized results in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Introduction. The authors refer to translocations that occur &quot;naturally in the human population&quot;. However, the references cited – Arsuga et al., 2004; Holley et al., 2002 and Hlatky et al., 2002 – all refer to translocations induced by cell irradiation, i.e. they are not &quot;naturally occurring&quot;. The correct citation for natural translocation frequencies in the human populations, and the relationship to chromosome organization is Bickmore and Teague, 2002.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for bringing this to our attention and have now corrected the citation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
