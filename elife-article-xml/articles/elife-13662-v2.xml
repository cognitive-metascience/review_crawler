the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilize the active state, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13662.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13662.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13662.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Calcium ions regulate many processes in the human body. The calcium-sensing receptor, called CaSR, is responsible for maintaining a stable level of calcium ions in the blood. This receptor can detect small changes in the concentration of calcium ions, and activates signalling events within the cell to restore the level of calcium ions back to normal. Abnormal activity of this receptor is associated with severe diseases in humans</p><p>CaSR is found in the surface membrane of cells and belongs to a family of proteins called G-protein coupled receptors. Much of the protein extends out of the cell and interacts with calcium ions, phosphate ions and certain other molecules such as amino acids. However, it was not well understood how these small molecules bind to CaSR and how this activates the receptor.</p><p>Geng et al. have now used a technique called X-ray crystallography to view the three-dimensional structure of the exterior domain of CaSR in its resting state and active state. These structures revealed that, contrary to expectations, calcium ions are not the main activator of the receptor. Instead, Geng et al. found that CaSR adopts an inactive state in the absence or presence of calcium ions, while the active state only forms when an amino acid is bound.</p><p>Furthermore investigation showed that calcium ions are needed to stabilise the active form, while phosphate ions keep the inactive form stable. Geng et al. also identified the shape changes that must occur as CaSR transitions from its inactive to its active state. In particular, an amino acid binding to the exterior domain causes it to close like a venus flytrap, which is a crucial step in activating the receptor.</p><p>Taken together, the findings show that the amino acids and calcium ions act jointly to fully activate CaSR. The next steps are to determine the structure of the entire receptor with and without its small molecule partners and to use these structures to design drugs that can alter CaSR’s activity in order to treat human diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13662.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13662.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>calcium-sensing receptor</kwd><kwd>extracellular calcium homeostasis</kwd><kwd>principal agonist</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>extracellular domain structure</kwd><kwd>receptor activation mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM112973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Qing R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15GRNT25420002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Qing R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>L-amino acids are agonists of calcium-sensing receptor, and act jointly with calcium and phosphate ions to control receptor function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is responsible for the maintenance of a stable blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofer and Brown, 2003</xref>). It senses fluctuations in the circulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by (1) modulating the production of parathyroid hormone in parathyroid glands, and (2) regulating the reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in kidney and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 2013</xref>). Abnormal function of CaSR is associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostatic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ward et al., 2012</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in CaSR lead to potentially fatal neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, while gain-of-function mutations cause autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ward et al., 2012</xref>). CaSR also plays important roles in biological processes unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance, including fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Riccardi et al., 2013</xref>), nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conigrave and Hampson, 2006</xref>), and regulation of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruat and Traiffort, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The functional diversity of CaSR results from its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways through G<sub>q/11</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>12/13</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conigrave and Ward, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofer and Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magno et al., 2011</xref>), and to respond to a variety of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>). The general consensus is that the principal agonist of CaSR is extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofer and Brown, 2003</xref>). Other orthosteric agonists include various divalent and trivalent cations, polyamines and cationic polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>CaSR function can be regulated by endogenous and synthetic allosteric modulators, extracellular pH and ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen and Brauner-Osborne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinn et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>). Aromatic and aliphatic L-amino acids such as L-Phe and L-Trp increase the sensitivity of CaSR toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>) and are considered as positive allosteric modulators of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have also demonstrated that L-amino acids can activate the receptor provided that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is above a threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conigrave et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young and Rozengurt, 2002</xref>). For this reason, L-amino acids have been called allosteric activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conigrave et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, it has been proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and amino acids may act as co-agonists of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young and Rozengurt, 2002</xref>). However, this view has not been widely accepted.</p><p>CaSR is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Within this family, CaSR and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) function as disulfide-linked homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pidasheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Romano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ward et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), while GABA<sub>B</sub> and taste receptors are obligatory heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaupmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1998</xref>). Ligand binding to CaSR takes place within a large extracellular Venus Flytrap (VFT) module that consists of two domains (LB1 and LB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauner-Osborne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mun et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, CaSR contains a cysteine-rich (CR) domain that connects the VFT module to the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendy et al., 2013</xref>). This CR region is present in all class C GPCRs except GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and is required for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauache et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). However, the activation mechanism of CaSR remains unknown.</p><p>Structural information for class C GPCRs is available for the extracellular domains (ECD) of mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>), as well as the transmembrane domains of mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we present the first crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of human CaSR in two different functional states. These structures reveal novel binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and L-Trp, identify L-Trp as an agonist of the receptor, and demonstrate that these ions and amino acids collectively control the function of CaSR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of CaSR ECD homodimer</title><p>The ECD of human CaSR was secreted from baculovirus-infected insect cells as a disulfide-tethered homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

CaSR ECD exhibited binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Isotope dilution of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp with nonradioactive L-Trp led to a displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp in a concentration-dependent manner. The addition of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased the amount of L-Trp bound to CaSR ECD at any given concentration, suggesting that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances L-Trp binding, possibly by affecting the L-Trp-binding affinity and kinetics of CaSR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of L-Trp (IC<sub>50</sub>, concentration at which 50% displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp was observed) was approximately 2 mM regardless of whether the experiment was performed in the absence (2.11 ± 0.72 mM) or presence (2.04 ± 0.10 mM) of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Nevertheless, the binding affinity of L-Trp to CaSR ECD with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup> may still differ as it depends on the concentration and binding affinity of the radiolabeled ligand. Further studies are needed to characterize the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on L-amino acid binding at the orthosteric agonist site of CaSR.</p><p>We found that L-Trp directly stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization through CaSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conigrave et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young and Rozengurt, 2002</xref>). L-Trp-induced CaSR activation required the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> above a threshold level of 0.5 mM. The effect of L-Trp on CaSR was concentration-dependent, with an apparent half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.12 ± 0.06 mM when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present at 2.5 mM. The efficacy and potency of L-Trp decreased at lower concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are within the physiological range (L-Trp EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.75 ± 0.51 mM at 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), consistent with previous proposal that multiple amino acids need to act in concert to control the function of CaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2004</xref>).</p><p>L-Trp is also important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated CaSR response.

The presence of 10 mM L-Trp lowered the EC<sub>50</sub> of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by about 30%. Second, the residues involved in L-Trp binding are crucial for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent receptor activation. Previous and current studies demonstrate that each of the individual mutations S147A, S170A, Y218A, and E297K abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced receptor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silve et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–L</xref>). Furthermore, E297K is a naturally occurring inactivating mutation that can lead to life-threatening hyperparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pollak et al., 1993</xref>).

Site 2 is positioned directly above the interdomain crevice in LB1 domain, and it abuts the L-Trp binding site in the cleft. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by the hydroxyl group of T100 in both states, and by the carboxyl group of N102 through a water molecule in the active structure. In addition, T145, another residue lining the site, forms part of the L-Trp binding cleft in the active state. Therefore, an intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> site 2 provides an essential framework for L-Trp recognition. Indeed, introducing a hydrophobic residue at this site through mutations T100I, N102I, or T145I nearly eliminated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced receptor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).</p><p>Site 3 is positioned at the edge of the interdomain cleft in LB2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by the hydroxyl groups of S302 and S303 either directly (site 3′) or indirectly through water molecules. Alignment of the inactive and active structures in this region showed a small conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion stabilizes a loop conformation that permits an interdomain hydrogen bond between the neighboring LB2 residue S301 and LB1 residue R66. Such interaction enhances domain closure of CaSR ECD for receptor activation.</p><p>Among all four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in CaSR ECD structure, site 4 is most closely associated with receptor activation because it directly participates in the formation of an active receptor conformation. Site 4 is part of the homodimer interface formed upon agonist binding, bridging the LB2 domain of one subunit and CR domain of the second subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by three interfacial residues, including the carboxylate group of D234 and carbonyl oxygen of E231 and G557 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The natural mutation G557E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendy et al., 2009</xref>) reduced the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> possibly by affecting backbone conformation, thereby weakening the affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Our structural data indicate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at site 4 stabilizes the active conformation of the receptor by facilitating homodimer interactions between the membrane-proximal LB2 and CR domains.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions have different peak heights in the anomalous difference maps, which are correlated with different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-occupancies at various sites. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at sites 1 and 2 have strong peaks (12.1–13.1 σ), indicating that these are high-occupancy sites. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at sites 3 (7.3 – 9.0 σ) and 4 (5.8 σ) have weaker anomalous peaks, which suggest low occupancy and possibly low affinity.

L-Trp, the amino acid used in this study, fits the role of an orthosteric agonist for CaSR. (1) It binds at the interdomain crevice of the VFT module, the canonical agonist-binding site for class C GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>). (2) L-Trp shares a common receptor-binding mode with the endogenous agonists of mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, which are also amino acids or their analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>). The residues involved in agonist recognition are located at the same positions in the structures of these receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, a conserved serine residue is responsible for securing the carboxylate of L-Trp, glutamate and GABA in CaSR (S147), mGluRs (S165) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (S130) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. (3) L-Trp interacts with both LB1 and LB2 domains to facilitate extracellular domain closure, a crucial first step during CaSR activation. In contrast, no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is found at the putative orthosteric agonist-binding site to induce domain closure. (4) Mutations of L-Trp-binding residues completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced IP accumulation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silve et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that L-Trp is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated receptor response. (6) L-Trp directly activates CaSR-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion fulfills at least three functional roles. First, it maintains the structural integrity of CaSR, as manifested by the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site 2 for receptor function. Second, it is directly involved in receptor activation. Specifically, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at site 4 stabilizes the unique homodimer interface between membrane-proximal LB2 and CR domains in the active state. Third, Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances L-Trp binding to CaSR ECD, possibly by reinforcing the L-Trp bound and active conformation of the receptor. Furthermore, the actions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and amino acids on CaSR are inter-dependent. While the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> above a threshold level is required for amino-acid-mediated CaSR activation, amino acids increase the sensitivity of the receptor toward Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, we conclude that amino acids and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are indeed co-agonists of CaSR, acting jointly to trigger receptor activation.</p><p>This then led us to an intriguing question: How does Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion activate the receptor on its own as demonstrated in various cell-based functional assays? It is possible that amino acids are present in cell culture media and extracellular fluid at sufficient concentration to prime the receptor to respond to increasing concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We have obtained crystals of CaSR ECD in the absence of any additional amino acids. Nevertheless, the structure showed a stretch of continuous density in the interdomain cleft that may belong to an endogenous ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Table 1—source data 2</xref>). Despite multiple attempts, we have not been able to identify the structure of this endogenous ligand through mass spectrometry. In light of the L-Trp-bound CaSR ECD structure, we reason that the endogenous ligand may be an amino acid or even a mixture of amino acids. In the inactive structure, the endogenous ligand was likely removed by citrate buffer (pH 5.5) during enzymatic deglycosylation.</p><p>Metabolic balances of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> are linked through hormonal factors such as parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23, which control the homeostasis of both ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quinn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tyler Miller, 2013</xref>). We therefore reason that the physiologically relevant anion bound to CaSR is likely PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, which primarily exists in a HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> mixture in biological systems. First, the anion at site 2 is required for structural stability of the receptor. Second, the anions at sites 1 and 3 appear to stabilize the inactive conformation. Binding of anions at these sites prevent favorable interactions across the interdomain cleft that promote VFT closure. Third, the presence of anion decreases CaSR-mediated IP accumulation. Therefore, these anions may exert a negative modulatory effect on CaSR activity.</p><p>The presence of anion-binding sites in CaSR may also provide a mechanism for CaSR to sense polycations such as polyamines. Increasing concentrations of polyamines could potentially compete with arginine residues at the anion-binding sites to bind to PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, thereby prompting the dissociation of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> from relatively weak sites, and releasing their inhibitory effect on the receptor. This would drive CaSR toward its active-state conformation. Our hypothesis would predict that polycations with higher number of positive charges will be more effective agonists. Indeed, previous studies have shown that polyamines mediate an increase in intracellular inositol phosphate and Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation with the rank order seprmine &gt; spermidine &gt; putrescine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quinn et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In summary, activation of CaSR involves an intricate interplay of amino acids, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and possibly PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Like other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenbaum et al., 2011</xref>), CaSR exists in a conformational equilibrium between inactive and active states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). (1) CaSR adopts an open conformation in the resting state, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions promote the inactive configuration. (2) An L-amino acid closes the groove in the extracellular VFT module, thereby inducing the formation of a novel homodimer interface between subunits. (3) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilize the active state by enhancing homodimer interactions between membrane-proximal domains to fully activate the receptor. The combination of agonist-induced VFT closure and specific association of membrane-proximal CR domains in CaSR will likely lead to rearrangement of the transmembrane domains for receptor activation.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13662.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Activation mechanism of CaSR.</title><p>The schematic diagram shows the equilibrium between the resting and active states of CaSR and the effects of L-amino acid and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13662.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13662.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13662-fig9-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Common class C GPCR activation mechanism</title><p>Structural and functional data suggest a universal activation mechanism for class C GPCRs. First, agonist causes VFT closure in all three receptor systems of CaSR, mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. Second, receptor activation requires the association of membrane-proximal domains. For CaSR, this involves the formation of a novel homodimer interface between the LB2 and CR domains. For GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, which lacks the CR region, agonist leads to the formation of a large heterodimer interface between the LB2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly for mGluRs, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies indicate that the LB2 domains of mGluRs come into proximity to stabilize the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, disulfide crosslinking experiments of mGluR demonstrate that a precise association between the CR domains is sufficient for full receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). Third, agonist binding is accompanied by a decrease in separation between the C-terminal ends of extracellular domains. This will likely result in rearrangement of the transmembrane domain dimer for receptor activation. Indeed, FRET and crosslinking studies have detected movement between interacting transmembrane domains of mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsushita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tateyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). In conclusion, agonist-induced VFT closure that leads to the specific association of membrane-proximal domains is a common mechanism shared by all class C GPCRs during ligand-dependent receptor activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The extracellular domain of human CaSR (1–612) was cloned into the pFBDM vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2004</xref>) for expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells.

A two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis was identified from the self-rotation function. Polyalanine models generated from the individual LB1 and LB2 domains of mGluR3 ECD structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 2007</xref>) (PDB code: 2E4U) were used as search probes to locate the VFT modules of both CaSR ECD molecules in the crystal. After phase improvement by two-fold NCS-averaging, additional density appeared for the CR domain of CaSR ECD. A complete model of the CaSR ECD homodimer was developed through a succession of manual fittings and iterative refinement. The final model contained the CaSR ECD residues 20–119, 135–359 and 393–598 in one protomer, and residues 22–122, 136–360 and 392–602 in the other protomer. Each protomer contained eight intrasubunit disulfide bridges. Electron density was visible for carbohydrate residues (N-acetyl-glucosamine) attached to Asn90, Asn287, Asn488, Asn541 of one protomer, and Asn541 of its dimer partner. Finally, each protomer was also bound to one L-Trp ligand, four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, and two PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions were identified by anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using data collected at a wavelength of 1.7712 Å. We modeled PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> as the anions in the CaSR ECD structure because they were major components of the crystallization solution.

The final model for a single protomer contained CaSR ECD residues 21–130 and 136–603. In addition to the eight intrasubunit disulfide linkages within each protomer, the inter-subunit disulfide bond formed by C129 was ordered in the form I CaSR ECD crystal structure. Electron density was also visible for carbohydrate residues (N-acetyl-glucosamine) attached to Asn261, Asn287, Asn446, Asn468, Asn488, Asn541, and Asn594.

The cells were washed three times with an assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/ml BSA, 5.5 mM D-glucose, 5.3 mM KCl, 138 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3,</sub> 0.44 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.34 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) to remove any endogenously bound ligand, and pre-incubated with 10 mM L-Trp for 20 min before stimulation with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single-cell intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> microfluorimetry</title><p>HEK293 cells that stably expressed the CaSR (HEK-CaSR cells) were cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates, and loaded in the dark with fura2-AM (5 µM) in physiological saline solution (PSS; 125 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 0.1% w/v D-glucose, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.45) that contained 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 1 mg/ml BSA for 1.5 hr at 37°C. The cells were washed and stored in a fura2-AM-free loading solution prior to experiments. Fura2-loaded HEK-CaSR cells were transferred into a perifusion chamber, placed in the light path of a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, USA), and perifused with PSS containing various concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Trp.</p><p>Fura2-loaded HEK-CaSR cells were excited by a Lambda DG-4 150 Watt xenon light source (Sutter, Novato, USA), using alternating wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm at 0.5 s intervals, and imaged at 510 nm. For each data set, regions of interest corresponding to the locations of 10 individual cells were selected and digital images were captured using an AxioCam camera controlled by Stallion SB.4.1.0 PC software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, USA).</p><p>Single-cell intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization data consisted of excitation ratios (F340/F380) plotted against time (min). Ratio data were integrated, expressed as integrated response units (IRUs), and corrected for baseline (PSS containing 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>).

The protein was incubated in 100 mM NaCitrate, pH 5.5 overnight to remove any endogenously bound ligand. The CaSR ECD protein was then separated from any free ligand by gel filtration chromatography in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl.</p><p>Binding of 0.1 mM L-[<sup>3</sup>H]Trp (1 Ci/mmol) to 600 ng of purified CaSR ECD was measured with the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) using 1.25 mg/mL Yttrium silicate (YSi) protein A SPA beads (PerkinElmer, USA) in conjunction with 0.125 ng/mL of anti-Flag M2 antibody in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl at 4°C. Increasing concentrations of non-radioactive L-Trp were added to compete for receptor binding in the presence of 0 mM or 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Each reaction was also performed in the presence of 60 mM non-radioactive L-Trp for background correction. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 hr to reach equilibrium. The plates were then counted in a Microbeta counter (PerkinElmer, USA). Data were analyzed using the non-linear regression algorithms in Prism (GraphPad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank WA Hendrickson and RS Kass for advice and support, Q Liu and O Clarke for advice on diffraction data analysis, C Karan and R Realubit for access to EnVision plate reader, K Rajashankar and Northeastern Collaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) staff for help with data collection.

These structures of the extracellular domain demonstrate that L-Trp is an orthosteric agonist of the receptor and reveal binding sites for modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Structures in four pharmacologically relevant conditions reveal two distinct conformations consistent with a model of an activation rearrangement that is triggered by venus flytrap closure on agonist, which positions the cysteine-rich domains of the subunits in close proximity – consistent with earlier structural and biochemical analysis on other class C GPCRs. The study suggests that positive and negative allosteric modulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions act occurs via modulation of the binding of the orthosteric agonist.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Evaluate the L-Trp EC<sub>50</sub> in cell-based assays using different ionic conditions (such as no Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>2) To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> on the response of CaSR to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compare responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, in wt and mutants of the anion binding sites.</p><p>3) To demonstrate the potentiating effect of L-Trp on the response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compare responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of L-Trp, in wt and mutants of the L-tryptophan binding sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Geng et al. describes the crystal structures of the human calcium-sensing G protein-coupled receptor extracellular domain (ECD). In a nutshell, these structures demonstrate that L-Trp is an orthosteric agonist of the receptor and reveal several binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions that, based on mutagenesis data and functional assays, may play a key role in balancing receptor activity.</p><p>In particular, the structures were obtained in four different pharmacologically relevant conditions (with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Trp) and revealed only two distinct conformations. Based on the structural information available for the same receptor family (class C GPCRs), the authors propose that these two conformations represent inactive and active states of the receptor. They provide a detailed comparison of both structures to highlight the rearrangement of the ECDs that is necessary for receptor activation. Of note, this is the first structure in the class C family in which the cystein rich domain (CRD) adopt such a conformation in an agonist bound condition. This structure nicely fits the crosslinking data obtained for the metabotropic glutamate receptors in living cells and thus validate the ECD activation model of class C GPCR possessing a CRD domain: an interdomain movement triggered by VFT closure which positions the CRDs in close proximity.</p><p>I thus believe this study is of immediate interest to many people in the GPCR field and beyond. Overall the methodology and data are robust and I did not find any flaws that should prohibit its publication.</p><p>To conclude, I think it is tempting to speculate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions act respectively as positive and negative allosteric modulators of the CaSR receptor activity by modulating, at least in part, the binding of the orthosteric agonist L-Trp. One key experiment would thus be to evaluate the L-Trp EC<sub>50</sub> in cell-based assays using different ionic conditions (such as no Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>Although this might strengthen the manuscript, I do not believe these data would be critical for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an important manuscript reporting the first crystal structure of CaSR. The structure showed interesting features in terms of ligand binding sites. The binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a main agonist, was different from the canonical ligand binding sites identified in other class C GPCRs, such as mGluR and GABABR. It is noteworthy that this canonical site in CaSR was occupied by L-tryptophan, a putative co-agonist. These features concerning about binding sites and the proposed activation mechanism of CaSR is unique, in comparison to other class C GPCRs. Therefore, this paper will contribute to facilitate the understanding of physiological and biophysical properties of CaSR and class C GPCR. The authors also identified the putative binding sites for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, and suggested that PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is an antagonist of CaSR for the first time.</p><p>I highly evaluate the scientific merits and the general impact of the paper. I judge it is worthy for publication, but only after satisfactory revisions. I have four major comments which require attention.</p><p>1) Experiments to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup></p><p>The conclusion in the Discussion that &quot; PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions promote the inactive configuration&quot; is rather speculative from the two reasons in the following.</p><p>A) There are no direct evidence which shows PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> promotes the inactivated conformation. The authors showed mutants of the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> binding sites have lower IP accumulation in response to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. I think the data are not sufficient. To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> on the response of CaSR to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> conclusively, I would like to request to present data comparing the responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, in wt and mutants of the anion binding sites. The expected result is lower response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> than in the absence, not in mutants but in wt.</p><p>B) The authors assume that the electron density represents the presence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, because there are no anions in the crystallization solution other than PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. Is there a possibility that carryover endogenous anion(s) other than PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is bound to the anion binding site? (similarly to the case of the putative carryover of endogenous amino acid(s) at the L-tryptophan binding site when crystalized in the absence of L-tryptophan).</p><p>2) Experiments to demonstrate the potentiating effect of L-tryptophan</p><p>I have similar comments to the case of anion effect. To demonstrate the potentiating effect of L-tryptophan on the response of CaSR to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> conclusively, please present data comparing the responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of L-tryptophan, in wt and mutants of the L-tryptophan binding sites. The expected result is higher response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of L-tryptophan than in the absence, not in mutants but in wt.</p><p>3) Comparison with the mGluR and GABABR</p><p>The authors discussed differences and similarities of the CaSR structure to those of mGluR and GABABR. However, it is hard to follow the explanations in the text, without structure images for comparison.</p><p>A) The authors mentioned the degree of rotational change of two LB1 interface in CaSR with GABAB and mGluR upon activation (subsection “Common protomer-protomer interactions”, third paragraph). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>, the authors showed two images of CaSR in the resting and activated states. I would like to request to add similar images in the two states of mGluR and GABABR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, to clarify the discussion of the rotated angle of LB1 interface.</p><p>B) The authors described an overall similarity of VFT cleft structure of CaSR and mGluR. They also wrote the tryptophan binding site of CaSR corresponds to the glutamate binding site of mGluR (subsection “Structure of CaSR ECD homodimer”, second paragraph). To clarify these points, please present a superimposed image of the VFT cleft of CaSR and mGluR, in e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>4) Gd3+ binding site</p><p>In the crystal structure of mGluR1, a binding site for Gd3+ was identified at the dimer interface (Tsuchiya et al., PNAS 2002). I would like to have explanations whether or not a similar structure was identified in CaSR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Geng et al. reported the crystal structures of entire extracellular domain of calcium sensing receptor of calcium free form and loaded forms in the presence of calcium and PO43- ions. This work is of importance for providing insights for the activation mechanism via dimer interface between subunits. There are several major concerns that need be addressed:</p><p>1) The crystal structures were determined for CaSR with mutations of either two (N386Q and S402N) or three (N468Q) N-glycosylation sites. However, no study has been carried out on the effects of these mutations on expression and function of CaSR. It is important to provide evidence with experimental data that mutations at these glycosylation sites do not result in alteration of the function and expression.</p><p>2) Since mutations could lead to reduction in cell surface expression due to trafficking, it is encouraged to provide confocal images to ensure that the observed change in intracellular IP activity is not due to reduction of protein expression levels on cell surface.</p><p>3) The identification of Trp binding site is very important for the activation mechanism. It will be very helpful to report Trp binding affinity of the ECD of CaSR.</p><p>4) Extremely high concentrations of three different anion ions were used for crystallization. The role of anion binding is not clear and some of them appear to be non-specific. Among 4 anion-binding sites identified, sites 1-3 are in inactive form crystalized with 3.0 M Li2SO4, 100 mM Tris pH8.5 with mutations N386Q and S402N. Under this condition, SO42- ions are assigned. On the other hand, 1.6 M NaH2PO4, 0.4 M K2HPO4, 100 mM Na2HPO4/citric acid pH4.2, 10 mM Trp 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are used for identification of anion sites in the active form of CaSR with three glycosylation mutations. Thus, 2 anion binding sites were modeled to be PO43. What is the binding affinity for these anion ions?</p><p>5) The four calcium binding sites shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> either have incomplete coordination or lack of negatively charged residues. These properties are very different from classical calcium binding sites with at least three ligand oxygen atoms from the protein and with electrostatic interactions. The reported site 3 calcium is directly chelated only by one oxygen from hydroxyl side chin of S302. Site 4 is formed by side chain of D234 and mainchain carbonyl oxygen from E231 and G557. How the function results provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is a mutation G55E that results in a significantly increase of EC50 for IP accumulation and intracellular calcium response. Why have such big alteration of activity for a replacement of another carbonyl oxygen? Since calcium interaction is largely electrostatic, it would make sense to test the mutational effect D234A. The provided mutational studies of I181 m, T100I, and N102I all have significantly reduced maximal amplitudes in both IP and intracellular calcium activities in addition to increased EC50. These results suggest that the surface expression of the mutated protein variants are largely reduced. Thus, the effect for these residues in calcium binding cannot be unambiguously revealed. It is important to provide the results for the mutational effect of these identified ligand residues on direct calcium binding affinity.</p><p>6) It is worth to pointing out that at pH4.2 sidechain of Asp and Glu are largely protonated with significantly reduced calcium binding capability. In addition, due to poor solubility of calcium phosphate, the molar phosphate concentrations used in the buffer will result in extremely low concentration of soluble free calcium. Thus, the role of calcium binding in activation revealed in the determined structures is likely to be under estimated due to the condition used for crystallization.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural mechanism of ligand activation in human calcium-sensing receptor&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the point by point response to Reviewer #3, comment #3, the authors stated the following:</p><p>&quot;The presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect the binding affinity of L-Trp, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>ion is not directly involved in L-Trp recognition. This is consistent with our structural observation that no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is found at the L-Trp-binding site. Nevertheless, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion increased the amount of L-Trp bound to CaSR ECD at any given concentration, indicating that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the L-Trp-binding site occupancy, possibly by stabilizing the L-Trp-bound and active conformation of CaSR.&quot;</p><p>The authors should clarify what they mean by this. If calcium stabilized the Trp-bound state it would presumably be seen as an increase in Trp affinity. An increase in amount of radio-Trp that is bound that does not shift the affinity curve would seem to suggest adding to circulation Trp binding sites (i.e. receptors) that were previously not available (from an unavailable/inactive pool?). Or is there another possible explanation? Or does this raise a caveat about the experiment? This should be addressed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I believe the revised version of the manuscript &quot;Structural mechanism of ligand activation in human calcium-sensing receptor&quot; is addressing the essential revisions that were raised during the first reviewing process. In particular, the authors have addressed the allosteric effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on L-Trp activity (and vice versa).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13662.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Evaluate the L-Trp EC<sub>50</sub> in cell-based assays using different ionic conditions (such as no Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</italic></p><p>Following the referees’ suggestion, we have evaluated the L-Trp EC50 at different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations by monitoring changes in CaSR-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in single cells. In agreement with previous findings, L-Trp can activate CaSR when the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is above the threshold level of 0.5 mM. The effect of L-Trp on CaSR was concentration-dependent, with an apparent EC50 of 0.12 ± 0.06 mM when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present at 2.5 mM. The efficacy of L-Trp decreased at lower concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are within the physiological range (L-Trp EC50 = 0.75 ± 0.51 mM at 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), consistent with previous proposal that multiple amino acids need to act in concert to control the function of CaSR. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and 4F</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> on the response of CaSR to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compare responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, in wt and mutants of the anion binding sites.</italic></p><p>Following the referees’ suggestion, we have measured the response of CaSR to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence and presence of the anion SO<sub>42-</sub>. We chose SO<sub>42-</sub> to substitute for PO<sub>43-</sub> because CaSO<sub>4</sub> is more soluble than CaHPO<sub>4</sub>, the predominant form of calcium phosphate salt at physiological pH. At pH 7.4, approximately 61.3% of the phosphate ions exist in the form of HPO<sub>42-</sub> and 38.7% are in the form of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. The solubility of CaHPO<sub>4</sub> and Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)2 are 1.5 mM and 71 mM, respectively. The solubility of CaSO<sub>4</sub> is 15 mM.</p><p>As predicted by the referee, and consistent with our structural observation, we found that the response of CaSR to Ca<sup>2+</sup> was slightly lower in the presence of than in the absence SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. This confirms that anions have a negative allosteric effect on the receptor. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>We have also examined the effects of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> on mutants of the anion binding-sites.

In agreement with previous findings, L-Trp can activate CaSR when the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is above the threshold level of 0.5 mM. The effect of L-Trp on CaSR was concentration-dependent, with an apparent EC50 of 0.12 ± 0.06 mM when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present at 2.5 mM. The efficacy of L-Trp decreased at lower concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are within the physiological range (L-Trp EC50 = 0.75 ± 0.51 mM at 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), consistent with previous proposal that multiple amino acids need to act in concert to control the function of CaSR.

The authors showed mutants of the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> binding sites have lower IP accumulation in response to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. I think the data are not sufficient. To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> on the response of CaSR to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> conclusively, I would like to request to present data comparing the responses (IP accumulation) to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence and absence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, in wt and mutants of the anion binding sites. The expected result is lower response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> than in the absence, not in mutants but in wt.</italic> </p><p>Following the referee’s suggestion, we have measured the response of CaSR to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence and presence of the anion SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. We chose SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to substitute for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> because CaSO<sub>4</sub> is more soluble than CaHPO<sub>4</sub>, the predominant form of calcium phosphate salt at physiological pH. At pH 7.4, approximately 61.3% of the phosphate ions exist in the form of HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and 38.7% are in the form of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. The solubility of CaHPO<sub>4</sub> and Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4)2</sub> are 1.5 mM and 71 mM, respectively. The solubility of CaSO<sub>4</sub> is 15 mM.</p><p>As predicted by the referee, and consistent with our structural observation, we found that the response of CaSR to Ca<sup>2+</sup> was slightly lower in the presence of than in the absence SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. This confirms that anions have a negative allosteric effect on the receptor. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>We have also examined the effects of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> on mutants of the anion binding-sites.

Is there a possibility that carryover endogenous anion(s) other than PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is bound to the anion binding site?

This work is of importance for providing insights for the activation mechanism via dimer interface between subunits. There are several major concerns that need be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The crystal structures were determined for CaSR with mutations of either two (N386Q and S402N) or three (N468Q) N-glycosylation sites. However, no study has been carried out on the effects of these mutations on expression and function of CaSR. It is important to provide evidence with experimental data that mutations at these glycosylation sites do not result in alteration of the function and expression.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that it is important to provide evidence that the glycosylation mutations introduced into our expression constructs do not alter the function of the receptor. It has been reported previously that glycosylation is not required for signal transduction of CaSR (Ray et al., JBC, 1998, 273, 34558-34567). Following the referee’s suggestion, we have also generated two full-length CaSR constructs for functional analysis in mammalian cells, one carrying the two glycosylation-site mutations N386Q and S402N, and the other carrying the additional mutation N468Q. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced IP accumulation was statistically the same for the wild-type and mutant receptors, indicating that these glycosylation mutations did not alter CaSR function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, previous studies of full-length CaSR in mammalian cells indicate that disruption of the glycosylation sites impairs proper processing and expression of the receptor at the cell surface (Ray et al., JBC, 1998, 273, 34558-34567). In agreement with these findings, we found that expression of CaSR ECD in insect cells was essentially eliminated when more than three glycosylation sites were mutated. After testing mutations at each of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites individually and in various combinations, we chose the constructs reported in this study to maximize the reduction of carbohydrate content while maintaining a sufficient expression level for structural analyses.</p><p><italic>2) Since mutations could lead to reduction in cell surface expression due to trafficking, it is encouraged to provide confocal images to ensure that the observed change in intracellular IP activity is not due to reduction of protein expression levels on cell surface.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the referee’s suggestion. Unfortunately, we do not have any experience with confocal imaging. We did measure the cell surface expression levels of wild-type and mutant CaSR by on-cell western analysis, which was described in the Methods section. Most of the mutants in our study were expressed on the cell surface at levels comparable to that of the wild- type receptor. The exceptions were R66H, R69E, I81M, T100I, N102I, and S417L, which reduced the surface expression of the mutant receptors to approximately 70-75% of the wild-type level. Nevertheless, the reduction in the protein expression level on cell surface could not account for the much greater decrease in intracellular IP accumulation for each of these mutants. We therefore concluded that the mutations affected receptor function.</p><p><italic>3) The identification of Trp binding site is very important for the activation mechanism. It will be very helpful to report Trp binding affinity of the ECD of CaSR.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee, and have determined the binding affinity of L-Trp for CaSR ECD by scintillation proximity assay using radiolabeled [<sup>3</sup>H]-Trp. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp to CaSR ECD was inhibited by nonradioactive L-Trp with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 2.1 ± 0.7 mM. The presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect the binding affinity of L-Trp, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is not directly involved in L-Trp recognition. This is consistent with our structural observation that no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is found at the L-Trp-binding site. Nevertheless, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion increased the amount of L-Trp bound to CaSR ECD at any given concentration, indicating that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the L-Trp-binding site occupancy, possibly by stabilizing the L-Trp-bound and active conformation of CaSR.</p><p><italic>4) Extremely high concentrations of three different anion ions were used for crystallization. The role of anion binding is not clear and some of them appear to be non-specific. Among 4 anion-binding sites identified, sites 1-3 are in inactive form crystalized with 3.0 M Li2SO4, 100 mM Tris pH8.5 with mutations N386Q and S402N. Under this condition, SO42- ions are assigned. On the other hand, 1.6 M NaH2PO4, 0.4 M K2HPO4, 100 mM Na2HPO4/citric acid pH4.2, 10 mM Trp 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are used for identification of anion sites in the active form of CaSR with three glycosylation mutations. Thus, 2 anion binding sites were modeled to be PO43-. What is the binding affinity for these anion ions?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that it would be informative to determine the binding affinities of the anions to CaSR. We tried to quantify the binding of PO<sub>43-</sub> ions to purified CaSR ECD protein using microscale thermophoresis, but were unsuccessful. Several factors may have contributed to the difficulties we encountered. (1) The anions at different sites may have overlapping binding affinity ranges that cannot be easily differentiated. (2) Some sites such as site 2 may already be occupied by endogenous anions. (3) Low-affinity anion-receptor interactions at some sites are difficult to detect.</p><p><italic>5) The four calcium binding sites shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> either have incomplete coordination or lack of negatively charged residues. These properties are very different from classical calcium binding sites with at least three ligand oxygen atoms from the protein and with electrostatic interactions. The reported site 3 calcium is directly chelated only by one oxygen from hydroxyl side chin of S302. Site 4 is formed by side chain of D234 and mainchain carbonyl oxygen from E231 and G557. How the function results provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is a mutation G55E that results in a significantly increase of EC50 for IP accumulation and intracellular calcium response. Why have such big alteration of activity for a replacement of another carbonyl oxygen? Since calcium interaction is largely electrostatic, it would make sense to test the mutational effect D234A.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the referee’s observation that the coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at all four binding sites in CaSR appear different from classical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. It is possible that water molecules play a role in coordinating the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, but could not all be seen in the structures due to disordering or the modest resolution of the structures.</p><p>The alteration in receptor activity of the G557E mutant may have resulted from a change in the conformation of the loop containing residue 557 such that the carbonyl oxygen is no longer optimally positioned to coordinate the binding of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at this site. Nevertheless, the effect of the G557E mutation is not as substantial as some of the other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site mutations including I81M, T100I and N102I, which nearly abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced receptor activation. The EC<sub>50</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced IP accumulation increased approximately two fold from 1.6 mM for the wild-type receptor to 3.4 mM for the G557E mutant, while the Emax of the receptor response remained essentially the same.</p><p>Following the referee’s suggestion, we have tested the mutation D234A, and found that its effect on receptor activity was negligible, as shown by the IP accumulation dose response curves for wild-type receptor and the D234A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 4</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the side chain of D234 is somewhat flexible, and does not contribute to the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at site 4 as much as the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of E231 and G557.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13662.026</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Dose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated IP accumulation in cells transiently expressing the D234A mutant CaSR.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13662.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13662.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13662-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>The provided mutational studies of I181 m, T100I, and N102I all have significantly reduced maximal amplitudes in both IP and intracellular calcium activities in addition to increased EC50.

It is important to provide the results for the mutational effect of these identified ligand residues on direct calcium binding affinity.</italic> </p><p>The cell surface expression levels of the mutants I81M, T100I, N102I were approximately 70- 75% of the wild-type level based on on-cell western measurements.

We tried two different approaches to determine the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity to wild-type CaSR ECD, including microscale thermophoresis and scintillation proximity assay. Unfortunately, we were not successful possibly for the same reasons that we had difficulties measuring the affinities of anions. (1) The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at different sites may have overlapping binding affinity ranges that cannot be easily differentiated. (2) Some sites such as site 2 may already be occupied by endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>. (3) Low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-receptor interactions at some sites are difficult to detect.</p><p><italic>6) It is worth to pointing out that at pH4.2 sidechain of Asp and Glu are largely protonated with significantly reduced calcium binding capability. In addition, due to poor solubility of calcium phosphate, the molar phosphate concentrations used in the buffer will result in extremely low concentration of soluble free calcium.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In the point by point response to Reviewer #3, comment #3, the authors stated the following:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;The presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect the binding affinity of L-Trp, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is not directly involved in L-Trp recognition. This is consistent with our structural observation that no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is found at the L-Trp-binding site. Nevertheless, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion increased the amount of L-Trp bound to CaSR ECD at any given concentration, indicating that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the L-Trp-binding site occupancy, possibly by stabilizing the L-Trp-bound and active conformation of CaSR.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors should clarify what they mean by this. If calcium stabilized the Trp-bound state it would presumably be seen as an increase in Trp affinity. An increase in amount of radio-Trp that is bound that does not shift the affinity curve would seem to suggest adding to circulation Trp binding sites (i.e. receptors) that were previously not available (from an unavailable/inactive pool?). Or is there another possible explanation? Or does this raise a caveat about the experiment? This should be addressed in the text.</italic> </p><p>We think referee #3 has raised a valid criticism. As pointed out by referee #1 below, we cannot conclude based on our [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp binding competition studies alone that the binding affinity of L-Trp is the same with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Given our structural observation that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes the active conformation of the receptor, we agree that Ca<sup>2+</sup> would most likely enhance the binding affinity of L-Trp since the interaction of L-Trp with an active receptor is expected to be more extensive than with an inactive receptor. In an active receptor, L-Trp would contact both the LB1 and LB2 domains. L-Trp may still bind to the open cleft in an inactive receptor, but its interaction with the receptor will be limited to the LB1 domain, which would result in lower affinity. The binding of glutamate to an open cleft has previously been observed for mGluR1 (Kunishima et al., Nature 2000, 407, 971-977).</p><p>Unfortunately, as indicated by referee #1, it would be difficult for us to measure the binding affinity of L-Trp in a saturation binding experiment since the concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp required would be ≥10 mM, and a relatively low specific radioactivity of the commercially available radio-labeled ligand may preclude such experiments. Our competition experiments in the current study were performed at 0.1 mM [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp, a concentration that is about 20-fold below the determined half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of non-labeled L-Trp for replacing radiolabeled L-Trp.</p><p>In addition, the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> may affect the on- and off-rate of L-Trp binding to CaSR ECD. Specifically, L-Trp may have a slower off-rate when bound to the active conformation. Therefore, the higher amount of L-Trp binding observed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> may reflect the different L-Trp binding affinity and kinetics exhibited by the inactive and active receptors. We have modified our text to include these explanations and to indicate that additional studies would be needed to characterize the role of L-amino acid binding to the orthosteric agonist site of CaSR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
