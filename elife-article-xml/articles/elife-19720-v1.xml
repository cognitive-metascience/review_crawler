suggest that the enzymatic function of PS1/γ-secretase can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19720.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19720.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19720.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease is a widely recognised disorder caused by the progressive deterioration and death of brain cells. A key feature of the disease is the formation of structures called plaques in the brain. Plaques occur when many copies of a molecule known as amyloid beta stick together outside of the brain cells. Healthy brains also produce amyloid beta but it is in a different form, which cannot form plaques.</p><p>One in twenty people with Alzheimer’s disease have a family history of the disease. Of these, many are linked to changes in a gene that produces a protein called Presenilin 1 (or PS1 for short). Cells need PS1 to make amyloid beta and the altered versions of PS1 produce the type of amyloid beta that causes Alzheimer’s disease. Yet, in cases that do not run in families, the gene for PS1 is unchanged but the PS1 protein still produces the form of amyloid beta that is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Maesako, Horlacher et al. wanted to find out how seemingly healthy PS1 proteins can be made to produce plaque-forming amyloid betas. Studies of PS1 from mice revealed that small chemical modifications, called phosphate groups, could be attached to PS1 in a process called phosphorylation. Modified PS1 proteins produce harmful amyloid betas and removing the modifications was enough to make PS1 behave normally again. Maesako, Horlacher et al. found three points in the PS1 protein where phosphorylation could change the behaviour of the protein, the most important one is a site called Ser367.</p><p>Further investigation showed that an enzyme called Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates PS1; this enzyme is also able to attach phosphate groups to many different proteins. Maesako, Horlacher et al. went on to show that PS1 is phosphorylated in samples from people with Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that this is a plausible cause for some cases of the disease. Finding a way to prevent phosphorylation or remove phosphate groups from PS1 could be the first step towards treating these cases of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

β-amyloid (Aβ), are the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic component of γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Esler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2000</xref>), which is responsible for the final enzymatic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Strooper et al., 1998</xref>). Over 180 familial AD mutations have been identified in the PS1 gene, and the majority of them lead to an increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Strooper, 2007</xref>). PS1 knock-in mice carrying familial AD mutations exhibit decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but increased Aβ42/40 ratio and accelerated Aβ deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 2015</xref>). This supports the idea that up-regulation of the Aβ42/40 ratio rather than the total amount of Aβ has a strong impact on Aβ deposition and AD pathogenesis.</p><p>Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based imaging techniques we have previously shown that familial AD mutations in PS1 increase the proximity of PS1 N-terminus (NT) to C-terminus (CT) or to the large cytoplasmic loop domain, causing the so called ‘closed’ pathogenic PS1 conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berezovska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uemura et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and PS1/γ-secretase modulators, which are known to decrease the Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weggen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Page et al., 2008</xref>), drive PS1 into the ‘open’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lleó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uemura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohki et al., 2011</xref>). These reports indicate that PS1 conformational changes are tightly linked to changes of the Aβ42/40 ratio, suggesting that modulation of the pathogenic ‘closed’ PS1 conformation is a potential target for AD treatment.</p><p>A number of studies highlight the reciprocal relationship between elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and Aβ pathology. Notably, Aβ deposition is observed in brain regions exhibiting a high basal rate of neuronal activity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sperling et al., 2009</xref>). The idea that Aβ causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is supported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuchibhotla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lopez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Busche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Higuchi et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis affects Aβ production. For example, acute stimulation of the entorhinal cortex using an optogenetic approach increases the Aβ42 level specifically in the projection area of the perforant pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>). KCl-induced depolarization causes sustained release of Aβ42 from AD mouse model synaptoneurosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). KCl-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx elevates intracellular Aβ42/40 ratio in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pierrot et al., 2004</xref>). We recently reported that increases in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels induce the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation in primary neurons, followed by an increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuzuya et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, PS1 is found in the ‘closed’ conformation in sporadic AD brain, and this pathogenic PS1 conformational shift correlates with the proximity to deposited Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wahlster et al., 2013</xref>). In this report, we address the detailed molecular mechanisms of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation of the PS1/γ-secretase.</p><p>Phosphorylation, one of the crucial post-translational modifications, is a rapid and dynamic event in cells, and represents a common mechanism of regulating protein conformation and/or activity. In PS1, fifteen phosphorylation sites have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kirschenbaum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fluhrer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ryu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matz et al., 2015</xref>). Although the phosphorylation of some of these sites affects the stability of PS1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ryu et al., 2010</xref>), the impact of phosphorylation on PS1 conformation and function has not yet been tested. Here, using FRET-based imaging we show that phosphorylation-inhibited mutations at the three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310, S313, and domain 3: S365, S366 and S367) prevents the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PS1 ‘closed’ conformational change. Conversely, phosphorylation-mimicking mutations reveal that domain 1 and 2 phosphorylation is necessary, but domain 3, and S367 in particular, is crucial for causing the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation. Moreover, Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibitors prevent the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PS1 ‘closed’ conformational change whereas PKA activators trigger it. Therefore, we conclude that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-increased PKA activity leads to phosphorylation of PS1 at the three domains, inducing the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation. These results provide strong evidence that PS1 phosphorylation at certain residues can potentially be molecular targets for AD prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increases the level of phosphorylated PS1</title><p>Using the conformation sensitive FRET probe, GFP-PS1-RFP (G-PS1-R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uemura et al., 2009</xref>), and the real-time FRET assay, we have previously shown that PS1 conformation is dynamically regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Significant increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were verified by Indo-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grynkiewicz et al., 1985</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). There was no statistical difference between the FRET efficiencies of WT PS1 and phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants in vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants is not different from that of WT PS1 in basal conditions. A23187 significantly increased the FRET efficiency between fluorescently labeled NT and CT of WT PS1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This indicates that WT PS1 adopts the ‘closed’ conformation following the treatment with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore. On the other hand, A23187 did not change the FRET efficiencies in T74A, S310A, S313A, S310A/S313A, S365A, S366A, S367A, S365A/S367A and S366A/S367A PS1 transfected cells, suggesting that conformation of these PS1 mutants was resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The A23187-resistant phosphorylation sites on PS1 could be divided into three sub-membrane domains: domain 1 (T74) on NT of PS1, domain 2 (S310, S313) and domain 3 (S365, S366, S367) within the large

To distinguish between these scenarios, we generated a set of phosphorylation-mimicking G-PS1-R mutants by replacing serine or threonine with aspartic acid (D) in single domains (domain 1, domain 2 or domain 3), in double domains (domains 1 + 2, domains 1 + 3 or domains 2 + 3), or in triple domains 1 + 2 + 3.

The spectral FRET analysis revealed significantly higher FRET efficiency in S367D G-PS1-R but not in S365D G-PS1-R or S366D G-PS1-R, as compared to WT G-PS1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates that phosphorylation of PS1 at serine 367 is responsible for the PS1 ‘closed’ conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PKA activity is involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic conformational change</title><p>Several kinases involved in phosphorylation of the serine residues within the PS1 cytoplasmic loop region, such as PKA, JNK, PKC and GSK3β, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kirschenbaum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fluhrer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>). However, the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation that is crucial for the PS1 conformational change remains unknown. To address this, WT G-PS1-R expressing 7 W cells were incubated with inhibitors of several kinases prior to A23187 treatment. The spectral FRET assay revealed that only the PKA inhibitor (KT5720) specifically rescued the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered ‘closed’ PS1 conformation, whereas JNK, PKC and GSK3β inhibitors did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was confirmed using a different PKA inhibitor (H-89) and a complementary antibody-based FLIM assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To verify this further in primary neurons, we monitored the change of endogenous PS1 conformation following pre-treatment with the two PKA inhibitors: H-89 or KT5720, or PKA activators: forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP, prior to incubation with KCl. The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a well known PKA-specific substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989</xref>), was used as a positive control for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PKA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferguson and Storm, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that the proximity between the fluorescently labelled PS1 NT and CT was comparable between vehicle and KCl-treated neurons in the presence of H-89 or KT5720 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, the FRET efficiency of forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP treated neurons was significantly higher than that of vehicle-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), supporting the involvement of PKA in the PS1 conformational change. Of note, there was no additive effect with KCl and PKA activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of KT5720 on the KCl/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 conformational change was also confirmed by real-time spectral FRET imaging in living primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To further corroborate the results obtained by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, we employed a dominant negative form of the PKA regulatory α subunit (G324D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olson et al., 1993</xref>). We found that co-expression of the G324D PKA mutant together with G-PS1-R prevents both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 phosphorylation at S310 and the ‘closed’ PS1 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19720.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PKA activity is involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven PS1 conformational change.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spectral FRET analysis of the PS1 conformation in 7 W cells transfected with WT G-PS1-R and pre-treated with 1 µM KT5720 (KT, PKA inhibitor, 16 hr), 20 µM SP600125 (SP, JNK inhibitor, 4 hr), 100 nM Ro 31–8220 (Ro, PKC inhibitor, 16 hr), or 5 µM TDZD-8 (TD, GSK3β inhibitor, 4 hr).

As expected, EGTA decreased the FRET efficiency between PS1 NT and CT, indicating that PS1 adopted an ‘open’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the other hand, EGTA had no effect on PS1 conformation in the presence of PKA activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that PKA activation is an event down-stream of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p><p>To ensure that PKA activation causes the PS1 pathogenic conformational change via PS1 phosphorylation, we treated 7 W cells expressing WT G-PS1-R or the phosphorylation-inhibited G-PS1-R mutants with forskolin. Whereas PKA activation by forskolin caused the PS1 ‘closed’ conformation in WT G-PS1-R expressing cells, it did not affect the conformation of domain 1, domain 2, or domain 3 phosphorylation-inhibited mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This indicates that blocking phosphorylation of either one of these domains precludes PS1 from adopting the ‘closed’ conformation via PKA activation.</p><p>Phosphorylation-mimicking mutations in domain 1 or domain 2 only (but not in domain 3), or domain 1 and domain 2 combined had no effect on PS1 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, to verify that domain 3 needs to be phosphorylated for the PS1 conformational change, and to determine whether PKA is involved, we transfected 7 W cells with WT or the domains 1 + 2 phosphorylation-mimicking G-PS1-R mutant, followed by treatment with A23187, forskolin, or 8-Bromo-cAMP. Similar to WT G-PS1-R expressing cells, the FRET efficiency of domains 1 + 2 phosphorylation-mimicking G-PS1-R was significantly increased upon A23187, forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This indicates that PKA is involved in the phosphorylation of S365-S366-S367 residues.</p><p>Since allosteric changes in PS1 conformation underlie changes in the Aβ42/40 ratio, with the ‘closed’ conformation linked to the increased Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berezovska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Isoo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wahlster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuzuya et al., 2016</xref>), we next tested if the inhibition of PKA activity would prevent the KCl treatment-induced increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. We found that treatment with KT5720 indeed abolished the KCl-induced elevation of the Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of domain 1 or 2 is not sufficient for the PS1 conformational change, but is required for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of domain 3, leading to the pathogenic conformational change in PS1/γ-secretase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PS1 phosphorylation is responsible for the pathogenic conformational shift in vivo</title><p>We established that PS1 phosphorylation at domain 3 forces PS1 into the ‘closed’ state in vitro. To determine whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may trigger PS1 domain 3 phosphorylation and the pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation in vivo, we optimized our spectral FRET assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uemura et al., 2009</xref>) to monitor PS1 conformation in living mice using two-photon microscopy. First, we found that GFP emission was the strongest in the 875–900 nm wavelength range, whereas RFP emission significantly decreased at &gt;800 nm excitation, with barely detectable RFP signal at 900 nm in 7 W cells expressing G-PS1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, 900 nm excitation was used in subsequent in vivo experiments. Using two different negative controls for FRET: G-PS1 (donor only) and PS1-R (acceptor only), we ensured that the emission intensity of RFP at 900 nm excitation is caused neither by GFP fluorescence bleed-through, nor by direct RFP excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, to express the G-PS1-R probe in the brains of living mice, we sub-cloned the construct into an AAV8 vector under the neuron specific human Synapsin 1 (hSyn1) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). pAAV8-hSyn1-G-PS1 (donor only) and pAAV8-hSyn1-PS1-R (acceptor only) as negative controls, and pAAV8-hSyn1-R-G fusion protein as a positive control were also generated for the FRET assay. G-PS1-R expression in neurons of the somatosensory cortex was verified by two-photon imaging using 775 nm wavelength by which both GFP and RFP were excited simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We selectively excited GFP at 900 nm, and found that the RFP/GFP (R/G) ratio was significantly higher in G-PS1-R expressing neurons than that in G-PS1 (donor only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), validating the FRET detection and establishment of the PS1 conformation assay in living mouse brain.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19720.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers the PS1/γ-secretase pathogenic conformation via PS1 phosphorylation in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the pAAV8-hSyn1-WT G-PS1-R construct.

Although it has been suggested that aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis affects Aβ production, the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations on PS1/γ-secretase function is unknown. We have recently reported that increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels induce the pathogenic change in PS1 conformation and increase the Aβ42/40 ratio in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuzuya et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the rapid and dynamic nature of the conformational changes, it is unlikely that this change is achieved through mechanisms involving transcription or reassembly of PS1 into de novo γ-secretase complexes. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear, and whether similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PS1 conformational changes occur in vivo is unknown. Our current study addresses these questions and demonstrates that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKA-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at domain 1 (T74), domain 2 (S310, S313) and domain 3 (S365, S366, S367) is responsible for the PS1/γ-secretase pathogenic conformational change in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>The high level of serines and threonines in the PS1 N-terminus and in the large hydrophilic loop region suggests that the enzymatic function of PS1 can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. It has been reported that PS1 phosphorylation at several residues enhances stability of the PS1 CT fragment that is necessary for γ-secretase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ryu et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, Matz and colleagues have identified eleven new phosphorylation sites in PS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matz et al., 2015</xref>). They showed that phosphorylation-inhibited mutations of these sites affect neither activity of the PS1/γ-secretase nor Aβ production. Our current study revealed that six amino acids: T74, S310, S313, S365, S366 and S367, all, except for S310, within the newly-discovered PS1 phosphorylation sites, are critical for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic, ‘closed’ conformation linked to increased Aβ42/40 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berezovska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Isoo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wahlster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuzuya et al., 2016</xref>). We found that the conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutants at these residues is not different from that of the WT PS1. This is consistent with the findings of unaltered Aβ42/40 ratio in cells expressing PS1 phosphorylation-inhibited mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matz et al., 2015</xref>). However, the conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibiting mutants and WT PS1 is very different in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-stimulated condition. This finding suggests that phosphorylation of PS1 at these residues as a result of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx/PKA activation underlies its conformational change.</p><p>Our data show that introducing phosphorylation-inhibited mutations within all six residues prevents the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx/PKA activation-triggered PS1 conformational change. This indicates that phosphorylation of domain 1 (T74), domain 2 (S310-S313) and domain 3 (S365-S366-S367) is important for PS1 adopting the ‘closed’ conformation. On the other hand, the results using phosphorylation-mimicking mutants revealed that phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2, though necessary, is not sufficient for the structural change of PS1. Whereas domain 3, specifically S367, is critical for PS1 achieving the ‘closed’ conformation. These results beg the questions of how domain 3 is phosphorylated and whether phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2 is involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic conformational change. Although the domain 1 and domain two phosphorylation-mimicking PS1 isoform (T74D/S310D/S313D G-PS1-R) shows the same conformation as WT G-PS1-R, PKA activators were able to induce the ‘closed’ conformation of this mutant. Therefore, we conclude that PKA is involved in phosphorylation of domain 3. We propose the following model: PKA first phosphorylates PS1 at domain 2, which leads to spatial rearrangements around domain 1, and allows its phosphorylation. This subsequently changes the local conformation around domain 3, enabling its phosphorylation by PKA. This final phosphorylation of S365-S366-S367, with S367 being most crucial, drives the pathogenic conformational alteration of the PS1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We propose that local spatial rearrangement around domain three is a key step for PKA-induced domain three phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of domain 1 and domain 2 is necessary for this to occur. This model is consistent with the finding that PKA is able to phosphorylate only S310 within domain 2 in recombinant PS1 hydrophilic loop (263–407) peptide in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fluhrer et al., 2004</xref>). We reason that lack of domain 1 in this recombinant PS1 fragment does not allow change in the local conformation around domain 3, explaining why S365-S366-S367 are not phosphorylated by PKA in this recombinant PS1. Moreover, a recent structural simulation study has demonstrated that 350–373 residues of PS1 containing domain 3, are subject to major movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Somavarapu and Kepp, 2016</xref>). It is highly likely that naturally occurring domain 1 and domain 2 phosphorylation events may trigger these local spatial rearrangements around the 350–373 residues of PS1. We confirmed that domain 1 or domain 3 phosphorylation-inhibited mutant PS1 were still able to get phosphorylated by PKA at domain 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that domain 2 is the first step of the phosphorylation. Consistently, except for domain 2, there are no known PKA substrate consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</xref>) around domain 1 or domain 3 of PS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>PS1 conformational shifts are reflected by consistent changes in the FRET efficiency, detected by both the antibody-based FLIM assay of endogenous PS1 and by spectral FRET using the G-PS1-R reporter. Of note, all FRET-based assays only report relative changes in the proximity between the fluorophores, which does not necessarily translate into comparable changes in the distance between the protein epitopes (PS1 NT-CT and NT-loop, in this case). However, regardless of which assay we use, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKA activation reliably and reproducibly increased the proximity between donor and acceptor fluorophores tagging PS1 NT-CT or NT-loop domains. This strongly suggests that we observe conformational changes in the entire PS1 molecule rather than just a change in the orientation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores.</p><p>We have also established and validated novel in vivo PS1 conformation assay. Topical KCl application significantly increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (mean = ~649 nM, ranging from 166 nM to 2793 nM) in WT mice brains, a concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> consistent with that observed in AD mouse models displaying Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in vivo (mean = ~499 nM, ranging from 162 nM to 1535 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuchibhotla et al., 2008</xref>). We verified that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induces the pathogenic ‘closed’ PS1 conformation in vivo via PS1 S365/S366/S367 phosphorylation. The cAMP-triggered PKA activation in mouse brain and consecutive conformational change of the wild type PS1 that we report confirms PKA-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at endogenous levels. More importantly, we show up-regulation of the domain 2 (S310) phosphorylation in AD brains, demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven PS1 phosphorylation at certain residues may be important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Of note, a wide distribution of the phosphorylated PS1 levels observed in AD cases did not correlate with either age or PMI. Since we have selected a relatively homogenous group of AD brains in terms of pathology, Braak and CERAD scores could not be used to explain the wide distribution. Further investigation is necessary to determine if other factors, such as medications taken, disease duration, ApoE genotype, etc. could have affected the p-PS1 levels.</p><p>We propose a positive feed-forward mechanism for the pathogenesis of AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): once AD pathology, i.e. Aβ oligomers or deposited Aβ, triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, domains 1, 2 and 3 of PS1 can be hyper-phosphorylated by PKA. This induces the pathogenic ‘closed’ PS1 conformation, and leads to subsequent elevation of the Aβ42/40 ratio, followed by accelerated Aβ oligomerization or deposition. In line with these findings, we have previously reported that PS1 shows a ‘closed’ conformation around Aβ plaques in the sporadic AD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wahlster et al., 2013</xref>), and that higher Aβ42/40 ratio leads to the pathogenic conformation of PS1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zoltowska et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that selective inhibition of PS1 phosphorylation at the domain 1, 2 and/or 3 may present a novel opportunity for therapeutics for AD. Since phosphorylation-inhibited PS1 mutations on these sites do not affect assembly, maturation, or activity of the PS1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matz et al., 2015</xref>), inhibition of these PS1 phosphorylation residues would affect neither the cleavage of Notch nor other γ-secretase substrates. On the other hand, inhibition of PKA activity may not be a suitable approach to prevent PS1 phosphorylation, due to multiple PKA substrates and potential off target effects in the brain and in the periphery. In future studies, PS1-targeting agents that selectively block PS1 phosphorylation at either one of the three residues could be identified, and their efficacy could be examined in vivo using our novel PS1 conformation assays.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19720.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered PS1 pathogenic conformational change.</title><p>The schematic image of the molecular events involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered pathogenic ‘closed’ conformational change and increase of the Aβ42/40 ratio.

Brain tissue sections were permeabilized using 0.4% TX-100. For 4% PFA fixed 7 W cells and primary neurons 0.1% TX-100 was used.

Briefly, a mode-locked Chameleon Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) set at 850 nm or 770 nm was used to excite GFP or Alexa Fluor 488 donor fluorophores, respectively. A Zeiss LSM510 microscope and x63 oil immersion objective was used for the imaging. The donor fluorophore lifetimes were recorded using a high-speed photomultiplier tube (MCP R3809; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) and a time-correlated single-photon counting acquisition board (SPC-830; Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany). The baseline lifetime (<italic>t</italic>1) of the donor fluorophore was measured in the absence of the acceptor fluorophore (negative control, FRET absent). In the presence of the acceptor fluorophore (RFP or Cy3), excitation of the donor fluorophore results in reduced donor emission energy if the donor and acceptor are less than 5–10 nm apart (FRET present). This yields characteristic shortening of the donor fluorophore lifetime (<italic>t</italic>2). The acquired FLIM data were analyzed using SPC Image software (Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany) by fitting the data to one (negative control) or two (acceptor present) exponential decay curves. In the latter case, <italic>t1</italic> of the non-FRETing population was ‘fixed’ and thus excluded from the analysis, and only shorter, <italic>t2</italic>, values were analyzed. The FRET efficiency (%E<sub>FRET</sub>) was calculated using the following equation: %E<sub>FRET</sub> = 100*(<italic>t</italic>1-<italic>t</italic>2)/<italic>t</italic>1. Higher %E<sub>FRET</sub> reflects closer proximity between fluorophores labeling the PS1 domains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spectral FRET</title><p>The spectral FRET assay with single photon excitation for the experiments using cultured cells and immunostained mouse brain sections was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uemura et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, an Argon laser at 488 nm was used to excite GFP or Alexa 488, and emitted fluorescence was detected by seven channels of the Zeiss Metadetector within the 502–651 nm or 511–682 nm wavelength range (21.4 nm spectral bandwidth for each channel) on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. Average pixel fluorescence intensity for the whole cell after subtraction of the background fluorescence was measured using Image J. The ratio of fluorescence intensity in the 598 nm channel (for RFP) to that in the 513 nm channel (for GFP) or 565 nm (Cy3) to 522 nm (Alexa 488) was used as a readout of the FRET efficiency, which reflects the relative proximity between the donor and acceptor.</p><p>The spectral FRET assay for monitoring PS1 conformation in living mouse brain using two-photon excitation is newly established. First, to determine the excitation wavelength that preferentially excites GFP, the G-PS1-R probe was excited at different wavelengths from 750 nm to 975 nm with a mode-locked titanium/sapphire laser (MaiTai; Spectra-Physics, Fremont, CA). The 900 nm wavelength was chosen to selectively excite GFP, and emitted fluorescence was detected by two emission channels: 495–540 nm range for channel 1 (for GFP) and 575–630 nm for channel 2 (for RFP), on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 MPE microscope (x20 objective, water immersion, NA = 1.05) (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Time-lapse images were obtained every 10 s for a duration of 2 min.

The authors use a series of experiments, including with biochemical and FRET experiments to systematically dissect the relationship of different phosphorylation states of the protein and its conformational properties in cells and neurons. The model that emerges is a complex one where Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered PKA activity results in sequential phosphorylation of domains 2, 1 and 3, with S367 phosphorylation being critical for change to a closed conformation. An exciting additional set of experiments directly probe FRET in vivo, supporting the developed model. Finally, an important link to disease was uncovered by the observation that the phosphorylation at S310 (domain 2) increased on average in AD brains. Overall, the work represents a strong combination of interesting tools with many important control experiments to develop a mechanistic model for how a PKA phosphorylation cascade results in PS1 conformational changes including in vivo. The obtained novel mechanistic understanding combined with the observed links of phosphorylation levels in AD suggests potential venues for therapeutic strategies. Therefore, I believe the paper would be of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Some technical issues are noted below that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) The antibody based FRET experiments need more description and discussion, at least in the Methods section.</p><p>How large are the antibodies and how are they labeled? What range of distance changes (at least approximately) are being detected? Are factors other than distance affecting the rather small changes in the reported changes in FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)? Factors such as orientational effects or changes in chromophore photophysics (less likely here) can also contribute to observed FRET efficiencies.</p><p>The changes in average reported FRET efficiencies are small. However, from the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, some portions of the neurons may have larger changes than others. Could the authors comment on this aspect and whether a more detailed analysis is possible?</p><p>2) Some of the above points are more generally relevant for the FRET studies in the paper, and authors should discuss these issues in the paper.</p><p>3) It would be useful to have a few additional images/time traces (corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) in the supplementary information for the reader's benefit.</p><p>4) The authors observe the interesting result that phosphorylation at domain 2 (S310) is increased on average in AD brains. However, in addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> lower panel indicates that there is a wider distribution of phosphorylation ranging from lower to much higher values than for controls. Authors please comment on this issue and how it affects their conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19720.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript is generally well written and the experimental execution is earnest.</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a complicated paper experimentally in the sense that it is assumed that the PS1 Ser/Thr to Ala mutations and Ser/Thr to Asp mutations have no influence other than preventing and simulating phosphorylation, respectively –the desired interpretation.

The data is certainly trending in the right direction, and significant with the selected comparisons.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern that mutations in PS1 phosphorylation sites could have changed the conformational ensemble of the PS1/γ-secretase. Thus, we have thoroughly analyzed conformation of the phosphorylation-inhibited Ser/Thr to Ala PS1 mutants and found that it is not different from that of the wild type PS1 in the basal, vehicle-treated, condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates that Ser/Thr to Ala mutations per se do not alter PS1/γ-secretase conformation. The effect of the phospho-mimicking Ser/Thr to Asp mutations, on the other hand, is more “multifaceted”, with domain 1 and domain 2 Asp mutants having no effect on PS1 conformation in the basal condition, but Ser to Asp domain 3 mutant shows the pathogenic conformation similar to that of drug-stimulated (KCl/A23187/ forskolin/cAMP) wild type PS1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, 3E</xref>). Together, this indicates that phosphorylation of PS1 at domain 3, and Ser 367 in particular, rather than mutation itself, is crucial for the pathogenic conformational change.</p><p>With regard to the small changes for individual data-plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and “smaller than typical error bars on, for example, the control measurements (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)”: First of all, we thank the reviewer for noticing this mistake and want to apologize for the oversight on our part: the graphing software generated error bars for the vehicle treated control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> equivalent to “0”, and thus shouldn’t be shown at all. The statistical difference for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was calculated based on the assumption that the mean in KCl treated cells is different from 100% (one-sample t-test). Specifically, we have performed six independent experiments of IP/Western blotting to compare the amount of phosphorylated PS1 between vehicle and KCl<sup>-</sup>treated primary neurons. To be able to pull these experiments together for the statistical analysis (and to avoid great variability in the band’s optical density due to different film exposures among different experiments), 100% was assigned to the vehicle treated sample, and the percent change in phospho-PS1 for KCl treated neurons was analyzed in each experiment. Phosphorylation is a very dynamic process and its detection can be influenced by a number of factors. However, even though the average increase in phospho-PS1 after KCl treatment was relatively small, the increase was consistent and reproducible. For the Aβ ELISA measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>),we have conducted five independent experiments, each containing n= 3 to 8 biological replicates (not just triplicates-octuplets), and thus error bars were generated for both vehicle and drug-treated samples. Again, even though the KCl<sup>-</sup>triggered Aβ42/40 ratio increase was relatively small it was consistent and significantly higher than that in control cells. The results from all trial are combined to show this.</p><p><italic>Unless I am missing something, why don't the authors use their new FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in cells, wherein the differences are easier to see and apparently are larger, as opposed to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Maybe this is typical of traditional FRET measurements, but their new FRET assay seems very promising in terms of quantifying the closed vs. open conformation. I am used to seeing histograms of closed and open FRET data, not interpreted data, but I will leave this up to the FRET experts to sort out.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgment of the great potential of the new G-PS1-R FRET probe-based assay. The assay is indeed uniquely suited for the longitudinal real-time measurements of the dynamic PS1 conformational change in live cells in vitro and in vivo. However, to measure conformational change of the endogenous PS1 in neurons, the complementary antibody-based FLIM approach is needed.</p><p>To further substantiate the interchangeable application of these two assays, we have now performed a spectral FRET assay in live neurons in vitro infected with AAV/G-PS1-R, and found that KCl treatment leads to an increase in the R/G ratio (PS1 adopts “closed” conformation), whereas the PKA inhibitor KT5720 blocks this effect (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result matches closely the results from the antibody-based FLIM assay monitoring changes in endogenous PS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>I want to know more about KT5720, the pharmacologic PKA inhibitor-its selectivity, potency, etc. This is critical for me to get comfortable with publishing this paper. I want to see a second line of evidence to support the authors hypothesis (i.e. in addition to the PS1 Ser/Thr to Ala mutations and Ser/Thr to Asp mutations). If this inhibitor is selective, it seems that this is the most unassailable data in the paper to show via the suite of experiments in several cell lines and ideally in mouse brain that inhibitor pre-treatment prevents pathogenic collapse of PS1 and prevents altering the Abeta ratio associated with pathology, in the presence of triggered calcium increases.

If the pharmacologic data is not possible to generate, then this type of data becomes central as a second line of evidence.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that having PKA-selective inhibitor(s) would provide truly unassailable data. Unfortunately, it is practically impossible to have a pharmacological reagent that is 100% selective. KT5720 has been reported/used in almost 1000 studies as a selective PKA inhibitor. Still, according to the review by Andrew Murry, (2008, Sci Signal), KT5720 may inhibit some other kinases as well, although to a lesser degree. Thus, we have tested several reported inhibitors of other kinases (i.e., <italic>JNK</italic>, PKC, and GSK3β) and found that unlike KT5720 inhibition of PKA, inhibition of these kinases was not able to prevent the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PS1 conformational change(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further corroborate the conclusion of the involvement of PKA, we have also used a different “preferred” PKA inhibitor, H-89, and two different PKA activators, forskolin and 8-Bromo-cAMP, and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that the observed effect of phosphorylation on PS1 conformational change is PKA-mediated.</p><p>However, to further address the reviewer’s concern about selective PKA role, and to verify the results from pharmacological manipulation, we have performed additional experiments using a different, “genetic”, approach: expression of the dominant negative form of the PKA regulatory subunit α. We found that both the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PS1 conformational change and PS1 S310 phosphorylation are significantly inhibited by the expression of the dominant negative PKA mutant vs. empty vector control in 7W CHO cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Based on all the data, we cannot fully exclude that other kinase(s) may also contribute to the PS1 conformation-inducing phosphorylation, however we are confident that activation of PKA is involved.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to expand our experiments to “several cell lines and ideally mouse brain”. We have performed the FLIM analysis in 7W line (CHO cells), and show that both PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H-89, inhibit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-induced PS1 conformational change (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is consistent with the results in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, to verify the physiological relevance of the PKA-inhibition in mouse brain and to determine if KT5720 pre-treatment would prevent the cAMP-induced “pathogenic collapse of PS1”, we injected 1µl of 100 µM KT5720 inhibitor or vehicle control into the somatosensory cortex. 75 minutes post-injection, 1µl of 100 mM 8-Bromo-cAMP, a direct PKA activator, was delivered to the same brain region for 5 minutes. Mice were quickly euthanized, the brain was removed, fixed, sectioned, and ex-vivospectral FRET analysis of endogenous PS1 conformation was performed. We found that KT5720 prevents the 8-Bromo-cAMP-induced PS1 “closed” conformational change in mouse brain in vivo (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The inhibitory effect of KT5720 on PKA activity has been verified by immunostaining for PKA specific substrate, phospho-CREB (S133), in adjacent mouse brain sections (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: […] 1) The antibody based FRET experiments need more description and discussion, at least in the Methods section.</italic> </p><p><italic>How large are the antibodies and how are they labeled? What range of distance changes (at least approximately) are being detected? Are factors other than distance affecting the rather small changes in the reported changes in FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)? Factors such as orientational effects or changes in chromophore photophysics (less likely here) can also contribute to observed FRET efficiencies.</italic> </p><p><italic>The changes in average reported FRET efficiencies are small. However, from the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, some portions of the neurons may have larger changes than others. Could the authors comment on this aspect and whether a more detailed analysis is possible?</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Some of the above points are more generally relevant for the FRET studies in the paper, and authors should discuss these issues in the paper.</italic> </p><p>Per reviewer’s request we provided more details for the antibody-based FRET assays in the Material and methods of the revised manuscript. We appreciate and agree with the reviewer’s concern about large complexes of the primary + fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. However, the great advantage of using the antibody-based FRET assay is the ability to monitor changes in the proximity between endogenous PS1/γ-secretase domains. We are aware that all FRET-based assays only report relative changes in the proximity between fluorophores tagging these domains, which does not directly translate into comparable changes in the distance between the protein epitopes (PS1 NT and CT, in this case). Nevertheless, both spectral FRET and FLIM assays we used have proven to be highly reliable and reproducible in reporting consistent changes in the FRET efficiency (reflecting PS1 conformational changes) after experimental treatments.</p><p>However, to further substantiate the findings we have also used our previously validated GFP-PS1-RFP FRET reporter probe (Uemura et al., 2009, Plos One) to monitor PS1 conformational change in real time in live cells in vitro and in vivo. In the G-PS1-R probe, donor and acceptor fluorophores are fused to the PS1 NT and cytosolic loop, respectively, reporting relative change in the GFP-NT to RFP-loop proximity.</p><p>Regardless of which assay we used, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKA activation consistently increases the proximity between donor and acceptor fluorophores tagging PS1 NT and CT in the antibody-based FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>,new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>)or PS1 NT and Loop domain in the G-PS1-R probe-based FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>,new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and 1D</xref>). This indicates that the antibody-based FRET assay reliably reflects PS1 conformational change. Moreover, since increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> shortens both the PS1 NT-CT and PS1 NT-loop proximity, we believe we observe conformational change in the entire PS1 molecule rather than just a change in the orientation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. Thus, whether it is KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) or A23187 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1A, 1D</xref>) or PKA activation by forskolin and cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, 3C and 3E</xref>), and whether it is spectral FRET or the FLIM assay, we consistently see increases in the FRET efficiency reflecting increased proximity between phosphorylated PS1 domains –&gt; PS1 adopting a “closed” conformation.</p><p>The average reported change in FRET efficiency is ~10-20% by spectral FRET vs. 30-50% by FLIM (more sensitive detection as it is fluorophore concentration independent). Even though the change in the proximity between fluorophores may be a relatively small, it could signal substantial conformational change on the molecular level that would affect PS1/γ-secretase function.</p><p>In regard to the range of the distance changes: Since in our GFP-PS1-RFP conformational reporter probe donor and acceptor are in the 1:1 ratio, and the Förster radius of the RFP-GFP pair is known (5.7 Å) (Shcherbo et al., 2009, BMC Biotechno), we could translate the FRET signal into the change in the distance between GFP and RFP by using the following equation: d= 5.7 x [1/(1-t2/t1) -1]^(1/6) (with t1 and t2 being donor fluorophore lifetimes in the absence and presence of the FRET acceptor, respectively). The GFP-NT/RFP-loop distance is approximately 70 Å in the vehicle-treated condition. Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation (A23187, KCl) leads to the average per neuron change in the ~3~4.5 Å range.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that some areas in neurons show higher FRET efficiency than others, which could be due to local differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration or in PKA distribution. A combination of the PS1 conformational assay and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging or PKA staining in the same cell could provide more detailed mechanistic insight. However, since both rely on the fluorescent labeling/detection, our experience shows that the presence of the third fluorophore may interfere with the reliability of the FRET detection in cells.</p><p><italic>3) It would be useful to have a few additional images/time traces (corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) in the supplementary information for the reader's benefit.</italic> </p><p>Per the reviewer’s request we have included additional images/time traces in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors observe the interesting result that phosphorylation at domain 2 (S310) is increased on average in AD brains. However, in addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> lower panel indicates that there is a wider distribution of phosphorylation ranging from lower to much higher values than for controls. Authors please comment on this issue and how it affects their conclusions.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, a wide distribution in the level of PS1 S310 phosphorylation was revealed in AD brains. It is possible thatbroad phospho-PS1distribution could be result of the phosphorylation dyshomeostasis in the distressed AD brains (i.e. over activation/inhibition of kinases/phosphatases). There are so many factors that are difficult to control or monitor (or simply have all information unavailable) when analyze human brain samples, such as individual progress of the disease, past medical history, medications, or even lifestyles, etc. All of these could contribute to broader variability in AD brain.</p><p>All AD and control cases we used in this study were matched as best as possible by the subject’s age and post-mortem interval (PMI). We have also selected a relatively homogenous group of AD patients in terms of pathology (almost all cases are B&amp;B VI and CERAD C). Since the original submission of the manuscript we have analyzed more AD and Control cases, bringing the total number to n=20 Controls and n=23 AD. The wide distribution of phospho-PS1 among AD, but not Control, cases still remains. Having higher “n” allowed us to do correlation analysis with the available data. We found that neither age nor PMI affect the level of PS1 phosphorylation (updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer raised the interesting question that warrants further investigation of the different influencing factors (e.g., ApoE genotype, disease duration/age of onset, etc.) that may shed light on variations in the PS1 S310 phosphorylation level between different AD subjects. Unfortunately, such data were only available for a very few of the AD cases used in this study, and thus cannot be included in this manuscript. Since the main focus of the current study is on the molecular mechanism of the pathogenic PS1 conformational change, a different follow up epidemiological study that will select a different set and significantly higher number of AD and Control cases with more complete clinical data would be needed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
