coli</italic> and evades the host restriction/modification system. The Ocr protein of T7 was shown to exist as a dimer mimicking DNA and to bind to host restriction enzymes, thus preventing the degradation of the viral genome by the host. Here we report that Ocr can also inhibit host transcription by directly binding to bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and competing with the recruitment of RNAP by sigma factors. Using cryo electron microscopy, we determined the structures of Ocr bound to RNAP. The structures show that an Ocr dimer binds to RNAP in the cleft, where key regions of sigma bind and where DNA resides during transcription synthesis, thus providing a structural basis for the transcription inhibition. Our results reveal the versatility of Ocr in interfering with host systems and suggest possible strategies that could be exploited in adopting DNA mimicry as a basis for forming novel antibiotics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria and viruses have long been fighting amongst themselves. Bacteriophages are a type of virus that invade bacteria; their name literally means ‘bacteria eater’. The bacteriophage T7, for example, infects the common bacteria known as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Once inside, the virus hijacks the bacterium’s cellular machinery, using it to replicate its own genetic material and make more copies of the virus so it can spread. At the same time, the bacteria have found ways to try and defend themselves, which in turn has led some bacteriophages to develop countermeasures to overcome those defences.</p><p>Many bacteria, for example, have restriction enzymes which recognise certain sections of the bacteriophage DNA and cut it into fragments. However, the T7 bacteriophage has one well-known protein called Ocr which inhibits restriction enzymes. Ocr does this by mimicking DNA, which led Ye et al. to wonder if it could also interrupt other vital processes in a bacterial cell that involve DNA.</p><p>Transcription is the first step in a coordinated process that turns the genetic information stored in a cell’s DNA into useful proteins. An enzyme called RNA polymerase decodes the DNA sequence into a go-between molecule called messenger RNA, and it was here that Ye et al. thought Ocr might jump in to interfere.</p><p>To begin, Ye et al. examined the structure of Ocr when it binds to RNA polymerase using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy. Ocr has been well-studied before, its structure previously described, but not when attached to RNA polymerase. The analysis showed that Ocr gets in the way of specific molecules, called sigma factors, that show RNA polymerase where to start transcription. Ocr binds to RNA polymerase in exactly the same pocket as part of sigma factors do, which is also the place where DNA must be to be decoded to make messenger RNA. Ye et al. then performed experiments to show Ocr interfering with binding to RNA polymerase did indeed disrupt transcription. This means Ocr is quite versatile as it interferes with the RNA polymerase of the bacterial host and its restriction enzymes.</p><p>Ocr’s strategy of mimicking DNA to interrupt transcription could be adopted as an approach to develop new antibiotics to stop bacterial infections. DNA transcription is an essential cellular process – without it, no cell can replicate and survive – and RNA polymerase is already a validated target for drugs. Following Ocr’s lead could provide a new way to stop infections, if the right drug can be designed to fit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ocr</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>DNA mimicry proteins</kwd><kwd>RNAP</kwd><kwd>cryo EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N007816/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Fuzhou</given-names></name><name><surname>Jovanovic</surname><given-names>Milija</given-names></name><name><surname>Buck</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaojiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA mimicry Ocr protein, a well-studied T7 phage protein that inhibits host restriction enzymes, can also inhibit host transcription through competing with sigma factors in binding to RNA polymerase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteriophage T7 infects <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and hijacks the host cellular machinery to replicate its genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Studier, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger and Schroeder, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann and Messerschmid, 1988</xref>). The T7 genome encodes 56 proteins with many functioning as structural proteins for the bacteriophage. A number of T7 proteins are known to specifically inhibit the bacterial cellular machinery. For example, proteins gp0.7, gp2 and gp5.7 inhibit cellular transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cámara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tabib-Salazar et al., 2018</xref>) whereas gp0.3 inhibits restriction/modification (RM) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Studier, 1975</xref>).</p><p>Gp0.3 is the first T7 gene expressed after infection and T7 variants lacking gene 0.3 were shown to have genomes susceptible to <italic>E. coli</italic> RM systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Studier, 1975</xref>). Subsequently the 117 amino acid protein gp0.3 was named Overcome Classical Restriction (Ocr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger and Schroeder, 1981</xref>). Ocr is abundantly expressed and forms a dimer that mimics the structure of a slightly bent 20 base pair B-form DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Issinger and Hausmann, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walkinshaw et al., 2002</xref>) and blocks the DNA binding grooves of the type I RM enzyme, preventing the degradation and modification of the T7 genome by the host. Intriguingly, Type I RM enzymes are present in very low numbers (estimated at ~60 molecules per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelleher and Raleigh, 1994</xref>]). Since Ocr is a DNA mimicry protein, it is possible that the abundantly expressed Ocr (estimated to be several hundreds of molecules per cell at least) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann and Messerschmid, 1988</xref>) also interferes with other DNA processing systems of the host. Indeed early evidence of an interaction between Ocr and the host RNA polymerase (RNAP) was obtained using pull-down affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ratner, 1974</xref>).</p><p>RNA polymerase is the central enzyme for transcription, which is a highly controlled process and can be regulated at numerous distinct functional stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decker and Hinton, 2013</xref>). The large majority of transcription regulation, however, is executed at the recruitment and initiation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning and Busby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browning and Busby, 2016</xref>). To ensure transcription specificity, bacterial RNAP relies on sigma (σ) factors to recognise gene-specific promoter regions. <italic>E. coli</italic> has seven sigma factors which can be grouped into two classes, the σ<sup>70</sup> class represented by σ<sup>70</sup>, responsible for transcribing housekeeping genes, and the σ<sup>54</sup> class, responsible for transcribing stress-induced genes including phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feklístov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browning and Busby, 2016</xref>). Much work has yielded a detailed mechanistic understanding of how transcription directed by σ<sup>70</sup> and σ<sup>54</sup> is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glyde et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the two large RNAP subunits β and β’ form a crab claw structure that encloses the DNA binding cleft, accommodating the transcription bubble and the downstream double-stranded (ds) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Inhibiting host transcription is widely exploited by bacteriophages including T7 on <italic>E. coli</italic> and P23-45 on <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabib-Salazar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ooi et al., 2018</xref>). Gp0.7, gp2 and gp5.7 of T7 were shown to inhibit bacterial RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cámara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabib-Salazar et al., 2017</xref>). Gp0.7 is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP-σ<sup>70</sup>, resulting in transcription termination at sites located between the early and middle genes on the T7 genome, gp2 specifically inhibits σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent transcription initiation and gp5.7 inhibits σ<sup>S</sup>, responsible for stationary phase adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tabib-Salazar et al., 2018</xref>). Two proteins gp39 and gp76 of bacteriophage P23-45 were shown to inhibit <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ooi et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, RNAP is a validated antibacterial target and novel inhibitors of RNAP hold promise for potential new antibiotic development against antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Srivastava et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we investigate the potential effects of Ocr on the host transcriptional machinery. Our results with purified components show that Ocr can bind to RNAP and inhibit both σ<sup>70</sup> and σ<sup>54</sup> dependent transcription. Specifically we establish that an Ocr competes with sigma binding, thus affecting recruitment and can inhibit transcription both in vitro and in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells when over-expressed. Using structural biology, we show that the Ocr dimer directly binds to RNAP at the RNAP cleft, where sigma factors and the transcription bubble bind, suggesting that Ocr interferes with transcription recruitment by competing with sigma factor binding, and could also interfere with transcription initiation. Our work thus reveals the detailed molecular mechanisms of how Ocr could potentially affect the host through inhibiting transcription in addition to its role in knocking out host restriction and modification. These new structural details of RNAP-Ocr complexes allow comparisons with known transcription initiation complexes and other phage proteins suggesting new avenues to be exploited for inhibiting bacterial transcription and combating antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ocr interacts with RNAP with high affinity</title><p>An early study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ratner (1974)</xref> showed that upon T7 infection, Ocr protein was detected in pull-down experiments using host RNAP as bait, suggesting that Ocr could associate with the host transcriptional machinery. To assess if Ocr can engage with RNAP directly, we carried out in vitro interaction studies using purified components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that purified Ocr co-eluted with RNAP in gel filtration experiments, suggesting a tight interaction of RNAP and Ocr sufficient to withstand the lengthy elution time of the complex during chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The complex persisted for the order of minutes during chromatography, suggesting a stable complex. To quantify the interactions, we carried out binding experiments between RNAP and Ocr using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Our results show the binding affinity (dissociation constant, Kd) is in the order of 10 nM, similar to that of RNAP with sigma factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). These results thus confirm the basis for the RNAP-Ocr interaction originally observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ratner, 1974</xref>). Our observed affinity of Ocr for RNAP is about three orders of magnitude lower than the values reported for the association of Ocr with the EcoKI type I restriction modification enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atanasiu et al., 2002</xref>) as would be expected if the type I RM enzyme was the primary target for Ocr.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNAP interacts with Ocr and can form a stable complex with Ocr.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel filtration chromatography profiles of RNAP (green), Ocr (blue) and RNAP-Ocr complex (orange).

After several rounds of 2D classification, which allowed us to remove ice contaminations, very large particles or particles much smaller than RNAP, the remaining particles were subject to 3D classifications using the structure of the RNAP filtered to 60 Å as an initial model (PDB code 6GH5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two classes with clear density for Ocr were refined to a global resolution 3.7 and 3.8 Å respectively although the quality is not uniform in the reconstruction, as demonstrated in the resolution distribution. Two resolution zones seem to be evident, around 3–4 Å and around 7–8 Å, reflecting the structural features of the complex (some domains are mobile) and partly due to preferential orientations of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The RNAP clamp is highly dynamic and single-molecule Forster Resonant Energy Transfer data have shown that the RNAP clamp adapts a range of conformations from closed to open involving more than 20 Å movement and 20<sup>o</sup> rotation of the clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2012</xref>).

In one structure, the entire Ocr dimer inserts deeply into the RNAP cleft, occupying the full RNAP nucleic acid binding channel including where the transcription bubble and the downstream DNA resides in the transcriptional open and transcribing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In this structure, the Ocr dimer inserts into the RNAP channel and each of the two Ocr subunits, which we term proximal and distal, and makes distinct interactions with RNAP. The proximal subunit is deeply embedded in the RNAP cleft and occupies the space for the template strand DNA, the complementary newly synthesised RNA and the non-template strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, magenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glyde et al., 2018</xref>]). The distal Ocr subunit occupies the position of the downstream DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, yellow). The negatively charged surface of the proximal Ocr complements the highly positively charged surface of the surrounding RNAP and fits snugly into the channel formed by β and β’ subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). The distal Ocr subunit mimics the downstream DNA in its interactions with the β’ clamp. Superposition of the β’ clamp in the RNAP-Ocr structure with that of initial transcribing complex shows the distal Ocr monomer aligns with downstream dsDNA in the initial transcribing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the Ocr dimer has a rigid conformation that resembles a bent B-DNA. Consequently, in order to maintain the interactions between both Ocr subunits and RNAP, the β’ clamp has to open up (to ~58 Å in RNAP-Ocr from ~35 Å in RPo) to accommodate the Ocr dimer compared to RPo that accommodates a transcriptional bubble and dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In the narrow clamp mode, the proximal Ocr subunit interacts with the β’ clamp, again mimicking downstream DNA in RPo although the clamp is more open (~45 Å) compared to that in RPo (~35 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Interestingly, although an Ocr monomer surface mimics that of a dsDNA in the overall dimension and the negative charge distributions, the Ocr subunit in the narrow clamp structure does not exactly overlay with the downstream dsDNA in RPo when RNAP is aligned on its bridge helix, the highly conserved structural feature that is close to the active centre and connects β and β’ clamps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Instead Ocr is shifted upwards compared to the dsDNA in RPo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Inspecting the structures of Ocr and RNAP explain the differences. The downstream binding channel of RNAP consists of β and β’ clamps on two sides and the β’ jaw domain as a base, providing a positively charged environment on three sides, required to accommodate and engage with the negatively charged DNA during transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although an Ocr monomer has a largely negatively charged surface, there are also positively charged patches on the Ocr surface, especially those facing the β’ jaw domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In order to maintain the interactions between Ocr and the β’ clamp and to overcome charge repulsions with the β’ jaw, the β’ clamp is opened up, shifting Ocr upwards and away from the jaw domain.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Detailed interactions between RNAP and Ocr in the ‘narrow-clamp’ conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two orthogonal views of RNAP-Ocr narrow-clamp structure (RNAP shows as surface and Ocr shows as cartoon (magenta and yellow), overlaid with σ<sup>70</sup> open complex structure (PDB code 6CA0).

The very tight binding between Ocr and Type I RM enzymes ensures complete inhibition of restriction and modification. It would appear from our data that the excess Ocr molecules could then start the process of shutting down host transcription by binding to any non-transcribing RNAP. An earlier study by McAllister and Barrett used host strains lacking the host restriction systems, thus eliminating the effects of Ocr on host restriction enzymes. They showed that expression of gp0.3 (Ocr) resulted in a delayed inhibition of host β-galactosidase synthesis and delayed inhibition of total RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McAllister and Barrett, 1977</xref>). This inhibitory effect is consistent with our studies here showing that Ocr can inhibit host transcription. Since Ocr is expressed by host RNAP, it thus takes time for a sufficient amount of Ocr to be synthesized by the host, resulting in the delayed response. Indeed, Ocr could bind to free RNAP and/or potentially compete with host σ<sup>70</sup> which are in the range of hundreds of molecules per cell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pax-db.org/dataset/511145/137/">https://pax-db.org/dataset/511145/137/</ext-link>), since their binding affinities to RNAP are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) and Ocr can compete with σ<sup>70</sup> for RNAP binding and promoter DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, when Ocr and gp1.1 (a small protein with unknown function) were both expressed, the host protein synthesis was shutdown effectively, suggesting that gp1.1 and Ocr might have complementary/synergetic effects.</p><p>The bifunctionality observed in Ocr may also be shared by other DNA mimic proteins. For example, the phage T4 Arn protein targeting the McrBC restriction enzyme also has weak interaction with histone-like protein H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2014</xref>). Arn is very similar in shape to Ocr but since T4 requires the host RNAP throughout its life cycle it is unlikely to target RNAP as strongly as Ocr. Additional functions may also exist for other DNA mimics like phage λ Gam protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilkinson et al., 2016</xref>) and the recently discovered anti-CRISPR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

However, due to the extensive positively charged surface within RNAP, the binding is not specific. Indeed, two distinct binding modes have been detected which allow either the proximal or distal Ocr monomer to interact with the positively charged β’ clamp. The RNAP clamp opens up in the ‘wide clamp’ binding mode in order to accommodate the Ocr dimer conformation while maintaining the charge complementarity, both deep inside the cleft and with the β’ clamp. When the clamp is closed as in the transcriptional open complex, even though there is ample space to accommodate one Ocr subunit, the charge repulsion between the β’ jaw domain and the Ocr surface results in the opening of the β’ clamp, thus shifting Ocr upwards and away from the β’ jaw domain. These structures demonstrate that the structural flexibility of RNAP clamp plays a key role in its ability to accommodate Ocr. A study of the kinetics of the formation of the complexes between Ocr and RNAP would be interesting and may show multiple consecutive reactions as found for the interaction of a small DNA mimic Uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) with uracil glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The interactions and structures of Ocr with RNAP observed here suggest that Ocr could potentially interact and inhibit other DNA processing enzymes through a series of non-specific interactions with dsDNA binding sites/channels. However, the rigidity and the bent conformation of the Ocr dimer imposes constraints on the binding sites, which are optimised for the RM enzymes it inhibits but can still be accommodated by the structurally flexible RNAP DNA binding channel. The rigidity of the dimer is defined by the interactions between the Ocr subunits. Work presented here suggests that Ocr could be modified to fine-tune its DNA mimicry for binding to specific DNA processing proteins, either by reducing the rigidity of the dimer or changing the bend angle to create a new dimer interface. DNA mimicry has been proposed as a potential effective therapeutic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Putnam and Tainer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dryden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>), Ocr could thus be exploited to create specific variants that can target specific DNA binding proteins, especially those that are shown to be antibiotic targets. In addition, our data here show that Ocr can effectively inhibit transcription under stress conditions when transcriptional activity is reduced. It is thus possible that during other growth conditions/phases, such as stationary phases or persistence, Ocr could be effectively utilised to inhibit transcription and thus diminish bacterial survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNAP-Ocr complex formation</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase was purified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). As well as being purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sturrock et al., 2001</xref>), Ocr was ligated into pOPINF vector with a N-terminal His-tag. Three purification steps (Ni-NTA affinity, Heparin, and Gel filtration chromatography) were employed, which generated homogeneous Ocr protein as judged by SDS-PAGE gel. The RNAP-Ocr complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography. Initially RNAP (final concentration 14.5 µM) and Ocr (all Ocr concentrations are for the dimeric form, final concentration 58.0 µM) were mixed at a 1:4 molar ratio in a 150 µl reaction volume and the mixture (150 µl) was incubated on ice for 30 mins before being loaded onto the gel filtration column with a flowrate of 0.3 ml/min (Superose 6 10/300, GE Healthcare) and eluted in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and the presence of Ocr was confirmed by Western blot against the His-tag.

In all cases hydrophobic treated capillaries were used. σ<sup>54</sup>, σ<sup>54-</sup><sub>R336A</sub> and σ<sup>70</sup> were purified to homogeneity similarly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nechaev and Severinov, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). σ<sup>54-</sup><sub>R336A</sub> and σ<sup>70</sup> holoenyzme were individually produced with gel filtration chromatography by mixing RNAP and σ with 1:4 molar ratio and incubating on ice for half an hour before loading to superpose 6 10/300 column.</p><p>Ocr, σ<sup>54</sup>, and σ<sup>70</sup>, σ<sup>54-</sup><sub>R336A</sub> -RNAP holoenzyme and σ<sup>70</sup>-RNAP holoenzyme were all His tagged and labelled with the kit (Monolith His-Tag Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA 2nd Generation) separately. The labelled Ocr and sigma factors were diluted to a concentration of 50 nM and mixed with an equal volume of a serial dilution series of RNAP incubated at room temperature for 20 min before loading into MST capillaries thus giving a final concentration of 25 nM for Ocr and the sigma factors in the direct titration of RNAP. For Ocr competitive binding with σ<sup>70</sup> holoenzyme, 50 nM of his-labeled σ<sup>70</sup> holoenzyme, diluted in MST-binding buffer, was mixed with equal volumes of a dilution series of Ocr in MST-binding buffer. For DNA with holoenzyme binding affinity, linear promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</xref>) was used σ<sup>70</sup> and a<italic> nifH</italic> promoter with mismatch DNA between -10 and -1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glyde et al., 2018</xref>) was used. 40 nm of his-tagged holoenzyme was mixed with equal volumes of a dilution series of DNA in MST-binding buffer. MST experiments were performed using 70–100% LED power and 40–60% MST power with a wait time of 5 s, laser on time of 30 s and a back-diffusion time of 5 s. For all the binding experiments (Ocr or σ with RNAP, or DNA with holoenzyme), MST data were analysed using Grafit 3.0 (Erithacus Software) and the data were fitted with a quadratic tight binding equation with the concentration of the constituent being titrated kept constant in the fitting process. The dissociation constants obtained are maximum values and the real values are likely to be rather smaller. This is due to the concentration of the protein being titrated being larger than the dissociation constant. In the competitive binding experiment with Ocr and σ<sup>70</sup>-RNAP holoenzyme, the data were fitted using the tight binding equation to determine the apparent dissociation constant. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CryoEM sample preparation</title><p>For structural studies using cryoEM, the His-tag of Ocr was cleaved and the purification procedure was as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sturrock et al., 2001</xref>). The complex was formed as described above. The RNAP-Ocr complex sample was concentrated to 0.6 mg/ml and 3.5 µl of the complex was applied to R2/2 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil). The vitrification process was performed using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4°C and 95% humidity, blotted for 1.5 s with blotting force −6.

The picked particles were then extracted into boxes of 256 × 256 pixels. Initial 2D classification of the data was carried out in Cryosparc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) to remove junk particles due to ice contamination or other defects on the grids. Subsequent image processing was carried out in Relion 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Briefly, the particles were separated using 3D classification. Three out of five classes were subsequently refined using the RNAP from the closed complex RPc (EMD-3695) filtered to 60 Å as the initial reference map. The remaining two classes were discarded due to their lack of clear structural features, probably derived from particles that are of poor quality. After combining the remaining three classes and refinement, one more round of focused 3D classification by applying a mask was carried out to separate different complexes or conformations. To generate the mask, structural models of RNAP and Ocr were first fitted into the refined 3D reconstruction. Ocr and the surrounding RNAP clamp regions were then used to calculate a volume in Chimera. Two classes with clearly different conformations of RNAP and both with Ocr bound, were refined, polished and post-processed (with masking and sharpening), resulting in the final reconstructions at 3.7 Å (for the wide clamp RNAP-Ocr) and 3.8 Å (for the narrow clamp RNAP-Ocr) based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) at 0.143 criterion. The directional FSC analysis and histogram of directional resolution were performed using the 3D-FSC server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://3dfsc.salk.edu/">3dfsc.salk.edu</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Model building, refinement and structural analysis</title><p>The RNAP from RPo (PDB code: 6GH5) and RPip (PDB code: 6GH6) was used as an initial model for the model building of narrow clamp and wide clamp reconstructions, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies showed that bacteriophage T7 gp0.3 (Ocr) overcomes host restriction by serving as a molecular mimic of double-stranded DNA that binds to, and inhibits, host type I restriction endonucleases. Early work had also suggested that Ocr may interact with host RNAP. The results in this manuscript confirm that Ocr interacts with host RNAP and show that Ocr inhibits transcription by host RNAP by disrupting interactions with both σ factor and DNA interactions. The authors determine structures of RNAP-Ocr complexes, which show that Ocr interacts with the RNAP DNA binding determinants by serving as a molecular mimic of DNA and suggest Ocr disrupts RNAP-σ and RNAP-DNA interactions through steric clash. The findings provide a striking example of protein function through structural mimicry of DNA. In addition, the results may provide an example of dual-targeted regulation – namely, a bacteriophage regulator that may functionally inhibit both host type I restriction endonucleases and host RNAP.</p><p>Overall the structural work itself is of significant interest but requires substantial revision in terms of presentation. The part of the manuscript on mechanism is weaker but could be improved substantially with revisions (detailed below). The main weakness of the manuscript is that it does not sufficiently address to what extent the observed interaction of Ocr with RNAP is biologically relevant for bacteriophage T7 virulence, and how its functional importance compares to Ocr's interaction with type I restriction enzymes. The reviewers suggest that additional experiments addressing functional relevance is within the scope of the manuscript and are desirable but not essential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I) Presentation of structural studies:</p><p>1) A broad issue concerning the presentation of the structural results is the overall focus on comparing Ocr-RNAP complexes with σ<sup>54</sup>-holoenzyme complexes since functional relevance of Ocr inhibition of σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription is extremely unlikely. The reviewers agree that it's important to show the relationship between binding modes of Ocr in the Ocr-RNAP structures and binding modes of DNA in transcription initiation complexes, but that should be done with σ<sup>70</sup>-RNAP structures (which are all available). The presentation here makes it appear that phage-mediated inhibition of σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription is a central component of phage infection, which is almost certainly not the case. The figures and data concerning Ocr inhibition of σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription should be removed and/or moved to the supplement. These changes concern (although may not be limited to):</p><p>Figure 2C should show σ<sup>70</sup>-RPo complex, not σ<sup>54</sup>-RPo (6GH5).</p><p>Figure 4 should use a σ<sup>70</sup>-RPo, not σ<sup>54</sup>-RPo.</p><p>Data presented in Figure 6D, E – possibly irrelevant.</p><p>Data presented in Figure 7A, C – possibly irrelevant.</p><p>Data presented in Figure 8A – possibly irrelevant.</p><p>2) It is surprising that the authors did not compare the Ocr dimer structures in their cryo-EM maps with previously published Ocr structures, both in isolation and bound to EcoKI. Such a comparison, as well as of the interactions of Ocr with RNAP and EcoKI, is warranted at least as a comment in the main text, if not in a figure.</p><p>3) There are many issues regarding the figures and presentation of structural and mechanistic data. These are detailed below (Figure revisions).</p><p>II) Studies of Ocr inhibition mechanism:</p><p>1) The data on transcription inhibition in uninfected cells engineered to overproduce Ocr (Figure 5) is relatively uninformative and should be removed.</p><p>2) Figure 6, presenting confusing 'reaction schematics' and gel images for 44 different assays and conditions should be replaced by bar graphs with error bars, presenting the most important assays and conditions.</p><p>3) The in vitro transcription experiments of Figure 6 were performed with fully duplex promoter DNAs, while the gel shifts and competition experiments of Figure 7C and 7D are done with promoter DNAs that have mismatch transcription bubbles – that explains why Ocr reduces in vitro transcription from 100 to 39%, but in 7D (for example), there is no decrease in open complex formation whatsoever. It’s not clear why the experiments were done this way – the gel shift/competition experiments with mismatch promoters aren't really very informative of anything. These experiments should be removed or repeated with relevant DNA templates (i.e. fully duplex).</p><p>4) The text describing the Ocr inhibition mechanism could be shortened.</p><p>III) Biological relevance of inhibition of RNAP function by Ocr to T7 phage virulence:</p><p>The weakest part of the manuscript is the proposal that Ocr functionally inhibits host RNAP during infection by bacteriophage T7 – i.e., the proposal that inhibition of host RNAP by OCR occurs during, and is important for, infection by bacteriophage T7. This proposal should be either: (1) tempered with strong caveats, or (2) bolstered by additional experimental data. One experiment that potentially could be performed quickly would be to compare burst sizes for infection of host cells lacking type I restriction endonucleases (available commercially) with bacteriophage T7 derivatives having or lacking the gene encoding Ocr; If the authors proposal is true, there should be measurable differences in burst sizes. The reviewers strongly encourage, but do not absolutely require, the authors to attempt to compare burst sizes of ocr+ and ocr= T7 phage in hosts strains lacking type I restriction.</p><p>Figure Revisions:</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>1) In A, there are two peaks of the RNAP-Ocr complex eluting between 40-57 ml. Do the authors know what the difference is between the complexes in both peaks? Which peak was used for structural studies?</p><p>2) In C, it is unclear why the RNAP-Ocr complex is loaded twice in the western blot. What's the difference between both lanes?</p><p>3) In D-E, the authors use EC50 and Kd interchangeably. To avoid confusion, the authors should be consistent and refer to Kd. Moreover, considering the labeled ligand in these experiments is at 25 nM concentration and the Kd for the interactions is in a similar concentration range, the binding measurements are performed under conditions of RNAP depletion (i.e. the free concentration of RNAP does not equal the concentration of added RNAP for each data point). If the authors cannot use ligand concentration 10-fold below the Kd for technical reasons, they should use a binding model that accounts for this change in free RNAP concentration or at least acknowledge that the reported Kds are higher than the true Kds.</p><p>4) The authors also state that Ocr is much more abundant in T7 infected cells than type I restriction enzymes, arguing that the additional Ocr molecules interact with PNAP. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the intracellular concentration of Ocr compared to σ factors and whether these are in a range where Ocr can effectively compete with σ factors for binding to RNAP.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>5) Should be revised to compare Ocr-RNAP binding with σ<sup>70</sup>-holoenzyme transcription initiation complexes.</p><p>6) For non-experts, it is not easily evident where the template and non-template DNA strands, as well as the RNA, are located in the structure. The authors should consider coloring these elements differently (also in Figure 3).</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1:</p><p>7) The authors used focused 3D classification but do not explain how the masks were generated. A description should be included in the Materials and methods section, and it would be useful to also show the masks used in the figure.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2:</p><p>8) A and B, the particle orientation distributions are far from isotropic, the effect of this on the FSC curves should be assessed with directional FSC plots (https://3dfsc.salk.edu/). Some of the density maps shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 may suffer from this.</p><p>9) In A and B, the display threshold for rendering the EM volumes seems too low. Increasing the threshold will likely help to bring out the secondary structure features that should be easily identifiable at this resolution but are not well visible in the representations shown in the figures.</p><p>10) In D, what's the difference between both half-map FSCs? Presumably one map was used for model refinement and the other as control, but it is not clear which is which.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 3:</p><p>11) The authors state that many side chain densities are resolved in the map, but this is not well visible in panel C.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>12) Should be revised to compare Ocr-RNAP binding with σ<sup>70</sup>-holoenzyme transcription initiation complexes.</p><p>13) The authors state in the text (subsection “Structures of Ocr in complex with RNAP”, last paragraph) that the downstream DNA binding channel provides a positively charged surface composed of b, b' clamps and b' jaw, but this is not shown in the figure. The authors further state that positively charged areas on the Ocr surface face the b' jaw domain, but this is also not evident in this figure as the b' jaw is not shown in B. It would be helpful to revise the figure accordingly.</p><p>Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1:</p><p>14) How were the gels stained in the different panels?</p><p>15) In Figure 7A and B, the authors argue that there is a gradual disappearance of the RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> complex when adding increasing concentrations of Ocr. However, in conditions I and II in 7A there seems to be no or very little RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> complex present at either Ocr concentration. A more careful titration would be necessary to make this point. The low abundance of RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> in lanes 7 and 9 is also surprising since one would expect a similar abundance of both RNAP-Ocr and RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> at equimolar concentration of the components given the similar Kds for the interactions. In condition III, the authors add Ocr to preformed RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> purified by gel filtration, but it seems there is barely any σ<sup>54</sup> present (see also the very weak signal in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A when comparing lanes 11 and 12 to lane 6). Therefore, it is unclear whether Ocr actually competes with σ<sup>54</sup> or binds to abundant free RNAP. To substantiate their claim, the authors should demonstrate that the preformed RNAP-σ complexes contain stoichiometric amounts of all components as expected. More generally, the gels shown could also benefit from quantitation.</p><p>16) In Figure 7C and D, the authors changed the protein concentrations for the different reactions compared to A and B. To ease comparison with the other panels in this figure, it would make more sense to use similar experimental conditions as in the previous experiments. It would also be helpful if the authors could comment on the affinity of the DNA for RNAP-σ. Is binding tighter than that of Ocr to RNAP to explain that DNA can overcome the inhibitory effect of Ocr that is pre-bound to RNAP?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural basis of transcription inhibition by the DNA mimic protein Ocr of bacteriophage T7&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Cynthia Wolberger (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and the comments of the reviewers have been satisfactorily addressed. However, there is a remaining issues with one of the figures that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Figure 6 in the revised manuscript is problematic – the discussion of Figure 6 in the text, in the Figure 6 legend, and the figure itself are inconsistent.

The legend to panel A should describe the experiment more completely and explain what Roman numerals I, II and III denote in that panel, as well as in panel B. It would perhaps be best to relabel the panels to denote the reaction scheme as panel A and to explicitly point the reader to that scheme in explaining I, II and III. The differences between the pairs of lanes 7-8, 9-10, 11-12 should also be explained.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis of transcription inhibition by the DNA mimic protein Ocr of bacteriophage T7&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please label panels A and B with the concentrations of Ocr above the pairs of lanes in I, II, and III so that all the panels in the figure are labeled optimally and the same.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52125.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I) Presentation of structural studies:</p><p>1) A broad issue concerning the presentation of the structural results is the overall focus on comparing Ocr-RNAP complexes with σ<sup>54</sup>-holoenzyme complexes since functional relevance of Ocr inhibition of σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription is extremely unlikely.

Overall there are no significant differences at the monomeric level between the Ocr model in this study and that of crystal structure and the dimer interface is also largely unchanged. However the dimer is slightly less bent compared to that of crystal structure. We have added a sentence to describe this and a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In terms of EcoKI complex, the structural model was derived from a negatively stained reconstruction and the reliability and accuracy are questionable hence we are reluctant to perform a detailed comparison. Nevertheless, we have added a sentence stating that in that complex, Ocr is fully encircled by the enzyme, similar to DNA encircled by the DNA clamp while Ocr in the transcriptional complex is bound in the cleft.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are many issues regarding the figures and presentation of structural and mechanistic data.

In that study, the authors used host strains lacking the host restriction enzymes and looked at the effects of host RNA and protein synthesis post T7 infection. Their results showed that expression of gp0.3 (Ocr) resulted in an inhibition, albeit delayed, of host β-galactosidase synthesis and delayed inhibition of total RNA synthesis (Figure 3 in McAllister and Barrett, 1977). This inhibitory effect is consistent with our results here showing that over-expressed Ocr inhibits host transcription, and thus also protein production. The delayed response could be due to the fact that Ocr is expressed by the host RNAP, it thus takes time for sufficient amount of Ocr to be synthesized by the host to show an inhibitory response. We have added this in the text. Interestingly, when Ocr and gp1.1 (a small protein with unknown function) were both expressed in T7, the host protein synthesis was shutdown effectively, suggesting that gp1.1 and Ocr might have complementary/synergetic effects although that requires further investigation. We have added this in Discussion but have also tuned down on the proposal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure Revisions:</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>1) In A, there are two peaks of the RNAP-Ocr complex eluting between 40-57 ml.

Indeed, the signal from the labelled protein is a limiting factor on the concentrations we could use in these experiments. We have now refitted the data using the full tight binding equation. A tight binding equation was used with σ or Ocr fixed at 25 nM. The Kd values now are Ocr-RNAP: 7 nM, σ<sup>70</sup>-RNAP: 15 nM and σ<sup>54</sup>-RNAP: 20 nM. These numbers are broadly in agreement with Kd of σ<sup>54</sup>-RNAP (~ 60 nM) obtained in our laboratory (Scott et al. Biochem J., 2000, 352:539-547) using kinetic binding experiments. The competition experiments in Figure 6 (and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) show that equimolar concentration of Ocr can effectively compete out σ<sup>70</sup> and σ<sup>54</sup>, again consistent with similar Kds to RNAP.

However, in conditions I and II in 7A there seems to be no or very little RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> complex present at either Ocr concentration. A more careful titration would be necessary to make this point. The low abundance of RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> in lanes 7 and 9 is also surprising since one would expect a similar abundance of both RNAP-Ocr and RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> at equimolar concentration of the components given the similar Kds for the interactions. In condition III, the authors add Ocr to preformed RNAP-σ<sup>54</sup> purified by gel filtration, but it seems there is barely any σ<sup>54</sup> present (see also the very weak signal in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A when comparing lanes 11 and 12 to lane 6).</p></disp-quote><p>The Kd for Ocr is actually slightly better than for both σ<sup>70</sup> and σ<sup>54</sup> (Figure 1D-F). Furthermore, σ does not stain so well. They are more visible in western blotted gels against His-tag on σ proteins (new Figure 6B). We have also moved σ<sup>54</sup> data to supplementary figures (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, it is unclear whether Ocr actually competes with σ<sup>54</sup> or binds to abundant free RNAP. To substantiate their claim, the authors should demonstrate that the preformed RNAP-σ complexes contain stoichiometric amounts of all components as expected. More generally, the gels shown could also benefit from quantitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that the holoenzyme is formed stoichiometrically (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We have quantified gels when possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In 7C and 7D, the authors changed the protein concentrations for the different reactions compared to A and B. To ease comparison with the other panels in this figure, it would make more sense to use similar experimental conditions as in the previous experiments. It would also be helpful if the authors could comment on the affinity of the DNA for RNAP-σ. Is binding tighter than that of Ocr to RNAP to explain that DNA can overcome the inhibitory effect of Ocr that is pre-bound to RNAP?</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted experiments under the same conditions as in vitro transcription assays and stained for Cy3 fluorescently labelled DNA (new Figure 6C-D compared to new Figure 5). Figure 6A-B shows competition experiments and protein concentrations are 2x as in Figure 6C-D due to different detection methods. In Figure 6A, the gels were stained with Coomassie blue. However σ factors were not sensitive to Coomassie. Figure 6B shows western blots against His-tag on σ. Figure 6C-D investigates the effects on promoter complex formation, similar to those in Figure 5. Here we used fluorescent signals from Cy3 attached to DNA, which are more sensitive than Coomassie and hence lower protein concentrations were used. We now also include data showing DNA binding to RNAP-σ<sup>70</sup> and indeed the Kd is ~ 0.1 nM, significantly tighter binding compared to Ocr. These data are included in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 in the revised manuscript is problematic – the discussion of Figure 6 in the text, in the Figure 6 legend, and the figure itself are inconsistent. While Figure 6 contains panels A – D, the figure legend only refers to panels A – C. In addition, the legend does not adequately describe the figures. The legend to panel A should describe the experiment more completely and explain what Roman numerals I, II and III denote in that panel, as well as in panel B. It would perhaps be best to relabel the panels to denote the reaction scheme as panel A and to explicitly point the reader to that scheme in explaining I, II and III. The differences between the pairs of lanes 7-8, 9-10, 11-12 should also be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended Figure 6 legend as well as the text (subsection “Ocr inhibits RNAP recruitment and open complex formation but does not 271 disrupt pre-formed open complexes”) in the revised manuscript.

In panels C and D the authors helpfully added labels above the gel lanes to explain the differences between the pairs of lanes in 'I', 'II', and 'III' (0.5 vs. 5 microM); however, the same needs to be done for panels A and B. Please label panels A and B with the concentrations of Ocr above the pairs of lanes in I, II, and III so that all the panels in the figure are labeled optimally and the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended Figure 6 as well as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 with Ocr concentrations clearly labelled above the pairs of lanes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
