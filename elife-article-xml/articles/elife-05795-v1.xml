pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly. The essential mechanistic role of Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis in this reaction is still incompletely understood. Here, we show that although Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is essential to initiate DNA replication, it is not essential for MCM loading. Using purified proteins, an ATPase-defective Cdc6 mutant ‘Cdc6-E224Q’ promoted MCM loading on DNA. Cdc6-E224Q also promoted MCM binding at origins in vivo but cells remained blocked in G1-phase. If after loading MCM, Cdc6-E224Q was degraded, cells entered an apparently normal S-phase and replicated DNA, a phenotype seen with two additional Cdc6 ATPase-defective mutants. Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is therefore required for Cdc6 disengagement from the pre-RC after helicase loading to advance subsequent steps in helicase activation in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05795.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05795.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05795.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it first creates copies of its DNA so that the two daughter cells both receive a complete copy of its genetic blueprint. The DNA is arranged in a double helix that is made of two single DNA strands that twist together. The process of copying the DNA requires a group or ‘complex’ of proteins called the MCM helicase complex that binds to this double-stranded DNA molecule. MCM then separates the two DNA strands to allow the production of new DNA strands in a process that uses the original strands as templates. After copying, the two resulting DNA double helices each have one of the original strands and one new strand.</p><p>An enzyme called Cdc6 works together with several other proteins to help MCM bind to double-stranded DNA. Cdc6 uses energy to promote DNA copying, but it is not clear how this works. Here, Chang et al. studied the activity of yeast Cdc6. A mutant form of Cdc6 that lacked its enzyme activity still promoted MCM binding to DNA. However, yeast cells with this mutant enzyme were unable to copy their DNA and did not divide.</p><p>Next, Chang et al. used a technique called ‘single particle electron microscopy’ to investigate how the MCM complex, DNA and Cdc6 interact with each other. These experiments show that normal Cdc6 enzymes detach from the MCM complex after the energy is used to allow DNA copying and cell division to proceed. However, the mutant Cdc6 enzymes remain stuck to the complex, which blocks DNA copying. In cells, if the mutant Cdc6 enzymes are deliberately destroyed after the MCM complex binds to DNA, DNA copying proceeds normally. This implies that Cdc6 inhibits MCM activity as long it remains bound to the complex.</p><p>A similar sequence of steps occurs when helicases bind to DNA in bacteria, which suggests that this important process has been maintained during billions of years of evolution. The next steps will be to understand how Cdc6 is able to inhibit the MCM complex, and how Cdc6's enzyme activity enables it to detach from the complex later on.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05795.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05795.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>ORC/Cdc6</kwd><kwd>helicase loader</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM74985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Huilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-0950464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinreich</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Speck</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genetic characterization of the Cdc6 replication initiator reveals similarities in the helicase loading reaction between bacteria and eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells allow pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) assembly at origins only once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li and Araki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</xref>) to promote genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2013</xref>). An inactive MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) double hexamer is first loaded on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in late M- to early G1-phase and then activated in a subsequent step that requires conserved protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Labib, 2010</xref>). Cdc6 is a AAA+ ATPase family member that binds ORC (origin recognition complex), and together these proteins function as an MCM ‘helicase loader’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cocker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</xref>). Since the weakly hydrolyzed ATP-γ-S analogue traps an OCCM complex on DNA containing ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 and a single hexamer of MCM (all six MCM subunits are also AAA+ proteins), double hexamer loading requires ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Following MCM complex loading, Cdt1 and Cdc6 disengage from the pre-RC to allow additional protein loading complexes to activate the MCM helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The AAA+ family shares multiple conserved motifs, including Walker A and B motifs that promote ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as sensor 1 and 2 motifs that help couple changes in ATP/ADP occupancy with protein conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Early mutational analysis of the Walker A motif agreed that budding yeast Cdc6 must bind ATP to execute its essential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weinreich et al., 1999</xref>). However, there have been conflicting reports on the role of Cdc6 ATPase activity in pre-RC assembly and yeast viability. Two different mutants altering the Walker B motif (required for ATP hydrolysis) gave opposite phenotypes: a Cdc6-E224G mutant was lethal and acted as a dominant negative mutant when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</xref>), but a double Cdc6-D223A, E224A mutant was viable suggesting the Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis might not be required for its essential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weinreich et al., 1999</xref>). A Walker B DExx&gt;AAxx mutant in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Cdc6 (Cdc18) was also shown to be viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). A polar residue in the sensor 1 motif at the tip of the β4-strand (corresponding to N263 in budding yeast Cdc6) is also required for ATP hydrolysis in various AAA+ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>). Mutation of Cdc6 N263 to A has been reported to result in normal growth at 24°C and no growth at 37°C in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</xref>) but was lethal at 30°C in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>). Alanine mutation of the Cdc6 sensor 2 arginine (R332) had a modest effect on growth, suggesting it does not perform an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</xref>), but mutation of R332 to E was lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>). Lastly, AAA+ members typically form multisubunit protein assemblies and an ‘R-finger’ residue in one subunit can stimulate ATP hydrolysis in an adjacent subunit. The R-finger is named for an analogous arginine first discovered in the Ras GTPase-activating protein, p120<sup>GAP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheffzek et al., 1997</xref>). However, a triple alanine mutant spanning the budding yeast Cdc6 R-finger (R274) gave no growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</xref>), suggesting that the Cdc6 R-finger is not required for stimulating either ORC or MCM ATPase activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05795.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Cdc6 Walker B catalytic residue is essential in yeast but is easily bypassed by intragenic suppressor mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the <italic>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> Cdc6 orthologue with bound ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2000</xref>) highlighting the ATP binding pocket and key residues.

However, two recent reports using only purified proteins (and using Cdc6-E224G or Cdc6-N263A mutants) find that Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is not required for efficient MCM loading in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). The Cdc6-N263A sensor 1 mutant was previously shown to be defective in ATP hydrolysis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Speck and Stillman, 2007</xref>). Coster et al. and Kang et al. have suggested that Cdc6 ATPase is required for a quality control step that ejects incomplete or non-functional MCM hexamers before loading. Surprisingly, no systematic mutational analysis of the Cdc6 Walker B residues has been reported.</p><p>Here, we have combined yeast genetics and in vivo assays together with an in vitro MCM loading reaction to probe the role of Cdc6 Walker B motif residues for viability and growth, ATP hydrolysis, pre-RC assembly, and DNA replication in yeast. We find that Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is required for yeast viability but not for MCM loading either in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, since the requirement for Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis can be bypassed by degrading Cdc6 ATPase defective proteins after MCM loading, ATP hydrolysis is likely instead required to disengage Cdc6 from the pre-RC (presumably an ORC-Cdc6-MCM intermediate) to allow subsequent steps in MCM helicase activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The Walker B motif (DExx) contains a glutamate residue that is required for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogura et al., 2004</xref>) and is highly conserved among Cdc6 orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Williams et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

The results of the mutational scan are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. These data show that Cdc6 E224 is the only residue in the Walker B motif required for viability.

ORC, Cdc6 (wild type or mutant), Cdt1, and MCM were incubated at 24°C with replication origin-containing plasmid DNA linked to magnetic beads and then washed under low salt conditions. This allows detection of proteins specifically bound to origin DNA. Wild type and both mutant Cdc6 proteins bound to ORC and promoted binding of MCM to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, low salt). Interestingly, the E224Q mutant had a higher amount of Cdt1 bound than the wild type or Cdc6-NQ complex, as reported for a Cdc6-E224G mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Randell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting build up of an intermediate Cdt1-containing complex prior to dhMCM (double hexamer MCM) loading. ‘Loaded’ dhMCM that encircles dsDNA is resistant to a 0.5 M high salt wash but ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1 and any MCM proteins that are merely ‘associated’ with DNA are not. Both mutant Cdc6 proteins were capable of loading MCM protein, albeit less efficiently than wild-type Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, high salt). The increased Cdt1 retention in low salt by Cdc6-E224Q was also seen in reactions treated with a more stringent (0.3 M K acetate) low salt wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, Cdc6-E224Q protein was retained within the low salt complex but wild-type Cdc6 and the Cdc6-NQ protein were significantly less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Cdc6 is marked with an arrowhead). Cdc6-E224G is also defective in dissociating from the pre-RC relative to wild-type Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>). Cdc6 ATP binding is required for interaction with ORC and for pre-RC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weinreich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Speck et al., 2005</xref>) and since Cdc6-E224Q and Cdc6-NQ proteins formed similar pre-RC complexes to wild-type Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, low salt), they are not defective in ATP binding.</p><p>Although ORC-Cdc6-E224Q complexes exhibited no ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), substantial ATPase activity was evident after MCM and Cdt1 protein addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), at about two-thirds the level of the wild-type reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, Cdc6-E224Q does not prevent MCM ATPase activity, which might be sufficient to support double hexamer loading. Recent experiments using multiple ATP binding and ATPase-defective MCM mutants in yeast support the model that MCM ATPase activity is necessary for efficient double hexamer loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using cryo-EM, the Mcm2-7 double hexamer loaded by ORC and mutant Cdc6 has the characteristic four-layered architecture in side views comprised of the two distal C-terminal AAA layers and the two middle N-terminal layers from two Mcm2-7 hexamers in their side views. This structural organization is identical to the double hexamer loaded by the wild-type ORC-Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As mentioned previously, ATP-γ-S traps a normally transient ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-MCM (OCCM) intermediate on the DNA with a single MCM hexamer encircling dsDNA but with a small gap in the hexamer at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochman and Schwacha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Samel et al., 2014</xref>). OCCM complexes are not seen with wild-type proteins in ATP, since ATP hydrolysis quickly promotes Cdt1 release to give a ‘OCM’ intermediate complex and then double hexamer loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</xref>). Both negative staining-EM and cryo-EM revealed a heterogeneous mixture of OCCM and OCM complexes formed with the Cdc6-E224Q protein in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that were not seen with wild-type Cdc6.

Cdc6 is an unstable protein (t1/2 ≤ 5 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Piatti et al., 1995</xref>) and so we expected that glucose addition (which strongly represses any further Cdc6 expression) would be followed by the disappearance of Cdc6 protein.

In summary, alanine or leucine mutations at the N263 sensor 1 residue were unique among the sensor 1, sensor 2, and ‘R-finger’ Cdc6 residues we tested in giving a lethal phenotype and both N263 mutant proteins were dominant negative for growth when over-expressed in wild-type yeast.</p><p>Since the N263A mutant is also defective for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Speck and Stillman, 2007</xref>) but is capable of loading MCM proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2014</xref>), we integrated this allele under the control of the Gal1 promoter in yeast and tested its role in DNA replication. Similar to the <italic>cdc6-E224Q</italic> and <italic>cdc6-E224G</italic> alleles, expression of only <italic>cdc6-N263A</italic> gave a growth arrest in G1 phase, but when the gene was repressed and the Cdc6-N263A protein subsequently degraded, cells entered S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Cdc6 ATPase activity is required for viability in budding yeast as seen by the phenotypes of multiple E224 and N263 substitution mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>]). Using purified proteins, Cdc6 ATPase activity is not essential for MCM loading in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2014</xref>]) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) but is required for initiating DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>). Since degradation of the ATPase defective Cdc6-E224Q, Cdc6-E224G and Cdc6-N263A mutant proteins after MCM loading promotes DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), Cdc6 ATPase activity is required for Cdc6 release from the pre-RC, that is, an ORC-Cdc6 intermediate complex engaged with MCM (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). So, Cdc6 activity is not required after MCM loading other than for its removal from the helicase-loading complex. Since we did not trap an intermediate complex with ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 and MCM double hexamer in vitro, we cannot conclude whether MCM hexamers are loaded in tandem, from two separate OCCM structures, or as a double hexamer. Since Cdc6-E224Q is defective for ATP hydrolysis and suppresses ORC ATP hydrolysis in the ORC-Cdc6-DNA context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), it appears that MCM ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) can drive the reaction forward in vitro to give double hexamer formation, albeit less efficiently that with wild-type Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). However, since blocking Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis in vivo prevents subsequent MCM activation, this suggests that the in vitro reactions do not capture some essential aspect of this reaction. For instance, the dhMCM engaged with ORC-Cdc6-E224Q may be much more stable on origins within chromatin in yeast, which have a small 125-bp nucleosome-free region on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We isolated multiple intragenic suppressors of the Cdc6-E224A or E224Q single mutants in the highly conserved ‘DEMD’ core region of the Walker B motif, that is, AAMD, AAAD, AAMA, NQMD, NQMA, and NQNM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All of these intragenic suppressors also mutate the first aspartic acid residue indicating that the presence of this D223 residue blocks Cdc6 activity in vivo when Cdc6 cannot hydrolyze ATP. The NQMD mutation did not restore Cdc6 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This simplest explanation for the bypass phenotype is that a conformational change within the Cdc6-NQ mutant compensated for the loss of ATPase activity. This is supported by the fact that the AAMD, AAMA, AAAD mutants grew poorly but the NQMD and NQMN mutants, which have quite different substitutions at the ‘DE’ residues, grew very robustly at all temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is well established that ATP hydrolysis by AAA+ family members leads to conformational changes within these proteins, which drive the reactions forward, and this conformational change is communicated by residues in close proximity to the ATP/ADP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has discovered that the Cdc6 ATPase performs a quality control function in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest this is not its primary role in vivo since blocking a quality control function for the Cdc6 ATPase (i.e., ejecting incompletely assembled MCM hexamers or MCM-Cdt1 heptamers that bind the ORC-Cdc6 loader before loading onto dsDNA) should not give rise to a lethal phenotype. The hexameric replicative helicase structure and loading mechanisms have been honed over a long evolutionary history to be highly efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forsburg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Slaymaker and Chen, 2012</xref>) and probably very few errors occur in vivo. Our data strongly suggest that the essential role of the Cdc6 ATPase is to disengage Cdc6 from the pre-RC after MCM is loaded. Interestingly, this role of the Cdc6 ATPase in initiating DNA replication is similar to bacterial helicase loaders: the AAA+ <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> helicase loader DnaC does not require ATP hydrolysis to load the hexameric DnaB helicase at <italic>oriC</italic>—but DnaC ATP hydrolysis leads to DnaC disassembly and release from a DnaC–DnaB complex that actually inhibits DnaB helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>). Our data therefore reveal a broad conservation of replicative helicase loading mechanisms across kingdoms, which can hopefully be further elucidated by crystallographic or other biophysical methods using wild type and mutant helicase loading complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Construction of yeast strains and plasmids and yeast growth</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary files 1, 2</xref>.
