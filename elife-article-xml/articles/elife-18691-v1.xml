hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Aβ exerts neuropathogenic activity through tau, the mechanistic link between Aβ and tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we showed that the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis is critical in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau pathology. <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> knockout or antagonistic FcγRIIb antibody inhibited Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and rescued memory impairments in AD mouse models. FcγRIIb phosphorylation at Tyr273 was found in AD brains, in neuronal cells exposed to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, and recruited SHIP2 to form a protein complex. Consequently, treatment with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> increased PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels from PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to mediate tau hyperphosphorylation. Further, we found that targeting SHIP2 expression by lentiviral siRNA in 3xTg-AD mice or pharmacological inhibition of SHIP2 potently rescued tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairments. Thus, we concluded that the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis links Aβ neurotoxicity to tau pathology by dysregulating PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism, providing insight into therapeutic potential against AD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18691.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18691.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18691.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In Alzheimer’s disease, damage to neurons in the brain gradually causes memory loss and difficulties with thinking. The main hallmarks of this damage are seen in the accumulation of proteins in and around neurons. First, a protein called amyloid beta forms aggregates outside the cell. This appears to lead to the build up of an abnormal form of a protein called tau inside the cell. These abnormal tau proteins have excessive numbers of phosphate groups attached to them, and so are known as “hyperphosphorylated”. The molecular mechanism underlying amyloid beta’s role in the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins was not known.</p><p>Amyloid beta binds to many different receptor proteins – including one called Fc gamma receptor IIb – on the surface of neurons. Kam, Park et al. investigated whether interactions between amyloid beta and Fc gamma receptor IIb might regulate the phosphorylation of tau within neurons. Adding amyloid beta to mouse neurons caused tau proteins to become hyperphosphorylated. However, removing Fc gamma receptor IIb from the neurons, or stopping it from binding to amyloid beta, abolished this effect.</p><p>When amyloid beta was bound to Fc gamma receptor IIb, the receptor became phosphorylated. This in turn triggered a series of further phosphorylation events, culminating in an increase in the level of a molecule that relays signals from cell receptors – called SHIP2 – inside the neurons. This molecule increases tau phosphorylation when added to neurons. Reducing the activity or amount of SHIP2 in mice that present the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease reduced the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein in their neurons and restored their memory to normal levels.</p><p>Kam, Park et al. also looked at samples taken from the brains of human Alzheimer's disease patients. Unlike samples taken from people without Alzheimer’s disease, neurons in these samples contain both phosphorylated Fc gamma receptor IIb and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.</p><p>By uncovering the molecules that link amyloid beta with tau hyperphosphorylation, Kam, Park et al.’s results suggest new targets for therapies to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. More research is now needed to investigate whether this could lead to the design of new drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18691.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18691.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>tau</kwd><kwd>SHIP2</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>fc gamma receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRI grant, NRF-2016R1A2A1A05005304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kam</surname><given-names>Tae-In</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Hyejin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gwon</surname><given-names>Youngdae</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seo-Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Yong-Keun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research Council of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MSIP Project No. 2N41660-16-074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gwon</surname><given-names>Youngdae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Global Research Laboratory, NRF-2010-00341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Sungmin</given-names></name><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>Seo Won</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Yong-Keun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By binding to Fc gamma receptor IIb, amyloid beta induces a series of phosphorylation events that mediate the damaging effects of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive loss of memory and the neuronal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mattson, 2004</xref>). The pathological hallmarks of AD are the presence of senile plaques consisting of Aβ peptide and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walsh and Selkoe, 2004</xref>). Aβ species are generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases, and accumulate extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haass and Selkoe, 2007</xref>). In general, Aβ contributes to AD pathology by exhibiting toxicity in susceptible neurons, facilitating tau hyperphosphorylation, disrupting proteasome activity, and triggering synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LaFerla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kam et al., 2014</xref>). Tau is a microtubule-binding protein but dissociates from the microtubules and accumulates in neurons as it becomes highly phosphorylated at multiple sites, resulting in the impairment of microtubule assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballatore et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence strongly indicate that these two hallmarks are strongly interrelated in AD. In the amyloid cascade hypothesis, tau is believed to be one of the major downstream targets of Aβ to produce neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</xref>). Aβ accelerates neurodegeneration in neuronal cells but not in tau-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rapoport et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, tau depletion in mutant <italic>APP</italic> transgenic mice prevented Aβ pathologies, including learning and memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberson et al., 2007</xref>). The role of Aβ in tau pathology was also shown in 3xTg-AD mice expressing APP, presenilin, and tau transgenes in which Aβ immunization reduced not only Aβ accumulation but also tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oddo et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, higher levels of NFT have been observed in APPswe/P301L transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>) and in 3xTg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>). More importantly, tau hyperphosphorylation is frequently found in AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1989</xref>). Apparently, tau kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), are activated by Aβ for tau phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Terwel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2012</xref>). All of these findings indicate the presence of a pathologic signal pathway starting with extracellular Aβ and ending in the phosphorylation of intracellular tau. However, the mechanism connecting the two pathologic hallmarks of AD remains unknown.</p><p>Phosphoinositides, the phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, are known to play a major role in signal transduction upon cellular stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). Among them, the biological roles of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> have been relatively well characterized in cell survival, proliferation, and synaptic function via their binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunney and Katan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>), but the function of PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is largely unknown. Unlike PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are formed when cells respond to signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang and Majerus, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmon, 2008</xref>). SH2 domain-containing phosphatidylinositol 5′-phosphatase (SHIP) removes 5′ phosphate from PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to produce PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damen et al., 1996</xref>). Increasing evidence has revealed that phosphoinositide metabolism is dysregulated in AD; specifically, the level of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is decreased in human and mouse AD brains, and in the primary cortical neurons exposed to oligomeric Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stokes and Hawthorne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jope et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2008</xref>), and recovery of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency prevents AD-related cognitive deficits in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McIntire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). However, how phosphoinositide metabolism, including levels of PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, is regulated by Aβ during AD pathogenesis and the consequences of its dysregulation in AD needs to be resolved.</p><p>Until now, Aβ was reported to bind to many receptors, including alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7 nAChR), NMDA receptor, receptors for advanced glycation end- products (RAGE), Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), the Ephrin-type B2 receptor (EphB2), cellular prion protein (PrPc), and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lustbader, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Snyder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cissé et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Although these receptors were shown to be responsible for Aβ neurotoxicity, especially memory impairment in AD mice, their role as neuronal receptors in Aβ-induced tau pathologies was limitedly shown in α7 nAChR and NMDA receptor (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stancu et al., 2014</xref>). Of particular note, while α7 nAChR was reported to mediate Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation, the finding was based on in vitro and ex vivo system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, evidence showing a correlation of the proposed molecular mechanism with pathologic evidence was not much provided. In particular, the CAMKK2-AMPK at down-stream of NMDA receptor was recently proposed to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers through tau phosphorylation and this event is very likely caused by NMDA receptor-induced increase of intracellular calcium, not by direct interaction of NMDA receptor with Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mairet-Coello et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a neuronal receptor that is important in Aβ-induced tau pathology needs to be elucidated.</p><p>Recently, we showed that Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb) is also expressed in neurons and directly interacts with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> to mediate Aβ neurotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and memory impairment in AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that FcγRIIb is phosphorylated at tyrosine 273 by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in neurons and in AD brains, and that this phosphorylation recruits SH2 domain-containing phosphatidylinositol 5′-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2, INPPL1) to increase PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels for tau hyperphosphorylation. Further, <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> or <italic>Inppl1</italic> deficiency in 3xTg-AD mice or pharmacological inhibition of either protein abrogates all of these observations, highlighting the importance of the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis in the Aβ-induced tau pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FcγRIIb is essential for tau hyperphosphorylation and memory deficit in 3xTg-AD mice</title><p>Given that FcγRIIb was previously identified as a receptor for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and a mediator of memory impairment in hAPP-J20 mice expressing only familial mutant APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 2013</xref>), and that tau as well as Aβ is essential for memory impairment in AD mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that FcγRIIb is responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation in response to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. We first assessed and confirmed that both FcγRIIb mRNAs and proteins were significantly expressed in neurons as well as non-neuronal cells in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, incubation of primary cortical neurons with synthetic Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers increased tau phosphorylation at several pathological epitopes, including Ser396/Ser404 (PHF1), Thr231/Ser235 (AT180), and Ser202 (CP13), but these phosphorylations were abrogated in <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> knockout (KO) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Each group of mice was tested for spatial working memory in a Y-maze task. Although the total number of arm entries was not significantly different between groups, <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> deficiency improved the spatial working memory of 3xTg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We generated several FcγRIIb mutants lacking the ITIM (ΔITIM) or cytoplasmic region (Δcyto), or substituting the tyrosine residue with phenylalanine (Y273F), and examined their effects on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation. Unlike FcγRIIb, ectopic expression of FcγRIIb mutants did not induce neuronal death in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of FcγRIIb Y273F mutant, which was not phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), blocked Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity to the control level in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas FcγRIIb WT potentiated it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that FcγRIIb-Tyr273 phosphorylation is required for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity. Next, we examined the role of FcγRIIb phosphorylation in tau phosphorylation using a reconstitution analysis in <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO neurons. Unlike that in <italic>Fcgr2b</italic>-deficient neurons, reconstitution of the <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO primary cortical neurons with FcγRIIb WT recovered Aβ-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau, detected by PHF1, CP13, AT180, and 12E8 antibodies, as seen in WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, reconstitution with FcγRIIb-ΔCyto or FcγRIIb-Y273F failed to show tau phosphorylation at those epitopes in response to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb-Tyr273 by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is critical for tau phosphorylation.</p><p>Even more interestingly, when we analyzed the phosphorylation status of FcγRIIb in the brains of AD patients, we found FcγRIIb phosphorylation on Tyr273 in the hippocampal tissues of five out of six AD patients (stage V and VI), but not in normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (stage III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, tau phosphorylation at PHF was observed in four out of the five AD patients with FcγRIIb-Tyr273 phosphorylation-positive brains. As we previously reported, the expression level of FcγRIIb was increased in AD brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). With the notion that FcγRIIb phosphorylation is required for tau phosphorylation and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity, it is likely that the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb found in AD brains is associated with tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss during AD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Recruitment of SHIP2 to phosphorylated FcγRIIb by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in neuronal cells</title><p>In B cells, the SHIP (SHIP1 and 2) is known to bind to the phosphorylated ITIM region of FcγRIIb and inhibit downstream responses triggered by immune receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ono et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muraille, 2000</xref>).

Behavioral tests following the i.c.v. injection of sub-lethal doses of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and AS1949490 revealed that AS1949490 significantly rescued Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced impairments of spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), object recognition memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), and passive avoidance memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Moreover, from western blot analysis of the mouse hippocampal tissues, we found that AS1949490 suppressed Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau phosphorylation (PHF1, CP13, AT180) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Taken together, these observations support the view that pharmacological manipulation of SHIP2 is amenable to the development of AD therapeutics targeting Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau phosphorylation and memory impairment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite tremendous efforts showing that Aβ plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, including memory impairment, synaptic loss, and neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LaFerla et al., 2007</xref>), mechanistic understanding of tau phosphorylation in Aβ-induced memory deficits remains poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rapoport et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shipton et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing crucial mediator, the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis, which is responsible for Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation, memory impairment, and neuronal loss in AD models. Because the interaction of Aβ species, especially oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, with FcγRIIb accounts for such neuropathogenic defects of AD as an initiation step, the selective interaction of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> with FcγRIIb may hint at why Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, but not Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>, is important in tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oddo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, inhibition of the interaction between FcγRIIb and Aβ using anti-FcγRIIb antibody prevents Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation and memory deficits.</p><p>In general, Aβ oligomers play a key role in AD pathogenesis, while soluble Aβ oligomers are still heterogeneous, including low or high <italic>n</italic> oligomers, and the proposals on which species of Aβ oligomers are responsible for the pathogenesis are a little in debate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>). We have here used 3 different sources of Aβ oligomers; synthetic Aβ oligomers, naturally secreted Aβ oligomers (7PA2 cells), and Aβ of 3xTg-AD model mice. Although synthetic Aβ oligomers are well-characterized and have been used widely for neurotoxicity, the acting concentration of synthetic Aβ (μM range) is relatively higher than that in AD brains. Compared to synthetic Aβ oligomers, conditioned medium from 7PA2 cells mainly contains not only Aβ dimers and trimers but also the different pools of Aβ oligomers, including zeta peptide, and show more potent neurotoxic properties (nM range) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qi-Takahara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haass and Selkoe, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the oligomers generated in 3xTg-AD mouse brain may be more complicated and needs to be identified. Nonetheless, we propose here that FcγRIIb plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in response to these species of Aβ, probably a certain common species among the different sources of Aβ oligomers.</p><p>Given that FcγRIIb was initially reported as a hematopoietic receptor which is mainly expressed in B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008</xref>), our data using 3xTg-AD/FcγRIIb KO mice raised a possibility that FcγRIIb in non-neuronal cells might contribute to APP/Aβ-induced tau pathologies via neuroinflammatory function. As expected, we observed that microglia was activated in 3xTg-AD mice and this activation was also reduced significantly in the cortex and marginally in the hippocampus by FcγRIIb deficiency (data not shown). Recently, however, we and other colleagues identified that both FcγRIIb mRNA and protein are also expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suemitsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 2013</xref>), though FcγRIIb expression in neurons is low compared to astrocytes and immune tissues. Notably, its expression is increased at least several folds in primary neurons after exposure to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and in AD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kam et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, transgenic expression of the FcγRIIb mutant lacking its cytoplasmic domain in the neurons blocked memory impairment in 3xTg AD mice (data not shown). Moreover, the results showing that Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation was prevented by FcγRIIb deficiency, antagonistic FcγRIIb antibody, or SHIP2 inhibitor in primary cultured neurons assure neuronal function of the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis. Together, we believe that the inflammation mediated by FcγRIIb in 3xTg-AD mice is not likely a major cause of the memory impairment but contributes to the aggravation of memory impairment in the mice.</p><p>Unlike other FcγRs that have an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has a unique ITIM in its cytoplasmic tail and thus acts as an inhibitory receptor in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okun et al., 2010</xref>). Excitingly, the binding of extracellular Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> to FcγRIIb induces phosphorylation in the ITIM of FcγRIIb in neuronal cells. We observed that Lyn kinase is expressed in neurons and that knockdown of <italic>LYN</italic> expression blocks Aβ-induced FcγRIIb phosphorylation and neurotoxicity (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that Lyn phosphorylates the ITIM of FcγRIIb in neuronal cells in response to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Moreover, we also observed this phosphorylation of FcγRIIb in AD brains (stage V and VI) in which tau was highly phosphorylated. Then, how is FcγRIIb different from other Aβ receptors? It is reasonable to propose that different mechanisms or even the same mechanism exerts multiple effects at different stages of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Strooper and Karran, 2016</xref>). For instance, RAGE is now believed to mainly function to transport Aβ in the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deane et al., 2003</xref>) and ABAD acts for mitochondrial toxicity as an intracellular binding partner of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lustbader, 2004</xref>). In case of PrPc, it's debatable whether it is involved in Aβ-induced memory impairments and thus needs to be further characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balducci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gimbel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cissé et al., 2011b</xref>). Further, compared to those receptors, our observations that the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb at tyrosine 273 is found in the brain of AD patients and is required for both oligomeric Aβ neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation can make it distinct from other Aβ-binding receptors. In the case of PirB that shares structural similarity with FcγRIIb and also acts as an Aβ receptor for synaptic plasticity, the phosphorylation of PirB is not associated with Aβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we believe that FcγRIIb facilitates tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD brains, consistent with the proposed role of tau in AD pathogenesis, such as severe memory impairment and neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballatore et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we show that SHIP2 is a key mediator in delivering the toxic signal of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> to tau by binding to the phosphorylated FcγRIIb. Many studies on SHIP2 have focused on its inhibitory effect on insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wada et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Inppl1</italic> transgenic mice show impaired insulin signaling and glucose intolerance, while <italic>Inppl1</italic> KO mice are highly resistant to weight gain on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sleeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kagawa et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, targeting SHIP2 is thought to be a promising approach for the treatment of other diseases, including type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vanhanen et al., 2006</xref>). Given that metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, is highly associated with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vanhanen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Razay et al., 2007</xref>), we speculate that SHIP2 may play a dual role in AD and diabetes. In support of this, a SHIP2 inhibitor exhibited an ameliorating effect on the impaired memory function of diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soeda et al., 2010</xref>). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SHIP2 are involved in metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaisaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kagawa et al., 2005</xref>); thus, it will be very interesting to evaluate the effect of these SHIP2 SNPs on AD pathogenesis in our FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis.</p><p>Dysregulation of phosphoinositide metabolism is increasingly recognized as important in various diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wymann and Schneiter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kok et al., 2009</xref>). The phosphoinositide pool is also altered in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stokes and Hawthorne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jope et al., 1994</xref>). In particular, this work shows that a change in the PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> level is implicated in AD pathogenesis through tau hyperphosphorylation. PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is scarce under normal conditions and increases through signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmon, 2008</xref>). While PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are known to overlap to some degree in their functions, they apparently have distinct roles in neurodegeneration. Recently, it was shown that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, potentiates glutamate-induced cell death in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase INPP4A deficiency shows increased level of PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and leads to neurodegeneration in brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). We also observed that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> selectively induces tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. In addition, tensin homolog deletion on chromosome 10 (PTEN) also dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at position 3 and generates PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1997</xref>). The reduced level of PTEN in AD brains correlates with an increase in tau phosphorylation and, thus, dysregulation of PTEN also contributes to tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, genetic reduction of synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), the major PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase in the brain, ameliorates behavioral and synaptic deficits and accelerates Aβ clearance through rescuing PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McIntire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Because oligomeric Aβ decreases PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2008</xref>), as we also observed, there is a possibility that SHIP2 activation together with either Synj1 upregulation or PTEN downregulation induces the imbalance in the phosphoinositide pool between PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and leads to AD pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 signaling axis provides the missing link between Aβ and tau pathologies. Notably, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> induces FcγRIIb phosphorylation to recruit SHIP2, leading to disruption of phosphoinositide metabolism for tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairment in neurons and AD model mice. Together with the Aβ-lowering strategy, our results provide new ways for AD therapeutics to rescue Aβ and tau pathology: i) selective inhibition of the interaction between FcγRIIb and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, ii) inhibition of a kinase (i.e., Lyn) which phosphorylates FcγRIIb upon Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> stimulation, and iii) inhibition of SHIP2 which disrupts phosphoinositide metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>FcγRII﻿b knockout, 3xTg-AD and hAPP (J20) transgenic mice and tissue preparation</title><p>WT (C57BL/6), <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takai et al., 1996</xref>), 3xTg-AD and hAPP (J20, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were used.

Especially the identification of SHIP2 linking Aβ to Tau pathology is novel and potentially of high interest. Overall the referees were in support of publication, but before reaching consensus a few critical questions should be addressed.

The second gap is a mechanistic link between increased PtdIns(3,4) and tau pathology. GSK-3-β kinase that catalyzes tau hyperphosphorylation, uses ATP as a donor of phosphate groups, so phosphoinositides are not a substrate.

First there are issues with the expression of FcγRIIb in neurons: Figure.1——figure supplement 1 A shows in fact that a large part of FcγRIIb mRNA is in glia and not in neurons. Additional evidence to proof that FcγRIIb is expressed in neurons is needed, it could be that the weak signal in the experiments in neurons is background. The authors could consider in situ hybridisation to check their claim. In addition, FcγRIIb is highly expressed in microglial cells and may play a role in microglial activation. Therefore, the impact of FcγRIIb KO on tau pathology in 3X TG mice can be also mediated by reduced microglial activation (cell autonomous effects vs non-autonomous effects). Did the authors check microglial activation and cytokine levels in these mice (WT 3XTG vs. KO 3Xtg)?

What happens in the cortex of these 3xTg mice where Aβ plaques should be present, is tau phosphorylation more pronounced there? And is that protected by FcγRIIb deficiency?

Why do the authors think that their receptor is the major driver of pathology in AD and why are other receptors not considered? Does this need any qualifiers?</italic> </p><p>Until now, Aβ was reported to bind to many receptors, including alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7 nAChR), NMDA receptor, receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), the Ephrin-type B2 receptor (EphB2), cellular prion protein (PrPc) and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) (Yan et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2000; Lustbader et al., 2004; Snyder et al., 2005; Lauren et al., 2009; Cisse et al., 2011a; Kim et al., 2013). Although these receptors were shown to be responsible for Aβ neurotoxicity, especially memory impairment in AD mice, their role as neuronal receptors in Aβ-induced tau pathologies was limitedly shown in α7 nAChR and NMDA receptor (reviewed in Stancu et al., 2014). Of particular note, while α7 nAChR was reported to mediate Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation, the finding was based on in vitroand ex vivosystem (Wang et al., 2003). It thus remains to be confirmed in detail using animal models of AD. Furthermore, evidence showing a correlation of the proposed molecular mechanism with pathologic evidence was not much provided. In particular, the CAMKK2-AMPK at down-stream of NMDA receptor was recently proposed to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers through tau phosphorylation and this event is very likely caused by NMDA receptor-induced increase of intracellular calcium, not by direct interaction of NMDA receptor with Aβ (Mairet-Coello et al., 2013). Therefore, a neuronal receptor that is important in Aβ- induced tau pathology has not been identified and needs to be elucidated for controlling overall AD pathology. We added this information in ‘Introduction’ (fourth paragraph).</p><p>Then, how is FcγRIIb different from other Aβ receptors? It is reasonable to propose that different mechanisms or even the same mechanism exerts multiple effects at different stages of disease progression (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). For instance, RAGE is now believed to mainly function to transport Aβ in the blood brain barrier (Deane et al., 2003) and ABAD acts for mitochondrial toxicity as an intracellular binding partner of Aβ (Lustbader et al., 2004). In case of PrPc, it's debatable whether it is involved in Aβ-induced memory impairments and thus needs to be further characterized (Balducci et al., 2010; Gimbel et al., 2010; Cisse et al., 2011b). Further, compared to those receptors, our observations that the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb at tyrosine 273 is found in the brain of AD patients and is required for both oligomeric Aβ neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation can make it distinct from other Aβ- binding receptors. In the case of PirB that shares structural similarity with FcγRIIb and also acts as an Aβ receptor for synaptic plasticity, the phosphorylation of PirB is not associated with Aβ signaling (Kim et al., 2013). Thus, we believe that FcγRIIb facilitates tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD brains, consistent with the proposed role of tau in AD pathogenesis, such as severe memory impairment and neuronal loss (Ballatore et al., 2007). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the specificity of FcγRIIb in ‘Discussion’ (fourth paragraph).</p><p>In general, Aβ oligomers play a key role in AD pathogenesis, while soluble Aβ oligomers are still heterogeneous, including low or high <italic>n</italic> oligomers, and the proposals on which species of Aβ oligomers are responsible for the pathogenesis are a little in debate (reviewed in Benilova et al., 2012). We have here used 3 different sources of Aβ oligomers; synthetic Aβ oligomers, naturally secreted Aβ oligomers (7PA2 cells), and Aβ of 3xTg-AD model mice. Although synthetic Aβ oligomers are well-characterized and have been used widely for neurotoxicity, the acting concentration of synthetic Aβ (μM range) is relatively higher than that in AD brains. Compared to synthetic Aβ oligomers, conditioned medium from 7PA2 cells mainly contains not only Aβ dimers and trimers but also the different pools of Aβ oligomers, including zeta peptide, and show more potent neurotoxic properties (nM range) (Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Haass and Selkoe, 2007). Moreover, the oligomers generated in 3xTg-AD mouse brain may be more complicated and needs to be identified. Nonetheless, we propose here that FcγRIIb plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in vitroand in vivoin response to these species of Aβ, probably a certain common species among the different sources of Aβ oligomers. We added above information in ‘Discussion’ (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) There are two major gaps in the proposed cascade and this should be mentioned at least in the Discussion to clarify this for the reader. First there are no mechanistic data in this work to link Aβ to FcγRIIb phosphorylation. The authors mention lyn kinase briefly (Discussion, third paragraph) but don't show any data. The second gap is a mechanistic link between increased PtdIns(3,4) and tau pathology. GSK-3-β kinase that catalyzes tau hyperphosphorylation, uses ATP as a donor of phosphate groups, so phosphoinositides are not a substrate. Therefore a possible link could be PtdIns(3,4)-mediated regulation of GSK-3β.</italic> </p><p>The first gap; Lyn is a member of Src-family tyrosine kinases and catalyzes the phosphorylation of FcγRIIb at ITIM domain for the inhibition of leukocyte signaling (Smith and Clatworthy, 2010). Thus, we initially hypothesized that and tested whether FcγRIIb was phosphorylated by Lyn after treatment with Aβ. We found that Lyn was activated (phosphorylation at Tyr 397) by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>). In addition, we observed that knockdown of Lyn expression by shRNA suppressed Aβ- induced Lyn activation and FcγRIIb phosphorylation (tyrosine 273) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B</xref>). To further address the role of Lyn in AD, we also isolated a novel inhibitor of Lyn from virtual library. When we examined the activity of this Lyn inhibitor in vitroand in vivo, we consistently found that the Lyn inhibitor effectively prevented FcγRIIb-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1C</xref>) and Aβ-induced Lyn activation and FcγRIIb phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1D</xref>). Moreover, Lyn inhibitor reduced the Aβ-induced cell death in primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1E</xref>). Taken together, Lyn is required for FcγRIIb phosphorylation at Tyr273 for Aβ neurotoxicity. We have actually prepared these results together with other data of in vivotests using AD models as a separate issue, and are thus sorry to say that we would like to show these results only to reviewers. It also needs more detail characterization. Please, understand us.

We previously demonstrated that ER stress is elicited by the interaction between Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and FcγRIIb, and is responsible for Aβ neurotoxicity (Kam et al., 2013). Thus, we decided to examine the gap among SHIP2, ER stress, and GSK3β. To determine the relationship between PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (a SHIP2 product) and ER stress, we first analyzed the alteration of GRP78, a typical marker of unfolded protein response (UPR), following the delivery of various phosphoinositides into primary cortical neurons. Among the phosphoinositides, we found that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> only increased the level of GRP78. We also found that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> abolished the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 (GSK3β activation) and increased tau hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, we found that treatment with ER stress inhibitors, such as 4-PBA and Salubrinal, a chemical chaperone and an eIF2α dephosphorylation inhibitor, respectively, apparently attenuated PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-induced GSK3β activation and tau phosphorylation with some different efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The different efficacy of these two inhibitors on GSK3β and tau phosphorylation might reflect a way of their inhibition of ER stress and tau phosphorylation by kinases. These results suggest that GSK3β is activated by SHIP2 product through ER stress to phosphorylate tau. Further, treatment with AS1949490, a SHIP2 inhibitor, or infection with lentivirus carrying <italic>Ship2</italic> shRNA blocked Aβ-induced GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), again confirming our proposal that activation of SHIP2 elicits ER stress to activate GSK3β and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation. We included these results into supplementary information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) (subsection “Dysregulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by the FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis for tau 269 phosphorylation”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Two referees have concerns with the idea that the action of FcγRIIb is cell autonomous.

Moreover, unlike other FcγRs, levels of FcγRIIb mRNA (RT-PCR) and proteins were greatly increased at least 3 to 10 folds by Aβ treatment in primary cultured neurons and NeuN-positive neurons in AD brains. For these analyses, we tested almost all of commercially available and home-made FcγRIIb antibodies (more than 7 antibodies) and consistently found similar results using a few of the antibodies.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18691.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of FcγRIIb protein and mRNA in the purified neurons.</title><p>(<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>) Detection of FcγRIIb protein in NeuN- positive neurons of normal and AD patients by immunohistochemistry.

We are submitting a manuscript showing their functional differences in the neuropathologic activity in AD model to other journal and decided to show the results only to reviewer to support our current proposal.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18691.024</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Detection of neuron-enriched FcetIIb isoform, FcγRIIb2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-PCR analysis showing <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> mRNA in the purified neurons of WT and Fcgr2b KO brain and other tissues.

However, as you known well, generation of neuron-specific knockout (nsKO) mice of FcγRIIb and of FcγRIIb nsKO/3x AD double transgenic mice will take too long time (3 more years). Thus, as an alternative approach, we generated a dominant negative mutant of FcγRIIb (FcγRIIb DN; FcγRIIb-ΔCyto) lacking its cytoplasmic region (a.a. 232-300) and thus unable to transmit the signal into cells, and confirmed its protective activity in Aβ-induced neuronal cell death after its transient expression in neuronal cells (data not shown). We then generated a transgenic mouse expressing FcγRIIb- ΔCyto-HA under <italic>CamKIIα</italic> promoter, which drives neuron-specific expression of the transgene (Mayford et al., 1996) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4A</xref>). We confirmed apparent but low expression of FcγRIIb-ΔCyto-HA in the hippocampus and cortex of the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4B</xref>). To address neuropathic effect FcγRIIb in AD model mice, we next crossed the mice with 3xTg-AD model mice to generate 3xTg- AD/FcγRIIb-ΔCyto-HA double transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4C</xref>). The behavior tests of the mice showed that neuronal expression of FcγRIIb-ΔCyto-HA inhibited memory impairments of 3xTg-AD model mice in Y-maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4D</xref>). These results are essentially similar with the results observed in 3xTg-AD/FcγRIIb KO double transgenic mice, and suggest that neuronal function of FcγRIIb is critical for the memory impairments in the AD model mice. As we mentioned above, these results together with those of neuron-enriched FcγRIIb2 isoform are included in other manuscript and are thus presented only here to provide more convincing evidence to reviewer.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18691.025</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Neuron-specific effect of FcγRIIb-dominant negative mutant on memory function in the transgenic mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Construction of CamKIIα promoter-FcγRIIb deletion mutant lacking its cytoplasmic domain (∆232-300) (FcγRIIb DN).

[J. Neurosci. (2008)] created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of &gt;20,000 genes by gene profiling from astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Based on their list, FcγRIIb is significantly expressed in postnatal day 16 (P16) neurons and P17 forebrain. (2) Suemitsu et al. [Neuroscience (2010)] detected FcγRIIb protein in parvalbumin neurons, whereas FcγRIII and FcγRI proteins were detected in microglial cells.</p><p>In summary, we confirmed that, though neuronal expression is very low compared to non-neuronal cells, FcγRIIb is evidently expressed in neuronal cells as well. Again, please note that its expression is increased at least several folds in primary neurons by Aβ treatment and in AD brains compared to age-matched non- AD brains. Moreover, presence and distinct function of a neuron-enriched FcγRIIb2 provides more compelling evidence for the pathogenic role of FcγRIIb in AD.</p><p>While we have mainly focused on the role of neuronal FcγRIIb in tau pathology of AD model, we were also attempted to examine the role of FcγRIIb in the microglial activation in 3x Tg-AD mice. From immunohistochemical analysis, we identified that, compared to that of age-matched control mice, expression of Iba1, a microglia marker, was significantly reduced by <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 6A, B</xref>) and slightly in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 6A, C</xref>) of 3x Tg-AD mice. In addition, RT-PCR analysis showed that mRNAs of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1β, iNOS, and TNFα) were also decreased by <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO in 3x Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 6D</xref>). Though there is a tissue-specific difference, these observations suggest that ablation of FcγRIIb might reduce microglia activation in the brain of 3x Tg-AD mice. Unlike neuron-specific effects of FcγRIIb-ΔCyto-HA on tau phosphorylation and memory impairment seen in a transgenic mice expressing FcγRIIb-ΔCyto-HA, however, we do not think that the reduced inflammation by <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO in 3x Tg-AD mice is a direct cause of the memory rescue. At this moment, we do believe that the neuroinflammation via FcγRIIb also functions to contribute to the aggravation of memory impairment in AD mice, while we do not have evidence showing that the non-neuronal activity of FcγRIIb is solely responsible for the memory impairment. This role of FcγRIIb in the regulation of neuroinflammation is important and is worthwhile to pursue further in detail but is far away from our main story at this time. We showed these only to reviewers and discussed it in ‘Discussion’ as ‘data not shown’ (third paragraph).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18691.027</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Microglial activation is suppressed by <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO in 3x Tg-AD mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1 levels in the cortex and hippocampus of 7 month-old 3x Tg-AD and 3x Tg-AD/<italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO mice.

What happens in the cortex of these 3xTg mice where Aβ plaques should be present, is tau phosphorylation more pronounced there? And is that protected by FcγRIIb deficiency? Does the age of mice affect tau hyperphoshorylation, i.e. is tau pathology still absent in 3xTg FcγRIIb KO mouse even at a very advanced age when there are loads of Aβ?</italic> </p><p>In general, it is known that extracellular amyloid plaques were prominently detected over 12 month of age in 3x Tg-AD mouse model (Hirata-Fukae et al., 2008). Since we mostly analyzed tau phosphorylation at the age of 8-9 months, we performed additional experiments to identify the effect of FcγRIIb KO in more aged mice following the reviewer’s suggestion. While transgenic expression of human tau (detected by HT7 antibody) in 3x Tg-AD mice was not altered during aging, tau phosphorylation in 20 month-old 3x Tg-AD mice was heavily detected and occurred more than that of 6 month-old 3x Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1-Figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). Compared to 15 month-old 3x Tg-AD mice, the level of hyperphosphorylated tau was reduced by <italic>Fcgr2b</italic> KO in the same age of 3x Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, E</xref>). These results illustrate that tau phosphorylation mediated by FcγRIIb occurs at the onset of the disease and lasts to the late stage. We included these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (subsection “FcγRIIb is essential for tau hyperphosphorylation and memory deficit in 3xTg-AD mice”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> the authors analyze the effects of the receptor mutations on Aβ-induced cell death. &quot;Cell death was determined after 24h under fluorescence microscope&quot;.
