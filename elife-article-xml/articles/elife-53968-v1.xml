requires high frequency and specificity of integration at the genomic target site. Here, we describe a set of resources to streamline reporter gene knock-ins in zebrafish and demonstrate the broader utility of the method in mammalian cells. Our approach uses short homology of 24–48 bp to drive targeted integration of DNA reporter cassettes by homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) at high frequency at a double strand break in the targeted gene. Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence which enables in vivo liberation of the homology arms. We observed high rates of germline transmission (22–100%) for targeted knock-ins at eight zebrafish loci and efficient integration at safe harbor loci in porcine and human cells. Our system provides a straightforward and cost-effective approach for high efficiency gene targeting applications in CRISPR and TALEN compatible systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>knock-in</kwd><kwd>targeted integration</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>pig fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>end joining</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24OD020166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Essner</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrail</surname><given-names>Maura</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbs</surname><given-names>Drena L</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Essner</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Short homology arms exposed by CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage can target integration at genomic CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites at high frequencies with reproducible precision using pGTag vectors in zebrafish and mammalian cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Designer nucleases have rapidly expanded the way in which researchers can utilize endogenous DNA repair mechanisms for creating gene knock-outs, reporter gene knock-ins, gene deletions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epitope tagged alleles in diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beumer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geurts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). A single dsDNA break in the genome results in increased frequencies of recombination and promotes integration of homologous recombination (HR)-based vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasty et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Orr-Weaver et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rong and Golic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, in vitro or in vivo linearization of targeting vectors stimulates homology-directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasty et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Orr-Weaver et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rong and Golic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). Utilizing HDR or HR at a targeted double-strand break (DSB) allows directional knock-in of exogenous DNA with base pair precision, however, reported frequencies vary widely, and engineering targeting vectors with long homology arms is not straightforward.</p><p>Previous work has shown <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have the ability to join or recombine linear DNA molecules that contain short regions of homology at their ends, and this activity is likely mediated by exonuclease activity allowing base pairing of the resected homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grzesiuk and Carroll, 1987</xref>). More recently, it was shown in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, silkworm, zebrafish, and mouse cells that a plasmid donor containing short (≤40 bp) regions of homology to a genomic target site can promote precise integration at the genomic cut site when the donor plasmid is cut adjacent to the homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hisano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakade et al., 2014</xref>). Gene targeting in these studies is likely mediated by the alternative-end joining/microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway or by a single strand annealing (SSA) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceccaldi et al., 2016</xref>), collectively referred to as a homology mediated end joining (HMEJ). In contrast, in human cell culture, linear donors using a similar strategy with homologous ends have been reported to show inefficient integration until homology domains reach ~600 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting different repair pathways may predominate depending on cell type. In the initial reports using short regions of homology for in vivo gene targeting in zebrafish, the level of mosaicism in F0 injected animals was high, resulting in inefficient recovery of targeted alleles through the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hisano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakade et al., 2014</xref>). Most recently, studies in <italic>Drosophila </italic>show efficient integration of exogenous DNA in flies and S2 cells using 100 bp homology arms flanked by a CRISPR target site for in vivo homology liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanca et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these studies suggest a strategy that combines short homology flanked donors with in vivo homology arm liberation should lead to efficient precision targeting in zebrafish and mammalian cells.</p><p>Here, we present GeneWeld, a HMEJ strategy for targeted integration directed by short homology and demonstrate efficient germline transmission rates for recovery of targeted alleles in zebrafish. We provide a suite of donor vectors, called pGTag, that can be easily engineered with homologous sequences (hereafter called homology arms) to a gene of interest and a web interface for designing homology arms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genesculpt.org/gtaghd/">www.genesculpt.org/gtaghd/</ext-link>). We demonstrate that 24 or 48 base pairs of homology directly flanking cargo DNA promotes efficient gene targeting in zebrafish, pig, and human cells. Our results also suggest that longer homology arms up to 1 kb in length do not increase the frequency of on-target integration in zebrafish in comparison to 24 or 48 bp. Our experiments illustrate that Cas9 mediated in vivo release to expose homology on the knock-in cassette ends is integral for enhancing targeted integration. Using short homology-arm mediated end joining, we can achieve germline transmission rates averaging approximately 50% across several zebrafish loci when pre-selecting reporter-positive embryos to raise to adulthood. Southern blot analysis in the F1 generation reveals we can recover single copy integration alleles with precision at both 5’ and 3’ ends at high frequency, enabling efficient recovery of zebrafish with precise site-directed gene modifications. We present a strategy to delete and replace up to 48 kb of genomic DNA with a donor containing homology arms flanking two distal CRISPR/Cas9 sites in a gene. Finally, we show that short homology arm-directed targeted integration of a GFP reporter into safe harbor loci in porcine and human cells increased 10-fold in comparison to homologous recombination. The tools and methodology described here provide a tractable solution to creating precise targeted integrations and open the door for other genome editing strategies using short homology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single short homology domain drives efficient CRISPR targeted integration</title><p>To develop baseline gene targeting data, we engineered variable length homology domains to target <italic>noto,</italic> using a similar strategy to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hisano et al.

Taken together, these results suggest that our short homology arm targeting strategy promotes high efficiency integration in somatic tissue and allows endogenous gene expression patterns to be followed in living embryos.</p><p>Previous work in zebrafish indicated that longer homology arms (200 bp to 1 kb in length), in combination with restriction enzyme digestion either in vitro or in vivo to liberate a linear donor template, could promote efficient targeted integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). Using the pGTag vectors with UgRNA sites for in vivo homology arm liberation, we tested whether 1 kb long homology arms altered the efficiency of integration in comparison with 24 or 48 bp of short homology. Targeted integration of a 2A-TagRFP-CAAX-SV40 cassette into exon 2 of <italic>cx43.4</italic> with 24 and 48 bp homology arms resulted in 38–56% and 29–47% of injected embryos showing broad RFP expression throughout the nervous system and vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,f</xref>). Increasing the length of the 5’ and 3’ homology arms to 1 kb did not significantly change the frequency of RFP expression compared to 24 bp (p=0.1693) or 48 bp (p=0.6520) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), with 26–47% of injected embryos showing the expected neuronal and vascular RFP expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S2-S3).

For comparison with previous reports using in vitro liberation of long homology arm cassettes before injection, the 1 kb homology arm vector digested with restriction enzymes that cut within the homology arms, reducing the 5’ arm to approximately 900 bp and the 3’ homology arm to 700 bp. The linear DNA template was gel purified before injection. The frequency of RFP expressing embryos after injection of the linear 1 kb homology arm template was significantly reduced to approximately 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> Linear HR 1 kb; p=0.0111; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S2-S3).

The pGTag cassettes contain 2A-fluorescent protein or 2A-Gal4/VP16 reporters for visualizing integrated reporter expression in injected embryos.

Both CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN genomic sites are targeted with high efficiency, providing flexibility in design and increasing genome-wide accessibility.</p><p>Our initial targeting experiments at <italic>noto</italic> using a single 5’ homology arm and single <italic>noto</italic> sgRNA to target the genome and donor vector showed an increase in targeting efficiency as the length of the homology arm increased from 12 to 48 bp. However, when targeting was performed with homology on both sides of the cargo flanked by the universal UgRNA sites, short and long homology arms were equally efficient at targeted integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This may reflect enhanced efficiency of in vivo cargo liberation by the UgRNA. Positive integration events of tagged alleles are selected by fluorescence reporter expression, reflecting the endogenous pattern of expression of the targeted gene. Our observations indicate this correlates with predominantly precise integration events as analyzed by PCR and sequencing in both somatic tissue and through the germline. We speculate that inclusion of homology at the 3’ end of our cargo creates competition for the donor DNA ends, as not all editing events are precise at both 5’ and 3’ junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that precise events at the 3’ end could preclude precise integration at the 5’ end during some editing events, and vice versa. It is tempting to speculate that these data hint at synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) as a possible DNA repair mechanism for pGTag donor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceccaldi et al., 2016</xref>). After strand invasion using either of the homology domains and replication through the reporter, second DNA end capture may abort before or after replication through the opposing homology domain, resulting in imprecision, as greater than or equal to 150 bp is required for proper second end capture in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mehta et al., 2017</xref>). Our targeting results are similar to a recent study in zebrafish that reported short homology directed integration of a 2A fluorescent reporter near the termination codon at three genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Our study robustly demonstrates the short homology targeted integration strategy can be reproducibly applied at many loci to generate zebrafish knock-in mutations which transmit through the germline at high frequency.</p><p>Using two sgRNAs we attempted to simultaneously delete a section of the <italic>rb1</italic> gene and introduce a 2A-Gal4/VP16 reporter cassette to create a deletion tagged allele. While we found evidence of efficient deletion and tagging in F0 targeted embryos, we were unable to recover germline alleles. It is possible that the inability to recover <italic>rb1</italic> tagged alleles was due to the essential requirement for this tumor suppressor gene, in either somatic tissue or germline stem cells. Our previous targeted mutagenesis at <italic>rb1</italic> revealed it is necessary to significantly reduce the amount of TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA injected into the embryo in order to prevent complete bi-allelic inactivation and allow for recovery of viable mosaic adults that transmit indel mutations through the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Solin et al., 2015</xref>). Combined with previous work that indicates stem cells are susceptible to apoptosis following gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ihry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2018</xref>), these factors may have contributed to the lack of recovery of <italic>rb1</italic> deletion tagged alleles. Additional experiments at non-essential genes are needed to determine the efficiency of simultaneous gene deletion and tagging.</p><p>Previous studies in zebrafish examined whether homology arm length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shin et al., 2014</xref>) or in vivo I-SceI cleaved, linear templates with exposed homology arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>) would enhance targeting efficiency. We compared the effect of short and long homology arm length on targeted integration in somatic tissue using our pGTag vectors and targeting strategy. Increasing the <italic>cx43.4</italic> 5’ and 3’ homology arms to 1 kb did not result in a significant difference in targeting efficiency compared to vectors with short 24 bp or 48 bp homology arms, as assayed by fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, injection of the long homology arms vector without the universal sgRNA to liberate the arms effectively eliminated reporter expression and targeted integration. We also found there may be a significant disadvantage to long homology arms. Injection of the <italic>esama</italic> 2A-Gal4/VP16 vector with 1 kb homology arms led to nearly 100% of embryos showing widespread RFP expression, and 30–60% of embryos injected with circular plasmid alone were reporter positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results suggest long homology arms of intronic or intergenic sequences may contain repetitive elements that drive off-target integration across the genome. Alternatively, intronic promoters or enhancers could be unmasked by integration at ectopic sites, leading to high rates of false positives. Given the simple design, low cost, and ease of assembly of short homology arms, this approach may be preferable for most precision targeted integration experiments. However, further experiments are required at additional loci to determine whether the advantages of using short homology in targeting vectors represents a universal rule.</p><p>Our results show short homology arms are effective at directing precision targeted integration at CRISPR/Cas and TALEN sites in mammalian cells without selection by antibiotic resistance. Introducing a universal targeting vector with 48 bp homology arms into pig fibroblasts or human K562 cells lead to a 10-fold increase in targeted integration in comparison to a circular template that would integrate by homologous recombination. This is in contrast to previous studies in mammalian cells that indicated the frequency of targeted integration was not significantly enhanced until the length of homology arms was increased to 600 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect variation in experimental design or activity of DNA repair pathways in different cell types. Our results showing robust precision targeted integration using short homology arms in zebrafish and two mammalian cells lines suggest this simple, straightforward approach will be broadly applicable across species and model systems. In support of this, a recent study has shown 100 bp short homology arms and flanking CRISPR sgRNA sites efficiently directs targeted integration of DNA cassettes in<italic>Drosophila</italic>and S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanca et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown short homology arm directed targeted integration is highly efficient in zebrafish and mammalian cell lines. The simplicity of our strategy for building arms into the pGTag vectors, a universal guide to liberate the targeting cassette, and the GeneSculpt Suite website together will aid in streamlining targeted integration experimental design. Our vector suite provides a platform that can expand the zebrafish functional genomics toolkit for efficient site-directed modifications that create gene fusions, introduce cDNA variants, recombinases, or floxed gene-breaking cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2011</xref>) for conditional gene inactivation. Targeted integration will allow tagged or mutant genes to be expressed at endogenous levels and avoid ectopic or over-expression that can result from random transgene integration. These tools will broaden the use of designer nucleases for homology-based gene editing at CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN cut sites in zebrafish and mammalian cell lines. Our results open the door for more advanced genome edits in animal agriculture and human cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>anxa2a</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000003216</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>aqp1a1</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000023713</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>aqp8a1</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000045141</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>cx43.4</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000007099</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>esama</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000077039</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>flna</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000074201</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>kdrl</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000105215</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>mmp14a</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000002235</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>msna</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000058128</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>rb1</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000006782</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>s1pr1</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000042690</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tyr</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000039077</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vegfaa</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">ensemble: ENSDARG00000103542</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>AAVS1</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">HGCN:22 Adeno-Associated Virus Integration Site 1</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotin et al., 1992</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ROSA26</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Porcine homolog of mouse <italic>ROSA26</italic> safe harbor locus for transgene integration</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli)</italic></td><td valign="top">NEB Stable Competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">C3040I</td><td valign="top">Electrocompetent Cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli)</italic></td><td valign="top">One Shot TOP10 Chemically Competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher/Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">C404010</td><td valign="top">Electrocompetent Cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WIK</td><td valign="top">Zebrafish International Resource Center</td><td valign="top">ZIRC:ZL84</td><td valign="top">Wildtype strain of zebrafish</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(<italic>UAS:mRFP</italic>)<sup>tpl2</sup></td><td valign="top">Balciunas lab</td><td valign="top">Tg(<italic>miniTol2 &lt; 14XUAS:mRFP, γCry:GFP&gt;</italic>)<sup>tpl2</sup></td><td valign="top">Maintained in the lab of D.

sequences in zebrafish and mammalian cells. This approach combines the use of short homology arms with the deployment of universal CRISPR sgRNA sequences flanking reporter sequences that allows to expose homology arms in vivo. Along with the suite of vectors that facilitate adopting these approaches this work will stimulate genome engineering-based lines of research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Efficient targeted integration directed by short homology in zebrafish and mammalian cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the engineering of a homology directed repair platform for tagging loci after double strand breaks in zebrafish, pig and human cell lines. The authors demonstrate that short homology arms are ideal for targeting, with longer homology arms offering little advantage. Moreover, in vivo release of a double stranded donor with short homology arms is sufficient to drive targeted homology end joining (HMEJ) repair at high efficiency. The manuscript also reports a workaround for loci that are lowly expressed and thus difficult or impossible to directly screen for successful integration events by fluorescence: inserting a Gal4 instead of a fluorescent protein amplifies the signal in a UAS-FP zebrafish line and thus enables screening by fluorescence. The most interesting aspect of the work was the observation that 5' or 3' homology may compete for one another to reduce efficiency and possibly reduce for precise repair at these 5' and 3' ends.</p><p>Despite the fact that there are several previous published studies that have reported alternative approaches for achieving this task, precise gene editing is still a non-routine task for zebrafish labs due to low efficiency and imprecise integration. Thus, the combination of technological advancements in this area and the tools generated here that can be broadly shared will have a major impact on the zebrafish community as a whole, and also advance gene editing approaches in mammalian cells.</p><p>Therefore, although there was a discussion about the novelty and advance reported, the reviewers consider the manuscript in principle suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they have raised a number of questions and concerns that will need to be addressed before the manuscript can be published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Southern blots shown in Figure 4B, C should include images of higher molecular weight regions, to more fully assess potential off-targets integrations. Currently they are limited to ca. 8Kb.</p><p>2) The experiments presented in Figure 2F for <italic>cx43.4</italic> support the notion that when the Universal CRISPR sgRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 are co-injected with the donor construct to expose homology arms in vivo, increasing the length of homology arms to 1kb does not increase efficiency of integration based on reporter expression in F0. However, the experiments comparing the circular and in vitro linearized construct with the same homology arms of 1kb require providing further detail and discussion.</p><p>In particular, it is not clear where in the donor construct was the cut introduced to linearize the HR construct? The in vitro linearized constructs appear to have overhangs that are non-homologous to the target locus (based on what could be deduced from the Materials and methods). Shin et al., 2014 carried systematic comparison of integration efficiency of circular or in vitro linearized at various positions, HR constructs, concluding that internal cuts within homology arms increase efficiency over a circular donor. The current work that introduces cuts in vivo and exposes homology arms is consistent with these results. Therefore, assessing the effect of different cut sites as well as in vitro/in vivo generation of linear ends will be important to clarify what works best. This can be done by assessing reporter expression in F0, without studying germline transmission.</p><p>3) An inherent problem of all studies published on CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies: in the absence of data providing direct cross-comparisons of different strategies it is difficult to compare the reported efficiencies across different approaches/research groups, and thus not possible to judge for a reviewer (or reader) whether this technique will really be superior compared to others. In this manuscript, the authors do provide some level of comparison by comparing with uncut and long homology arms and mention other studies in their discussion. However, this should be extended. For example, the study by Luo et al., 2018, appears overall very similar apart from targeting the last exon. If the same gRNAs have been used in the past by other reports, a direct comparison of efficiencies would be helpful.</p><p>4) A general comment on how well your genome targeted CRISPR or TALEN reagents worked to target double strand break at each locus will be helpful. I feel many do not grasp how important the genome targeted double strand break is for HDR/HMEJ. Please add in these data and highlight in the Results.</p><p>5) Subsection “Dual homology arm liberation directs precise 5’ and 3’ integration in somatic tissue”: This reads like a formal observation of multiple highly speculative molecular events. Please revise accordingly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Efficient targeted integration directed by short homology in zebrafish and mammalian cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>Your revised manuscript largely addressed the reviewers' questions and concerns.

Indeed, as noted by the reviewers, universal precision genome editing requires a higher bar of demonstrating the ability to generate protein fusions. The authors cite in their letter &quot;manuscript&quot; in preparation and note &quot;Our preliminary studies show the frequency of precision integration is reduced with these vectors, however, precise integration events can be recovered when screening higher numbers of F0s. We are assembling all of our data to provide a rigorous analysis of these observations prior to publication.&quot; Therefore, this rigorous analysis of precise integration events for generating protein fusions is needed before the efficiencies of short and long homology arms for this endpoint can be compared.</p><p>2) Therefore, the above considerations should be added to the Discussion following the section comparing the short and long homology arms efficiency.</p><p>3) The major and exciting advance of the approach is the combination of using short homology arms AND releasing short homology arms of the injected donor constructs in vivo, but this is not clearly stated in the Abstract.

We do believe that this approach along with our junction fragment analysis is rigorous for the short homology arms, just not the comparisons between longer and shorter homology arms. We have added the following sentence to emphasize this in the Results and Discussion:</p><p>In the Results: “For fluorescence to be detected, the integrated reported gene is required to be in frame with the open reading frame of <italic>noto</italic>.”</p><p>In the Discussion: “However, further experiments are required at additional loci to determine whether the advantages of using short homology in targeting vectors represents a universal rule.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Therefore, the above considerations should be added to the Discussion following the section comparing the short and long homology arms efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The major and exciting advance of the approach is the combination of using short homology arms AND releasing short homology arms of the injected donor constructs in vivo, but this is not clearly stated in the Abstract. Please consider revising the following sentence &quot;Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence to target double strand breaks in vivo and expose homology arms” &quot;Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence enabling to expose in vivo homology arms and target double strand breaks.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have incorporated the following sentence “Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence which enables in vivo exposure of the homology arms.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
