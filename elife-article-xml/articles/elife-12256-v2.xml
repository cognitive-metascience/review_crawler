They link homologous DNA strands and have to be faithfully removed for proper DNA segregation and genome integrity. Here, we present the crystal structure of human HJ resolvase GEN1 complexed with DNA at 3.0 Å resolution. The GEN1 core is similar to other Rad2/XPG nucleases. However, unlike other members of the superfamily, GEN1 contains a chromodomain as an additional DNA interaction site. Chromodomains are known for their chromatin-targeting function in chromatin remodelers and histone(de)acetylases but they have not previously been found in nucleases. The GEN1 chromodomain directly contacts DNA and its truncation severely hampers GEN1’s catalytic activity. Structure-guided mutations in vitro and in vivo in yeast validated our mechanistic findings. Our study provides the missing structure in the Rad2/XPG family and insights how a well-conserved nuclease core acquires versatility in recognizing diverse substrates for DNA repair and maintenance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12256.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12256.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12256.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Factors like ultraviolet radiation and harmful chemicals can damage DNA inside living cells, which can lead to breaks that form across both strands in the DNA double helix. “Homologous recombination” is one of the major mechanisms by which cells repair these double-strand breaks. During this process, the broken DNA interacts with another undamaged copy of the DNA to form a special four-way structure called a “Holliday junction”. The intact DNA strands are then used as templates to repair the broken strands. However, once this has occurred the Holliday junction needs to be ‘resolved’ so that the DNA strands can disentangle.</p><p>One way in which Holliday junctions are resolved is through the introduction of precise symmetrical cuts in the DNA at the junction by an enzyme that acts like a pair of molecular scissors. Re-joining these cut strands then fully restores the DNA. Enzymes that generate the cuts in DNA are called nucleases, and the nuclease GEN1 is crucial for resolving Holliday junctions in organisms such as fungi, plants and animals. GEN1 belongs to a family of enzymes that act on various types of DNA structures that are formed either during damage repair, DNA duplication or cell division. However, GEN1 is the only enzyme in the family that can also recognize a Holliday junction and it was unclear why this might be.</p><p>Lee et al. have now used a technique called X-ray crystallography to solve the three-dimensional structure of the human version of GEN1 bound to a Holliday junction. This analysis revealed that many features in GEN1 resemble those found in other members of the same nuclease family. These features include two surfaces of the protein that bind to DNA and are separated by a wedge, which introduces a sharp bend in the DNA. However, Lee et al. also found that GEN1 contains an additional region known as a “chromodomain” that further anchors the enzyme to the DNA. The chromodomain allows GEN1 to correctly position itself against DNA molecules, and without the chromodomain, GEN1’s ability to cut DNA in a test tube was severely impaired. Further experiments showed that the chromodomain was also important for GEN1’s activity in yeast cells growing under stressed conditions.</p><p>The discovery of a chromodomain in this human nuclease may provide many new insights into how GEN1 is regulated, and further work could investigate if this chromodomain is also involved in binding to other proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12256.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12256.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Holliday junction resolvase</kwd><kwd>GEN1</kwd><kwd>chromodomain</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>protein-DNA complex</kwd><kwd>Yen1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Max Planck Research Group Leader Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Shun-Hsiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Klügel</surname><given-names>Maren Felizitas</given-names></name><name><surname>Biertümpfel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Otto Hahn Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Princz</surname><given-names>Lissa Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MPI of Biochemistry</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Habermann</surname><given-names>Bianca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of human Holliday junction resolvase GEN1 in complex with DNA reveals a conserved chromodomain as an additional DNA-anchoring point that opens new perspectives for enzyme regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is a fundamental pathway ensuring genome integrity and genetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heyer, 2015</xref>). In mitotic cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by HR using the sister chromatid as a template to restore the information in the complementary double strand. In meiosis, the repair of programmed DSBs by HR and the formation of crossovers are crucial to provide physical linkages between homologs and to segregate homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, HR during meiosis creates sequence diversity in the offspring through the exchange between homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petronczki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarbajna and West, 2014</xref>).</p><p>HR proceeds by pathways that may lead to the formation of DNA four-way junctions or Holliday junctions (HJs) that physically link two homologous DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holliday, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szostak et al., 1983</xref>). Faithful removal of HJs is critical to avoid chromosome aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wechsler et al., 2011</xref>) and cells have evolved sophisticated measures to disentangle joint molecules. One basic mechanism is resolution mediated by HJ resolvases that introduce precise symmetrical nicks into the DNA at the branch point. Nicked DNA strands are then rejoined by endogenous ligases leading to fully restored or recombined DNA strands. This mechanism is well studied for bacterial and bacteriophage resolvases such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RuvC, T7 endonuclease I, T4 endonuclease VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benson and West, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lilley and White, 2001</xref>). These resolvases operate as dimers and show a large degree of conformational flexibility in substrate recognition and in aligning both active sites for coordinated cleavage. Interestingly, T4 endonuclease VII and RuvC reach into and widen the DNA junction point whereas T7 endonuclease I binds DNA by embracing HJs at the branch point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biertümpfel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Górecka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hadden et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, HR is more complex and tightly regulated. In somatic cells, HJ dissolution by a combined action of a helicase and a topoisomerase (BLM-TOPIIIα-RMI1-RMI2 complex in humans) is generally the favored pathway, possibly to restore the original (non-crossover) DNA arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Putnam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu and Hickson, 2003</xref>). In contrast, HJ resolution generates crossover and non-crossover arrangements depending on cleavage direction. Several endonucleases such as GEN1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1-SLX4 have been implicated as HJ resolvases in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fekairi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muñoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Svendsen and Harper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Svendsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, these resolvases are not structurally related and have different domain architectures, giving rise to variable DNA recognition and regulation mechanisms. The interplay between resolution and dissolution mechanisms is not fully understood yet, however, cell cycle regulation of resolvases seems to play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eissler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>GEN1 belongs to the Rad2/XPG family of structure-selective nucleases that are conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lieber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang, 2011</xref>). The Rad2/XPG family has four members with different substrate preferences that function in DNA maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</xref>). They share a conserved N-terminal domain (XPG-N), an internal domain (XPG-I) and a 5’-&gt;3’ exonuclease C-terminal domain containing a conserved helix-hairpin-helix motif. C-terminal to the nuclease core is a regulatory region that is diverse in sequence and predicted to be largely unstructured. Although the catalytic cores are well conserved in the superfamily, substrate recognition is highly diverse: XPG/Rad2/ERCC5 recognizes bubble/loop structures during nucleotide-excision repair (NER), FEN1 cleaves flap substrates during Okazaki fragment processing in DNA replication, EXO1 is a 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease that is involved in HR and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and GEN1 recognizes Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grasby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tomlinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</xref>). A common feature of the superfamily is their inherent ability to recognize flexible or bendable regions in the normally rather stiff DNA double helix. Interestingly, GEN1 shows versatile substrate recognition accommodating 5’ flaps, gaps, replication fork intermediates and Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ishikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanai et al., 2007</xref>). According to the current model, however, the primary function of GEN1 is HJ resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarbajna and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">West et al., 2015</xref>) and it is suggested to be a last resort for the removal of joint molecules before cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To date, structural information is available for all members of the family but GEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miętus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). A unified feature of these structures is the presence of two DNA-binding interfaces separated by a hydrophobic wedge. This wedge is composed of two protruding helices that induce a sharp bend into flexible DNA substrates. Rad2/XPG family members also share a helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif that binds and stabilizes the uncleaved DNA strand downstream of the catalytic center. However, the comparison of DNA recognition features within the Rad2/XPG family has been hampered because of the lack of structural information on GEN1.</p><p>To understand the molecular basis of GEN1's substrate recognition, we determined the crystal structure of human GEN1 in complex with HJ DNA. In combination with mutational and functional analysis using in vitro DNA cleavage assays and in vivo survival assays with mutant yeast strains, we highlight GEN1’s sophisticated DNA recognition mechanism. We found that GEN1 does not only have the classical DNA recognition features of Rad2/XPG nucleases, but also contains an additional DNA interaction site mediated by a chromodomain. In the absence of the chromodomain, GEN1’s catalytic activity was severely impaired. This is the first example showing the direct involvement of a chromodomain in a nuclease. Our structural analysis gives implications for a safety mechanism using an adjustable hatch for substrate discrimination and to ensure coordinated and precise cleavage of Holliday junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination and architecture of the GEN1-DNA complex</title><p>In order to structurally characterize human GEN1, we crystallized the catalytically inactive variant GEN1<sup>2-505 D30N</sup>, denoted GEN1 for simplicity, in complex with an immobile Holliday junction having arm lengths of 10 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The structure was determined experimentally and refined up to 3.0 Å resolution with an R<sub>free</sub> of 0.25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The HJ crystallized bridging between two protein monomers in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The overall structure of GEN1 resembles the shape of a downwards-pointing right hand with a 'thumb' extending out from the 'palm' and the DNA is packed against the ball of the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The palm contains the catalytic core, which is formed by intertwined XPG-N and XPG-I domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>, green). They consist of a seven-stranded β-sheet in the center surrounded by nine helices harboring the conserved active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B/D</xref>, orange). The catalytic residues form a cluster of negatively charged residues (D30, E75, E134, E136, D155, D157, D208) that were originally identified by mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wakasugi et al., 1997</xref>) and are conserved in other Rad2/XPG family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B/C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The XPG-I domain is followed by a 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease C-terminal domain (EXO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B/D</xref>, blue). The EXO domain consists of a helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif (helices α10-α11) accompanied by several α-hairpins (α12-α13 and α14-α15). A similar arrangement is also found in other proteins, which use a H2TH motif for non-sequence specific DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tomlinson et al., 2010</xref>). The EXO domain in GEN1 has a 78 amino acid insertion (residues 245–322), of which only helix α12b (residues 308–322) is ordered in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, gray and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Helix α12b packs loosely with the H2TH helices (α10-α11) and helix α12 at the 'finger' part of GEN1. Yeast Rad2, a homolog of human XPG, also contains helix α12b, and it shows a similar arrangement as in GEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The EXO domain sandwiches the XPG-N/I domains with a long linker reaching from the bottom 'fingers' (α10-α13) along the backside of GEN1 to the top of the XPG-N/I domains at the 'wrist' (α14-α15). A structure-based sequence alignment of the nuclease core of human GEN1, FEN1, EXO1 and yeast Rad2 proteins with functional annotations relates sequence conservation to features in the Rad2/XPG family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The comparison with members in the Rad2/XPG identified two DNA binding interfaces and a hydrophobic wedge (ball of the thumb) that separates the upstream and the downstream interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C/D</xref> and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We found many hits for different chromo- and chromo-shadow domains with root mean square deviations between 1.9 and 2.8 Å (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). A superposition of the aromatic cage of the five structurally most similar proteins with GEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) showed that residues W418, T438, and E440 are well conserved, whereas two residues at the rim of the canonical binding cleft are changed from phenylalanine/tyrosine to a leucine (L397) in one case and a proline (P421) in another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Instead, Y424 occupies the space proximal to P421, which is about 1.5 Å outwards of the canonical cage and widens the GEN1 cage slightly. The substitution of phenylalanine/tyrosine to leucine is also found in CBX chromo-shadow domains (see below); however, the rest of the GEN1 aromatic cage resembles rather chromodomains.</p><p>Chromodomains often recognize modified lysines through their aromatic cage thus targeting proteins to chromatin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eissenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yap and Zhou, 2011</xref>). Given the conserved aromatic cage in GEN1, we tested the binding to modified histone tail peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C/D</xref>). However, we did not detect any binding despite extensive efforts using various histone tail peptides in pull-down assays, microscale-thermophoresis (MST) or fluorescence anisotropy measurements (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our structure shows that the aromatic cage is closed by helix α15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> blue/pink), which has a hydrophobic interface towards the aromatic cage with residues L376, T380, and M384 reaching into it (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The GEN1 chromodomain was found to be distantly related to the CDY chromodomains and chromobox proteins, particularly to the chromo-shadow domains of CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5. This agrees with the result from the DALI search, in which CBX chromo-shadow domains and homologs thereof were among the closest structural matches. Together with the observed differences in residues forming the aromatic cage, it indicates that the GEN1 chromodomain forms a new subgroup with features from chromo- and chromo-shadow domains that emerged from a common ancestor within CBX/CDY proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>GEN1-DNA interactions</title><p>The GEN1-HJ structure revealed that the upstream DNA-binding interface acts as a docking site for double-stranded DNA and that the chromodomain secures its position.

This β-hairpin interacts with the complementary DNA strand by matching the protein backbone (residues 406–411) to the contour of the DNA backbone in a sequence unspecific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A/E</xref>). The side chains of K404 and R406 project out, and they are in hydrogen bonding distance to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Remarkably, R408 forms a polar interaction with Q65, which establishes a connection between the DNA contact point at the chromodomain and the nuclease core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The interactions at the chromodomain extend the upstream DNA-binding interface to cover a full DNA turn, reinforcing the binding.</p><p>The downstream binding interface can be inferred from other Rad2/XPG structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C/F</xref>) as the nuclease core is well conserved in GEN1, FEN1, Rad2 and EXO1 (root mean square deviations of 0.9–1.1 Å for 161 Cα atoms, respectively). The residues corresponding to the tip of the thumb (residues 79–92), which are disordered in the GEN1 structure, likely form helix α4 upon DNA binding to the downstream interface as seen in human FEN1 and EXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). The missing residues in GEN1 have 35.7% identity and 78.6% similarity (BLOSUM62 matrix) to the corresponding residues in FEN1 (90–103), which form helix α4 in the FEN1-DNA complex (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The same region is disordered in FEN1 when no DNA is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates that also GEN1 undergoes such a disorder-to-order transition to form an arch with helices α4 and α6 upon substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2012</xref>) and similar to the arrangement in T5 FEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ceska et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The activity of GEN1 depends on correct DNA positioning</title><p>GEN1 has versatile substrate recognition features, ranging from gaps, flaps, replication fork intermediates to HJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ishikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanai et al., 2007</xref>).

According to our structure, R54 in helix α3 at the upstream interface fixes the substrate position by reaching into the minor DNA groove and we observed that R54E had a strongly reduced cleavage activity (~50%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating a key role in substrate positioning.</p><p>Residue C36 in helix α2 points towards the downstream interface and likely contacts the DNA upon binding (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The corresponding FEN1 Y40, is a key residue stacking with the -1 base of the 5’ flap at the FEN1 active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we tested the cleavage ability of a GEN1<sup>C36E</sup> and found that the mutant protein had completely lost its enzymatic activity for both, HJ and 5’ flap cleavage, to the same degree as the active site modification D30N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This effect is stronger than for FEN1<sup>Y40A</sup>, which showed only a partial loss in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that C36 provides a polar interface for orienting and guiding the cleaved strand towards the active site and the lower gateway.</p><p>We further tested a glutamate modification of the superfamily-conserved R89 and R93 located in the disordered part continuing to helix α6, presumably forming an arch (see above). The arch was shown to facilitate cleavage by clamping flap substrates in FEN1 and the modification R100A showed a strong decrease in the cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). The GEN1 R89E mutation, corresponding to residue R100 in FEN1, showed that the activity of GEN1 with a HJ substrate was not altered. In the case of a 5’ flap substrate, cleavage was slightly reduced and it reached to the full level at enzyme concentrations higher than 10 nM. The effect of the R93E modification was even less pronounced compared to R89E. In contrast, the cleavage of both 5’ flap and HJ substrates depended strongly on F110 at helix α6 (thumb), which points towards the active site. An F110E modification showed a reduction in cleavage by 25% for HJ substrates, and the effect was even stronger for 5’ flap substrates, where the activity is reduced by 65%. The equivalent position in FEN1 is V133 showing a critical involvement in stabilizing 5’ flap DNA by orienting the -1 nucleotide for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). We have also tested the effect of modifying H109, which neighbors the critical F110. Even though it points away from the active site, a glutamate at this position reduced 5’ flap cleavage to 83% and HJ cleavage recovered only at high substrate concentrations of 256 nM. Overall, the results suggest that F110 has a key position for DNA recognition and processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Coordinated cleavage of HJs</title><p>Classical HJ resolvases introduce two symmetrical incisions across the junction point by coordinating the action of two active sites. The first nick is rate-limiting and the second one takes place near-simultaneously and within the lifetime of the resolvase-DNA complex. This mechanism has been well studied for bacterial and bacteriophage HJ resolvases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fogg and Lilley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giraud-Panis and Lilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pottmeyer and Kemper, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shah et al., 1997</xref>). Hence, it is thought that also GEN1 dimerizes upon binding to HJ substrates as indicated by coordinated cleavage and by an increase in hydrodynamic radius compared to protein alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rass et al., 2010</xref>). In order to further examine the effect of GEN1 modifications on HJ cleavage, we used a cruciform plasmid cleavage assay to evaluate GEN1’s nicking function, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Here, the plasmid pIRbke8<sup>mut</sup> served as a substrate that contains an inverted-repeat sequence extruding a cruciform structure when supercoiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lilley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rass et al., 2010</xref>). Coordinated dual incision of the cruciform (by a dimer) leads to linear duplex products with slow migration, whereas uncoordinated cleavage (by monomeric enzymes) results in nicked plasmids that migrate even slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Cruciform structures are reabsorbed when the superhelical stress is released upon single nicking and the DNA cannot serve as a substrate anymore.</p><p>We observed that wild type GEN1 resolved cruciform structures into linear products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rass et al., 2010</xref>). GEN1<sup>C36E</sup> (downstream interface) and GEN1<sup>R54E</sup> (upstream interface) showed only residual activity confirming their importance for HJ cleavage. The cruciform cleavage by F110E (thumb) was strongly reduced in line with our nuclease assays using small DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). GEN1<sup>R89E</sup> (disordered part of the arch) did not show any appreciable effect, which suggests that this part of the arch is not directly involved in HJ recognition. Taken together, our results suggest that the positioning of HJ junction substrates both at the upper and the lower gateway is critical for productive cleavage. Furthermore, none of the tested modifications at the different DNA interaction interfaces was able to uncouple the coordinated HJ cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The chromodomain of GEN1 facilitates efficient substrate cleavage</title><p>Agreeing with the structural significance for DNA binding, the truncation of the chromodomain (Δchromo, residues 2-389) showed a severe reduction (~3-fold) in HJ cleavage activity whereas all longer GEN1 fragments containing the chromodomain (2-464, 2-505 and 2-551) showed full activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of the chromodomain truncation is even more pronounced for 5’ flap DNA cleavage than for HJs, showing a 7-fold reduction compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The activity of GEN1 in the plasmid-based cruciform cleavage assay was also severely hampered in the absence of the chromodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) showing only a weak band for linear products and no increase for nicked plasmid, emphasizing the importance of the chromodomain for GEN1 activity.</p><p>Further, to test the influence of the positively charged side chains K404 and R406 on DNA binding, we introduced charge-reversal mutations to glutamates and assessed their nuclease activities. Even though K404 and R406 are within hydrogen-bonding distance to the DNA, K404E, and R406E showed no appreciable influence on GEN1’s nuclease activity. Only a slight reduction in cleavage of 5’ flap substrates was observed for GEN1<sup>R406E</sup>, whereas the processing of HJ substrates was not altered significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This reinforces the conclusion from our structural observations that the chromodomain and the DNA interact through their backbones via van-der-Waals interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Influence of phosphorylation-mimicking chromodomain modifications</title><p>PhosphoSitePlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hornbeck et al., 2014</xref>) lists two phosphorylation sites at residues T380 and T438 in GEN1 that were found in a T-cell leukemia and a glioblastoma cell line. These residues are located in helix α15 and at the rim of the aromatic cage, respectively. Both phosphorylation sites are positioned to interrupt hydrophobic interactions between helix α15 and the chromodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Therefore, we tested if the phosphorylation-mimicking modifications T380E and T438E had an effect on GEN1’s activity. At low enzyme concentrations (&lt;50 nM) HJ cleavage was similar to that of wild-type protein but at high concentrations the activity declined to less than 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). For a 5’ flap substrate, the assay showed consistently lower activity than wild type, recovering to about 80% cleavage at the highest enzyme concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylation of GEN1 chromodomain residues may regulate DNA recognition and cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Physiological relevance of GEN1 interactions</title><p>To test the physiological relevance of the identified GEN1-DNA interactions, we investigated the survival of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutant strains expressing variants of Yen1 (GEN1 homolog) after treatment with the DNA-damaging agent MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">source data 2</xref>). All Yen1 variants were expressed to a similar degree as endogenous Yen1, which was confirmed by Western Blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Because of the functional overlap of Mus81 and Yen1 in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco et al., 2010</xref>) a double knockout (<italic>yen1Δ mus81Δ</italic>) was used and complemented with different variants of <italic>Yen1</italic>.</p><p>The control strain, complemented with wild type Yen1, survived MMS concentrations of up to 0.01%, consistent with the described hypersensitivity of <italic>mus81Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Interthal and Heyer, 2000</xref>). In stark contrast, cells containing either the active site mutant Yen1-D41N (corresponding to GEN1<sup>D30N</sup>) or the downstream interface mutant Yen1-F47E (corresponding to GEN1<sup>C36E</sup>) did not grow even at an MMS concentration as low as 0.0025% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). After the expression of the upstream interface mutant Yen1-I97E (corresponding to GEN1<sup>R54E</sup>) cells showed a slight but significant growth defect at high MMS concentrations (see panels for 0.0075% and 0.01% MMS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results are therefore consistent with the in vitro cleavage results carried out with GEN1 mutants and showing a reduction in activity for R54E and no activity for C36E (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As a last mutant in the nuclease core, we tested the K298E mutation which is located in helix α10 of the H2TH motif in the downstream DNA-binding interface, and for which we were unable to obtain the corresponding GEN1<sup>K219E</sup> modification for cleavage assays (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This mutant displayed a strong sensitivity towards MMS but lower than the one observed for the catalytic mutant, indicating that the mutant was partially functional in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the effect of mutations in the aromatic cage of Yen1's chromodomain (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and found that their severity was strongly position dependent. Mutation of R486E and Y487A in Yen1, both of which are located near the base of the cage, corresponding to the W418 position in GEN1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), showed a strong effect on MMS sensitivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), similar to the one observed for the catalytic mutant, presumably due to a dysfunctional chromodomain. In contrast, mutations located further outside of the core (F478A and K484E) led to a less pronounced MMS sensitivity. The same was true for the K469E variant, which corresponds to position R406 at the chromodomain-DNA interface in GEN1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>), and for residues at the rim of the chromodomain (<italic>yen1-N526A, yen1-L528D</italic> and <italic>yen1-W529A</italic>), consistent with our in vitro observation for GEN1<sup>T438E</sup> (slightly reduced activity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). No effect on MMS sensitivity was detected for <italic>yen1-L530A</italic>, which corresponds to a conserved glutamate in chromodomains (E440 in GEN1). Lastly, we found that the deletion of the chromodomain (Yen1-Δ452–560) lead to a severe phenotype comparable to the active site mutant Yen1-D41N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). The Yen1 variant lacking the chromodomain was expressed to levels similar to the full-length protein and we therefore conclude that the chromodomain is crucial for the function of Yen1. Taken together, the functional data of Yen1 mutants in vivo and GEN1 mutants in vitro point towards an essential and evolutionary conserved role of the chromodomain in GEN1/Yen1 proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Implications of the chromodomain</title><p>The structure of the human GEN1 catalytic core provides the missing structural information in the Rad2/XPG family. The GEN1 structure complements recent reports on the structures of Rad2, EXO1 and FEN1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miętus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Thereby, it gives insights how relatively conserved nuclease domains recognize diverse substrates in a structure-selective manner and act in different DNA maintenance pathways. In comparison with other Rad2/XPG nucleases, GEN1 shows many modifications on common structural themes that give the ability to recognize a diverse set of substrates including replication fork intermediates and HJs. The upstream DNA interface of GEN1 lacks the 'acid block' found in FEN1, instead it has a prominent groove at the same position (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 'upper gate') with a strategically positioned R54 nearby. Furthermore, the helical arch in GEN1 misses helix α5, which forms a cap structure in FEN1 and EXO1 that stabilizes 5’ overhangs for cleavage. These features have implications for the recognition and cleavage of HJ substrates (see below). The most striking difference to other Rad2/XPG family members is that the GEN1 nuclease core is extended by a chromodomain, which provides an additional DNA anchoring point for the upstream DNA-binding interface. The evolutionarily conserved chromodomain is important for efficient substrate cleavage as we showed using truncation and mutation analyses. This finding opens new perspectives for the regulation of GEN1 and for its interactions with other proteins. Chromodomains serve as chromatin-targeting modules (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eissenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yap and Zhou, 2011</xref>), general protein interaction elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smothers and Henikoff, 2000</xref>) as well as dimerization sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cowieson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2011</xref>). These possibilities are particularly interesting, as chromatin targeting of proteins via chromodomains has been implicated in the DNA damage response. The chromatin remodeler CHD4 is recruited in response to DNA damage to decondense chromatin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O’Shaughnessy and Hendrich, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stanley et al., 2013</xref>). The chromodomains in CHD4 distinguish the histone modifications H3K9me3 and H3K9ac and determine the way how downstream DSB repair takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Price and D’Andrea, 2013</xref>). It is plausible that GEN1 uses its chromodomain not only as a structural module to securely bind DNA but also for targeting or regulatory purposes. Even though it was not possible to find any binding partner with a series of tested histone tail peptides, we cannot exclude that the chromodomain is used as an interaction motif or chromatin reader. It will therefore be interesting to extend our interaction analysis to a larger number of peptides and proteins. Interestingly, the modifications GEN1<sup>L397E</sup> and GEN1<sup>Y424A</sup> at the rim of the chromodomain did not alter DNA cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), however, mutations of residues at the rim of Yen1’s chromodomain show a phenotype, suggesting an additional role like binding to an endogenous factor.</p><p>Another intriguing aspect of the chromodomain is that the conserved T438 at the rim of the aromatic cage and T380 at the closing helix α15 are both part of a casein kinase II consensus sequence for phosphorylation (Ser/Thr-X-X-Asp/Glu). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayoub et al., 2008</xref> showed that the analogous threonine in the chromodomain of CBX1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and phosphorylation disrupts the binding to H3K9me. We observed a reduction in DNA cleavage activity for the phosphorylation mimicking mutations T380E and T438E, which may suggest a regulatory role. They might function together and in combination with other modifications to provide a way of functional switching at the chromodomain. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eissler et al., 2014</xref> recently identified several CDK phosphorylation sites in an insertion in the Yen1 chromodomain which affects HJ cleavage and together with phosphorylation of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the regulatory domain restricts Yen1’s activity to anaphase. The insertion is not found in other chromodomains and it is extended in Yen1 compared to GEN1, which is lacking these phosphorylation sites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A/B</xref>). Notably, the activity of Yen1 is negatively regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eissler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matos et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the chromodomain is targeted by cell cycle kinases. It also provides a likely explanation for the different regulatory mechanisms found in GEN1 and Yen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanco and Matos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matos and West, 2014</xref>). Exploration of the regulatory function of the GEN1 chromodomain will be an important topic to follow up, and this may lead to the understanding of the precise regulation mechanism of GEN1 as well as its substrate recognition under physiological conditions.</p><p>It is noteworthy that our analysis also revealed that the human transcription modulator AEBP2, which is associated with the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2), contains a chromo-barrel domain, which, to our knowledge, has not been reported so far.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recognition of DNA substrates</title><p>The GEN1-DNA structure showed a considerable similarity to the other members of the Rad2/XPG family, and this facilitated the generation of a combined model to understand substrate recognition of GEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This was done by superimposing the protein part of the FEN1-DNA complex (PDB 3q8k) onto our GEN1 structure and extending the DNA accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A/B</xref>). Remarkably, the superimposition of the proteins aligns the DNA from the FEN1 structure in the same register as the DNA in the GEN1 complex at the upstream interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and 6B</xref> insert). Furthermore, the free 5’ and 3’ ends of the double flap DNA from the FEN1 structure point towards the lower and the upper gateway in GEN1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We extended the GEN1 structure by homology modeling of the disordered residues 79-92 (helix α4) in GEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition to the similarity of this part to FEN1, the model readily showed the arrangement forming an arch structure. This would explain why GEN1 recognizes 5’ flap substrates efficiently, analogous to FEN1, as the arch can clamp a single-stranded DNA overhang for productive cleavage. This also explains why the F110E modification in the arch at helix α6 hampered 5’ flap cleavage severely. The side chain points directly towards the active site and likely disturbs the stabilization of a 5’ overhang for catalysis by charge repulsion. However, there are two features in GEN1 that vary from the arrangement in FEN1 and EXO1 considerably. Helix α6 is longer (24 instead of 15 residues) and helix α5 is missing in GEN1. As a result the arch points away from the DNA rather than forming a 'cap' structure as it is observed in FEN1 and EXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the modified arch in GEN1 provides an opening, marked as 'lower gate' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.

By pointing away from the active site the arch provides an opening to accommodate unpaired, single-stranded DNA to pass along the arch at the lower gate (groove between α2 and α4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> 'lower gate') from one GEN1 monomer to the upper gate (groove between α2-α3 and α14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> 'upper gate') of the other within a GEN1 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B/C</xref>). R54 is perfectly positioned at the minor groove to guide the second cleavage strand to pass through the upper gate (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B/C</xref>, marked with a asterisk). In FEN1, this position is occupied by the 'acid block', which stabilizes a single 3’ flap of the unpaired substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>) and it would not accommodate longer 3’ DNA overhangs. In our model, two GEN1 monomers come together crosswise upon HJ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The helical arches of both proteins likely provide additional protein-protein interactions as well as protein-DNA contacts by packing against the backbone of opposite DNA arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As a result, the GEN1 dimer orients both active sites symmetrically across the junction point resembling the situation in bacterial RuvC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and West, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Górecka et al., 2013</xref>). This arrangement would ensure that both incisions are introduced within the lifetime of the GEN1-HJ complex as observed biochemically by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rass et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanism likely works in a coordinated nick-and-counter-nick fashion, as shown for bacterial or bacteriophage HJ resolvases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fogg and Lilley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giraud-Panis and Lilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pottmeyer and Kemper, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shah et al., 1997</xref>) and recently for GEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and West, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The distance between both gates is bridged by unpaired bases in our GEN1-HJ model. This view is supported by the observation that FEN1 unpairs two bases near the active site through interactions with the hydrophobic wedge leading to strongly bent DNA arms between the upstream and downstream DNA interfaces. This mechanism seems to be a common feature of Rad2/XPG nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Finger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grasby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this view, the bacterial RuvC resolvase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) has also been shown to unfold HJ junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and West, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Górecka et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of GEN1, the critical step would be the assembly of the dimer around the junction point in a highly restraint way and the introduction of the first nick. This releases the tension on the complex like a spring leading to an immediate second cut and subsequent disassembly of the GEN1-HJ complex. Furthermore, a HJ does not provide free DNA ends and adopts a structure that intrinsically restrains its degrees of freedom, thus inhibiting cleavage by a single GEN1 monomer. Altogether we speculate that the arch (helix α4-α6) acts like a lever or hatch switching between flap and HJ recognition modes. When a free 5’ end is available it closes and clamps the flap, thus positions the DNA for cleavage. For the case of a HJ substrate, the arch adopts an open conformation, allowing unpaired, single-stranded DNA to pass, while preventing the correct positioning of the DNA for catalysis at first. HJ cleavage is inhibited until a second GEN1 monomer binds. This mechanism differs from the one used by bacterial or bacteriophage HJ resolvases, which act as obligate dimers binding to DNA substrates in a concerted way (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). Our model for DNA cleavage by GEN1 describes a conformational switch provided by a flexible arch that can discriminate between substrates containing free 5’ ends or those with a restraint structure like HJs. This aspect may explain our observation that GEN1 cleaves 5’ flap DNA catalytically while stoichiometric amounts are required for HJ substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Using a switchable hatch in a spring-loaded mechanism would be an efficient way of preventing a single cut at a HJ junction while allowing GEN1 to adapt to recognize various DNA substrates and perform different functional roles. Thus, GEN1 may have an intrinsic safety mechanism that ensures symmetrical dual incision across a branch point. Further studies have to address the exact engagement mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GEN1 in a biological context</title><p>GEN1’s biological role is not fully understood yet. Yeast cells are viable without the GEN1 homolog Yen1 even in the presence of DNA damaging agents as the Mus81-Eme1 complex can complement the defect (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, both proteins can cleave 5’ flaps and HJ substrates in vitro. However, GEN1 can cleave intact HJs symmetrically whereas MUS81-EME1 is much more efficient with nicked DNA four-way junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matos et al., 2011</xref> suggested that Yen1/GEN1 might serve as a backup enzyme to resolve persistent HJs that have eluded other mechanisms of joint molecule removal before cytokinesis.</p><p>Our analysis infers that HJ cleavage is slower than 5’ flap cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B/C</xref>), bringing interesting implications for a safety control of GEN1’s activity. GEN1 may have to assemble in an accurate way before it can cleave a HJ. Likewise, it increases GEN1’s persistence time on HJs and opens a window for branch migration for extending the length of recombined stretches of DNA. Moreover, GEN1 recognizes various DNA substrates, which may point towards a general role in processing substrates in different DNA maintenance pathways. GEN1 has been shown to cleave replication fork intermediates, and it is implicated in the resolution of replication-induced HJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>). Like MUS81-EME1, it might also be important for the processing of fragile sites to ensure proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ying et al., 2013</xref>). These functions have to be tested systematically to understand GEN1’s biological role. In this context, the regulation of GEN1 is an important factor and needs to be explored. Our study identified a chromodomain extending the GEN1 nuclease core that might have a role in regulating the enzyme. An open question is the function and architecture of the remaining 444 amino acids at the C-terminus of GEN1. They are thought to regulate the nuclease activity and control subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">García-Luis et al., 2014</xref>). It is very likely that new interaction sites and post-translational modifications in this region will be discovered in future. The presented structure together with additional studies will help to unravel these questions and to obtain a comprehensive view of the functions of the Rad2/XPG nucleases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Wild type human GEN1 and truncations thereof (residues 2-551, 2-505, 2-464, 2-389) were amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 40125755 (Mammalian Gene collection, natural variant S92T, S310N, UniProtID Q17RS7) and cloned into a self-made ligation-independent cloning vector with various C-terminal tags followed by His8.

The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting paper that describes the structure of the N-terminal active site region of human GEN1 (residues 2-505) in complex with a Holliday junction. As expected, the authors found that the core of GEN1 is similar to that of other XPG/Rad2 nucleases. However, GEN1 contains a chromodomain as an additional DNA interaction site. The chromodomain of GEN1 is required for its full catalytic activity in vitro and is important for the in vivo function of the yeast homolog of GEN1, Yen1.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this manuscript should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers do not insist on any additional experimental work but would like the following questions being addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it would be good to include the CtGEN1 from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> (Freeman et al., 2014 JMB) to see whether this newly identified GEN1 homolog also contain the chromodomain.</p><p>2) Mutation in the helical arch (R89E) does not have any appreciable effect. Given the potential involvement of the arch in the function of GEN1 suggested by the authors, have the authors tested more mutations in that region?</p><p>3) The chromodomain of Yen1 contains an insert, which has unknown function. Within the insert, there are a number of CDK phosphorylation sites that have previously identified (Blanco et al, 2014 Mol Cell; Eissler et al., 2014 Mol Cell). CDK phosphorylation of Yen1 has been shown to reduce DNA binding and catalytic activity of Yen1. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) As mentioned in the Discussion, the authors suggest that both protein-protein interaction and protein-DNA interaction are likely to be involved in GEN1 dimerisation upon HJ binding. Did the authors identify the potential dimerisation domain?</p><p>5) Unfortunately the authors did not carry out any biochemical experiments with the Yen1 mutants. It is impossible to know whether the introduced mutations impair nuclease activity or something as basic as protein stability. Have the authors performed Western Blot analysis or other assays for further biochemical characterization?</p><p>6) Is the fragment of GEN1 used for the structural studies able to support GEN1's in vivo roles? Even if it does not, which would not be completely unexpected, the information would be very useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12256.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In response to the comments, the revised manuscript contains additional data as follows:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: We have included CtGEN1 in the sequence alignment of GEN1 chromodomains.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: We have included two additional GEN1 mutations in the arch region (R93E and H109E).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>: We have added Yen1(Δchromo) in the MMS survival assays.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>: We have confirmed the expression of Yen1 in all yeast strains that were used in MMS survival assays.</p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it would be good to include the CtGEN1 from C. thermophilum (Freeman et al., 2014 JMB) to see whether this newly identified GEN1 homolog also contain the chromodomain.</italic> </p><p>We have extended the sequence alignment as suggested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, CtGEN1 also contains a chromodomain, suggesting a widespread evolutionary role for the function of Yen1/GEN1.</p><p><italic>2) Mutation in the helical arch (R89E) does not have any appreciable effect. Given the potential involvement of the arch in the function of GEN1 suggested by the authors, have the authors tested more mutations in that region?</italic> </p><p>We have added data for two additional mutations in the arch area (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). R93E (at the end of putative helix α4) showed a similar activity as the wt enzyme and H109E (in helix α6, next to the important F110 and pointing away from active site) showed reduced activity. This underlines the importance of helix α6 for catalytic activity and suggests a minor role for helix α4.</p><p><italic>3) The chromodomain of Yen1 contains an insert, which has unknown function. Within the insert, there are a number of CDK phosphorylation sites that have previously identified (Blanco et al, 2014 Mol Cell; Eissler et al., 2014 Mol Cell). CDK phosphorylation of Yen1 has been shown to reduce DNA binding and catalytic activity of Yen1. This should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion, we have added this point to the Discussion. It is indeed interesting that the chromodomain of Yen1 is targeted by CDK phosphorylation in order to modulate Yen1 activity. This insertion is smaller and lacks these phosphorylation sites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in GEN1 proteins outside the fungal kingdom. It offers a potential explanation for the yeast-specific regulation of Yen1 activity.</p><p><italic>4) As mentioned in the Discussion, the authors suggest that both protein-protein interaction and protein-DNA interaction are likely to be involved in GEN1 dimerisation upon HJ binding. Did the authors identify the potential dimerisation domain?</italic> </p><p>So far, we were not able to determine the dimerization interface conclusively. In our hands, human GEN1 does not behave well under high concentrations that are necessary for most methods to characterize oligomerization. We have started experimental work using a systematic mutational analysis as well as optimizing conditions for the biophysical characterization of human GEN1. The analysis will take more time and we are planning to address this point in a follow-up study. However, we have added a citation for a recent publication from the West lab (Chan et al., 2015) to the relevant section in the Results. The study confirms GEN1’s dimerization upon binding to HJs by characterizing hydrodynamic properties of human GEN1 and by analyzing the coordinated cleavage of HJs.</p><p><italic>5) Unfortunately the authors did not carry out any biochemical experiments with the Yen1 mutants. It is impossible to know whether the introduced mutations impair nuclease activity or something as basic as protein stability. Have the authors performed Western Blot analysis or other assays for further biochemical characterization?</italic> </p><p>This is an important point and we also felt that it had to be addressed for a conclusive analysis. Therefore, we undertook the effort to incorporate a C-terminal 3FLAG-tag into all Yen1 variants used in the MMS survival assays, as no antibody against Yen1 was available. We show in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref> by Western Blot analysis that all mutants but R517A were expressed to levels similar to wt. Hence, we have removed mutant R517A from the manuscript. It is located in an insertion region of the Yen1 chromodomain that does not seem to be directly important for the function of Yen1.</p><p>Overall, these control experiments suggest that protein stability is not affected with different Yen1 variants, but rather that they have a more specific defect in Yen1 function, either by directly influencing DNA binding, catalytic activity or by influencing its regulation.</p><p>Moreover, we have also introduced a Yen1 variant lacking the chromodomain (Δchromo), which despite being expressed similarly as the full-length protein fails to rescue the MMS hypersensitivity of the yen1Δ knock-out. We therefore conclude that the chromodomain is essential for Yen1’s function.</p><p><italic>6) Is the fragment of GEN1 used for the structural studies able to support GEN1's in vivo roles? Even if it does not, which would not be completely unexpected, the information would be very useful.</italic> </p><p>We have used the yeast system to address this question and have expressed two Yen1 truncations, 2-451 (without chromodomain) and 2-559 (with chromodomain). The latter construct corresponds to the GEN1 fragment used for structural studies. The truncations showed a severe MMS hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Yen1 is critical for its function, in line with the reviewer’s prediction. We are currently following up on this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
