the peptidoglycan cell wall. The cell-wall-synthesis machinery responsible for rod shape in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the processive 'Rod complex'. Previously, cytoplasmic MreB filaments were thought to govern formation and localization of Rod complexes based on local cell-envelope curvature. Using single-particle tracking of the transpeptidase and Rod-complex component PBP2, we found that PBP2 binds to a substrate different from MreB. Depletion and localization experiments of other putative Rod-complex components provide evidence that none of those provide the sole rate-limiting substrate for PBP2 binding. Consistently, we found only weak correlations between MreB and envelope curvature in the cylindrical part of cells. Residual correlations do not require curvature-based Rod-complex initiation but can be attributed to persistent rotational motion. We therefore speculate that the local cell-wall architecture provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation, either through direct binding by PBP2 or through an unknown intermediate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-wall insertion</kwd><kwd>single-enzyme dynamics</kwd><kwd>MreB cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>bacterial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>Rod complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>679980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Teeffelen</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Teeffelen</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Teeffelen</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mairie de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emergence(s) program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Teeffelen</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006537</institution-id><institution>Campus France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Prestige Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wollrab</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For initiation of cell-wall insertion, the cross-linking enzyme PBP2 stably binds to a component of the cell envelope that is different from MreB filaments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is the major load-bearing structure of the bacterial cell envelope and physically responsible for cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). Rod-like cell shape in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> requires peptidoglycan synthesis by stable multi-enzyme 'Rod complexes' containing the transglycosylase RodA, the transpeptidase PBP2, the transmembrane protein RodZ, and the actin homolog MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). All of these proteins move persistently around the cell circumference at similar speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that these proteins stably associate for processive cell-wall insertion. Colocalization of MreB and RodZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alyahya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendezú et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>) supports this idea.</p><p>Other proteins (MreC, MreD, PBP1a, and PBP1b) are possibly also part of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Contreras-Martel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kruse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>). MreC activates PBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Contreras-Martel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>). However, the shape defect of a <italic>mreCD</italic> deletion is partially suppressed by a hyperactive PBP2 point mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that neither MreC nor MreD are strictly necessary for Rod-complex assembly or function. The bi-functional class-A penicillin-binding proteins PBP1a and PBP1b interact with PBP2 and RodZ, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>), and PBP2 activates PBP1a glycosyltransferase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>). However, Rod-complex rotational motion is independent of class-A PBP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, single-molecule tracking suggests that any possible association of PBP1a or PBP1b with the Rod complex is short lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to <italic>mreCD</italic>, a <italic>rodZ</italic> deletion can also be suppressed by point mutations in PBP2, RodA, or MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shiomi et al., 2008</xref>). Summarizing, it emerges, that RodA, PBP2, and MreB form the core of the Rod complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>). On the contrary, the determinants of Rod-complex spatial distribution and activity, which are ultimately responsible for cell shape, remain less well understood.</p><p>MreB filaments are intrinsically curved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salje et al., 2011</xref>). This curvature likely stabilizes their circumferential orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billaudeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olshausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouzounov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Wingreen, 2013</xref>) and the circumferential orientation of Rod complex motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Errington, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it has been suggested that MreB filaments provide a platform that recruits other Rod-complex components to the site of future cell-wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Errington, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Surovtsev and Jacobs-Wagner, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, MreB filaments might be responsible for the initial localization of Rod complexes. Ursell et al. and others suggested that MreB filaments are attracted to sites of specific two-dimensional cell-envelope curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billings et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ursell et al., 2014</xref>) based on mechanical properties of MreB filaments and RodZ-MreB interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bratton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colavin et al., 2018</xref>). However, correlations could also come about indirectly, for example through a curvature-independent depletion of MreB from highly curved cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawazura et al., 2017</xref>) or through persistent motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the initial localization of Rod complexes could in principle be governed by factors different from MreB. We thus wondered, whether the cell wall itself could provide a local cue for the initiation of Rod complexes, independently of cell-envelope curvature. Such a local cue would have to be sensed by a protein with a periplasmic domain that can possibly bind the cell wall.</p><p>An obvious candidate is the transpeptidase PBP2. For its cross-linking activity PBP2 must bring together donor peptides on nascent glycan strands and acceptor peptides in the cell wall. Binding of PBP2 to the existing cell wall could therefore provide an alternative mechanism of Rod-complex initiation. In support of this hypothesis, a PBP2(L61R) mutant shows increased cell-wall synthetic activity and affects the distribution of MreB-actin filament length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>). Further support comes from localization studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hocking et al., 2012</xref>). The spatial distributions of PBP2 and MreB only partially overlap, which is compatible with the hypothesis that PBP2 finds sites for activity independently of MreB.</p><p>Here, we used single-molecule tracking to demonstrate that diffusive PBP2 molecules stably bind to an immobile component in the cell envelope. Bound molecules transition between immobile and persistently moving states, the latter depending on Rod-complex activity. Interestingly, MreB filaments are not the binding substrate for PBP2, nor does MreB determine locations of PBP2 binding. Depletion and localization experiments of other known Rod-complex components suggest that none of those provide the sole substrate for PBP2 binding. These observations suggest that PBP2 or an unknown protein determine the initial localization of newly forming Rod complexes. We speculate that the cell wall itself provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation. In support of our observations, we found that MreB filaments are likely not recruited to regions of particular cell-envelope curvature in filamentous and normal cells, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ursell et al. (2014)</xref>. Specifically, we found only weak MreB-curvature correlations once cell poles were excluded from the analysis. Residual correlations were attributed to weak spontaneous cell bending, suggesting that they are caused by persistent rotational motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, we also found that fast diffusing molecules cannot contribute to processive Rod-complex activity due to limitations of diffusion, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al. (2014)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PBP2 enzymes can be quantitatively separated into diffusive and bound fractions</title><p>To study the role of PBP2 for the formation of Rod complexes we characterized its different states of motion, which are potentially representative of different states of substrate binding and activity.

Both models contain as a special case an immobile population, and they lead to very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found a diffusive population with average diffusion constant <italic>D</italic> = 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>/s containing 74–78% of all enzymes, and a second population with zero diffusion constant containing 22–26% of all molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The three-state model led to slightly better fits, predicting a larger fast-diffusing and a smaller slow-diffusing population with diffusion constants of <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.015 ± 0.005 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.055 ± 0.006 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. Because the true diffusive behavior might be more complex, we report the average diffusion constant in the following. We confirmed our findings using an alternative method that is based on the distribution of single-track effective diffusion constants, yielding a slightly lower bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Upon overexpression by about three- to six-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) using the vector pKC128 that expresses PAmCherry-PBP2 from the native <italic>mrdAB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) the fraction of molecules with near-zero diffusion constant decreased to 12.3 ± 1.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Here, the three-state diffusion model gave significantly better fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We will come back to this latter point further down.</p><p>While diffusing molecules are likely enzymatically inactive and possibly searching for new sites of cell-wall insertion (see further down), localized molecules are likely bound to an immobile substrate or part of slowly moving Rod complexes with anticipated speeds of 10–40 nm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bound PBP2 molecules are either persistently moving or immobile</title><p>To test whether all or part of the bound molecules were moving persistently we imaged PBP2 molecules at low frequency, taking images with an exposure time of 1 s and intervals of 3.6 s. The long exposure time effectively smears out the fluorescence of fast diffusing molecules, allowing us to detect the positions of individual bound molecules. Using this protocol, we found molecules that moved persistently, were immobile, or showed transitions between these two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Persistently moving molecules showed similar distributions of speed and orientation as a functional msfGFP-MreB fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouzounov et al., 2016</xref>) expressed from the native <italic>mreB</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>), in agreement with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>).

Specifically, we classified motion states using a single threshold on the mean velocity during four consecutive time steps in movies acquired with 3.6 s interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Window size and velocity threshold (8 nm/s) were chosen based on computationally simulated tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A-C</xref>). In confirmation of our two-state model, we found good agreement between the average MSD obtained from experiment and simulation for immobile and persistent segments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6D-F</xref>). Other states of motion are therefore likely not present. Using this criterion, we found a persistent fraction of 42.2 ± 1.1% of all bound molecules, while 57.8 ± 1.1% remained immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Upon overexpression of PAmCherry-PBP2 as above, we found that the persistent fraction remained nearly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), suggesting that the number of active Rod complexes, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>active</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PBP2</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PBP2</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> the number of PBP2 molecules, and <italic>b</italic> and <italic>p</italic> the bound and persistent fractions, respectively), increased by about two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>.

These findings demonstrate that the pattern of MreB localization is not simply a function of contour or Gaussian curvature. Instead, curvature correlations are qualitatively different at different parts of the cell and dominated by cell poles. On the contrary, correlations between MreB and contour curvature in the cylindrical part of the cell are weak.</p><p>In previous work by some of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2017</xref>) we found small but significant correlations between MreB and cell-centerline curvature in mechanically bent cells. We therefore wondered whether residual correlations between MreB and contour curvature in the cylindrical part of the cell observed here were dominated by weak cell bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) likely caused by cells attaching to the glass surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duvernoy et al., 2018</xref>). To that end we restricted our analysis to regions of the cell, where the spatially filtered cell centerline (using a Gauss filter of <italic>σ</italic> = 80 nm) was nearly straight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These regions still showed variations of cell-envelope curvature due to bulges or indentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, we did not find any significant correlations between MreB and contour curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, all residual MreB-curvature correlations after removal of poles and septa can be attributed to weak cell bending, while bending-independent bulges and indentations do not affect MreB localization.</p><p>We confirmed our findings with two alternative approaches: First, we subtracted from the local contour curvature the curvature contribution due to cell bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Residual curvature fluctuations originate from bulges or indentations. Consistently with our observation in straight cell segments, we found no significant correlations between MreB and corrected contour curvature. In an independent approach, we corrected MreB intensity values along the contours for the effect expected from cell-centerline bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Again, we did not find residual correlations after correction. Both of these analyses therefore strongly support the conclusion that spontaneous cell bending is responsible for all correlations between MreB and contour curvature in the cylindrical parts of normally growing cells.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that a small bending-induced enrichment of MreB can be explained by persistent rotational motion of MreB filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2017</xref>), because rotating MreB filaments tend to accumulate at inner regions of bent cells. Our observations are therefore compatible with a model of MreB-independent initiation of Rod complexes through PBP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Diffusing PBP2 molecules do not contribute to Rod-complex activity</title><p>It was previously suggested that diffusive PBP2 molecules contribute to cell-wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). However, if diffusive PBP2 molecules indeed contributed to processive Rod-complex activity, any cross-linking site of a moving Rod complex would have to be found by independent PBP2 molecules through diffusion at a rate equal to the cross-linking rate of up to 15/s. This rate corresponds to the distance between cross links of 2 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meroueh et al., 2006</xref>) and a speed of PBP2 of 30 nm/s frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether PBP2 diffusion was fast enough for the biological cross-linking rate, we conducted computational simulations of freely diffusing PBP2 molecules and measured the average encounter rate between any simulated molecule and a given target site representing a Rod complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

One-dimensional diffusion along filaments indeed increased the encounter rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, due to the preferentially circumferential orientation of MreB filaments, facilitated diffusion would also lead to reduced and asymmetric diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). On the contrary, we did not observe increased diffusion around the circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Support for this viewpoint comes from the diffusive motion of PBP2 molecules.

To determine whether this reduction is due to an alteration of the cell-wall structure or due to a different cause, will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell-wall architecture and not envelope curvature likely provides the signal for Rod-complex initiation</title><p>It has been proposed that Rod complexes are recruited to sites of specific cell-envelope curvature based on mechanical properties of MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ursell et al., 2014</xref>). We found that correlations between MreB filaments and cell-envelope curvature in normally growing rods do not require any curvature-dependent initiation of Rod complexes. This observation does not rule out that MreB-curvature correlations in cells of strongly perturbed shape might be influenced by MreB-filament bending or twisting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bratton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colavin et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence for motion-independent curvature preferences comes from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). However, our study as well as previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that MreB-filament rotation around the circumference are responsible for MreB-curvature correlations in wild-type and filamentous cells. Therefore, the physical signal underlying the spatial pattern of new Rod complexes is likely found in the local architecture of the cell wall, and not, as previously suggested, in the geometry of the cytoplasmic membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What is the PBP2-binding substrate?</title><p>The bound fraction of PBP2 molecules remained nearly constant upon A22 or Mecillinam treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We thus reasoned that persistently moving and immobile molecules are likely bound to the same substrate. In Gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic>, active Rod complexes are thought to insert nascent glycan strands in between template strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Höltje, 1998</xref>), even if deviations from perfect alignment are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turner et al., 2018</xref>). During cell-wall insertion, Rod complexes might therefore stay connected to the local cell wall through associations between PBP2 and a template strand, independently of enzymatic activity. In the future, it will be interesting to study potential interactions at the molecular level. These might then also reveal structural features of the cell wall potentially responsible for stable PBP2 association.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What determines the rates of binding and unbinding?</title><p>PBP2 molecules transition only slowly between bound and diffusive states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Possibly, PBP2 is found in two different molecular states that facilitate stable binding or allow for diffusive motion – either through conformational change or through interaction with an unknown interaction partner. Depletion experiments with RodA through CRISPRi suggest that RodA is not involved in this process, since RodA levels were likely repressed below the levels of bound PBP2. Depletion experiments with MreCD and RodZ suggest that none of these proteins constitutes the sole rate-limiting binding substrate. However, residual protein levels upon depletion were too high to rule out an important and possibly essential role for PBP2 binding. Specifically, RodZ depletion led to a reduction of the bound fraction, suggesting that RodZ directly modulates PBP2 binding or the stability of the bound form of PBP2. This is compatible with previous observations of RodZ-PBP2 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendezú et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgenstein et al., 2015</xref>). It will thus be interesting to investigate the role of RodZ for PBP2 binding or unbinding in more detail in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>How do MreB filaments 'find' the binding substrate?</title><p>We reasoned that MreB filaments must either be recruited to bound PBP2 molecules or to an unknown, low-abundant binding substrate. To find its target, MreB filaments could explore the cell envelope through rapid diffusive motion previously overlooked. Alternatively, the binding target could nucleate new MreB filaments. Other Rod-complex components such as RodZ could facilitate this process. This latter hypothesis is supported by the recent observation that the hyperactive PBP2(L61R) mutant described above causes more and shorter MreB filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>High residual rod-complex activity upon PBP2 overexpression suggests that PBP2 activates the Rod complex</title><p>We observed that the fraction of bound PAmCherry-PBP2 molecules decreased by about two-fold upon three-fold increase of enzyme levels. Together with a nearly constant fraction of persistently moving molecules, this suggests that the number of active enzymes increases about two-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Therefore, PBP2 appears to be an important limiting factor for Rod-complex activity. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that PBP2 activates RodA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For the msfGFP-fusion we observed that the decrease of the bound fraction was roughly inversely proportional to expression level up to 5 μM IPTG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). However, while this level of induction lead to wild-type levels of enzymes on average, it still led to a time-dependent change of cell shape and bound fraction. The quantitative interpretation of this result is therefore difficult.</p><p>Both fusions suggest that PBP2 abundance might not be the sole limiting factor for PBP2 binding and Rod-complex activity, and we already found two qualitatively different limiting factors: RodZ has a strong effect on PBP2 binding, possibly by facilitating binding or by stabilizing the bound fraction, while RodA and MreCD have seemingly no effect on binding but an important limiting role for persistent motion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Rod-complex activity and cell shape</title><p>Despite the substantial residual degree of persistent motion upon depletion of MreCD, RodA, or RodZ, the presence of all these components is required to stably maintain rod shape. A recent paper suggested that cell diameter in <italic>E. coli</italic> is partially determined by the spatial density of active Rod complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dion et al., 2019</xref>). The model is compatible with the fold-change of persistently moving PBP2 molecules and cell-diameter changes observed during MreCD and RodZ depletion. However, during RodA-depletion this simple model does not apply: Due to overexpression of PBP2, the total number of persistently moving PBP2 molecules per cell is likely as high as in the wildtype – even during RodA depletion. In the future, it will therefore be interesting to study how the stoichiometry of different Rod-complex components affects cell-wall insertion and cell shape.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The microscope was equipped with a 100x TIRF objective (Apo TIRF, 100x, NA 1.49, Nikon), three laser lines: 405 nm (Obis, Coherent), 488 nm (Sapphire, Coherent), 561 nm (Sapphire, Coherent), a dichroic beamsplitter (Di03-R488/561-t3−25 × 36, Semrock), an edge filter for PAmCherry imaging (BLP02-561R-25, Semrock), and a laser-line filter (NF561-18, Thorlabs). Shuttering of the 488 nm laser was controlled with an acusto optic tunable filter (AA Optoelectronics) or with shutters (Uniblitz, LS3 and TS6B, Vincent Associates). The 405 nm laser was controlled directly via an USB interface. Images were acquired with an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra, Andor). All components were controlled and synchronized using µManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>For high-frequency imaging with PAmCherry-PBP2, images were acquired with exposure time and intervals of 60 ms for a duration of 1 min. A weak UV-laser pulse (405 nm, 100–200 ms) was provided before the acquisition and every 200 frames during the measurements to activate new fluorophores. To obtain low variability of the bound fraction of molecules between replicates (standard deviation &lt;5%) we aimed to generate about 1000 tracks per technical replicate by taking 3–10 movies per replicate.</p><p>Low-frequency imaging was conducted with an exposure time of 1000 ms and with imaging intervals of 3.6 s or 1 s for a duration of 3.5 min or 3 min, respectively. We activated fluorophores once before the acquisition for 100–200 ms. In this way we collected 7–9 movies per replicate yielding about 100 tracks of at least four time steps, which resulted in variability of the persistent fraction of standard deviation &lt;10%. This way, the imaging time did not exceed 30 min per replicate.</p><p>Single molecule tracking with cells carrying the msfGFP-PBP2 fusion requires a photo-bleaching phase prior to image acquisition. For high-frequency imaging, the sample was exposed to 488 nm laser in epi mode in order not to bias our analysis towards diffusive molecules as exposure to light in TIR mode would predominantly lead to a loss of bound molecules. After photo-bleaching, we immediately switched to TIR mode for image acquisition. Images are taken with 60 ms exposure time and intervals for a duration of 1 min as for the PAmCherry fusion. As for PAmCherry-PBP2, we aimed to generate about 1000 tracks per replicate.</p><p>For low-frequency imaging of msfGFP-PBP2, the sample is first photo-bleached in TIR mode with high laser power. This step is followed by image acquisition while using a reduced laser power with an exposure time of 1000 ms and imaging intervals of 3.6 s for a duration of 4.5 min. Bleaching times for both cases were adjusted according to the PBP2 levels and it varies between 5 to 30 or 2 to 10 s for high and low frequency imaging respectively. As for PAmCherry-PBP2, we aimed to generate &gt;100 tracks per replicate.</p><p>For measurements of cell shape, average fluorescence intensity, MreB-curvature correlations, and MreB rotation we used two inverted epi-fluorescence microscopes, an Eclipse Ti (Nikon) microscope (microscope 2) or a DeltaVision Elite (GE Healthcare) microscope (microscope 3). Microscope two is equipped with a 100x phase contrast objective (CFI PlanApo LambdaDM100 × 1.4 NA, Nikon), a solid-state light source (Spectra X, Lumencor Inc, Beaverton, OR), a multiband dichroic (69002bs, Chroma Technology Corp, Bellows Falls, VT), and excitation (485/25) and emission (535/50) filters. Images were acquired using a sCMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0, Hamamatsu, Japan) with an effective pixel size of 65 nm. Microscope three is equipped with a 100x phase contrast objective (UPlanSApo 100X NA 1.4, Olympus), a multi-band dichroic beamsplitter (DAPI-FITC-mCh-Cy5) with excitation (475/28) and emission (525/48) filters, and a sCMOS camera (DV Elite, PCO-Edge 5.5) with an effective pixel size of 65 nm.</p><p>For measurements of fluorescence on cell boundaries, contour curvature, and MreB-msfGFP tracks, we focused on cells based on the phase-contrast signal. To track MreB-msfGFP spots moving at the bottom of the cell, we moved the focal plane 250 nm below the central plane of cells. Images were taken every 1 s for a duration of 120 s. We generated images of about 100 cells per replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell segmentation</title><p>Cell boundaries were detected from phase contrast microscopy images on microscope 2 or three using the MATLAB based cell segmentation tool Morphometrics (SimTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ursell et al., 2017</xref>).

First, we segmented bright field images using a semi-automated approach based on standard image processing tools to separate regions containing cells from background regions. For spatially separated cells this also allowed us to obtain a coordinate system for each cell.</p><p>PAmCherry-PBP2 spots in fluorescence images were identified as the local maxima of the denoised (bandpass filtered) images with intensity 3.5 or 2 (for fast and slow imaging, respectively) times higher than background (bpass and pkfnd functions from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/code.html">https://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/code.html</ext-link>). Sub-pixel resolution was achieved by finding the center of a two-dimensional Gaussian fitted to the intensity profile of each spot. We discarded peaks with a poor (residuals of fit) or broad (standard deviation of fit) Gaussian profile. Spots in subsequent frames were then connected into raw trajectories if their distance was below a threshold distance that is consistent with diffusion (high-frequency imaging) or persistent motion (low-frequency imaging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>). Threshold distances were 600 nm for imaging intervals of <italic>τ</italic> = 60 ms, 112.5 nm for <italic>τ</italic> = 1 s, and 225 nm for <italic>τ</italic> = 3.6 s. If tracking of a particle lead to a situation where a particle can be connected to more than one possible peak in the next frame we discontinued the tracking for this trajectory. We checked that low-frequency trajectories lie in cells by comparing fluorescent images and brightfield images. msfGFP-PBP2 images from fast frequency imaging are analyzed in the same way except that peaks which have intensity 1.6 times higher than background are selected.</p><p>msfGFP-PBP2 spots from low frequency imaging were identified and tracked in the following way: Peaks were preselected as local maxima in the bandpass-filtered image (using a Laplacian of Gaussian filter with <italic>σ</italic> = 1.8 pixels and pkfind, as above). We only considered local maxima in regions of the 2% highest intensity values that are 4-connected and contain at least three pixels each. We only consider peaks with nearest-neighbor distance higher than 3.5 pixels.</p><p>For further peak selection and sub-pixel localization we considered denoised raw images (using a Gauss filter with <italic>σ</italic> = 0.4 pixels). We selected peaks with a ratio of peak signal to local background noise higher than 3. Local background intensity and noise are respectively the average and standard deviation of the values of the pixels at a distance included between 3 and 4 pixels of the center of the peak. To avoid very low intensity peaks we also discarded peaks with absolute signal (&lt;2000 counts for 1 s exposure,&lt;1200 counts for 60 ms exposure), and we remove the 1% of the peaks with highest intensities, as those likely represent clusters of molecules. Sub-pixel resolution was achieved by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian to every selected peak. Peaks with standard deviation &gt;3 or with a ratio of the average absolute value of the residuals divided by peak intensity &gt;0.2 are removed.</p><p>Tracking was performed using the same code from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crocker and Grier (1996)</xref> with a maximum displacement between subsequent frames of 4 pixels (both for slow and fast tracking). For lifetime measurements with a time interval of 12 s, we increased to maximal displacement to six pixels.</p><p>For the comparison between different datasets we used Student’s t-test for bound fractions, persistent fractions, and diffusion constants where appropriate.

that cell wall synthesis is spatially controlled by MreB polymers assembling in negatively curved regions of the cytoplasmic membrane. Instead, the positional cue appears to be located on the peptidoglycan side, signaled by the recruitment of the major transpeptidase PBP2, which then provokes assembly of the cell wall synthesis machinery. In the future, it will be important to determine the exact spatial landmark that initiates this cascade.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this report the authors use different fluorescent fusions to track PBP2 localization. They find two main states: diffusive and bound (immobile) when imaging at high frequency. However, lower frequency imaging revealed that the bound fraction consists of both immobile and persistently moving particles, with the persistently moving particles traveling circumferentially as observed previously. The key observation is that the fraction of bound PBP2 particles remains constant over a roughly 3-6 fold range of PBP2 protein levels. This finding indicates that PBP2 is likely to be limiting for the formation of active Rod complexes. In characterizing this motion, the authors present evidence that other components of the rod machinery are not necessary for PBP2 to adopt its bound state, suggesting it is recognizing a partner outside of the complex, which very likely may be the cell wall itself. Importantly, a series of papers have been published that highlight the preference of MreB to localize at sites of negative cell curvature, leading to a model where MreB brings the machinery to these sites to correct aberrant curvature and maintain rod shape. The authors also present data that the prior analysis of MreB curvature preference was dominated by the curvature of the polar regions. When these cellular regions are excluded, the preference is minimal and can be explained by MreB persistent motion. In total, the authors present a convincing case that PBP2 is limiting for Rod system activation, thus nicely complementing the recent report of an activated PBP2 mutant that stimulates Rod system activity in vivo and in vitro. These findings are changing the paradigm of Rod system regulation and will be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>Major changes that must be made to the manuscript before it can be accepted:</p><p>1) The data are rigorously collected, assembled and analysed, and the findings are in general appropriately discussed in the context of the data obtained and of the existing literature. However, the paper is currently not written for a sufficiently broad audience. The text is too long, not very well structured and sometimes not an easy read. The figures could be more concise and require the reader to continuously go back and forward. Rewriting in a more concise manner (without sacrificing information), would significantly streamline the paper and convey the logic and connections more efficiently. Ways to clarify confusing presentation of the data are further proposed below.</p><p>2) With the present data, the authors cannot strongly conclude that the formation of the bound PBP2 state is independent of Rod system components other than MreB. The data for MreB are convincing due to the use of A22 and its known ability from Park's labeling studies to block PG synthesis by the Rod complex. However, the dependence of the PBP2 bound state on the other components was based on the use of depletion strains. It is therefore entirely possible that the residual bound and persistently moving states observed following depletion reflect the activity of remaining molecules of the depleted proteins. This possibility is especially true for the MreCD and RodZ experiments since they were produced and depleted from multicopy plasmids. The magnitude of depletion observed is significant, but how the final level of protein compares to the native levels is not presented. Also, even if the depletion is significant relative to native levels, it may be that very small amounts of these proteins are sufficient. In absence of additional controls, this section of the results and the associated discussion (and comments in the Introduction) requires significant revision to soften the conclusions and address the possibility that residual Rod components may underly some of the observed phenomena. In fact, reworking this section will help address the first requirement, because the text of this Results section is quite confusing. Also, Figure 3 and 6 might be somehow combined for them to be compared easily, the reader needs to refer to each back and forth (and the multiple supplementary figures) to follow the text.</p><p>3) The explanation given to the FRAP experiment of A22-untreated cells is not satisfying. The authors see no recovery of the bound fraction and indicate that this is presumably because bound molecules left the field of view through persistent motion. It is not clear why this would prevent diffusive molecules to transit to the bound state (immobile included) if the binding sites are not saturated and the average lifetime of a bound molecule is about 1 min.</p><p>4) Subsection “PBP2 determines the location of new Rod complexes”: In addition to the two possibilities considered by the authors, there is potentially a third possibility: an MreB filament could be present at the PBP2-binding site prior to PBP2 but this filament would not be required for PBP2 recruitment. This could happen if PBP2 and MreB get there independently of each other, recruited by, for ex a third protein. In absence of data showing that PBP2 determines MreB localization this cannot be completely excluded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This very nice paper from Wollrab and co-workers describes an imaging analysis aimed at understanding how the cell elongation system of <italic>E. coli</italic> is controlled. This system inserts new peptidoglycan (PG) along the cell cylinder and is often called the Rod system or elongasome. Components of the complex include MreB, RodA, PBP2, MreC, MreD, and RodZ. Fluorescent fusions to members of this complex have previously been shown to form foci that rotate around the cell cylinder in a circumferential motion that depends on cell wall synthesis. Therefore, this persistent motion is thought to reflect the active machinery working to insert new PG into the existing cell wall matrix.</p><p>Prior work investigating the factors that control Rod system activation has focused on the actin-like MreB protein. A series of papers have been published that highlight the preference of MreB to localize at sites of negative cell curvature, leading to a model where MreB brings the machinery to these sites to correct aberrant curvature and maintain rod shape. This paper, along with a recently published genetic analysis of Rod system function, strongly suggest that rather than MreB, it is the crosslinking enzyme PBP2 that plays the major role in governing Rod system activity.</p><p>In this report the authors use different fluorescent fusions to track PBP2 localization.

The experiments and analyses also appear well done, although I am not an expert in single particle tracking and will therefore leave commentary on this aspect of the paper to other more expert reviewers.</p><p>I have one major disagreement with the conclusions made by the authors that I think could largely be handled with changes to the text.</p><p>Major point:</p><p>1) I do not think the authors can strongly conclude that the formation of the bound PBP2 state is independent of Rod system components other than MreB.

Thus, in the minimal medium used for the microscopy experiments described, it is safe to assume roughly 200-400 PBP2 molecules/cell. According to the data in this report, only 20% of these are bound, and of these only 40% are persistently moving. This would equate to roughly 20-40 active PBP2 molecules/cell at any given time. With the exception of MreB, all the other Rod system components are predicted to be produced at the same level (RodA and MreD), or at twice (MreC) or 3-4x the level of PBP2 (RodZ). If it is true that there are only 20-40 active PBP2 molecules/cell, one can imagine a scenario where the other Rod components could be depleted to levels at or below detection limits, yet still promote the formation of the bound states of PBP2 and play a required role in the activation of the Rod complex. This scenario seems much more likely to me than postulating that WT PBP2 works without the other Rod components and that it may even partner with other PG polymerases to maintain persistent motion upon depletion of RodA. This section of the results and the associated discussion (and comments in the Introduction) requires significant revision to soften the conclusions and address the possibility that residual Rod components may underly some of the observed phenomena.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript from the van Teeffelen lab is a potentially important contribution to the cell wall biogenesis field. Using single molecule localization and computational simulations, the authors quantify the dynamic behaviours of the essential PBP2 transpeptidase and revisit the prevailing model according to which recruitment of MreB filaments to sites of negative curvature in the membrane initiate Rod complex formation in E coli. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that such model is incorrect and that, instead, Rod complex formation is initiated upon binding of PBP2 to an unknown substrate that is different to MreB and probably a local feature of the cell wall (although no real experimental evidence is provided to support this).</p><p>Overall the paper is well presented although the text is too long, not very well structured and quite indigestible to read, and the figures (too many, with too much data that are not always presented in a concise way and require the reader to continuously go back and forward) are also overloaded in my opinion. The data were nevertheless rigorously collected, assembled and analysed, and findings are in general appropriately discussed in the context of the data obtained and of the existing literature. I am not a physicist and thus will not review/comment on the methodological details behind their single molecule tracking/image analysis and simulations (which are about 4/5th of the Materials and methods) – I leave that to the specialists and will focus my comments in the biological part, data interpretation and impact.</p><p>I believe that this is an interesting study for the cell wall morphogenesis field. For this work to be highly influential research some mechanistic insight or experimental evidence about the substrate to which PBP2 binds to should be provided (it is speculated that it is some local cell wall feature but no data are provided to directly support this claim), and/or showing that initial localization of the Rod complex depends on PBP2 binding to such peptidoglycan cue and not on other proteins acting upstream PBP2. Along these lines, I am not completely convinced about the RodZ depletion and RodZ-PBP2 co-localization experiments presented and the conclusions that the authors draw from them and I would need them to address this point. This said, the data presented are in general very solid and the conclusions and discussions sound, and to my knowledge accurate quantification of the transitions between dynamic states in single trajectories was not done previously in the field. All in all, I believe that this study is significant enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and that no significant new work is required if the authors answer to the main points raised by the reviewers. The manuscript requires, however, some work – figures and text should be simplified/shorten for clarity, data of the wild-type strain should be included in the figures for reference, and some parts included in the results could be moved to the discussion.</p><p>Most substantial comments</p><p>– The explanation given to the FRAP experiment of A22-untreated cells is not satisfying. The authors see no recovery of the bound fraction and indicate that this is presumably because bound molecules left the field of view through persistent motion. I do not see why this would prevent diffusive molecules to transit to the bound state (immobile included) if the binding sites are not saturated and the average lifetime of a bound molecule is about 1 min. Could the authors please comment on this and maybe clarify their explanation in the text?</p><p>– Subsection “PBP2 determines the location of new Rod complexes”: In addition to the two possibilities considered by the authors, couldn't an MreB filament be present at the PBP2-binding site prior to PBP2 but not required for its recruitment? Could PBP2 and MreB get there independently of each other, recruited by, for ex a third protein? Why not? Why only the two possibilities indicated? Unless I missed something here or it is conclusively shown that MreB localization is dependent on PBP2 their hypothesis are incomplete and their conclusion biased.</p><p>– The entire depletion section should be reworked for the sake of clarity. There is too much information in the figures and often not described in the text. The depletion strains display levels (of MreCD in particular but also of RodZ) well above the native levels at the time of “induction” to start with. Since the bound fraction is increased in the rodZ induced condition and decreased in the RodZ depletion, this suggest that RodZ may recruit PBP2. The authors then exclude this possibility by showing that upon a longer depletion the bound fraction increases again. Yet they need to show that depletion is still working.g – only t6 and t9 are shown. And RodZ levels seem higher at 9h than at 6h (and data are probably from different cells relative to the data shown in Figure 5 supplements). RodZ levels at all the depletion points shown in Figure 5—S4 need to be shown to demonstrate that the depletion is still operating and progressing after 2h and to thus to exclude RodZ as binding cue. Also, the colocalisation experiments RodZ-PBP2 do not add much the way they are presented. Why weren't these done by TIRF? In any case, there is sufficient overlay for a RodZ-dependent binding not to be completely excluded. Overall the text of this Results section is quite confusing and does not convincingly support the strong conclusion of the authors that PBP2 substrate is the cell wall. Also, Figure 3 and 6 might be somehow combined for them to be compared easily, the reader needs to jungle between the two (and the multiple supplementary figures) to follow the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor (Tâm Mignot) and one of the previous reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have gone through a large number of experiments, analysis and revisions that make this a better paper. They have done a very good job in addressing most of the reviewers comments. Additionally, reinvestigation of new and old high frequency acquisition data of PBP2 revealed that a 3-state diffusion model (instead of a 2-state diffusion model) was a better fit for their dataset, so they reanalysed their data using a published tool instead of the custom approach (of fitting to a 2-state model) used in the previous version of the manuscript. While the outcome of the 2- and 3- state model were similar for wild-type levels of PBP2 fusions, the outcome for the overexpression of PBP2 was different: the fraction of bound PBP2 particles no longer remained constant (i.e. the number of bound PBP2 increased in direct proportion to total PBP2 levels) but decreased when the levels of PBP2 increased. Thus, the new fitting and analysis affected one of the main messages of the paper: the authors previously claimed that PBP2 was the limiting factor for rod-complex activity and the new results indicate that this is not the case. PBP2 is still important (since the number of active PBP2 molecules still rises, although not in direct proportion, with PBP2 levels) but is not the only limiting factor for Rod activity. The authors have adjusted their manuscript accordingly and provide the comparison of the 2- and 3- state model in their rebuttal letter and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. I salute them for their in depth analysis and for revisiting their data and conclusions accordingly.</p><p>The paper is now clearer (the authors made an effort to shorten the text; discussion is also more structured and sharper) and convincing. The authors have made a clear effort to tone down their claims and indicate that a number of key questions remain to be addressed. The supplementary figures are helpful and improve the manuscript.</p><p>Some finals points that need to be addressed prior to publication are:</p><p>1) No evidence is provided to make the claim that the cell wall itself is the partner that PBP2 is recognizing outside the Rod complex, other than the slow diffusion coefficient of PBP2. The authors should either give more direct evidence that supports this or else rephrase their sentences to clearly indicate that this is speculation. The authors show that MreB is not the binding substrate of PBP2, and that none of the other Rod components provides the sole substrate for PBP2 binding… but no data are provided to directly support that a local cell wall feature binds PBP2 and initiates Rod complex formation. The authors should tone down this conclusion in the Abstract and as a main conclusion from the results reported.</p><p>2) The arguments given to exclude RodZ as PBP2 recruiting factor are not fully convincing on the basis of the data presented. The fraction of bound PBP2 decreases sharply and then progressively increases again (but remains lower than wt levels) during RodZ depletion (from t8). As pointed out during the first round of review, the authors do not show if depletion of RodZ is still operating at later times (the levels of RodZ in the depletion strain are not shown, the text suggests that this is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2F but this is not the case). The dCas9 data only shows t3 and t6, while the increase of bound PBP2 fraction operates after t8 in their depletion strain. This point is therefore not fully demonstrated and the conclusion should be toned-down.</p><p>3) The explanation that the diffusion constant of the diffusive population of PBP2 decreases significantly upon PBP2 overexpression (“perturbations in the stoichiometry.…. might lead to alternations of the cell wall structure”) is also pure speculation.</p><p>4) Title: please correct &quot;Tranpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; to&quot;THE transpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of THE major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot;?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50629.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this report the authors use different fluorescent fusions to track PBP2 localization.

To that end we switched from our custom approach (of fitting the distribution of apparent diffusion coefficients to a 2-state model) to the published and wide-spread Spot-On tool (Hansen et al., 2018), which is based on fitting multiple distributions of single-molecule-jump lengths (see the new Figure 1B and the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>While results of 2- and 3-state model are similar for near-wildtype levels of PAmCherry-PBP2 and msfGFP-PBP2, the 3-state model predicts that the bound fraction decreases at higher expression level (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2, 8). Here, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> the comparison between 2- and 3-state models for two different expression levels using PAmCherry-PBP2 (A) and msfGFP-PBP2 (B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Bound fractions and average diffusion constants of the diffusive fraction(s).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: TKL130 (near-native levels).

For better comparability between msfGFP-PBP2-expressing strains we now repeated all previous measurements of the bound fractions (also including the PBP2(L61R) mutant, and A22-treatment, now conducted in AV127) (Figure 1—figure supplement 8,9; Figure 3—figure supplement 3). In Figure 1—figure supplement 8C, we plot the bound fraction for native and mutant (L61R) msfGFP fusions using the 3-state model.</p><p>Due to the decrease of the bound fraction with increasing protein expression, the number of bound and active PBP2 increases less strongly with PBP2 expression level than previously thought. We now calculated the number of bound and active PBP2 molecules and show them as a function of expression level, respectively in a new Figure 1—figure supplement 7.</p><p>Depending on the measurement method of PBP2 protein levels (mass spectrometry or Western Blot or fluorescence level), estimates of protein levels and bound/active molecules differ. However, independently of the method, we observed that the number of active PBP2 rises with expression level once PBP2 is overexpressed beyond native levels. This is particularly robust for the PAmCherry fusion, where the bound fraction is measured with high accuracy, due to the lack of background fluorescence in high-frequency videos. We now also confirmed this increase of bound molecules by measuring the density of tracks obtained by low-frequency imaging (panel C). Therefore, PBP2 is still an important limiting factor for Rod-complex activity. However, since neither the number of bound (left) nor active (right) molecules rises in direct proportion to PBP2 levels, PBP2 is not the only limiting factor for activity.</p><p>We analyzed all high-frequency data (presented in Figures 1, 3, 4, 5 and supplementary figures) with Spot-On, fitting data to both 2-state and 3-state diffusion models (data presented in Supplementary file 2) and presented the parameters of the 3-state model in the manuscript text.</p><p>Where the 2-state model fit the data well (in most cases, where PBP2 was not overexpressed), the two different tools, our previous approach shows slightly lower bound fractions than Spot-On (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C).</p><p>We have now adjusted Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion and made a generally more conservative statement about the role of PBP2 as a limiting factor. We have also included all expression levels and fit parameters into two tables that allow potentially easier comparison between the different fusions, induction levels, and perturbations (Supplementary file 1A,B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major changes that must be made to the manuscript before it can be accepted:</p><p>1) The data are rigorously collected, assembled and analysed, and the findings are in general appropriately discussed in the context of the data obtained and of the existing literature.

Accordingly, we have weakened statements in Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. We have now stated more clearly what is supported by our experiments and what not. Finally, we have conducted additional repression experiments, which support our main conclusions as detailed in the following. We now write:</p><p>a) RodA: RodA is likely not the binding substrate, as levels are likely repressed at least 2-fold below levels of bound PBP2 molecules, as now also explained in a new Materials and methods section “Calculation of the stoichiometry between RodA and bound</p><p>PBP2 molecules”. However, each persistently moving PBP2 molecule (a subfraction of the bound molecules) could still each be associated with a RodA polymerase.</p><p>b) MreCD: MreC or MreD could be required for PBP2 binding. However, neither of these proteins is likely the sole, rate-limiting substrate for PBP2 binding. Otherwise we would have expected that diffusive molecules bind at a lower rate upon the 12-fold reduction of MreCD levels observed during the depletion experiment – even if final levels remain higher than PBP2 levels. Constancy of the bound fraction would then require an equal relative change of the unbinding rate, which seems unlikely.</p><p>c) RodZ: RodZ might be required for binding and potentially modulates the rate of binding or unbinding directly, as it RodZ depletion reduces the bound fraction by about 3-fold.</p><p>We confirmed this effect by an additional repression experiment, using a wildtype background with inducible dCas9 targeting native <italic>rodZ</italic></p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cell length, cell width, bound fractions and average diffusion constants as a function of time during RodZ repression in cells carrying inducible dCas9 targeting native rodZ.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50629-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The observed effect is very similar to the inducible RodZ protein. However, the phenotype is observed earlier. Specifically, cell width starts to increase already within 2h of depletion. Since we were not able to quantify RodZ levels due to temporal constraints of our proteomics facility, we didn’t include the data in the manuscript.</p><p>Despite the strong effect on the bound fraction, we still present evidence that RodZ is likely not the sole, rate-limiting binding substrate for PBP2. We write in the manuscript:</p><p>“First, the bound fraction increased after 6 h of depletion, despite a continued low level of RodZ (Figure 5—figure supplement 2F). Second, the spatial pattern of RodZ but not of PBP2 depends on the presence of MreB filaments (Figure 3), suggesting that the localization of PBP2 does also not depend on RodZ. Third, correlations between spatial patterns of mCherry-PBP2 and RodZ-GFP in cells expressing both fusions as sole copies of the respective proteins were low, in contrast to RodZ-GFP and MreB-mCherry (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) (Alyahya et al., 2009; Morgenstein et al., 2015).”</p><p>The analysis of spots on the cell periphery and of colocalization between RodZ and PBP2 is now also complemented by qualitatively same experiments in TIRF in an updated Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The explanation given to the FRAP experiment of A22-untreated cells is not satisfying. The authors see no recovery of the bound fraction and indicate that this is presumably because bound molecules left the field of view through persistent motion. It is not clear why this would prevent diffusive molecules to transit to the bound state (immobile included) if the binding sites are not saturated and the average lifetime of a bound molecule is about 1 min.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a more detailed explanation in the Materials and methods part of why we think that the bound fraction does not recover in the absence of A22 (Materials and methods section “Estimation of the timescale of molecules leaving the TIR field</p><p>of view due to persistent motion”). In brief: Molecules that bind, whether initially immobile or persistently moving, transition between immobile and persistent states according to the experimentally measured rates <italic>k</italic><sub>ip</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>pi</sub>, respectively. Therefore, molecules binding in a random location in the field of view leave the field of view on average within 45 s. This time is much shorter than the typical time of binding from the diffusive state (calculated as the inverse rate of binding). Therefore, newly binding molecules rapidly leave the field of view due to persistent motion and prevent the bound fraction from recovery.</p><p>In the manuscript we write: “The same experiment in non-treated cells did not reveal recovery of the bound fraction (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), likely because bound molecules leave the field of view through persistent motion within less than 1 min (Materials and methods section “Estimation of the timescale of molecules leaving the TIR field of view due to persistent motion”).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “PBP2 determines the location of new Rod complexes”: In addition to the two possibilities considered by the authors, there is potentially a third possibility: an MreB filament could be present at the PBP2-binding site prior to PBP2 but this filament would not be required for PBP2 recruitment. This could happen if PBP2 and MreB get there independently of each other, recruited by, for ex a third protein. In absence of data showing that PBP2 determines MreB localization this cannot be completely excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers the same substrate could recruit both MreB filaments and PBP2 independently, and we have modified the corresponding paragraph in the manuscript (now titled “PBP2 or an unknown low-abundant substrate determines the location of new Rod complexes”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) No evidence is provided to make the claim that the cell wall itself is the partner that PBP2 is recognizing outside the Rod complex, other than the slow diffusion coefficient of PBP2. The authors should either give more direct evidence that supports this or else rephrase their sentences to clearly indicate that this is speculation. The authors show that MreB is not the binding substrate of PBP2, and that none of the other Rod components provides the sole substrate for PBP2 binding… but no data are provided to directly support that a local cell wall feature binds PBP2 and initiates Rod complex formation. The authors should tone down this conclusion in the Abstract and as a main conclusion from the results reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and editors and have now changed the different parts accordingly. In the Abstract we now write “We speculate that the local cell-wall architecture provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation […]”, and we placed this sentence at the end of the Abstract. In the last paragraph of the Introduction we write “We speculate that the cell wall itself provides the cue for Rod-complex initiation.” Finally, in the Discussion paragraph titled “PBP2 might bind directly to the cell wall” we already emphasized the speculative nature of this proposition. Specifically, we already wrote “Based on our observations we speculated that PBP2 might bind to the cell wall directly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The arguments given to exclude RodZ as PBP2 recruiting factor are not fully convincing on the basis of the data presented. The fraction of bound PBP2 decreases sharply and then progressively increases again (but remains lower than wt levels) during RodZ depletion (from t8). As pointed out during the first round of review, the authors do not show if depletion of RodZ is still operating at later times (the levels of RodZ in the depletion strain are not shown, the text suggests that this is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2F but this is not the case). The dCas9 data only shows t3 and t6, while the increase of bound PBP2 fraction operates after t8 in their depletion strain. This point is therefore not fully demonstrated and the conclusion should be toned-down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we cannot rule out that RodZ is an important factor for PBP2 recruitment, as already explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion paragraph “What determines the rates of binding and unbinding?”. We now emphasized this possibility by writing in the same paragraph: “However, residual protein levels upon depletion were too high to rule out an important and possibly essential role for PBP2 binding.”</p><p>However, we still think that our data provides sufficient evidence to suggest that RodZ is not the sole rate-limiting binding substrate, as stated in the Results and the Discussion. Our CRISPRi-repression data might have caused confusion and we base our argument entirely on the depletion strain and on the localization and colocalization data.</p><p>Using the RodZ depletion strain we demonstrate that RodZ levels are stably reduced ~10-fold below WT at 6h and 9h after washing (for mass-spec data see Figure 5—figure supplement 2C), i.e., depletion works until at least 9h (residual expression is likely due to the leaky promoter). Yet, the bound fraction is only reduced by about 40% and 20% w.r.t. WT at the similar time points of t=6h and 8h, respectively. Furthermore, the bound fraction increases with time, while RodZ levels remain stably low. At t=2h, where the reduction of the bound fraction is strongest, RodZ level is expected to be reduced by only 30% w.r.t. WT according to a simple depletion model (<italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> 2^(-<italic>t/t</italic><sub>d</sub>), where <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>=1.9 the initial level w.r.t. WT and <italic>t</italic><sub>d</sub>=81min the doubling time). Therefore, bound fraction and RodZ levels are uncorrelated after 2h of depletion as also summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, which depicts the relative change of bound fraction and RodZ levels as a function of time.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Relative changes of PBP2 bound fraction and RodZ level w.r.t.</title><p>WT during RodZ depletion. RodZ levels at 2h and 4h time points are inferred from a simple depletion formula while levels at 0h, 6h, and 9h are from mass spectrometry.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50629-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also still think that our localization experiments provide strong evidence that RodZ is not the sole rate-limiting recruiting factor for PBP2. For any rate-limiting factor we would expect that a strong change of its localization pattern would also affect the localization pattern of PBP2. However, our A22 treatment demonstrates that the localization pattern of PBP2 does not change upon severe change of the localization pattern of RodZ (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Finally, RodZ and PBP2 localization patterns show very weak correlations (in contrast to RodZ and MreB) (Figure 5—figure supplement 3), further supporting the suggestion that RodZ is not the sole rate-limiting binding factor for PBP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The explanation that the diffusion constant of the diffusive population of PBP2 decreases significantly upon PBP2 overexpression (“perturbations in the stoichiometry … might lead to alternations of the cell wall structure”) is also pure speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We included this statement in response to the first round of reviewer comments. Without further investigation, we don’t have any other explanation to rationalize this observation. To deemphasize the speculation we now write “Interestingly, overexpression of PBP2 also led to a reduction of the diffusion constant (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). To determine whether this reduction is due to an alteration of the cell-wall structure or due to a different cause, will require further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Title: please correct &quot;Tranpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot; to &quot;THE transpeptidase PBP2 governs initial localization and activity of THE major cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
