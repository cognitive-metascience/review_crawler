Some bacteria can kill nearby cells by secreting bacteriocins, a diverse group of proteinaceous antimicrobials. However, bacteriocins are typically freely diffusible, and so of little value to planktonic cells in aqueous environments. Here, we identify an atypical two-protein bacteriocin in the α-proteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> that is retained on the surface of producer cells where it mediates cell contact-dependent killing. The bacteriocin-like proteins CdzC and CdzD harbor glycine-zipper motifs, often found in amyloids, and CdzC forms large, insoluble aggregates on the surface of producer cells. These aggregates can drive contact-dependent killing of other organisms, or <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells not producing the CdzI immunity protein. The Cdz system uses a type I secretion system and is unrelated to previously described contact-dependent inhibition systems. However, Cdz-like systems are found in many bacteria, suggesting that this form of contact-dependent inhibition is common.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24869.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24869.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Caulobacter crescentus</kwd><kwd>bacteriocins</kwd><kwd>type I secretion system</kwd><kwd>contact-dependent inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM082899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laub</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Bayona</surname><given-names>Leonor</given-names></name><name><surname>Laub</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches reveal a new form of contact-dependent inhibition in bacteria involving bacteriocin-like proteins that aggregate on the surface of cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To survive within complex microbial communities such as those found in the guts of animals or in soil, bacteria have evolved, and now rely on, a sophisticated array of strategies that allow them to compete for a limited set of resources. This constant battle for space and nutrients often involves the secretion of diffusible antimicrobials, including small-molecule antibiotics and bacteriocins. The secretion of these toxic compounds typically provides a fitness advantage to the producing cell by inhibiting the growth of competing cells and, in some cases, by lysing these competitors to liberate nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornforth and Foster, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>). The production of many antimicrobials is induced by stress signals triggered by crowding or the low availability of specific nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rebuffat, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bacteriocins are ribosomally-synthesized proteinaceous toxins that are also sometimes post-translationally modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissen-Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riley and Wertz, 2002</xref>). Most small bacteriocins are secreted into the environment through a type I secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Kwaadsteniet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rebuffat, 2011</xref>). Bacteriocins can be encoded on plasmids or in chromosomal gene clusters that generally contain all of the genes necessary for their synthesis, modification, and secretion, along with an immunity gene that protects the producer cell from self-intoxication. The inhibitory activity of bacteriocins can be broad- or narrow-spectrum, often determined by the nature of their cellular targets or the receptor proteins on target cells that mediate uptake. Diverse cellular targets have been described for bacteriocins. However, many insert into the membranes of target cells, either alone or by associating with integral membrane proteins, producing pores that alter cytosolic membrane permeability, causing the leakage of cellular contents, loss of membrane potential, and eventual cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rebuffat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vassiliadis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Producing diffusible, secreted bacteriocins may not be an efficient competitive strategy for many bacteria, particularly in certain growth conditions. For instance, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> is an α-proteobacterium that thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poindexter, 1981</xref>) where a secreted bacteriocin would be quickly washed away or diluted, making it ineffective in killing neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguirre-von-Wobeser et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the production of a secreted toxin, or any ‘public good’, also renders a population of cells sensitive to the proliferation of so-called cheaters that do not pay the energetic cost of producing the toxin, but benefit from its production by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riley and Gordon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travisano and Velicer, 2004</xref>). To circumvent these limitations of secreted toxins, some bacteria have evolved killing systems that require direct contact between a producer and a target cell. This includes the contact-dependent growth inhibition systems found in many Gram-negative pathogens in which a CdiA toxin is anchored to the outer membrane via a type V secretion mechanism, and then delivered directly to a target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>). Similarly, type VI and VII secretion systems are often used to deliver toxins to direct neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). Homologs of these proximity- or contact-dependent inhibition systems are absent from the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marks et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, aside from an ability to adhere together and form biofilms, no social behavior or cell-cell interaction system such as quorum-sensing has been previously described for <italic>Caulobacter</italic>.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel, atypical bacteriocin system in <italic>C. crescentus,</italic> now called the <underline>c</underline>ontact-<underline>d</underline>ependent inhibition by glycine <underline>z</underline>ipper proteins (Cdz) system, that enables producing cells to kill other cells in a contact-dependent manner. The Cdz system bears some genetic similarity to the small unmodified two-peptide bacteriocins (class IIb) from Gram-positive bacteria. However, in surprising contrast, the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> Cdz system yields no inhibitory activity in culture supernatant and the two small proteins CdzC and CdzD are only found at very low concentrations in the supernatant. Instead, the CdzC/D proteins remain almost exclusively cell-associated, with the CdzC protein forming large heat- and SDS-stable aggregates via a glycine-zipper repeat structure often seen in amyloid proteins. Together, the surface-associated proteins CdzC and CdzD enable producer cells to kill neighboring cells through direct contact. The Cdz system is massively induced upon entry to stationary phase and drives a nearly complete killing of any neighboring cells lacking the CdzI immunity protein. A computational search identified homologous, but as yet uncharacterized, systems in a range of species, including several clinically relevant pathogens. Our results suggest that contact-dependent inhibition may be more widespread than previously appreciated and has arisen through the modification of systems traditionally thought to produce diffusible toxins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A <italic>C. crescentus</italic> bacteriocin gene cluster is induced in stationary phase</title><p>We hypothesized that, if they exist, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genes involved in intercellular competition would be upregulated as cells enter stationary phase when cell density increases and nutrients become scarce.

We named these genes <italic>cdzABCD</italic> and <italic>cdzI</italic> for <underline>c</underline>ontact-<underline>d</underline>ependent inhibition by glycine <underline>z</underline>ipper proteins based on results below. The genes <italic>cdzA</italic> and <italic>cdzB</italic> are homologous to canonical type I secretion systems. The genes <italic>cdzC</italic> and <italic>cdzD</italic> are predicted to encode small (86 and 84 amino acids, respectively) proteins with weak similarity to bacteriocins (using the Gene Function Identification Tool in KEGG) and N-terminal regions resembling the signal peptides of secreted RTX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanonenberg et al., 2013</xref>). These analyses suggested that <italic>cdzC</italic> and <italic>cdzD</italic> may represent a previously uncharacterized two-protein bacteriocin. The <italic>cdzI</italic> gene had no obvious sequence homologs, but was predicted by TM-HMM to harbor three transmembrane domains, and could represent an immunity gene that prevents self-intoxication by the bacteriocins (see below).</p><p>To confirm induction of the <italic>cdz</italic> genes upon entry to stationary phase, we generated a reporter construct in which the predicted promoter region of cdzC was fused to YFP. Cells were grown in a rich medium from early exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 0.05) into stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 1.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). YFP levels increased dramatically as cells exited exponential phase, exhibiting ~10 fold induction once the culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 and ~30 fold after reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of the <italic>cdz</italic> genes may also be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms as we noted in our RNA-Seq data that an antisense RNA overlapping the 3' end of the <italic>cdzCDI</italic> operon was expressed during exponential phase, but significantly less so during stationary phase.</p><p>To further examine <italic>cdz</italic> induction, we generated strains in which CdzC or CdzD harbored an epitope tag, HA or V5, respectively, immediately following the putative secretion signal; CdzI was tagged with HA at the N-terminus. Western blots of cell extracts indicated that none of these proteins (CdzC, CdzD, or CdzI) were detectable in cultures grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 or 0.6, but each was easily detected once cells reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), confirming their stationary phase-dependent induction. Surprisingly, the epitope-tagged CdzC and CdzD were detected only in cell pellets, not the cell-free supernatants, suggesting that they are not conventional, secreted bacteriocins and instead remain cell-associated, a possibility explored further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cells harboring the <italic>cdz</italic> gene cluster can kill cells lacking it</title><p>We hypothesized that CdzC and CdzD form a two-peptide toxin that is secreted via the type I secretion system CdzAB, with CdzI providing immunity against CdzC/D.

However, the killing activity of strains carrying these larger deletions could be fully complemented by introducing only <italic>cdzABCDI</italic> on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>) indicating that (i) the neighboring genes are not part of the <italic>cdz</italic> system and (ii) CdzC and CdzD are likely not post-translationally modified, although we cannot fully rule out the possibility of modification by genes encoded elsewhere in the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Immunity to <italic>cdz</italic> is conferred by the small transmembrane protein CdzI</title><p>To identify the putative immunity gene, which would protect a producer strain from self-intoxication, we made several indicator strains with deletions spanning different regions of <italic>cdz</italic> and tested each for inhibition by a wild-type producer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To more directly assess killing by CdzC/D-producing strains and to gain insight into the mechanism(s) of killing, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine co-cultured cells. We engineered a wild-type producer strain to synthesize CFP and a ∆<italic>cdzCDI</italic> indicator to synthesize YFP. These strains were then mixed at a 1:1 ratio in early stationary phase and co-cultured. At various time points after mixing, we imaged the co-cultured cells in both the YFP and CFP channels. We also stained cells at each time point with propidium iodide (PI) to label in red cells with compromised membrane integrity that are likely dead.</p><p>After 20 hr of co-culturing, &gt;95% of the ∆<italic>cdzCDI</italic> indicator cells were stained by PI and thus were likely dead. In contrast, only ~10% of wild-type producer cells were stained by PI, a frequency comparable to that seen when CFP-labeled WT cells were competed against YFP-labeled WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). After 20 hr, nearly all PI-positive indicator cells still had a typical, crescent-shaped morphology and were relatively dark in phase contrast. However, by 44 hr, 30% of PI-positive cells were no longer homogeneously dark in phase contrast, and 13% had become round, a signature of cell lysis. By 71 hr, 70% of the indicator population was comprised of round, PI-positive cells. These results demonstrated that Cdz producers do, in fact, kill cells lacking CdzI, leading to a loss of membrane integrity and, ultimately, cell death. We verified that expression of the fluorophores did not affect the outcome of the competition by swapping CFP and YFP between producer and indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a control, we also verified that a co-culture of two indicator strains expressing different fluorophores did not lead to the same pervasive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24869.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CdzC and CdzD kill an indicator strain in co-culture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microscopy analysis of aliquots taken from co-culture competitions of a wild-type producer synthesizing CFP (false colored blue) and a <italic>∆cdzCDI</italic> indicator synthesizing YFP (false colored green), and stained with propidium iodide (red) to assess cell permeability.

In this setup, any molecules secreted into the growth medium by the producer should be able to target the indicator, unless they form structures larger than the pore size or adhere to the membrane. Strikingly, killing of the indicator occurred when the membrane pores were 8 µm in diameter and able to allow the passage of whole cells, but not when the pores were 0.4 µm, which restricts the exchange of cells.</p><p>Our split-well experiments strongly suggested that CdzC/D-based killing requires direct cell contact. On their own, these experiments do not rule out the possibility that the toxins form large aggregates that are released from cells, but that cannot pass through the 0.4 µm filters used. However, neither CdzC nor CdzD was detected in culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and culture supernatant exhibited no killing activity, even if concentrated 2000X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The preparation of such cell-free supernatants required the centrifugation and pelleting of cells, which could, in principle, also have pelleted large aggregates of toxins that had been released from cells to mediate non-contact-dependent killing. To rule out this possibility, we first killed stationary phase producer cells by boiling for 5 min before adding them, without a centrifugation step, to indicator cells. If large toxin aggregates were present in the supernatant, the indicator should still be killed, but it was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, we pre-treated stationary phase gentamicin-sensitive producer cells with gentamicin for 4 hr before adding them to gentamicin-resistant indicator cells, again without centrifugation. As with boiled producer cells, no killing was observed. Taken all together, these results support the conclusion that CdzC/D mediate contact-dependent killing.</p><p>In some contact-dependent systems, like that mediated by type VI secretion systems, killing occurs primarily on solid substrates, not in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russell et al., 2014b</xref>). However, the Cdz system appeared to drive cell contact-dependent killing even in culture, implying that cells must adhere together at some frequency. The <italic>C. crescentus</italic> strains we used were derived from the strain CB15N, which lacks the adhesive holdfast present in some <italic>Caulobacter</italic> isolates. To test whether the strains we used form stable cell-cell associations, we used a flow cytometry-based assay previously developed for studying contact-dependent inhibition in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruhe et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, stationary phase producer cells producing TdTomato and indicator cells producing Venus were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and fluorescence measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There were three types of events detected by the flow cytometer: TdTomato<sup>+</sup>/Venus<sup>-</sup>, TdTomato<sup>−</sup>/Venus<sup>+</sup>, and TdTomato<sup>+</sup>/Venus<sup>+</sup>. The latter, detected at a frequency of ~12% in the mixed population, likely represent cases in which at least one producer and at least one indicator cell are closely associated during passage through the flow cytometer. The frequency of such associated cells was not significantly different when examining mixtures of (i) two producers, (ii) an indicator and a producer, or (iii) two indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) suggesting that cell-cell contact is not mediated by the <italic>cdz</italic> genes themselves but rather by other genes that the <italic>cdz</italic> system effectively uses to promote killing. Cell-cell attachments were also seen at comparable frequencies in exponential phase cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that whatever mediates attachment is not specifically expressed in stationary phase and so likely does not contribute to stationary phase-specific killing by the Cdz system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CdzC and CdzD localize to the outer membrane of producer cells</title><p>Our results suggested that CdzC and CdzD are cell associated and mediate contact-dependent killing.

One was estimated to be ~10 kDa, and likely corresponds to the unprocessed form of CdzC that includes the secretion signal peptide, while the other band likely represents the cleaved, processed form. Consistent with this interpretation, the full-length form was also seen in the inner membrane fraction, but not the outer membrane fraction, whereas the smaller form had the opposite pattern, appearing predominantly in the outer membrane fraction. Additionally, we noticed that a substantial amount of CdzC was also present in the stacking gel of the total and outer membrane fractions, suggesting that it forms larger aggregates that cannot enter the running gel. The presence of these aggregates did not depend on CdzD as they were still present in a <italic>∆cdzD</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). They were, however, dependent on the CdzAB secretion system. In a <italic>∆cdzAB</italic> strain, CdzC was found in the cytosolic, total membrane, and inner membrane fractions but not the outer membrane, and no high molecular weight aggregates were seen in the total membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, in the <italic>∆cdzAB</italic> strain, only the full-length form was detected.</p><p>We confirmed our results for HA-CdzC using a second fractionation method in which cell extracts were run through a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Immunoblots of CdzC, along with control blots for McpA and RsaF<sub>a</sub>, confirmed that CdzC is found in the cell membranes, with the strongest signal seen for fractions corresponding to the outer membrane. Again, strong signal for CdzC was also seen in the stacking gel indicating that CdzC forms large aggregates. Density-based fractionation methods can be misleading as insoluble cytosolic aggregates such as inclusion bodies will migrate with the heaviest fractions, often overlapping with the outer membrane fractions. We ruled out this possibility for CdzC by performing another fractionation experiment with a different range of sucrose concentrations such that outer membrane proteins would separate from the heaviest fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In this experiment, CdzC was still seen in fractions corresponding to the outer membrane, as judged by the location of the control protein RsaF.</p><p>Using non-denaturing conditions and native gels, we found that nearly all of the CdzC in outer membranes remained in the stacking gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that CdzC mainly forms large aggregates. These high molecular weight (&gt;220 kDa) aggregates of CdzC were also present in denaturing gels and accounted for much of the CdzC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), even though those samples had been resuspended in 2% SDS and 100 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and then boiled for 30 min. In fact, we could only solubilize these CdzC aggregates by lyophilization and the harsh addition of 90% formic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Taken together, our fractionation studies indicate that CdzC predominantly forms large, insoluble aggregates in the outer membrane compartment of Cdz-producing cells.</p><p>We also examined the localization of CdzD and CdzI. Immunoblots for CdzD revealed a similar pattern as for CdzC, with both the unprocessed and mature form present in the total membrane fraction; the mature form was also abundant in the outer membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Like CdzC, there were also high molecular weight aggregates of CdzD in the membrane fractions. However, these aggregates were relatively faint in the outer membrane fraction, suggesting that they had been solubilized during the fractionation procedure. CdzI, the immunity protein, was found in the total membrane fraction, but in contrast to CdzC and CdzD, was primarily in the inner membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), similar to the immunity proteins of many pore-forming bacteriocin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cascales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lagos et al., 1999</xref>) and those associated with some membrane-targeting contact-dependent inhibition systems secreted via type V and type VI systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruhe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russell et al., 2014b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CdzC forms large aggregates on the surface of producer cells</title><p>To assess whether CdzC forms extracellularly-exposed aggregates on the surface of intact cells, we used immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy on cells producing epitope-tagged CdzC.

This strain was still competent for killing in a contact-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In this strain, CdzC was more clearly seen within aggregates and fibrils, ranging from 50–250 nm in diameter, that emanated from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

One obvious and striking feature was the abundance of glycines and small hydrophobic residues (A, V, I), which together constitute 75% of all residues in the predicted mature form of each protein. A span of 24 and 25 amino acids in CdzC and CdzD, respectively, was predicted to have high aggregation propensity (see Materials and methods). These regions of CdzC and CdzD harbor extended GxxxGxxxG motifs, or ‘glycine zippers’. GxxxG motifs are found in many class IIb bacteriocins that are thought to be secreted from cells, forming transmembrane helices in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissen-Meyer et al., 2011</xref>). Glycine zippers are also found in some transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2005</xref>) and they are also thought to drive the oligomerization of certain prions and amyloid-forming proteins, such as the Aß amyloid peptide in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonte et al., 2011</xref>) and the human prion protein PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). In other proteins with glycine zipper motifs, the x in GxxxG can be any residue, with an enrichment for hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Senes et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of CdzC and CdzD they were exclusively small hydrophobic residues. These sequence characteristics are consistent with the aggregation propensity noted for CdzC, and also suggest that CdzC, and perhaps CdzD, insert into, and disrupt the integrity of, the membranes of target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24869.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic distribution of putative Cdz-like systems in bacteria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment used as the seed in an iterative computational search for Cdz-like systems (see Materials and methods).

However, BLAST searches using CdzC and CdzD as query sequences did not identify any hits, so we screened for potential Cdz-like systems in bacterial genomes using an algorithm based on gene cluster architecture and hidden Markov models (HMM) of the toxin sequences. In brief, we constructed a database of chromosomal regions that included type I secretion systems homologous to CdzAB. We then evaluated all possible small proteins within ~10 kb of the secretion system for similarity to CdzC and CdzD, using an HMM profile built from a multiple sequence alignment of CdzC, CdzD, and two Cdz-like proteins identified manually in <italic>Bacillus sp</italic>. YP1 and <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> 9a5c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The best three hits for CdzC/D-like proteins were added to the sequence alignment, which was then used as the seed to conduct an iterative search of UniProtKB using <italic>jackhmmer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eddy, 2011</xref>). Two iterations produced a multiple sequence alignment of 239 unique hits, each exhibiting several of the key features of CdzC and CdzD: (i) 60–151 residues long, (ii) a predicted secretion leader peptide ending in G[G/A/S], (iii) one or two glycine-zipper motifs flanked, but not interrupted, by a proline or charged residue, and (iv) a short, charged or polar C-terminal region. Further iterations of this analysis began to identify proteins annotated as type IIb bacteriocins, so their results were not taken into consideration.</p><p>The phylogenetic distribution of the candidate Cdz-like systems identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) suggested that this type of contact-dependent inhibition system is widespread in bacteria, particularly in γ-proteobacteria. Notably, we identified several potential Cdz-like systems in clinical isolates of human pathogens such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens,</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia.</italic> Some plant pathogens of important agricultural crops also carry Cdz-like clusters, including <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> and <italic>Erwinia sp.</italic></p><p>Unlike in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus,</italic> most of these putative contact-dependent systems were predicted to encode a single Cdz-like toxin protein, with 14% having two adjacent proteins as in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, and 5% encoding three potential toxins. The identification of immunity proteins was more difficult than the CdzC and CdzD-like proteins, although small, predicted transmembrane proteins were sometimes encoded near the Cdz-like systems identified bioinformatically. Many of the Cdz-like systems identified were likely to have been horizontally acquired as they were often flanked by transposase genes, and most were present in only some isolates of a given species. Interestingly, many of the genomic regions identified, though not the <italic>cdz</italic> cluster in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, also include genes involved in cell-cell adhesion such as thin aggregative fimbriae (Tafi), which could facilitate contact-dependent delivery of the toxins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A novel contact-dependent killing system</title><p>Our results suggest that the Cdz system in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> represents a new type of two-peptide bacteriocin that differs substantially from the previously described, canonical systems involving secreted, diffusible toxins. The small proteins CdzC and CdzD, which are both required for killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), were found almost exclusively in cell pellets, not cell-free supernatants. Our cell fractionation experiments indicated that CdzC and CdzD were located primarily in the outer membrane of cells, with CdzC forming large aggregates visible by electron microscopy on the surface of cells. Consistent with CdzC and CdzD remaining cell-associated, we found that these proteins only promoted the killing of other cells through direct physical contact; in a split-well set-up where indicator and producer cells shared the same growth medium but could not directly interact, no killing was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>There have been other reports of possible, cell-associated bacteriocins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barbour and Philip, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burmølle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dang and Lovell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tahara and Kanatani, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 1992</xref>), but these prior cases are unlikely to represent contact-dependent killing systems. In most of these cases, significant killing activity was also found in cell-free supernatants and the bacteriocins were typically easily detected in supernatants, suggesting they are primarily secreted into the environment and not exclusively cell-associated as with CdzC and CdzD. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a direct demonstration that these previously described bacteriocins localize to the outer membranes of producing cells, or a test of whether their activity requires, or is enhanced by, cell-cell contact.</p><p>The Cdz system is very strongly upregulated upon entry to stationary phase and appears to be active only during this stage of growth as an indicator strain could be maintained at a 1:1 ratio with a producer strain throughout exponential phase, but was rapidly killed in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations suggest that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells may produce and use the Cdz system to kill neighboring cells as a means of scavenging for nutrients when they become scarce. The Cdz system was capable of killing other <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells lacking the CdzI immunity protein and at least two other members of the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> family, but not more distantly related α-proteobacteria or the γ-proteobacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>. A narrow spectrum of action is common for bacteriocins and may enable targeting of the most similar competitors within a given niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riley, 2011</xref>). Producing a toxin that remains cell-associated may be critical to an aquatic, oligotrophic bacterium like <italic>Caulobacter</italic> as a fully secreted, diffusible toxin would be quickly flushed away, providing no benefit to a producer cell. We speculate that CdzC/D, and possibly all contact-dependent inhibition systems, represent a means of ensuring benefit to producer cells, preventing the futile release of potentially costly toxins. Contact-dependent systems may also help avoid exploitation by ‘cheater’ cells in a population that do not pay the cost of producing a toxin while benefitting from a secreted, public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNally et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism of secretion and toxin delivery</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, the Cdz system is the first contact-dependent inhibition system described involving a type I secretion system, as most rely on type V-based systems also known as two-partner secretion systems, or on type VI secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russell et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willett et al., 2015</xref>). The type V-based systems are found in the contact-dependent inhibition system first identified in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and subsequently found quite broadly in other Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>). In that system, the CdiA and CdiB proteins use the Sec complex for translocation across the inner membrane. CdiB is then inserted into the outer membrane where it promotes the assembly of CdiA proteins on the cell surface, with subsequent delivery of the C-terminal toxin domain of CdiA to target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willett et al., 2015</xref>). CdiA also seems to directly promote the cell-cell adhesion needed for contact-dependent inhibition. In the case of Cdz, cell-cell attachment is not mediated by genes encoded within the <italic>cdz</italic> gene cluster, as both WT and <italic>∆cdzABCDI</italic> strains showed similar frequencies of cell-cell adhesion by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, S3). Thus, Cdz toxin delivery likely takes advantage of an adhesion system encoded elsewhere in the genome. Transmission electron microscopy with immunogold labeling indicated that CdzC associates with fibrils on the surface of stationary phase cells. What genes encode these fibrils and whether they mediate attachment remains to be determined. Also of note is that type I systems usually partner with an outer membrane TolC-like channel to mediate the secretion of proteins into the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanonenberg et al., 2013</xref>). How the CdzA/B system manages to retain CdzC/D in the outer membrane following secretion is not yet clear and will require future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism of killing by CdzC and CdzD</title><p>Our fluorescence microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggest that CdzC/D kill cells lacking the immunity protein CdzI by forming pores in the membrane of target cells, a common mechanism of action for bacteriocins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rebuffat, 2011</xref>). When killed, indicator cells became permeable to propidium iodide, a strong indicator that inner membrane integrity had been compromised. These cells eventually lost their characteristic rod-shape, suggesting a complete loss in cell envelope integrity. Consistent with CdzC/D being a membrane pore-forming toxin, the immunity protein CdzI was found primarily in the inner membrane, where it may directly antagonize CdzC/D function. Whether CdzC and CdzD are transferred to a target cell or whether they kill while remaining associated with the producer cell is not yet clear.</p><p>CdzC forms large aggregates that appear critical to its toxic activity. These aggregates are stable against SDS and heat, dissolvable only through harsh formic acid treatment. This propensity to aggregate likely stems from the extensive hydrophobicity of CdzC, including an extended glycine zipper region with almost entirely hydrophobic residues within each repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Glycine zippers are often found in amyloid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2005</xref>) that form insoluble aggregates like those seen for CdzC. The GxxxG motif in CdzC and CdzD have also been seen in bacteriocins thought to kill target cells by inserting into their membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the extended glycine zipper region of CdzC may mediate both its aggregation on the surface of producer cells and its insertion into the membrane of target cells. In this vein, we note that some annotated type IIb bacteriocins harbor GxxxG motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissen-Meyer et al., 2011</xref>) and may, like CdzC, form large aggregates on the surface of producing cells to drive contact-dependent killing; however, as noted earlier, no such analyses have been reported for bacteriocins. The Cdz system may represent a special sub-class of type IIb bacteriocins or a new class.</p><p>CdzD has a similar set of sequence characteristics as CdzC, including the glycine zipper repeats with almost entirely hydrophobic residues. However, CdzD aggregates appear to be less stable as they were easily solubilized in our cell fractionation studies. However, CdzD and CdzC were both fully required for killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). CdzD could help promote CdzC secretion or it may seed CdzC aggregates, although CdzC still formed very high molecular weight aggregates in a <italic>∆cdzD</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Alternatively, CdzD may participate only in the 'warhead', or pore-forming element, of a CdzC-driven aggregate, creating a pore alone or in combination with CdzC. Notably, CdzC and CdzD need to be secreted to be active as a strain lacking the secretion system, CdzAB, was fully viable. It is possible that CdzC and/or CdzD must be modified upon secretion. Although the <italic>cdz</italic> gene cluster does not encode any obvious modification enzymes, as is often the case for bacteriocin gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissen-Meyer et al., 2011</xref>), CdzC and CdzD may at least need to have their leader peptides removed for full activity as toxins or possibly to aggregate, with only aggregates being active.</p><p>CdzC was associated with fibrils on the surface of fixed cells, although CdzC is likely not the only, or even primary, component of these fibrils. As already noted, these fibrils may mediate cell adhesion, with the Cdz system effectively using them for toxin delivery. Associations between bacteriocins and fibrils have been reported previously. The pore-forming microcin MccE492 from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> RYC492 is thought to form amyloid-like, but non-toxic fibrils on the surface of cells in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bieler et al., 2005</xref>). The toxic form of MccE492 is non-aggregated and diffusible, such that its inhibitory activity is seen only in the supernatants of exponential phase cells. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, phenol soluble modulins (PSM), which share some similarity to eukaryotic anti-microbial peptides, form amyloid-like fibrils required for biofilm stabilization. When purified, some PSM variants have antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cogen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>An association between small antimicrobial proteins and amyloid formation has also been described in the case of several eukaryotic peptides. En route to forming mature fibers, many amyloid proteins pass through a toxic oligomeric stage that forms pores in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DePas and Chapman, 2012</xref>). The most notable examples are the human major prion protein PrP and the amyloid-beta (Aß) peptide that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease, which has a glycine zipper region similar to those in CdzC and CdzD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The small hydrophobic residues in the zipper region of the Aß peptide are thought to promote ß-aggregation by creating a ‘steric-zipper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2010</xref>). A leucine substitution in one of the glycine residues is sufficient to significantly alter cytotoxicity and oligomer formation by the Aß peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonte et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cdz-like bacteriocins may be widespread in proteobacteria</title><p>Collectively, our studies point to the existence of a new family of contact-dependent bacteriocins, secreted via a type I secretion system. This family appears to be relatively widespread, particularly in proteobacteria, with each system containing one to three small (~5–10 kDa) glycine zipper-based toxins. Many of these systems appear to have been horizontally acquired as even closely related species sometimes lack an orthologous copy. Additionally, many of these putative Cdz-like systems are part of, or adjacent to, genomic islands that include genes often associated with recent lateral transfers, such as transposases, CaaX proteases, and fimbrial adhesins.</p><p>In some cases, closely related species or strains do have orthologous Cdz-like systems, although the similarity is usually highest for the secretion systems, with substantial variation between the Cdz-like proteins. This type of inter-strain variation has been observed in other types of contact-dependent systems where they may impact self/non-self recognition, thereby playing a critical role in shaping community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcoforado Diniz and Coulthurst, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2014b</xref>).</p><p>The Cdz-like systems we identified bioinformatically are not restricted to organisms from a specific ecological niche and instead appear to be present in a range of bacteria with diverse lifestyles. Of particular interest are the Cdz-like systems present in clinical isolates of human pathogens.

Every hour aliquots were taken and 10-fold serial dilutions (10 µL each) spotted on PYE plates containing antibiotics appropriate for selection of each competitor; colony forming units (CFU) were counted after two days. For end-point competitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>), each competitor was grown separately to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.85, at which point they were mixed at a 1:1 ratio by volume. For strains harboring P<sub>van</sub> constructs, vanillate was added 5 hr prior to mixing strains. CFUs for each competitor were quantified as described above at the time of mixing, and then 4 and 16 hr in competition. The competitive index was calculated by taking the ratio of the two strains at the final time point, normalized by the ratio of the two strains at t = 0 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test the effect of growth phase on killing, each competitor strain was grown separately until exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2) or stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1). For competitions, 10 mL of the exponential phase culture were pelleted (6000 x g, 2 min) and cells were resuspended in 1 mL of the stationary phase culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Testing for inhibitory activity in culture supernatants</title><p>To test the effects of cell-free supernatant on an indicator strain, the supernatant from a stationary phase culture of a producer strain was recovered by pelleting cells twice in succession at 13,000 x g for 2 min and filtering through a low protein binding 0.45 μm HT Tuffryn membrane (Pall Life Sciences). This filtered supernatant was used to resuspend stationary phase indicator cells pelleted by centrifugation, and their survival was quantified after incubation at 30°C for 4 or 16 hr. As a control, supernatant from an indicator strain was tested, allowing us to quantify background rates of cell death in stationary phase under the experimental conditions used.</p><p>To concentrate supernatants from stationary phase cultures of producer strains, we used trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of total protein in culture supernatants using an adaptation of a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koontz, 2014</xref>). In brief, 2 L of culture supernatant was centrifuged twice at 13,000 x g for 10 min to remove cells. Samples were then resuspended to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) TCA and incubated at room temperature for 20 min followed by incubation at −20°C overnight. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 20 min. Pellets were washed three times with 7 mL of −20°C acetone, vortexing to resuspend and incubating 2 hr (first wash) or 30 min (second and third wash) at −20°C, and then centrifuging at 15,000 x g and incubating at 4°C for 10 min. The final pellet was air-dried and resuspended in PYE, and tested by immunoblotting. To test the activity of the TCA-precipitated proteins in liquid culture, the bulk protein pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of supernatant from a stationary phase indicator culture in PYE and mixed with indicator cells to test their survival.</p><p>Bulk precipitation of proteins in culture supernatants using ammonium sulfate was done following a procedure outlined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simpson, 2006</xref>). The starting sample was 50 mL of stationary phase culture supernatant, which was filtered using a 0.22 µm Steriflip PES vacuum filter (EMD Millipore). After ammonium sulfate addition up to 85% saturation at 0°C and 1 hr equilibration, samples were pelleted at 17,000 x g for 1 hr. Pellets were then resuspended in 500 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and desalted using an Illustra NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Eluate was concentrated to 150 µL using an Amicon Ultra-4 3 K centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore) spun at 7500 x g for 10 min.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that large diffusible aggregates present in the supernatant were pelleting with the cells during centrifugation steps, we performed competitions in which the stationary phase producer cells were killed by heating for 5 min at 98°C, or 4 hr of treatment with 4 µg/ml gentamicin, prior to mixing without centrifugation to an equal volume of stationary phase indicator carrying a gentamicin resistance cassette. Indicator survival was quantified after incubation for 16 hr at 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Split-well competition experiments</title><p>Sterile single-well Millicell hanging inserts with a PET membrane (Millipore, 0.4 or 8 µm pore size) were placed into 6-well polystyrene plates to split the well into upper and lower chambers. Only three wells per plate were used to prevent cross-contamination between adjacent wells. Each competitor strain was grown separately to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.85 and 3 mL added to the top or bottom of the split-well. Plates were covered with a lid and incubated at 30°C with shaking (90 rpm to prevent splashing between top and bottom of the well) and the competition evaluated as above.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher Hayes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work introduces the first bacteriocin system that does not rely on diffusible toxins but instead on toxins that remain anchored to the cell surface of producer cells thereby facilitating the killing of neighboring cells through cell-cell contact. This new mechanism expands the range of antimicrobials and bacterial weapons used by bacteria to compete across species boundaries. While all known bacterial bacteriocins rely on killing through diffusion, this system depends on cell-cell contact, a mechanism that maybe optimized for aqueous environments and that helps to avoid fitness problems arising from the distribution of public goods in bacterial communities.</p><p>Although all reviewers are enthusiastic about this work, they consider that some aspects of the manuscript could be improved, mainly the evidence that the mechanism is contact-dependent.</p><p>i) First, the finding that cells tend to aggregate per se is not a strong argument for contact-dependent killing. Likewise, results from split-well experiments, although in full agreement with contact dependency, could also be interpreted differently (e.g. retention of large diffusible aggregates and fibril material by small pore filters). Contact-dependent killing could be shown directly by simple imaging techniques, e.g. when producers and indicators are mixed on agar pads or in microfluidic devices in a 1:10 or 1:100 ratio one would expect to observe time-dependent killing primarily in the neighborhood of producers. A simple statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of producers and killing events could help build support for a killing mechanism involving cell-cell contact.</p><p>Time-lapse microscopy could also be indicative of the killing process. For example, it is reasonable to suggest that Cdz is a pore-forming system, but this only relies on PI permeability, which could be indirect.</p><p>ii) The fibrils are intriguing: they appear not to be EPS or S-layer constituents (they are absent from an <italic>rsaA manB</italic> mutant). Could these structures be artefacts of the EM (i.e. if the cells are stressed)? Are they observed in EM section, by cryo-EM or by live microscopy using various stains? The authors could easily stain the Cdz proteins with the available fluorescent antibodies to show that surface exposure can be detected by a complementary approach. Last, are there any known adhesins or fimbriae candidates also upregulated in the RNA-seq dataset during stationary phase?</p><p>iii) The proline substitution mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) are quickly glossed over, compared to the rest of the study. An alternative view is that the Pro mutant is unstable or fails to be exported. To exclude that and to substantiate the possibility that the zipper is important for killing activity as opposed to export/stability the authors should monitor secretion/surface exposure of this mutant variant. In absence of more controls the use of these mutants is not essential for the demonstration.</p><p>iv) In their interspecies killing assays with <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> Cdz producers, the authors have used two closely related α-proteobacteria. Have they used more distantly related members of this taxonomic group and can they comment on the phylogenetic distribution of potential Cdz prey? The Cdz mnemonic implies that only glycine zipper-like toxins are deployed by T1SS. Did the authors uncover other recognizable toxin-immunity genes linked to cdzAB related loci? Could this secretion mechanism be used to transfer nucleases, lipases or murein hydrolases into recipient cells?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24869.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Although all reviewers are enthusiastic about this work, they consider that some aspects of the manuscript could be improved, mainly the evidence that the mechanism is contact-dependent.</italic> </p><p><italic>i) First, the finding that cells tend to aggregate per se is not a strong argument for contact-dependent killing.

For example, it is reasonable to suggest that Cdz is a pore-forming system, but this only relies on PI permeability, which could be indirect.</italic> </p><p>We agree that cell-cell aggregation/adhesion alone is not a strong argument for contact- dependent killing. However, as noted in the manuscript, we performed these experiments as some frequency of cell-cell adhesion is presumably necessary for a contact-dependent killing mechanism in culture. With regard to the split-well experiments: we also agree that such an experiment in isolation would be only consistent with a contact-dependent mechanism, but would not rule out the possibility noted by the reviewers that large diffusible aggregates released from cells are mediating the killing and get stuck in the filters of the split well. However, importantly, it must be recalled that (i) our immunoblotting experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) failed to detect CdzC and CdzD in culture supernatants, (ii) our cell fractionation experiments, EM, and new immunofluorescence data (see point ii below) demonstrate that CdzC is present on the surface of cells, and (iii) culture supernatant alone, even concentrated up to 2000X, showed no killing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). With regard to this last point about supernatants, one could argue that the generation of cell-free supernatants requires a centrifugation step and that large, diffusible aggregates could have pelleted with cells. To rule out this possibility, we performed two additional experiments. First, we pre-treated gentamicin-sensitive producer cells with gentamicin for 4 h before adding them to indicator cells, without centrifugation. No killing was observed indicating that large, diffusible toxin aggregates are likely not present in the supernatant, and that producer cells must be alive to kill (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, we boiled producer cells before adding them and their supernatant, again without a centrifugation step, to indicator cells. If large, diffusible aggregates were present in the supernatant, this preparation should still kill indicator cells, but it did not (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In sum, it is our collective set of results, not the split-well experiment in isolation, that strongly favors a contact-dependent mechanism. We emphasize this point in the revised manuscript (see subsection “Cdz-based killing requires physical contact between producer and indicator cells”). We would also note that a demonstration of contact-dependent killing by time-lapse microscopy is something that still has not, to the best of our knowledge, been performed for the CDI system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as such studies are difficult, and potentially even more difficult for an oxygen-sensitive organism like <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> that cannot be monitored on agar pads for extended periods of time. This is an important challenge for the future, but goes way beyond the scope of this paper, which, as noted, already uses several different experiments to collectively support the notion of Cdz being a contact-dependent system.</p><p><italic>ii) The fibrils are intriguing, they appear not to be EPS or S-layer constituents (they are absent from an rsaA manB mutant). Could these structures be artefacts of the EM (i.e. if the cells are stressed)? Are they observed in EM section, by cryo-EM or by live microscopy using various stains? The authors could easily stain the Cdz proteins with the available fluorescent antibodies to show that surface exposure can be detected by a complementary approach. Last, are there any known adhesins or fimbriae candidates also upregulated in the RNA-seq dataset during stationary phase?</italic> </p><p>The cells imaged by EM do not show any of the typical features of stressed <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> cells, but we cannot, of course, know the exact phenotypic state of these cells immediately before imaging by EM. Nevertheless, the key issue here is whether CdzC can be visualized on the cell surface by a complementary approach. To address this issue, we have now performed immunofluorescence microscopy using our strain expressing epitope-tagged CdzC, without permeabilizing cells such that staining should only occur if CdzC is expressed on the surface of cells. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, CdzC-HA is indeed clearly stained by immunofluorescence in the same genetic background used for immuno-EM, but, importantly, is not stained in an isogenic <italic>△cdzAB</italic> strain that lacks the type I secretion system. This new result corroborates our conclusion, based on cell fractionation and EM, that CdzC, and likely CdzD, are cell surface-exposed proteins. With regard to fimbriae or adhesins, we did not find any that are regulated in a manner similar to the <italic>cdz</italic> system, but the responsible structure could be constitutively produced or regulated in a different way.</p><p><italic>iii) The proline substitution mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) are quickly glossed over, compared to the rest of the study. An alternative view is that the Pro mutant is unstable or fails to be exported. To exclude that and to substantiate the possibility that the zipper is important for killing activity as opposed to export/stability the authors should monitor secretion/surface exposure of this mutant variant. In absence of more controls the use of these mutants is not essential for the demonstration.</italic> </p><p>We agree that these mutants were not characterized in depth and are not essential to any of the major conclusions or arguments in the paper, so we have removed them from the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>iv) In their interspecies killing assays with Caulobacter crescentus Cdz producers, the authors have used two closely related α-proteobacteria. Have they used more distantly related members of this taxonomic group and can they comment on the phylogenetic distribution of potential Cdz prey? The Cdz mnemonic implies that only glycine zipper-like toxins are deployed by T1SS. Did the authors uncover other recognizable toxin-immunity genes linked to cdzAB related loci? Could this secretion mechanism be used to transfer nucleases, lipases or murein hydrolases into recipient cells?</italic> </p><p>We have now tested another closely related species, <italic>Asticcacaulis excentricus</italic>, a member of the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> family, and find that it is not killed. We also tested three additional, more distantly related α-proteobacteria, <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Sinorhizobium meliloti,</italic> and <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, which are also not killed. These results indicate that CdzC/D is a relatively narrow spectrum toxin. We have added the new results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and updated the text (Results and Discussion) accordingly. As for whether CdzAB could transfer other types of toxins, we cannot, of course, say definitively, but our phylogenetic analysis does suggest that <italic>cdzAB</italic> homologs are commonly, though not exclusively, associated with bacteriocin-like peptides similar to CdzC/D. The proteins that are encoded near <italic>cdzAB</italic> in other organisms and that carry secretion leader sequences but are not similar to CdzC/D will have to be explored in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
