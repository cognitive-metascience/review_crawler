study ribosome biogenesis. We screened a diverse chemical collection that included previously approved drugs for compounds that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Among the most cold sensitive was lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant drug. Lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits at 15°C. Importantly, this was not the result of translation inhibition, as lamotrigine was incapable of perturbing protein synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Spontaneous suppressor mutations blocking lamotrigine activity mapped solely to the poorly characterized domain II of translation initiation factor IF2 and prevented the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro.

The ribosomes themselves are made up of about 50 proteins and three RNA molecules that need to be assembled like a 3-D jigsaw. In bacteria, a group of proteins called ribosome biogenesis factors help to assemble these pieces correctly.</p><p>To study how a biological process works, scientists often look at what happens when a component is missing or not working properly. However, this approach cannot be used to study how ribosomes are made because stopping protein production entirely will kill the cell. Another approach is to use chemicals to temporarily stop or slow down a biological process, but researchers are yet to find a chemical that can do this for ribosome assembly.</p><p>To address this problem, Stokes et al. ‘screened’ 30,000 chemicals in an effort to find one or more that could affect ribosome assembly in bacteria. The screen revealed that a drug called lamotrigine—which is used to treat epilepsy and other conditions in humans—could stop the assembly of ribosomes, but did not affect the production of proteins by completed ribosomes.</p><p>The experiments also suggest that initiation factor 2, a protein that is involved in the production of other proteins, may also have a role in ribosome assembly. Another recent study found that the equivalent of initiation factor 2 in yeast acts as a quality control checkpoint during ribosome assembly, so the bacterial version may also perform a similar role.</p><p>It is also be possible that lamotrigine might be used to help develop a novel mechanistic class of antibiotics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03574.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03574.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cold sensitivity</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>lamotrigine</kwd><kwd>translation initiation factor IF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-GM053757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williamson</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stokes</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000121</institution-id><institution>Ontario Council on Graduate Studies, Council of Ontario Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stokes</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Joseph H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine inhibits bacterial ribosome biogenesis and reveals an unexplored role for initiation factor 2 (IF2) in ribosome assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial ribosome is a 2.6-MDa ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for protein translation, which sediments as a 70S particle composed of a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit. While there is a relatively thorough understanding of the structure and function of the ribosome during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore, 2012</xref>), the molecular events underlying its assembly remain largely enigmatic. Ribosome biogenesis, which consumes up to 40% of the cell's energy in rapidly growing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maguire, 2009</xref>), involves the coordinated transcription, modification, and folding of rRNA transcripts; translation, modification, and folding of r-proteins; binding of r-proteins to the appropriate rRNA scaffolds; and binding and release of ribosome biogenesis factors. In vivo, these events occur in parallel and represent a highly dynamic system of interrelated processes that occur cooperatively to narrow the assembly landscape of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes and Culver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome biogenesis factors are proteins that transiently bind to assembling ribosomal particles to increase the efficiency of subunit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunner et al., 2010</xref>) and prevent the entry of immature subunits into the translation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> has approximately 60 of such factors. Genetic perturbation has been the conventional route to probe the function of these proteins but has drawbacks. Genetic inactivation is typically permanent, often ‘all or none’ in scope, and for essential genes is fraught with the difficulty of creating conditional alleles. Further, due to the coordination of 30S and 50S subunit biogenesis, and regulatory feedback from the translational capacity of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamagishi and Nomura, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaal et al., 1997</xref>), genetic probes of ribosome assembly are prone to wide-ranging impacts and pleiotropic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerner and Inouye, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Small molecules are finding increasing use in a research paradigm that emphasizes the value of these as probes of biology. Such chemicals can exert their effects on a time scale of seconds and be added or removed from cell systems at will. Further, small molecules can be dosed to achieve varying levels of target inhibition and as such can be elegant probes of protein function. While existing antibiotics provide a surfeit of probes for on-going efforts to understand the mechanistic details of protein translation, no chemical probes exist for the study of ribosome biogenesis. Small molecule inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis could provide important new tools for the study of this complex process, particularly those events controlled by uncharacterized protein assembly factors. Additionally, chemical inhibitors of bacterial ribosome biogenesis might serve as leads for an entirely new mechanistic class of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comartin and Brown, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report the discovery and characterization of a chemical inhibitor of bacterial ribosome biogenesis. Using a diverse chemical library that included previously approved drugs and compounds of known bioactivity, we enriched for molecules that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>. Indeed, numerous studies have revealed that genetic defects in ribosome assembly result in cold sensitive growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant and Sypherd, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dammel and Noller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bubunenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connolly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clatterbuck Soper et al., 2013</xref>). We too performed validating efforts, reported herein, of the cold sensitivity of strains from the Keio collection, a comprehensive compendium of <italic>E. coli</italic> deletion strains. A subsequent chemical screen determined that the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine induced a strongly cold sensitive growth phenotype. Treatment with this molecule resulted in the accumulation of immature ribosomal subunits in a time-dependent manner without inhibiting protein translation. Spontaneous suppressors of lamotrigine activity mapped exclusively to translation initiation factor IF2, encoded by <italic>infB.</italic> These mutations, found in the poorly characterized and evolutionarily divergent domain II of IF2, obviated the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro. This work establishes lamotrigine as a widely available chemical probe of bacterial ribosome biogenesis and suggests a role for <italic>E. coli</italic> IF2 in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ribosome is a primary target of cold stress</title><p>Where cold sensitive growth has previously been identified as a dominant phenotype for defects in ribosome biogenesis, we set out to first validate such an enrichment strategy with a screen of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 2006</xref>), a comprehensive set of non-essential gene deletion strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We looked for strains that were sensitized to growth at 15°C compared to 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). A cold sensitivity factor was subsequently generated for each clone, defined as the ratio of growth at 37°C to growth at 15°C, normalized to the mean growth ratio measured for the entire collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Strains that displayed a cold sensitivity factor in the top 3.5% (155 clones) were analyzed using clusters of orthologous groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tatusov et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2003</xref>) to categorize the cellular function of each deleted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). To highlight the relative proportion of genes in each functional class, the number of cold sensitive genes in each was divided by the total number of non-essential genes in that same category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This normalization procedure highlighted ribosome-related genes as exceptionally sensitive to low temperatures, as &gt;20% of genes in this functional class were found to be cold sensitive. Importantly, this screen was also successful in identifying the vast majority of previously reported cold sensitive ribosome biogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>), providing support that screening compounds for cold sensitivity would enrich for those related to ribosome function and biogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03574.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The ribosome is a primary target of cold stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Screen of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio collection for cold sensitivity.

Analysis of the pre-30S, 30S, and 70S regions of the gradient using the 16S rRNA-specific primer revealed that increasing sedimentation rate correlated with a decreased proportion of immature 16S rRNA relative to total 16S rRNA. The presence of immature 16S rRNA sedimenting in the pre-30S region suggested a heterogeneous composition of 30S particles at various stages of maturation. At the maximum of the 30S peak approximately 40% of 16S rRNA was unprocessed. The 16S rRNA found in fractions corresponding to the 70S subunit was &gt;95% processed, as expected. Overall, a similar trend was seen when analyzing the processing of 23S rRNA in the pre-30S, pre-50S, 50S, and 70S regions of the gradient; increasing sedimentation rate correlated with a decreased proportion of immature 23S rRNA relative to total 23S rRNA. The pre-30S and pre-50S regions of the gradient were devoid of quantifiable 23S rRNA, suggesting very little 50S precursor accumulation in unperturbed cells.</p><p>Compared to cells treated with DMSO, those treated with 2× MIC of lamotrigine for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel), 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) contained similar proportions of immature to total 16S and 23S rRNA in the 30S, 50S, and 70S regions of the gradient. Furthermore, lamotrigine-treated cells displayed almost identical proportions of immature to total 16S rRNA in the pre-30S region, relative to DMSO-treated cells. Unlike DMSO-treatment, however, lamotrigine treatment resulted in the accumulation of immature 23S rRNA in the pre-30S and pre-50S regions. While the presence of unprocessed 23S rRNA in the pre-50S region strongly suggested an immature 50S subunit sedimenting at ∼40S, its presence in the pre-30S region raised questions of whether the dominant species in the pre-30S peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) was derived from 16S or 23S rRNA.</p><p>While calculating proportions of immature to total rRNA of the same species ([immature 16S/total 16S] and [immature 23S/total 23S]) provides detail of rRNA processing efficiency in each region of the gradient, it does not inform on the absolute quantity of one species (16S rRNA) relative to the other (23S rRNA). To answer this question, we quantified absolute cDNA fluorescence from 5′ primer extension reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Samples of rRNA purified from single fractions of sucrose gradients were reverse transcribed in parallel reactions using either the 16S- or 23S-specific primer. In this study, cDNA production is proportional to the amount of rRNA transcript in the sample and therefore reflects absolute quantities of each rRNA species (16S and 23S) present. The quantity of immature 16S rRNA from DMSO-treated cells was minor relative to cells treated with lamotrigine. This is consistent with previous reports, which have shown that immature ribosomal particles in unperturbed cells account for only a small proportion of total ribosomal material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, while immature 23S rRNA slowly accumulated in this region as a function of lamotrigine treatment length, immature 16S rRNA did so at a significantly greater rate. These results indicate that, by far, the major species of rRNA residing within the pre-30S region in lamotrigine-treated cells was unprocessed 16S rRNA. Thus, 5′ primer extension results strongly suggested that lamotrigine treatment results in the accumulation of an immature 30S subunit that sediments at ∼25S and an immature 50S subunit that sediments at ∼40S.</p><p>To further test this hypothesis, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to determine the relative stoichiometry of r-proteins across sucrose gradients of DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated cells. Early-log cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> grown at 15°C in <sup>14</sup>N-labeled LB media were treated with DMSO or 2× MIC of lamotrigine for 6 hr, lysed, and the ribosomal particles were separated through sucrose gradients. Fractions spanning the pre-30S to the 70S regions were spiked with a fixed concentration of 70S ribosomes purified from cells grown in <sup>15</sup>N-labeled media. These spiked samples were then digested with trypsin and prepared for mass spectrometry. This approach resulted in multiple independent peptide measurements for each r-protein in every fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Protein occupancy was calculated as <sup>14</sup>N/[<sup>14</sup>N + <sup>15</sup>N]. Direct inspection of the protein occupancy profiles revealed distinct patterns for early- (e.g., S15, L24) and late- (e.g., S3, L28) binding proteins. In the DMSO samples, all r-proteins within a given subunit displayed highly correlated occupancy patterns with maximal occupancy corresponding to ‘peak’ fractions as determined by rRNA absorbance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, treatment with lamotrigine resulted in significant occupancy of the early-binding proteins in pre-30S and pre-50S fractions, whereas the late-binding r-proteins exhibited relatively unperturbed profiles. Indeed, protein S15 is found at significantly greater occupancy in the pre-30S fractions upon lamotrigine treatment (dark blue). This effect on early binding proteins is particularly pronounced in the L24 profile with peak occupancy shifted six fractions earlier in the gradient (from orange to green). To facilitate further analysis, this large data set (∼20,000 measurements) was compressed to a 53-protein × 28-fraction heat map using the median protein occupancy value for each protein in each fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). As expected, the 70S peak from both DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated cells exhibited stoichiometric occupancy of each r-protein.</p><p>In both DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated samples, we observed sub-stoichiometric occupancy of the late-binding r-proteins S21, S2, and to a lesser extent S3, within the 30S peak. Notably, this effect was enhanced in the lamotrigine-treated samples. The depletion of these proteins is consistent with prior in vivo analysis of small subunit biogenesis at 37°C, which found S2, S3, and S21 to be the latest-binding small subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Williamson, 2013</xref>). Consistent with sucrose gradient traces monitoring UV absorbance and [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine incorporation, we observed a subtle broadening of the 30S protein occupancy peak upon treatment with lamotrigine. Analysis of the leading edge of this peak revealed an enrichment of relatively early-binding proteins S13, S7, S16, S8, S15, S6, and S18, consistent with the presence of 30S subunit assembly intermediates in lamotrigine-treated cells. Inspection of large subunit protein occupancy revealed drastic changes as a result of lamotrigine treatment, resulting in the accumulation of an immature particle depleted of the late-binding r-proteins L35, L36, L16, L30, and L28 as well as earlier-binding proteins, L34, L6, and L21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Particles with this heterogeneous protein composition could not be found in the DMSO-treated samples, indicating that if they do form they rapidly convert to mature particles that migrate later in the gradient.</p><p>Formally, these r-protein occupancy patterns could have resulted either from immature assembly intermediates or from the degradation of mature particles initiated by the removal of late-binding proteins. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used mass spectrometry to determine the occupancy pattern for the ribosome biogenesis factors RbfA and DeaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These proteins were completely absent from mature 70S particles, and thus we reasoned that their presence could be used as markers of immature particles. The 30S-specific maturation factor RbfA co-sedimented with the 30S particles in both DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated samples. Further, the 50S-biogenesis factor DeaD co-migrated with the pre-50S peak in the lamotrigine-treated samples and the 50S peak in the DMSO-treated samples. These data further suggest that the pre-30S and pre-50S particles are immature subunits and not the result of degradation of mature ribosomal particles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lamotrigine binds to wild type but not mutant IF2 in a G-nucleotide-dependent manner</title><p>To identify lamotrigine's target in vivo, we generated suppressor mutants and sequenced the resulting genomes to identify the mutation(s) that were responsible for resistance.

Immediately after the addition of lamotrigine to the cultures, cells were pulse labeled with [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine to monitor accumulation of non-native ribosomal particles.

Because the quantity of labeled subunits did not change as a function of the length of the chase, these particles likely represent fully mature subunits that have simply dissociated. Interestingly, DMSO-treated cells harvested immediately after the 3-hr pulse and before the addition of the chase show a slight decrease in the levels of complete 70S ribosomes relative to any of the samples harvested post-chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This small but significant change likely results from the presence of an intracellular pool of [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine, which is incorporated into 70S particles during the initial 30-min chase.

Some 30 min after removal of lamotrigine and non-labeled uridine chase, the relative proportions of ribosomal particles began to adjust. Specifically, the levels of pre-30S and pre-50S particles decreased with a corresponding increase in 70S ribosomes. This trend continued throughout the 3-hr chase period, after which there were no apparent differences between DMSO-treated and lamotrigine-treated cells. Interestingly, after 1 hr of non-labeled uridine chase, a cluster of three particles that sedimented at approximately 40S (discussed above as the pre-50S), 45S, and 50S appeared. With each successive time point, the levels of 50S increased at the expense of the other particles, suggesting our time course had captured cells actively assembling the pre-50S particles into 50S subunits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding bacterial ribosome assembly has proven to be a challenging undertaking. Involving nearly 60 protein factors, the process is rapid, highly efficient, and studies to date suggest that assembly intermediates are elusive and do not accumulate in significant amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The genetic inactivation of ribosome biogenesis factors has provided an opportunity to perturb the process in order to better understand the action of chemical modification and chaperone functions in the assembly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shajani et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, many of these factors are essential and resist genetic manipulation. Further, genetic inactivation has poor temporal resolution and is not ideally suited to probe the coordinated action of these factors in time and space. Indeed, our understanding of ribosome function has benefited enormously from a great number and variety of small molecule probes of chemical and conformational steps of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tenson and Mankin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Chemical inhibitors of the assembly process would similarly provide important new probes of ribosome biogenesis. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of ribosome assembly in <italic>E. coli</italic> under cold temperature growth conditions. The inhibitor, lamotrigine, is a widely available anticonvulsant drug whose target in <italic>E. coli</italic> is domain II of the initiation factor IF2. In all, this work provides the first small molecule probe of ribosome assembly and points to a novel role for IF2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>To find small molecule inhibitors of ribosome assembly, we developed a cell-based platform to first enrich for inhibitors of ribosome assembly and function by screening for compounds that led to a cold sensitive growth phenotype. The screen was inspired by numerous previous reports of cold sensitive mutants in ribosome-related genes and was validated with a screen of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio collection. In our screen of the Keio collection, ribosome genes were overwhelmingly enriched and, of the known cold sensitive ribosome biogenesis genes, we were successful in identifying the vast majority of these. We next screened a diverse collection of ∼30,000 small molecules, including many known drugs and bioactive compounds, to identify growth inhibitory compounds with increased potency at 15°C relative to 37°C. Of 38 structurally diverse active compounds from this screen, lamotrigine induced the most profound cold sensitive growth inhibition. Sedimentation analysis revealed that lamotrigine induced the rapid accumulation of non-native ribosomal particles with apparent sedimentation rates of ∼25S (pre-30S) and ∼40S (pre-50S), prompting an in-depth analysis of their composition. Using 5′ primer extension of rRNA and r-protein mass spectrometry, these particles were found to be immature 30S and 50S subunits, respectively. These immature subunits lacked r-proteins associated with the neck of the 30S subunit and the body of the 50S subunit around the L1 arm, central protuberance, and L11 arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). With these regions encompassing the functional centers of each subunit, it is tempting to speculate that lamotrigine may perturb late steps in 30S and 50S subunit assembly. It has recently been suggested that these sites are among the last to mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jomaa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jomaa et al., 2014</xref>) consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Whole genome sequencing of spontaneous suppressor mutants capable of robust growth in the presence of lamotrigine revealed mutations in domain II near the N-terminus of initiation factor IF2.

Interestingly, domain II is conserved solely among IF2 proteins from the Enterobacteriaceae and has yet to be assigned a definitive function. Indeed, only one study suggests a role for this region in binding strongly to 30S, 50S, and 70S ribosomal particles relative to the other Enterobacteriaceae IF2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreno et al., 1999</xref>). While lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S subunits, the target IF2 led us to wonder if lamotrigine might be an inhibitor of protein translation. We speculated that the observed ribosome biogenesis phenotype might be an indirect effect of blocking r-protein production, as described previously for antibiotics known to inhibit translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siibak et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sykes et al., 2010</xref>). Using multiple orthogonal approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, we were unable to detect any translational inhibition by lamotrigine even when using concentrations far above the MIC. These results were in contrast to assays with known translational inhibitors, including evernimicin, a known inhibitor of IF2-dependent 70S initiation complex formation.</p><p>The finding that IF2 is the target of lamotrigine is intriguing in light of emerging information on the role of its eukaryotic counterpart, eIF5B, in 40S subunit assembly in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, eIF5B associates with immature 40S subunits in a translation-like checkpoint, wherein immature 40S particles bind to mature 60S subunits prior to final maturation. Given that pre-30S and pre-50S particles accumulate during lamotrigine stress, a bacterial model may include association of two immature particles prior to maturation of the functional centers within the 30S and 50S subunits. Alternatively, it is possible that IF2 is involved in the maturation of 30S and 50S subunits independently. Regardless of the precise events mediated by IF2, our data strongly support a central role for the enigmatic and divergent domain II of <italic>E. coli</italic> IF2 in the assembly of both subunits. Interestingly, our observations help rationalize the previously unexplained finding that overexpression of IF2 in a <italic>ΔyjeQ</italic> background of <italic>E. coli</italic> partially suppresses the mutant slow growth phenotype and restores ribosome profiles to wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell and Brown, 2008</xref>). Similarly to lamotrigine-treated cells, the 30S particles of cells lacking YjeQ display significantly depleted occupancy of S21, S1, S2, and S3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jomaa et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that IF2 may perform an overlapping role in late 30S maturation during cold stress. Our results also parallel work dating back almost two decades, which showed that truncation of the N-terminus of <italic>E. coli</italic> IF2, containing domain II led to cold sensitive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laalami et al., 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1991b</xref>). With much of the machinery involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bharat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>) and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anger et al., 2013</xref>) conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes, the maintenance of IF2/eIF5B function in ribosome biogenesis through evolution is surely plausible. Given that domain II of IF2 is highly divergent, this work raises questions of how diverse bacterial species carry out the temperature-dependent functions of IF2 described herein. Domain II may have a purpose that is uniquely important to the Enterobacteriaceae under cold stress or, alternatively, species-specific proteins that mimic the N-terminus of IF2 from Enterobacteriaceae may perform this activity.</p><p>Taken together, this work establishes lamotrigine as a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of bacterial ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, we have identified domain II of IF2 as the molecular target of lamotrigine, suggesting an as-yet-uncharacterized ribosome assembly function for this canonical translation initiation factor. We posit that lamotrigine will serve as an important tool in expanding our understanding of the molecular details of IF2 in ribosome biogenesis and functions as a proof-of-concept molecule in the development of novel antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Screening for cold sensitivity</title><p>Overnight cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 (including Keio strains) grown in LB media at 37°C were diluted 1/1000 in fresh LB, and incubated at 15°C (48 hr) and 37°C (24 hr) in duplicate without shaking in a final volume of 100 μl.

The authors then proceed to demonstrate that lam perturbs assembly of 30S and 50S ribosomes. Suppressor analysis and biochemical analysis demonstrate that the translation initiation factor IF2 is the target of lam. Surprisingly though, lam does not perturb translation.</p><p>This is an interesting and exciting paper with intriguing implications. However, it was felt that some minor additional experimental support would solidify the claims. In particular, growth curves and/or serial dilution plating of bacterial strains at the permissive (37°C), nonpermissive (15°C), and various temperatures in between using media (LB and M9) containing various concentrations of lamotrigene (including concentrations used in various experiments) should be presented. 15°C is very low temperature for growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The doubling time for the DMSO/wild-type control at 15°C is about 12x that at 37°C and this raises the question of how much cold shock plays into these data. It is unclear why such a low temperature was chosen for this study. Results from the proposed simple experiments would allow more confident correlation of defects in ribosome biogenesis with effects on cell growth.</p><p>In addition, there are several places where the presentation of the data is difficult to follow and thus the authors should modify the text in response to the minor comments listed below.</p><p>1) Presumably the cold sensitivity factor is the ratio of growth at 37°C, relative to 15°C, relative to wild type?</p><p>2) Error bars would be desirable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> considering that the % cold sensitivity for the Co-enzyme metabolism gene class was only ∼2 fold less than the Translation, ribosome structure, and biogenesis gene class. This difference was the foundation for all the subsequent work.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is extremely difficult to follow: What is the difference in the experiment between 4B and C? It seems that panel B says that there is no measurable accumulation of pre-16S rRNA, but pre-23S rRNA is accumulated in the pre-30S and the pre-50S peak. Nevertheless, panel C says that pre-16S rRNA also accumulates. Where are these discrepancies coming from? Also, perhaps clearer labeling could help. I would call p16S, pre-16S; perhaps one could call +7 and +3, pre-pre50S, and pre-50S, respectively; or perhaps pre-50S+3 or pre-50S+7; it is also not explained in the legend where the +7 is coming from; it took me a while to figure that out.</p><p>4) What is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> supposed to show; what is on the x-axis? Neither the text nor the legend is helpful.</p><p>5) It is hard to tell if S3 is depleted from the pre-30S as claimed. I'd say no...</p><p>6) The effects on 50S maturation seem to be far more drastic than the effects on 30S maturation; perhaps that should be discussed.</p><p>7) It would be nice to show a structure of mature 30S and 50S illustrating which of the RPs are missing. Also, the authors point out that IF2 overexpression rescues the YjeQ deletion; interestingly the YjeQ deletion has a very similar phenotype in terms of depleted proteins.</p><p>8) The data indicates a maturation-specific function of the drug, and perhaps even of domain II. This should be discussed, and a domainII-specific function should be tested by complementation with IF2 from divergent species at low temperature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03574.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Growth curves and/or serial dilution plating of bacterial strains at the permissive (37°C), nonpermissive (15°C), and various temperatures in between using media (LB and M9) containing various concentrations of lamotrigene (including concentrations used in various experiments) should be presented. 15°C is very low temperature for growth of E. coli.

We observed a media-independent phenotype where lamotrigine activity was inversely proportional to growth temperature. These results are consistent with the conclusion that lamotrigine inhibits a cold sensitive event during ribosome biogenesis. As temperature decreases, the apparent role of IF2 in ribosome biogenesis becomes increasingly essential, thus increasing the growth inhibitory effect of lamotrigine. 15°C was selected in this study to maximize cold-induced ribosome biogenesis phenotypes while still permitting cell growth amenable to high-throughput screening in micro-well format. Based on the new data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, we believe that lamotrigine would produce identical ribosome biogenesis phenotypes at higher temperatures, albeit at correspondingly higher concentrations.</p><p><italic>1) Presumably the cold sensitivity factor is the ratio of growth at 37°C</italic>, <italic>relative to 15°C, relative to wild type?</italic></p><p>The cold sensitivity factor is defined in Figure legend 1 as the ratio of growth at 37°C to growth at 15°C, normalized to the mean of all cold sensitivity factors calculated.

I would call p16S, pre-16S; perhaps one could call +7 and +3, pre-pre50S, and pre-50S, respectively; or perhaps pre-50S+3 or pre-50S+7; it is also not explained in the legend where the +7 is coming from; it took me a while to figure that out</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed a complex figure and these comments have helped us to improve the clarity of these panels. We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and have re-written the Results section describing the relationship between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>. Briefly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> illustrates the proportion of processed rRNA in various positions through the gradient. This proportion of processed rRNA is defined as [immature rRNA/total rRNA] for each species analyzed (either 16S or 23S). This is ideal for understanding the rRNA processing efficiency of individual ribosomal particles. However, as was seen in the pre-30S region of the gradient in lamotrigine-treated cells, we were able to purify measurable quantities of both 16S and 23S species that were unprocessed. Thus, to discern whether the dominant species residing within the pre-30S region was 30S or 50S in nature, we needed to determine absolute quantities of 16S rRNA species and 23S rRNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) originating from this region. Performing this experiment with 5’ primer extension of both 16S and 23S rRNA in parallel from the same sucrose gradient fractions allowed us to conclude that the major species in the pre-30S peak was an immature 30S particle.</p><p><italic>4) What is</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref> <italic>is supposed to show; what is on the x-axis? Neither the text nor the legend is helpful</italic>.</p><p>We have greatly expanded the figure legend and our discussion of this figure. We have also modified the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> to avoid any additional confusion caused by figures of this form. This panel is intended to show example r-protein occupancy data of small and large subunit proteins (S3, S15, L28, L24) along sucrose gradients of DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated cells. Blue represents early fractions in the gradient and red indicates late fractions. The vertical axis quantifies r-protein occupancy. For each protein, the horizontal axis spans different fractions along the sucrose gradient from lowest density (blue; left) to highest density (red; right).</p><p><italic>5) It is hard to tell if S3 is depleted from the pre-30S as claimed. I'd say no...</italic></p><p>Although the depletion effect on S3 is less pronounced than that on S2 or S21, we contend that the protein is in fact depleted from the pre-30S peak in the lamotrigine treated cells and the 30S peak in the DMSO-treated cells. The effect is most apparent by comparing the intensity in fractions 1-4 of S3 with those from S8, S15, S6, and S18 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. Clearly the S3 abundance is lower than that of S8, etc. Additionally, the decreased abundance of S3 can be seen in the DMSO-treated cells by comparing the 30S peak intensities (fractions 7-9) of S3 to those of S20, S11, S12, etc. In response to the reviewers concerns, we have modified the Results section to emphasize the effect on S2 and S21 and to deemphasize the effect on S3. Critically, this change has no effect on the overall conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The effects on 50S maturation seem to be far more drastic than the effects on 30S maturation; perhaps that should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the data demonstrate very strong effects of lamotrigine treatment on 50S assembly. However, as evidenced by the significant accumulation of immature 16S rRNA in the pre-30S fractions, the effects on 30S assembly are profound in their own right. In the absence of a detailed mechanism for IF2 function in ribosome biogenesis, we have chosen to give equal weight to the effects observed on the 30S and 50S subunits. We contend that apparent assembly defects may be more pronounced in the large subunit simply as a result of the size and complexity of this subunit relative to the 30S. As a result of this complexity, even mild assembly inhibition may lead to the accumulation of the discrete particle we observe. Indeed, such effects have been observed upon depletion of a variety of assembly factors, some of which are non-essential. For example, deletion of SrmB results in the accumulation of a discrete 40S particle despite relatively mild effects on cellular growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore, 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) It would be nice to show a structure of mature 30S and 50S illustrating which of the RPs are missing. Also, the authors point out that IF2 overexpression rescues the YjeQ deletion; interestingly the YjeQ deletion has a very similar phenotype in terms of depleted proteins</italic>.</p><p>Images highlighting the depleted ribosomal proteins can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> panels C, D. We have modified the figure legends for these panels to clarify their content. We have also added a discussion point hypothesizing the functional relationship between YjeQ and IF2 during cold stress in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p><italic>8) The data indicates a maturation-specific function of the drug, and perhaps even of domain II. This should be discussed, and a domainII-specific function should be tested by complementation with IF2 from divergent species at low temperature</italic>.</p><p>We postulated the potential role(s) of IF2 in ribosome biogenesis in the Discussion. However, we attempted to keep this section concise in order to avoid over-interpretation of our data. Further investigation of the role of domain II in ribosome biogenesis through complementation is a great idea, and has previously been indirectly conducted. Two thorough investigations by Laalami et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maguire, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson, 2005</xref>) showed that truncations of the N-terminus of IF2 resulted in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that were incapable of growing at temperatures below 40°C. These results are in agreement with the cold sensitive phenotype induced by lamotrigine, and strongly suggest that complementing <italic>E. coli</italic> IF2 with the <italic>infB</italic> gene product from divergent species lacking domain II would result in cells that similarly display cold sensitivity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
