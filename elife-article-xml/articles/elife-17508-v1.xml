In eukaryotic cells, nutrients and growth factors regulate ribosomal RNA transcription through various key factors coupled to cell growth. We show here in mature adipocytes, ribosomal transcription can be acutely regulated in response to metabolic challenges. This acute response is mediated by PTRF (polymerase I transcription and release factor, also known as cavin-1), which has previously been shown to play a critical role in caveolae formation. The caveolae–independent rDNA transcriptional role of PTRF not only explains the lipodystrophy phenotype observed in PTRF deficient mice and humans, but also highlights its crucial physiological role in maintaining adipocyte allostasis. Multiple post-translational modifications of PTRF provide mechanistic bases for its regulation. The role of PTRF in ribosomal transcriptional efficiency is likely relevant to many additional physiological situations of cell growth and organismal metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17508.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17508.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17508.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity can cause several other health conditions to develop. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition, which arises in part because fat cells become unable to store excess fats. This makes certain tissues in the body less sensitive to the hormone insulin, and so the individual is less able to adapt to changing nutrient levels. Without treatment or a change in lifestyle, this insulin resistance may develop into diabetes. However, “healthy obese” individuals also exist, who can accommodate an overabundance of fat without developing insulin resistance and diabetes.</p><p>Some forms of rare genetic disorders called lipodystrophies, which result in an almost complete lack of body fat, can also lead to type 2 diabetes. This raises the question of whether lipodystrophy and obesity share some common mechanisms that cause fat cells to trigger insulin resistance. One possible player in such mechanisms is a protein called PTRF. In rare cases, individuals with lipodystrophy lack this protein, and mice that have been engineered to lack PTRF also largely lack body fat and develop insulin resistance.</p><p>Fat cells can respond rapidly to changes in nutrients during feeding or fasting, and to do so, they must produce new proteins. Structures called ribosomes, which are made up of proteins and ribosomal RNA, build proteins; thus when the cell needs to make new proteins, it also has to produce more ribosomes. PTRF is thought to play a role in ribosome production, but it is not clear how it does so.</p><p>Liu and Pilch analyzed normal mice as well as those that lacked the PTRF protein. This revealed that in response to cycles of fasting and feeding, PTRF increases the production of ribosomal RNA in fat cells, enabling the cells to produce more proteins. By contrast, the fat cells of mice that lack PTRF have much lower levels of ribosomal RNA and proteins.</p><p>Liu and Pilch then examined mouse fat cells that were grown in the laboratory. Exposing these cells to insulin caused phosphate groups to be attached to the PTRF proteins inside the cells. This modification caused PTRF to move into the cell’s nucleus, where it increased the production of ribosomal RNA.</p><p>Overall, the results show that fat cells that lack PTRF are unable to produce the proteins that they need to deal with changing nutrient levels, leading to an increased likelihood of diabetes. The next steps are to investigate the mechanism by which PTRF is modified, and to see whether the mechanisms uncovered in this study also apply to humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17508.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17508.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ribosomal transcription</kwd><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>lipodystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK30425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilch</surname><given-names>Paul F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK092942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilch</surname><given-names>Paul F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PTRF (Cavin-1) mediates metabolism-regulated ribosomal transcription in mature adipocytes, independent of its role in caveolae formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ribosome is the engine for protein synthesis and it is vital for cell growth and survival. Ribosome biogenesis, the process of making ribosomes, is a complex and energy intensive process that involves transcriptional regulators, protein modification, and the assembly of multi-component macromolecular complexes (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grummt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kusnadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</xref>). Synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is generally considered as a major rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, and it produces the common 47S precursor of mature 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs (review in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moss et al., 2007</xref>]). The 47S pre-rRNA is transcribed from hundreds of copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes distributed in repeated arrays among 5 acrocentric chromosomes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stults et al., 2008</xref>). Given the large numbers of rDNA genes, rRNA transcription can be regulated by both varying the number of transcriptionally active genes and/or by varying the rate of activated transcription. The former can be regulated through chromatin remodeling and related factors, and the latter can be acutely regulated through the factors assembled in Pol-I transcription complex machinery (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grummt, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomal transcriptional activity has been tightly linked to cell growth and proliferation. Any perturbation that changes cell growth or protein synthesis, such as nutrient and growth factor availability, senescence, toxin exposure or viral infection, leads to changes in rDNA transcription activity (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kusnadi et al., 2015</xref>). This regulatory process comprises a series of coordinated steps including transcription initiation, promoter escape, elongation and termination (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider, 2012</xref>). Regulation is achieved <italic>via</italic> coordinated multiple signaling pathways that modulate the expression and activities of many key factors, such as Pol I-specific transcription factors (RRN3, also known as transcription initiation factor 1A, TIF-1A), selectivity factor 1 (SL-1; also known as TIF-1B), upstream binding factor (UBF) and others (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bywater et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grummt, 2010</xref>). Most of these studies were performed in cultured cancer or cancer-like cell lines, where ribosomal transcriptional regulation was coupled to cell proliferation or closely related cell growth. For cell mass growth in mature non-proliferating cells, it’s less clear if and how ribosomal transcription is regulated, and the physiological relevance of ribosomal RNA transcription in these cells has been little studied.</p><p>Adipocytes are a highly metabolically dynamic cell type that can respond rapidly to alterations in nutrient excess and deprivation, thereby fulfilling its major role in whole body energy homeostasis (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scherer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). As a mature non-proliferating cell type, it undergoes dramatic changes upon metabolic challenges. In obesity due to excess calorie loading, adipocytes need to develop not only corresponding cellular structures and functions for the increasing needs in lipid storage and metabolic capacity, but also the machinery for the secretion of adipokines and other proteins. These cells also have to maintain an insulin sensitive functional response in order to avoid the development of type 2 diabetes. Given the importance of homeostatic protein synthesis as a basic cellular function to maintain structure and activity, and to ensure normal cellular physiological functions, it becomes obvious that 'healthy' adipocyte expansion has to be supported by fundamental processes such as protein synthesis, which in turn, can be determined by ribosome biogenesis. Changes in ribosomal RNA synthesis by long term starvation and re-feeding were in fact reported soon after ribosomes were first described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin and Gellhorn, 1966</xref>) although many mechanistic details of ribosome composition and function were unknown at that time. The effect of insulin on protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis in adipocytes was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansson and Ingelman-Sundberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vydelingum et al., 1983</xref>). A precisely controlled ribosomal DNA transcriptional response to changes in nutrient and insulin levels would therefore seem essential for healthy adipocytes.</p><p>We and others have shown that PTRF (polymerase I transcription and release factor, also known as Cavin-1, herein after, PTRF), plays a critical role in caveolae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>), structures that are particularly abundant in adipocytes. Moreover, a lipodystrophic phenotype was observed in PTRF null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) that is similar or identical to that of human patients with inactivating PTRF mutations who also display a type of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ardissone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dwianingsih et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jelani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shastry et al., 2010</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes that have been proposed, principally alterations in lipid metabolism/transport and perturbations of the cell surface membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilch and Liu, 2011</xref>) cannot fully explain both the adipose and muscular dystrophy phenotypes.</p><p>In fact PTRF/Cavin-1 as PTRF was first characterized by its Pol-I related regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansa et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansa and Grummt, 1999</xref>). These in vitro studies established a role for PTRF in the efficiency of rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansa et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansa and Grummt, 1999</xref>), but since then no further experiments concerning this function have been performed that we are aware of. Moreover, the physiological relevance of this activity was never established in cells or in vivo. Consequently, we used primary mouse and cultured adipocyte experimental systems to show that PTRF localized to the nucleus and associated with the pol I transcription complex, playing a direct role on metabolically regulated ribosomal DNA transcription. A number of PTRF post-translational modifications and motifs can explain its nuclear translocation and the role in mediating insulin and nutrient-regulated ribosomal transcription. PTRF also plays a critical role in maintaining the active rDNA transcriptional 'loop' formation. Our studies not only show a specific role of PTRF on metabolism-regulated ribosomal DNA transcription in the adipocyte, they add another layer of regulation to rDNA transcriptional complexity. They also highlight the role of ribosome biogenesis in adipocyte allostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Insulin stimulates PTRF nuclear translocation to the nucleus and binding to TTF1 at the ribosomal DNA transcription termination region</title><p>Using immunofluorescence staining, we showed that PTRF has a clear insulin stimulated nuclear translocation in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After insulin stimulation, PTRF but not caveolin-1 showed significant nuclear localization in isolated primary (Top panels) and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Bottom panels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further confirm this, we fractionated 3T3-L1 adipocytes into nuclear and non-nuclear fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, a significant portion of PTRF translocated to nucleus upon insulin stimulation. In contrast other caveolae component proteins such as caveolin-1, Cavin-2 (SDPR), and Cavin-3 (SRBC) did not show any nuclear localization or stimulated translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting a specific role of PTRF on rRNA transcriptional regulation. We performed an immunoprecipitation from the nuclear fraction with PTRF antibody, and consistent with the prior in-vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansa et al., 1998</xref>), our data indicated PTRF binds to TTF1 (polymerase I transcription termination factor 1) in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using a PTRF antibody followed by qPCR using primers probing the ribosomal transcription termination region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the occupancy of PTRF in the termination complex is significantly regulated by the nutrient availability and insulin.

After pre ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is synthesized, the first step is to remove the 5’ portion of the 5’-externally transcribed spacer (5’-ETS) to generate 45S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurney, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Sollner-Webb, 1981</xref>). The length of the removed region, known as the leader fragment of the 5’-ETS, is 650 bases in mouse and 414 bases in human. Because this leader sequence is rapidly excised and degraded after transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puvion-Dutilleul et al., 1997</xref>), its quantity in the nucleolus is a sensitive and highly selective marker of the amount of the nascent 47S pre-rRNA and hence, a widely used indicator of the rate of ribosomal transcription. Here we let 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and differentiated adipocytes 'rest' in PBS with 1% BSA for 3–4 hr, then switched them back to full culture medium (10% FBS in high glucose DMEM) with insulin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, pre-rRNA 47S levels were significantly up-regulated by this culture condition change. Compared to fibroblastic cells, the response in adipocytes is 2-fold higher, suggesting an adipocyte-specific rDNA transcription regulation mechanism as the levels of PTRF are much higher in the latter as compared to the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>). To see if PTRF played any role on this regulation, we isolated primary adipocytes from 6–8 weeks old wild type and PTRF null mice and challenged them with similar medium changes by switching from 1% BSA/KRP buffer to 10% FBS in high glucose DMEM with 100nM insulin. A dramatic defect of rDNA transcription up-regulation was observed in PTRF null cells as compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

To exclude cell proliferation associated ribosomal transcription, cells were pre-treated with nocodazole to induce cell arrest by depolymerizing the microtubule network, and culture media were switched from 1% BSA in PBS to full culture medium with insulin. Consistent with the results from adipocytes, PTRF null MEFs showed a dramatically smaller response to the culture condition change. PTRF transfection rescued this defect, whereas caveolin-1 (Cav-1) cannot, indicating a role of PTRF independent of its function in caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To determine if loss of this acute PTRF-dependent rDNA transcriptional regulation caused any long term ribosome biogenesis defect, we measured total protein, RNA and pre-rRNA contents in primary adipocytes from PTRF null and control wild type mice. Although 6–8 week old mice did not show any differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), in 6-month old mice, total protein and RNA were significantly reduced in PTRF null primary adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To mimic these physiological conditions in vitro, we repeatedly challenged WT and PTRF null 3T3-L1 adipocytes by repeated 'feeding', and 'fasting' at 12-hr intervals. After seven days, the PTRF null adipocytes showed a dramatically lower lipid content, less total protein and less total and 47S RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which essentially recapitulated the lipodystrophy characteristics observed in the PTRF knockout mouse model and human patients with PTRF deficiencies. These data suggest a PTRF-dependent ribosomal transcriptional response may be the early and direct causal mechanism for the pathogenesis of in vivo lipodystrophy. Interestingly we saw a subunit of RNA polymerase I, PolR1A dramatically decreased upon 3T3-L1 differentiation, whereas PTRF and TTF1 levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting a possible adipocyte-specific termination factor-dependent mechanism for the rDNA transcription regulations (See Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The p53 pathway is dysregulated upon loss of PTRF</title><p>It has been reported that deregulated ribosomal biogenesis can induce p53 pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Woods et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Lu, 2009</xref>), which will lead to cell growth arrest, apoptosis and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>).

We did not observe a significant p53 and MDM2 protein level change at basal condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left).

This is probably due to insufficient rRNA synthesis causing a relative increased accumulation of ribosomal proteins in the nucleus, which is also called nuclear stress. When we challenged the cells by 'fasting' medium, the inefficient rRNA transcription regulation was confirmed in PTRF null cells comparing to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Besides this, PTRF contains a protein sequence (<sup>54</sup>V<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>V<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>S<bold><underline>LL</underline></bold>DKII<sup>64</sup>), which is highly similar to nuclear export signals (NESs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The NES is a short amino acid sequence of hydrophobic residues in a protein that targets it for export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex by interacting with exportin, and the common NES sequence motif is 'LxxLxxLxL', where 'L' is a hydrophobic residue (often leucine) and 'x' is any other amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogerd et al., 1996</xref>). To investigate if this NES signal plays any role in PTRF nuclear localization, we generated a mutant by deletion of this region and expressed it in HEK293 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> this mutant was exclusive localized in the nucleus, probably due to the loss of nuclear export signal.

However the band in SDS-PAGE always migrates at 55–60 kDa. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we showed that PTRF is mono-ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Based on the size of 8 kDa for each ubiquitin protein, PTRF seems to be mono-ubiquitinated at two sites. Thus we expressed 8 PTRF truncation constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated them with anti-myc antibody followed by western blot using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, it seems that two regions (166-192aa and 193-249aa) are responsible for one mono-ubiquitination each. Protein monoubiquitination has recently emerged as an important posttranslational modification regulating transcription, endocytic vesicle trafficking, histone modification, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pemberton and Paschal, 2005</xref>).

NLS can also be regulated by monoubiquitination signals. Studies have suggested that monoubiquitination can mask its NLS resulting in cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Mallampalli, 2009</xref>). Our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, taken together, suggest the localization of PTRF in caveolae or in the nucleus might be coordinated by monoubiquitination, NLS and NES motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Intact caveolae are required for PTRF tyr-phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and ribosomal function</title><p>To test if intact caveolae are required for PTRF ribosomal functions we treated mouse primary adipocyte with beta-methyl-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), which has been widely used to disrupt caveolae structure due to cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wiesmann et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>).

When PTRF/Cavin-1 is knocked out in mice or lost through mutation in humans, caveolae are absent and the metabolic consequences are severe, including muscular and lipodystrophies. The possible explanation(s) proposed for the adipocyte lipodystrophic phenotype include alterations in lipid transport and/or altered plasma membrane adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilch and Liu, 2011</xref>), but these do not fully explain the progressive nature of the lipodystrophy observed in vivo. The transport/membrane defects would be present at birth presumably causing an immediate fat cell deficiency. On the other hand and given that the lipodystrophy of PTRF/Cavin-1 null mice and humans has a progressive severity, PTRF’s eponymous function in rRNA synthesis does indeed provide a possible explanation whereby decreased rRNA transcription as a function of time would lead to adipocyte loss due to the inability to maintain adequate protein levels, and we present data here in support of this hypothesis.</p><p>It was recognized some time ago that a fraction of PTRF could be found in the nucleus of human fat cells consistent with it having two nuclear localization sequences, but the possible functional significance of this finding was not pursued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aboulaich, 2004</xref>).

The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> derive from a comparison of WT and PTRF null primary mouse fat cells and gene edited cultured fat cells, and taken together, support the hypothesis that inefficient rRNA transcription underlies the lipodystrophy observed in mice and humans. Moreover, the absence of PTRF would be expected to lead to ribosomal stress, which in turn would lead to fat cell loss over time, and we find evidence for this process in fat cells from PTRF null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear localization of PTRF is dynamic and regulated by insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation under anabolic conditions and Ser/Thre phosphorylation under catabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

These results make physiological sense by adjusting potential ribosomal activity to the nutritional status of the cell. A further level of regulation may be achieved by ubiquitination and we have verified the necessity of the nuclear export signal in PTRF dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) support the idea that intact caveolae are required for PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear function. Further conceptual support for this derives from the fact that the relevant kinases are very likely to be located at the plasma membrane but further experiments regarding this and the other PTRF modifications will be necessary to complete the picture.</p><p>Lastly for ribosome transcription, it’s also proposed that 'loop' formation between initiation and termination complexes is essential for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denissov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nemeth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nemeth and Langst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sander and Grummt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shiue et al., 2009</xref>). Our studies support that PTRF play an essential role in this loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We show that in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, there is a high level of Pol-I expression in order to ensure the needs of rRNA syntheses by increasing the number of active transcription sites. This is closely correlated with pre-adipocyte proliferation. Upon adipocyte differentiation and consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>) Pol-I levels were dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas PTRF and TTF-1 levels were increased correspondingly, indicating ribosomal transcription in mature adipocyte became less Pol-I dependent, and more reliant on the regulation of transcriptional efficiency through the termination machinery. Our results support the notion that cells have developed at least these two different mechanisms to ensure proper control of ribosomal transcription in a cell type and physiological condition-specific manner. One mechanism is Pol-I dependent active transcriptional number regulation, which plays major role in proliferating cells. The other is termination factor, PTRF-dependent transcriptional rate regulation, which plays a critical role in mature differentiated cells in response to nutrient challenges. In fact, all cells must maintain a certain level of ribosomal activity to maintain protein expression upon their normal turnover, and nutritionally stressed cells such as adipocytes have a particular need for this activity. These cells are subject to repeated cycles of feeding and fasting, and indeed, we show in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the consequences of PTRF deficiency in this regard. We see no apparent differences in protein and fat content between WT and PTRF null fat cells until we expose them to the metabolic stress of repeated fasting and refeeding cycles. The PTRF null cells show a dramatic reduction in total triglyceride, RNA and protein content which essentially recapitulates the lipodystrophy in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) that is occurring in vivo in PTRF deficient mice and humans.</p><p>The PTRF null status obviously represents the extreme, but variations in PTRF expression would be predicted to have phenotypic consequences, in particular, in response to overnutrition, a ubiquitously prevalent condition in current times. What has been observed is that some individuals respond to over-nutrition by fat cell expansion requiring ribosomal activity to amass the additional proteins required to increase the size of fat cells and accommodate the excess nutrients as triglyceride, the so-called healthy obese individuals who lack obvious metabolic pathology. On the other hand, most people apparently fail to mount an adequate adipocyte adaptive response, and this results in fat spilling over to liver and muscle resulting in hepatosteatosis and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that the capacity of adaptational ribosomal DNA transcription may determine the maximal limit of adipocyte functional homeostasis and may coincide with these metabolic perturbations. In support of this idea, mice were exposed to conditions of normal, over and under nutrition from birth to weaning and then subjected to the same diet and followed for up to 112 days. The mice subject to undernourishment show an apparent inability for adipose tissue expansion that correlates with PTRF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kozak et al., 2010</xref>). Together these data and ours suggest the PTRF-dependent ribosomal transcriptional response to metabolic challenges may be the early and direct causal molecular mechanism for the pathological developments of adipose tissue function in vivo, lipodystrophy in the worst case scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal</title><p><italic>Ptrf</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were created as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2008</xref>).

The data provide novel insights into the functions and mechanisms of action of PTRF that include its nuclear translocation in response to insulin, the signals within its structure that mediate this re-localization and identification of specific phosphorylation sites that appear to be required for the activity of PTRF on directing rDNA transcription.

While data on the NES mutant PTRF is an important result, it is also possible that intact caveolae are required for the overall effect of PTRF on rRNA. Thus, a key experiment would be to analyze the role of PTRF in cells that are deficient in caveolae (caveolin 1 KO cells) so that a clear distinction can be made between PTRF function on rRNA, independent of its role in caveolae, versus a possible role in caveolae that affects this former function.</p><p>Related to this issue, do other caveolae proteins translocate to the nucleus and does the release of PTRF affect any functions of caveolae?

As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, when caveolae integrity was disrupted by cholesterol depletion using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (see Liu and Pilch, JBC 2008;283(7):4314-22 and Breen et al., PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34516.), there was essentially complete loss of caveolae and consequently, insulin-stimulated PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and effects on ribosomal transcription. The total level of PTRF is unchanged in this protocol. These data are consistent with intact caveolae being necessary for PTRF phosphorylation and subsequent proper targeting to the nucleus, hence its function on rRNA transcription. A new section describing these results has been added to the revised manuscript. Although caveolin-1 null cells might have been an ideal model to test PTRF caveolae-independent function, we and others have shown that the expression levels of caveolin-1 and PTRF are always linked to one other in existing physiological models such as cav-1 or cavin-1/PTRF null mice. Thus there is essentially no PTRF in the <italic>Cav1</italic> null mouse (Liu and Pilch, unpublished; Hansen et al., Nat Commun. 2013; 4: 1831). Together with the other figures presented in this manuscript, we believe our data clearly show a distinction between PTRF function in the nucleus and in caveolae.</p><p><italic>Related to this issue, do other caveolae proteins translocate to the nucleus and does the release of PTRF affect any functions of caveolae? Further related to this issue of the relationship between intact caveolae and PTRF: is it possible that PTRF from other pools in the cytoplasm is translocating to the nucleus? Overall, the revised manuscript will have to clarify these relationships between PTRF action on rRNA and the potential role of caveolae in this function.</italic> </p><p>New data were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> showing the other caveolae proteins, Cav-1, cavin-2 and -3, do not undergo nuclear localization or any stimulated translocation. Thus there is no overall movement of caveolae, just PTRF, which undergoes a specific translocation from plasma membrane caveolae to the nucleus in response to insulin. In the context of caveolae positive cells, PTRF translocation through cellular compartment(s) other than caveolae, the cytosol in particular, appears to be unlikely. First, the data presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are consistent with PTRF localization in caveolae being necessary for translocation. In the context of PTRF in caveolae positive cells, we showed (Breen et al., PLoS1, 2012) by cell fractionation that the amount of this protein in the cytosol is very small (&lt;5%) compared to that at present in caveolae. Moreover, these data may be the result of cell disruption, not intrinsic localization, as PTRF/cavin-1 dissociates from caveolae upon membrane and osmolarity stress (Sinha et al., Cell 2011, 144:402-413) both of which occur during cell disruption. Thus we think our data, including the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, clarify how PTRF localizes to caveolae, probably exclusively, and then translocates to the nucleus upon its insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
