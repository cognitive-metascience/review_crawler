signals. Histidine kinases (HK) are the sensory component, transferring information toward downstream response regulators (RR). HKs transfer phosphoryl groups to their specific RRs, but also dephosphorylate them, overall ensuring proper signaling. The mechanisms by which HKs discriminate between such disparate directions, are yet unknown. We now disclose crystal structures of the HK:RR complex DesK:DesR from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, comprising snapshots of the phosphotransfer and the dephosphorylation reactions. The HK dictates the reactional outcome through conformational rearrangements that include the reactive histidine. The phosphotransfer center is asymmetric, poised for dissociative nucleophilic substitution. The structural bases of HK phosphatase/phosphotransferase control are uncovered, and the unexpected discovery of a dissociative reactional center, sheds light on the evolution of TCS phosphotransfer reversibility. Our findings should be applicable to a broad range of signaling systems and instrumental in synthetic TCS rewiring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21422.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21422.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>two component systems</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>allosteric control of protein function</kwd><kwd>phosphoryl-transfer mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008725</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCE2009_1_2679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trajtenberg</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name><name><surname>Buschiazzo</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCV06_138918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buschiazzo</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FOCEM (MERCOSUR Structural Convergence Fund)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COF 03/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buschiazzo</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centro de Biologia Estructural del Mercosur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buschiazzo</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008725</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCE2007_219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trajtenberg</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name><name><surname>Buschiazzo</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The molecular mechanism of switching between phosphotransferase- and phosphatase-competent states in histidine-kinases has been uncovered, through direct crystallographic observation of bona fide complexes between a histidine-kinase and its response regulator from <italic>Bacillus subtilise</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perception of environmental and intracellular cues is an essential feature of life. Signaling pathways enable cells to regulate genetic and biochemical programs for adaptation and survival. Two-component systems (TCSs) play a particularly important role among protein machineries that cells have evolved to carry out signaling, widely distributed in bacteria, fungi and plants. The simplest TCSs comprise a sensory histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao and Stock, 2009</xref>). The signal is transmitted downstream from HK to RR, through an orderly sequence of conformational rearrangements coupled to phosphoryl-transfer reactions. The HK is turned on or off after signal-dependent allosteric rearrangements, which control autophosphorylation on a conserved histidine residue. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from the phosphorylated kinase to a conserved aspartate on the RR receiver domain, activating it to effect a specific output response. When auto-kinase activity is turned off, HKs often act as a phosphatase of their cognate phosphorylated RR (P~RR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulian, 2010</xref>), contributing to shutting down the pathway. Despite being paradoxical for a protein kinase, the phosphatase activity of HKs is physiologically relevant ensuring robust homeostatic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schramke et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>HKs are homodimeric proteins, comprising an N-terminal sensor domain and a more conserved catalytic core. Trans-membrane HKs display the catalytic region in the cytoplasm and the sensory domain within the lipid bilayer or toward the extracellular/periplasmic space. The catalytic core typically includes a helical Dimerization and Histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain, followed by a <bold>C</bold>atalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domain. HKs are classified according to DHp sequence signatures in HisKA, HisKA_2, HisKA_3, HWE_HK and His_kinase families. CheA-like HKs instead harbor the reactive His within a Histidine <bold>P</bold>hospho<bold>t</bold>ransfer (HPt) domain that is not involved in dimerization. Overall sequence conservation among HKs can be very low, but the entire catalytic region is remarkably conserved at the structural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zschiedrich et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that functional mechanisms are shared. RRs comprise a receiver domain (REC), which may be adjacent to additional effector domains (DNA binding, enzymatic, etc.). REC phosphorylation stabilizes structural rearrangements associated with effector domain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao and Stock, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorelays are examples of more complex TCS pathways, involving additional intermediate phosphotransfer proteins, such as extra REC, HPt and/or modified DHp domains. Phosphorelays allow for more complex signaling circuits and sharper regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulian, 2010</xref>). HKs have evolved to catalyze irreversible phosphotransfer reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Porter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Potter et al., 2002</xref>) ensuring a unidirectional input→output information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourret and Stock, 2002</xref>). However, evolutionary pressure has also resulted in signaling pathways where reversible steps are simultaneously required, mostly in phosphorelays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burbulys et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janiak-Spens et al., 2005</xref>), where dedicated HPt modules act as phospho-donors and -acceptors. The molecular bases underlying such differential reversibility patterns remain unknown, raising the question of how signaling pathway directionality is ensured, from input signal to adaptive response.</p><p>To address this question we have used the TCS DesK-DesR from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Mendoza, 2014</xref>). We had previously shown that the HK DesK, a member of the HisKA_3 family, undergoes important conformational changes to switch between phosphatase- and phosphotransfer-competent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>). The cytoplasmic portion of DesK (DesKC) including its entire catalytic region, displays a symmetric and rigid structure in the phosphatase state. DesK activation implies its rearrangement into an auto-kinase competent form with substantially higher flexibility. Upon auto-phosphorylation DesKC adopts a strongly asymmetric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>) able to transfer the phosphoryl group to DesR, its downstream RR partner. The DHp α-helices include a conserved membrane-proximal coiled-coil motif, upstream of the phosphorylatable His. Such DHp segment is critical for signal transmission, folding into a coiled-coil in the phosphatase state, whereas in the phosphotransferase form this coiled-coil breaks apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saita et al., 2015</xref>). We now report the crystal structures of the DesKC:DesR complex, trapped in the phosphatase and the phosphotransferase functional states. Extensive conformational rearrangements reveal how the two reaction centers are remodeled. Our data indicate that the relative orientation and distance of the reactive histidine with respect to the receiver aspartate is a molecular determinant controlling signal directionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two crystal structures of the DesKC:DesR complex represent snapshots of the dephosphorylation and the phosphotransfer reactions</title><p>To grasp the molecular determinants of unidirectional TCS signaling, the crystal structures of DesKC in complex with DesR were determined in two functional states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The N-terminal coiled-coil is formed in one of the complexes present in the asymmetric unit (in green and purple).

The alternate conformation appears to be forming the coiled-coil structure, but was not included given the weak electron density map. The N-terminal ends of both complexes are establishing crystal contacts with neighboring molecules, and different dehydration treatment of the crystals appear to force this alternative conformation (data not shown).

(ASU) of this crystal structure shows one full complex and half of a second one, which is completed through the crystallographic two-fold symmetry operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Several features indicate that this complex represents a snapshot of the phosphatase reaction, hereafter denominated the ‘phosphatase complex’. Symmetric organizations are a hallmark of HKs in the ‘auto-kinase off / phosphatase on’ states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamada et al., 2009</xref>). The phosphatase complex we have now crystallized indeed displays high symmetry, both in the way the REC domains associate to the HK dimer, as well as between HK monomers. The two independently refined phosphatase complexes show one dimer of DesKC<sub>STAB</sub> bound to two molecules of DesR-REC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), with the latter occupying equivalent positions on either side of the HK core. The 2:2 HK:RR stoichiometry was confirmed in solution by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), revealing an entropy-driven, endothermic association reaction. Size exclusion chromatography-coupled small-angle X ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) further supported the 2:2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>). There is also a high internal symmetry between both HK monomers, with CA domains rigidly fixed onto the central DHp and a resulting butterfly-like shape of the whole molecule. A second feature consistent with a phosphatase-competent configuration, is that one AMP-PCP (ATP analogue) moiety is bound to each CA domain, far (&gt;27 Å) from the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphorylation sites on the central DHp, precluding auto-kinase activity (subscripts HK and RR highlight the protein to which the indicated residues belong). Finally, the structural rearrangements triggered at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saita et al., 2015</xref>), driving DesK to its phosphatase state, have been linked to the stabilization of an N-terminal coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>). The three point-mutations engineered within DesK helix α1, are indeed observed to stabilize a coiled-coil structure toward the N-terminus in the phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Coiled-coil stabilization was devised according to previous structures of free DesKC<sub>H188V</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>), a mutant version that maintains normal P~DesR-specific phosphatase activities in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albanesi et al., 2004</xref>). Free DesKC<sub>H188V</sub> structures superimpose extremely well onto the HK partner of the phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). SEC-SAXS data further suggest that the coiled-coil conformation in the phosphatase complex was the most abundant species in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), involving a large α1:α1 dimerization interface of ~2100 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Regarding the RR component within the phosphatase complex, the three DesR-REC molecules in the ASU display identical ‘active-like’ structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</xref>). BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> moieties mimicking phosphoryl groups are observed bonded to each phosphorylatable Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>, and coordinated to Mg<sup>2+</sup> cations, consistent with this crystal form being a snapshot of the phosphatase reaction at its pre-dephosphorylation step.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21422.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry parameters.

The crystal structure was eventually solved by using the phosphomimetic DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> mutant in complex with DesR-REC. Three X ray diffraction datasets were obtained from DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC crystals soaked with different concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The three structures are similar, showing two DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC complexes in the ASU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A number of observations readily distinguish this complex from the phosphatase one, supporting it has captured a ground state of the P~HK→RR phosphoryl-transfer reaction, hereafter referred to as the ‘phosphotransferase complex’. In the first place, the phosphotransferase complex is highly asymmetric, a typical feature of phosphorylated and kinase-active forms of HKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mechaly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casino et al., 2014</xref>). One DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> dimer was observed bound to one DesR-REC monomer in the crystal. This 2:1 stoichiometry was further supported by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and SEC-SAXS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>) in solution. The symmetry is also broken within the HK dimer, with one of the two CAs interacting with the DHp helix α1 of the other protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The second CA domain is free, visible in the structure due to fortuitous crystal packing contacts. Such arrangement leaves only one RR-binding site available on the HK in the phosphotransferase state, explaining the asymmetric stoichiometry. Secondly, structural superposition of the HK partner extracted from the phosphotransferase complex, with the available structure of free phosphorylated DesK (<italic>wt</italic> P~DesKC [PDB 3GIG]), reveals closely similar conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), confirming that the structure of DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> in complex is a reliable model of the <italic>wt</italic> phosphorylated species. Finally, BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> was not observed bonded to Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> in any of the DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC complex structures, despite testing elevated soaking concentrations. Yet, the phosphorylation sites of the RR partners are very similar compared to the phosphatase complex, allowing for the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation to bind alike (the cation was observed bound only in phosphotransferase complex structures soaked with high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations). The absence of BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the phosphotransferase state, even though Mg<sup>2+</sup> was eventually bound, is consistent with phosphorylated HKs not interacting with phosphorylated RR species. The molecular basis for a decreased BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> affinity in the phosphotransferase became clear later by comparing both states’ reaction centers (see below). Taken together, the evidence indicates the phosphotransferase complex represents a snapshot of the transfer reaction, prior to the P~His→Asp phosphoryl group migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DesK and DesR interact through a ‘slippery’ interface</title><p>Both phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes show that the REC domain of DesR interacts with DesK through its α1<sub>(RR)</sub> helix and the β5α5<sub>(RR)</sub> loop, with a few additional contacts from the N-terminal portion of helix α5<sub>(RR)</sub> and the beginning of loop β4α4<sub>(RR)</sub>.

Ser<sub>196(HK)</sub> and Gln<sub>193(HK)</sub>, located on the same face of α1<sub>(HK)</sub> as Leu<sub>200(HK)</sub>, establish additional van der Waals contacts within a groove on the RR’s surface, extending the Leu<sub>200(HK)</sub>-lodging pocket all the way to the reaction center, which is rather open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Very few polar contacts are observed surrounding the hydrophobic core, on both ends of the interface patch: Asp<sub>203(HK)</sub>/Arg<sub>206(HK)</sub> with Ser<sub>106(RR)</sub>/Glu<sub>107(RR)</sub>, and a salt bridge between Arg<sub>235(HK)</sub> and Asp<sub>103(RR)</sub> on the other end. The buried surface is ~1400 Å<sup>2</sup> in the phosphatase state, the DHp:REC interface being the major contributor (~1000 Å<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), although the CA domain adds a buried area of &gt;400 Å<sup>2</sup>.

These significant movements engage corresponding shifts in the positions of interacting residues, albeit preserving the contacts, reminiscent of a ‘slippery’ interface. The slippery nature of the interface is consistent with its planarity, a low number of mainly hydrophobic contacts, leading to low shape complementarity and unfilled cavities within the RR partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21422.011</object-id><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Square matrix of all possible pair-wise structural superpositions.

Below the main diagonal the structurally invariant region of DesK DHp domains (residues 190–234<sub>(HK)</sub>) were superposed, whereas above the diagonal, the DesR REC domains (residues 1–129<sub>(RR)</sub>) were superposed instead. Resulting root mean squared deviations (in Å) were calculated, for both matrix halves, between all Cα atoms of the REC domains (residues 1–129<sub>(RR)</sub>) after superposition, as indicated in each individual matrix cell. Font colors highlight the two different alignment procedures performed. The significant differences between corresponding blue- and red-colored values, indicate that the REC domains do not change within, but rather ‘slip’ with respect to the kinase DHp

functional states of the kinase</title><p>Comparing the phosphatase <italic>vs</italic> phosphotransferase complexes, the HK partner reveals substantial rearrangements. Concerning the DHp domain, a large rotational shift is observed on the membrane-proximal side of the phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), in contrast to the distal RR-binding site, which remains essentially invariant. The relative orientation of the CA domains is also dramatically changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the RR REC domain adopts a unique conformation in both complexes, with an average rmsd of 0.3 Å aligning all Cα atoms, and no significant contrast clustering phosphatase vs phosphotransferase structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, this conformation adopted by the REC domain in complex with the kinase, combines structural features of both active and inactive states as seen in the free forms of RRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao and Stock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Namely, the β4α4 loop and β5 strand emulate the inactive RR, while the rest of the protein resembles the free phosphorylated species. The β4α4 loop is closed in phosphorylated RRs (e.g. PDB 4LE0), coupled to a fully wound first turn of helix α4 (Pro<sub>85(RR)</sub> displays a dihedral ψ angle near −40°, allowing for α-helicity). The REC molecules in both phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes, show instead this β4α4 loop open (with Pro<sub>85(RR)</sub> ψ angles of respectively 126° and 130°, and the first turn of α4 unwound, as observed in the inactive state of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free protein [PDB 4LE1]). Thus acting as a ‘phosphate lid’, the β4α4 loop opens and closes to control phosphoryl-transfer chemistry on Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21422.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A shared RR REC domain conformation in the phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes, has active- and inactive-like features.</title><p>The phosphotransferase complex (this study, PDB 5IUK) is shown in cartoon representation, following the same coloring scheme as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. REC domains from reported free DesR species are shown superposed, in gray the inactive Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free RR (PDB 4LE1) and the active species in cyan (PDB 4LE0). Note that the complexed form of the regulator (in magenta) is mainly similar to the active species, including in the β1α1 loop and α1 helix (that play key roles in the structuring of the RR’s active site), even though the RR is not phosphorylated on the reactive Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>. Dashed outlines highlight the regions that most resemble each functional state. Note that the inactive-like region essentially involves the end of β4 and the β4α4 loop, which closes in as a phosphate lid in P~DesR. Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> (shown in transparent sticks for clarity) interacts with the HK, playing a role in phosphate lid opening in both phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes. Tyr<sub>99(RR)</sub> on strand β5 (the strand is not visible below α4), typically forming a H-bond with the main chain O of Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> in activated RRs, is observed farther away in both DesK:DesR complexes, yet another feature of inactive states. Inset: a close-up of the N-terminal tip of helix α4 is shown. The dihedral ψ angle of Pro<sub>85(RR)</sub> is linked to the active/inactive shift of the β4α4 loop.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21422.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21422.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21422-fig3-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21422.013</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Major structural differences of the HK partner, comparing the phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural superposition of the phosphatase (red) and phosphotransferase (green) complexes, using the invariant region of the DHp domains (residues 190–234).

An ~80° rotation of helix α1 is coupled to a cogwheel-like shift of helix α2, at the level of the phosphorylation site within the DHp domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albanesi et al., 2009</xref>). This rotation includes the phosphorylatable His<sub>188(HK)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which had not been previously observed. Due to this shift, the side chain of His<sub>188(HK)</sub> ends up buried in the phosphatase state, establishing a H-bond with the same residue of the other protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), displaced away from the reaction center as compared to the phosphotransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub> right next to the phosphorylation site, follows a similarly dramatic rearrangement, well positioned only in the phosphatase complex to make a salt bridge with Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub>. Neighboring Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> thus inserts its aromatic side chain into a hydrophobic pocket formed between DHp α1 of one HK protomer and α2’ of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). That the reactive histidine moves away from the catalytic site in the phosphatase state is consistent with its marginal role in P~RR dephosphorylation catalysis in HisKA_3 HKs. Indeed, the phosphorylatable His was proved nonessential for NarX-mediated P~NarL dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huynh et al., 2010</xref>). His has been implicated in EnvZ-mediated phosphatase catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhu et al., 2000</xref>) in which case its imidazole would act as a base assisting the attack of water on the P~aspartyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhate et al., 2015</xref>). But contradictory results cast doubts on such a direct role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsing and Silhavy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skarphol et al., 1997</xref>). Instead, a Gln in HisKA_3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huynh et al., 2010</xref>), corresponding to Gln<sub>193(HK)</sub> in DesK, or a Thr/Asn in HisKA HKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willett and Kirby, 2012</xref>), equivalently positioned one helical turn C-terminal to the phosphorylatable His, play a key role in the phosphatase reaction, positioning a catalytic water molecule. Such water or hydroxide molecule is well located to perform the nucleophilic attack on the phosphoryl group, as observed in the P~CheY3 phosphatase CheX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pazy et al., 2010</xref>), a shared geometry among phosphatases and HKs as we now observe in the DesKC:DesR-REC phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The rotational phosphatase→phosphotransferase rearrangement disrupts the Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub>:Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub> ionic bond, and coupled to the α1<sub>(HK)</sub> and α2’<sub>(HK</sub>) movements, the position of Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> shifts, propagating along the rest of the phosphate lid β4α4 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This shift accounts for the capacity of Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> to be at H-bonding distance from the P~His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphoryl moiety, accompanying its transfer, and maintaining the H-bond to the phosphate on P~Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Further supporting that this ensemble of conformations is functionally relevant, molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphotransferase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) recapitulated the gliding shifts of one partner with respect to the other, reaching the different arrangements observed in the crystal structures at different moments of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Loose HK:RR association architectures can actually be observed in other TCS-related complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zapf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Willett et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting it is a universal feature. This explains the considerable promiscuity reported in different TCSs in in vitro assays, if long enough incubation times are allowed for a given HK to phosphotransfer to different RRs, including surrogate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Skerker et al., 2005</xref>). HK:RR interactions thus ensure high specificity, but also avoiding exceedingly high stability, which would hinder proper functional modulation and, ultimately, signal transmission altogether. Evolutionarily selected to be loose, slippery interfaces are inherently tolerant for substantial sequence variation of protein:protein contacting residues. Such tolerance is consistent with the extensive degeneracy found in TCS pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>), likely a general feature of HK:RR interactions. However, a permissive tendency for substitutions would appear to be contradictory with the high protein:protein specificity requirements of these systems. The DesK:DesR structures now provide with molecular details explaining why epistasis is found as a key property of HK:RR interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>). Epistatic amino acid changes are those that depend on the presence of other substitutions, leading to different effects in combination than individually. While interfacing residue replacements on any one of the TCS components can easily be accommodated due to the loose character of the protein:protein association, epistatic substitutions in the same component and/or in the other partner, are called to play essential stabilizing or destabilizing compensatory roles. Epistatic substitutions are thus selected, such that partner recognition and non-cognate discrimination are maintained, but without leading to overstable, non-functional complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A novel conformation of the response regulator when complexed with the histidine kinase</title><p>Our data indicate that the HK is largely unable to discriminate binding to RR or P~RR on the basis of structural determinants.

Among the few differential contacts, they mainly implicate the HK’s CA domain, but unlikely to grant discrimination ability given the highly similar conformation of the RR in those regions.</p><p>Calorimetry data are consistent with the crystallographic evidence, revealing only modest differences between DesR-REC:DesKC<sub>H188V</sub>and DesR-REC:DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), further supporting that both HK functional states interact with DesR-REC with similar strengths. Collecting calorimetric data by titrating DesKC with P~DesR-REC would be interesting to directly compare with the unphosphorylated form, but binding confounds with simultaneous P~RR dephosphorylation, and the addition of BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> to mimic RR phosphorylation resulted in protein aggregation. We did succeed in engineering a different phosphatase-trapped DesKC mutant, by insertion of additional heptad repeats in the coiled-coil segment (to be published elsewhere), indeed displaying equivalent DesR-REC-binding K<sub>D</sub> figures compared to DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>. HK:RR binding data in other TCSs are scarce, particularly exploring differential affinities according to the proteins’ phosphorylation status. The few cases dealing with HKs that switch between phosphatase/phosphotransferase-competent states, do provide further evidence in support of non-discrimination. EnvZ binds OmpR and P~OmpR with equivalent affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshida et al., 2002</xref>), as well as PhoQ binding to PhoP or P~PhoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castelli et al., 2003</xref>). Future studies shall uncover the relevance of additional mechanisms at the cell level that might favor particular HK:RR pairs to form, such as absolute and relative TCS protein concentrations, stability of non-phosphorylated HK:RR species in complex, subcellular spatial dynamics of each partner, and precise time-courses for HK and RR phosphorylated species to appear/disappear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway</title><p>Considering all the evidence, we can now propose a conceptual model explaining the molecular workings of the DesK/DesR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When the pathway is turned off, HK autophosphorylation is inhibited by: 1) hindering CA domains mobility, holding ATP substrates far from the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphorylation site; and, 2) DHp helical rotation, making the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> side chains inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This ‘open’ autokinase-off configuration is linked to a folded N-terminal coiled-coil, in which DesK can bind P~DesR and trigger phosphatase catalysis. Linked to P~DesR phosphate lid opening, Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub> binds to Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub>, and Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> becomes inserted into a DHp pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> is thus removed from the closed position, which would otherwise clash with an incoming nucleophilic water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>) that brings about dephosphorylation (Pazy et al., 2010). DesK Gln<sub>193(HK)</sub> is well located to position the catalytic water to perform dephosphorylation, consistent with the essential role of the homologous Gln residues in the phosphatase reactions mediated by the phosphatase CheZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>) or by the HK NarX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huynh et al., 2010</xref>). The rotational movement of His<sub>188(HK)</sub>, placing it at &gt;18 Å away from the reactive Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>, makes phosphoryl back-transfer P~DesR→DesK impossible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although sequence divergence makes the DHp rotational shift unlikely in HisKA HKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marina et al., 2005</xref>), DHp kinking by means of a conserved proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mechaly et al., 2014</xref>) could regulate the separation of the phosphorylatable His from the reaction center, analogously to the HisKA_3 rotational switch.

Possibly implying trans-membrane helix tilting, or other signal-triggered helical reconfigurations, a direct connection of sensory to intracytoplasmic α-helices can be posited. This switch can be readily understood as an order-disorder transition, which has been observed in HKs and other modular proteins, to work as an intraprotein signaling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schultz and Natarajan, 2013</xref>). Helical rotational shifts have also been uncovered in structural elements within chemotaxis and TCSs, such as in HAMP domains, likely revealing common underlying transduction mechanisms eventually controlling their physiologic directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airola et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HK activation leads to autophosphorylation and subsequent switching to its phosphotransferase state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Comparing the conformation of the phosphorylatable histidine between HKs performing auto-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mechaly et al., 2014</xref>), and the phosphotransferase complex (this study), the His residue shows ~180° flipping of its imidazole side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). During auto-phosphorylation, His<sub>Nδ1</sub> has been observed to H-bond with the ultra-conserved acidic His + 1 residue, which corresponds to Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub> in DesK. Such H-bond enhances His Nε2 nucleophilicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quezada et al., 2005</xref>), and indeed a carboxylate at His + 1 is critical for autophosphorylation in a number of HKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willett and Kirby, 2012</xref>). Once phosphorylated, the His disrupts its contact with this neighbor carboxylate group, stabilizing the P~HK species and leading to His χ−2 dihedral angle flipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Subsequent re-protonation of His<sub>188</sub>Nδ1, triggered by RR binding, is consistent with P-N bond weakening, as a first step towards phosphotransfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This mechanism might be critical in dissociative P~HK→RR reactions, which lack the simultaneous nucleophilic attack that the receiver Asp<sub>(RR)</sub> carries out in associative ones.</p><p>Our model predicts an important role of the highly conserved Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> in stabilizing an intermediary metaphosphate group, ideally positioned to accompany the migrating phosphoryl moiety. This threonine has been substituted in CheY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ganguli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appleby and Bourret, 1998</xref>) and DosR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gautam et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting it is not directly engaged in catalysis, but does play important roles in phosphoryl-transfer in vitro and proper in vivo signaling. Systematic mutagenesis studies substituting this threonine in different TCS pairs are needed to be conclusive about its role in phosphotransfer. Once the phosphotransferase reaction is complete, immediate dephosphorylation of the P~Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>, as well as P~DesR→DesK back-transfer, are minimized. The β4α4 loop in DesR plays a key role in these controls, remodeling its configuration in concert with DesK-association. This loop, acting as a phosphate lid, is open in the phosphotransferase complex, enabling the transfer reaction (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Yet, the phosphate lid is expected to close in, following the phosphoryl migration during transfer, due to the strong phosphoryl-Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> interaction. Phosphotransfer thus results in a fully activated RR configuration, with a closed phosphate lid that ensures the release of a stable P~DesR species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), as observed in active free RR structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The β4α4 loop amino acid sequence is not well conserved among different RRs and RR families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2016</xref>), despite its direct implication in forming the HK:RR interface.

Some of these positions had already been pinpointed as highly variable, yet functionally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Immormino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2016</xref>), recognizing positions T + 1 and T + 2 (starting from T, the conserved position Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub>) among others, as important modulators of RRs’ catalytic activities. Particular sequence signatures of these variable motifs, have been found to correlate with RR families, in turn connected to the distinct physiological constraints of each family’s signaling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2016</xref>). Our data now illustrate an additional selective pressure dimension to such variable positions, linked to the evolution of the HK:RR interface. Beyond sequence variability, the RR β4α4 loop is bound to play functional roles, as it is always located at the HK:RR interface in available structures. Mutagenesis studies with functional readouts including HK-mediated activities are needed, together with a larger number of 3D structures of HK:RR complexes from different TCS families, in order to delimit universal TCS mechanisms and system-dependent variations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Associative vs dissociative phosphotransfer: evolution of signaling directionality</title><p>Regulating the direction of information flow is central to signaling performance. The energies of P-N and P-O bonds engaged in phosphoryl-transfer reactions among histidine and aspartate, appear to be equivalent, explaining a few known reversible systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burbulys et al., 1991</xref>). However, and except for such systems where P~Asp→His phosphorylation has been selected (such as in phosphorelays), phosphoryl back-transfer (P~RR→HK) is typically minimized. Alternative sources of reactional asymmetry, other than bonding energetics, must be at play. Taking into account that phosphotransfer is a nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus, the reaction coordinate distance (i.e. between phosphorus and the entering atom, before the transfer reaction has begun) strongly suggests that P~DesK→DesR phosphotransfer occurs through a largely dissociative, or ‘loose’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lassila et al., 2011</xref>): a reaction coordinate distance of ≥4.9 Å provides room for a fully dissociated metaphosphate intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mildvan, 1997</xref>). This distance is directly correlated with the one separating side chain N and O atoms, respectively on the reactive His and Asp residues. Considering van der Waals radii, full dissociation of the phosphate intermediate is predicted for N-O distances of ≥6.6 Å. This threshold distance classifying phosphotransfer reactions into loose <italic>vs</italic> tight nucleophilic substitutions, nicely discriminates signaling complexes involved in, respectively, phosphorylations from the histidine imidazole group, or towards it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>). The His-Asp distance thus correlates with associative <italic>vs</italic> dissociative phosphotransfer, but also with the symmetry of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation with respect to the entering and leaving atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Increased back-transfer has been observed when the cation is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albanesi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukat et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 1999</xref>), further supporting that Mg<sup>2+</sup> asymmetry favors irreversible P~His→Asp transfer reactions. Furthermore, mutations that likely increase the distance between TCS partners, without impeding their association, have been reported to affect differentially the forward- and back-transfer directions in otherwise reversible phosphoryl-transfer steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janiak-Spens et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The DesK:DesR structures disclose the catalytic centers for TCS-mediated dephosphorylation and phosphotransfer reactions, built with contributing residues from both partners. Moreover, the HK serves as the driving component to modulate the construction of a given active site, selecting a conformation of the RR that is prone for transfer reactions on its catalytic aspartate. Except for the phosphate lid, the REC domain bound to the HK largely resembles the RR’s active form, shifting the position of the β1α1 loop and helix α1, now able to recruit the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation essential for phosphoryl-transfer catalysis. The phosphatase/phosphotransferase transition, switches the distance and orientation of the HK histidine side chain with respect to the RR aspartate, enabling for the distinct reaction mechanisms to take place, and ultimately ensuring the unidirectional flow of information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>For protein crystallization purposes, recombinant protein expression plasmid pACYC-DesKC<sub>STAB</sub>:DesR-REC was generated by sub-cloning DesKC<sub>STAB</sub> from pHPKS/Pxyl-desKSTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saita et al., 2015</xref>) into pACYC-DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</xref>) using RF cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Unger et al., 2010</xref>) with primers STAB_F (5’-CCTGTATTTTCAGGGATCC GGTATTATAAAACTTCGCAAG-3’) and STAB_R (5’-GTCAGACACTGTAATCACAACTTCCTTCCAG-3’).

A similar trend in equivalent 3D positions for covariant residue pairs among different HK and RR families was thus confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Podgornaia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weigt et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In silico modeling and molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The phosphotransferase complex was built by replacing the DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> dimer of 5IUK with <italic>wt</italic> P~DesKC (PDB 5IUM). This replacement resulted in model with barely no clashes, except for P~His<sub>188(HK)</sub> slightly bumping into Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> and Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub>. Energy minimization was then performed on such constructed complex with all-atom constraints in Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das and Baker, 2008</xref>), strongly restraining shifts to maintain the experimental coordinates. A final <italic>wt</italic> P~DesKC:DesR-REC model was thus obtained, with optimal stereochemical geometry and no clashes (0.09 rmsd between the energy minimized model and the pdb 5IUM experimental structure, aligning all 1930 DesK atoms). To further evaluate the minimized <italic>wt</italic> P~DesKC:DesR-REC model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), molecular dynamics simulations were performed, observing that its conformation is stable throughout the trajectory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), especially considering the positions of His<sub>188(HK)</sub>, Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> and Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> in contact with the phosphate.</p><p>For molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, the missing ATP lid loop within the CA domain in chain A (residues 328 to 335) were reconstructed by using a previously reported high resolution structure (PDB 3EHG) as template. The other CA domain (in chain B, residues 241–367) was deleted. The missing N-terminal portion of chain B helix α1, was reconstructed and extended up to residue Lys<sub>155(HK)</sub> using 5IUK as a template.</p><p>For computational efficiency only DesK residues Lys<sub>155(HK)</sub> to Asn<sub>368(HK)</sub> in chain A and Lys<sub>155(HK)</sub> to Ser<sub>239(HK)</sub> in chain B were considered. Only His<sub>188(HK)</sub> in chain B was set to be phosphorylated. His<sub>335(HK)</sub> was protonated at position Nδ1, while other histidines were protonated at Nε2, to preserve the interaction network. The ATP moiety and Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation present within the CA domain were both kept in the model. The structure of DesR-REC spanned residues Ser<sub>0(RR)</sub> to Leu<sub>131(RR)</sub>. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation in the active site of DesR-REC and the three crystallographic water molecules of the metal’s coordination sphere, were included in the model.</p><p>Acetyl and N-methylamide capping groups were added to N- and C- terminal residues, which did not correspond to the real terminals in the full protein sequences. The protein complex was solvated within an octahedral box of 15 Å from the solute, and sodium counterions were added to preserve the electroneutrality of the system. The AMBER force field ff14SB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maier et al., 2015</xref>) was used to represent the amino acids. The parameters for His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphorylated at NE2 with an unprotonated phosphate group were taken from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homeyer et al., 2006</xref>). The ATP molecule was described with reported parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meagher et al., 2003</xref>). The TIP3P model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) was used for water molecules. Monovalent ions were treated with previously described parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joung and Cheatham, 2008</xref>), while Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were modeled using the compromise set of parameters for the 12–6 non-bonded potential in TIP3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All calculations were performed with the GPU version of AMBER14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salomon‐Ferrer et al., 2013</xref>). Initially, the whole system was relaxed by energy minimization, then it was equilibrated for 0.2 ns in the NVT ensemble imposing harmonic positional restrains of 10 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> on the protein atoms. A reference temperature of 300 K was set by coupling the system to the Langevin thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastor et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu and Brooks, 2003</xref>) with a friction constant of 50 ps<sup>−1</sup>, which approximates the physical collision frequency for liquid water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Izaguirre et al., 2001</xref>). A 10 Å cut-off was used for non-bonded interactions, while long-range electrostatics were evaluated using Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>).

Production simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble. The pressure was kept at 1 atm by means of the Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>). Snapshots were recorded every 5 ps for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Autodephosphorylation and phosphotransfer assays</title><p>To purify the phosphorylated species of DesR-REC and DesR-REC<sub>F82A</sub>, 600 μM of both recombinant proteins were auto-phosphorylated using 50 mM acetyl phosphate in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris.HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl and 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, at room temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Laub, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Bourret (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Two-component regulatory systems, comprised of histidine kinases and response regulators, are a widespread means of signal transduction in bacteria, and are also found in archaea, eukaryotic microorganisms, and plants. Many, if not most, histidine kinases are bifunctional, capable of transferring phosphoryl groups to their cognate response regulator and stimulating their dephosphorylation. There are many unanswered questions about the mechanisms of the phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions, in part because of the paucity of high-resolution structures of HK•RR complexes. The manuscript by Tratjenberg et al. reports multiple DesK•DesR structures and the reviewers all agreed that it will likely be regarded as a landmark study. In general, the manuscript is well written and illustrated, providing important new insights into (i) the mechanism for switching the HK between phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions, (ii) a novel conformation of the RR when complexed with the HK, (iii) key roles of variable RR residues in the reactions, (iv) a dissociative phosphotransfer reaction mechanism, and (v) the apparent lack of participation of the conserved His on the HK in the phosphatase reaction.</p><p>There were, however, some concerns about how the data were presented and, in some cases, interpreted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Results section begins with two key conclusions, that &quot;Two crystal structures of the DesKC:DesR complex represent snapshots of the dephosphorylation and the phosphotransfer reactions&quot;. The authors eventually make a reasonable case that the structures are what they are interpreted to be. However, the text first asserts that the structures represent the two reactions and then discusses some properties of each structure before explaining why the authors believe the structures represent the two reactions. It would be much more convincing to the reader to first provide the reasons why the authors believe their structures represent the phosphotransfer and dephosphorylation reactions and then describe the structures.</p><p>2) The authors gloss over some underlying weakness in their claims about what the structures represent. For example, the authors claim that DesKCSTAB is a phosphatase-constitutive mutant. This is true in the sense that the phosphatase activity of DesKCSTAB is (i) not regulated by temperature and (ii) comparable to the high temperature value exhibited by wild type DesKC. However, the actual phosphatase activity reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Saita et al. 2015 is quite weak. When mixed with DesR-P in equimolar amounts, DesKCSTAB was able to dephosphorylate only half of the DesR-P, and did so at twice the initial rate of wild type DesKC. In other words, there is no evidence that one DesKCSTAB can act as an enzyme to dephosphorylate more than one DesR-P molecule.</p><p>3a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the text in subsection “A single response regulator conformation is selected by the two functional states of the kinase” compare &quot;inactive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; structures of DesR REC with the conformation of DesR REC observed in complexes. It is worth noting that the structure used to represent the inactive state (4LE1) lacks not only a phosphoryl group analogue, but also the divalent metal ion necessary for phosphoryl group chemistry. There are some differences in structures of receiver domains with or without metal ion bound, so the lack of a metal ion probably exaggerates the differences between the &quot;inactive&quot; state and the conformation observed in the complexes. It is perfectly appropriate to use 4LE1 when a metal bound structure is not available; however, it would be better to clearly alert the reader to the lack of metal ion.</p><p>3b) In the structure showed for the phosphotransferase and phosphatase reactions, the RR configuration is similar, corresponding in both cases to a partially activated (phosphorylated) conformation. However, in the phosphotransferase reaction the apo-RR should be recognized by P-HK, while the P-RR is recognized in the phosphatase reaction by the apo-HK. As is well know and the authors mentioned, the apo-RR and P-RR conformations are different. Therefore, the authors should analyze and discuss how are these conformations selectively recognized by the complementary HK conformation (structural determinants).</p><p>4) The authors missed some opportunities for more effective communication of key results. In particular, the mechanism of phosphatase activity by HK remains unresolved and whether or not the conserved His residue participates in the reaction is controversial. For example, a recent prominent review article [Bhate, Structure 23, 981 (2015)] states that although the His is not always required, &quot;in cases where the catalytic histidine is required, it likely acts as a base to assist the attack of water or hydroxide on the phosphoryl-aspartyl group&quot;. The findings reported in this manuscript place the His far from the attacking water.</p><p>5) Similarly, for readers interested in mechanistic details, it would be helpful to include illustrations of the proposed active sites for the phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions showing just the relevant side chains and small molecules, and indicating distances and geometries, without the clutter of backbone ribbons.</p><p>6) There is great merit in providing a proposed mechanism such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, which provides specific features that can be tested. I have two comments about the illustration and accompanying text:a) In subsection “A HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway” the authors say that a hydrogen bond is formed between His188 and Asp189. Is this modeled in the reported structures or just speculation? The reference cited (Quezada et al. 2005) actually demonstrated hydrogen bonding between the conserved His and a Glu that is 22 residues to the C-terminal side, not 1 residue C-terminal as in DesK. It might be worth citing Willett &amp; Kirby, PLOS Genetics 8, e1-003984 (2012), which provides evidence in multiple HKs that the acidic residue at variable position H<sup>+</sup>1 is critical for autophosphorylation, but not for phosphatase activity.b) The proposed dissociative phosphotransfer mechanism involves a key interaction between the conserved Ser/Thr residue of the RR and the phosphoryl group that has been released from the HK, before attack by the RR Asp. One prediction of this mechanism might be that phosphotransfer from HK to RR would be severely affected in the absence of the conserved Ser/Thr residue. I am aware of only one potentially relevant piece of data in the literature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of Appleby &amp; Bourret, J Bacteriol 180, 3563 (1998) shows that phosphotransfer occurs from CheA to a CheY mutant in which the conserved Thr is repaced by an Ala. Obvious caveats are that CheAs are different than other HKs, and that the experiment was not particularly sensitive to changes in phosphotransfer rate (i.e. the rate of phosphotransfer could have been dramatically slower but still observed).</p><p>7) The apparently important role played in the reactions by variable RR residues is very interesting. For example, subsection “The phosphatase to phosphotransferase transition: reconfiguring the reaction center for catalysis” notes apparent hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group and Thr81 of DesK. One wonders what happens in the ~80% of RRs for which the residue corresponding to Thr81 is not a Ser or Thr. Similarly, in this section and elsewhere, the role of Phe82 in forming the phosphate lid is noted. One wonders what happens in the 2/3 of response regulators that do not contain an aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, His) at the position corresponding to Phe82. These are rich topics for future investigation. It might be worth noting someplace in the manuscript that the reported structures suggest important roles for variable residues, which by definition vary between systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21422.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Results section begins with two key conclusions, that &quot;Two crystal structures of the DesKC:DesR complex represent snapshots of the dephosphorylation and the phosphotransfer reactions&quot;. The authors eventually make a reasonable case that the structures are what they are interpreted to be. However, the text first asserts that the structures represent the two reactions and then discusses some properties of each structure before explaining why the authors believe the structures represent the two reactions. It would be much more convincing to the reader to first provide the reasons why the authors believe their structures represent the phosphotransfer and dephosphorylation reactions and then describe the structures.</italic> </p><p>We are pleased to learn that the reviewers agree with our interpretation about the structures’ biochemical meaning. We’re sorry for not being clear enough in the way the subsection was written. We have now rephrased it according to your suggestions.</p><p>Before summarizing the revisions we have introduced, we feel it is probably helpful to argue about the logic behind our original version.</p><p>i) The two key conclusions that started the section, as the editors point out, were in fact the very title of the subsection itself. So, it was our deliberate intention to summarize the main conclusions there, in an attempt to quickly help the reader grasping the important messages. Otherwise, the risk is to lose the reader’s attention along the arduous, although essential, structural descriptions.</p><p>ii) Those descriptions, based on crystallographic as well as also in solution biophysics data, were elaborated in such a way as to build the several pieces of evidence, ultimately supporting our functional interpretation for each structure. In other words, it seems like a challenging exercise to first convince the reader of our interpretation of the data, before actually introducing the data themselves.</p><p>In any case we have tried to meet this challenge in this revised version, so that the subsection reads more clearly. We have substantially rephrased the entire subsection. We prefer keeping the same title though for the reasons described above. After the title, we now continue by first stating the proposed hypotheses (about each structure’s functional meaning), to then more clearly unfold, in a sequential manner, the pieces of evidence that support our claims. We also take advantage, within this subsection, to further elaborate the arguments supporting the interpretation of the DesKC<sub>STAB</sub>:DesR-REC complex as a snapshot of the phosphatase reaction. This is described in the following point #2.</p><p><italic>2) The authors gloss over some underlying weakness in their claims about what the structures represent. For example, the authors claim that DesKCSTAB is a phosphatase-constitutive mutant. This is true in the sense that the phosphatase activity of DesKCSTAB is (i) not regulated by temperature and (ii) comparable to the high temperature value exhibited by wild type DesKC. However, the actual phosphatase activity reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Saita et al. 2015 is quite weak. When mixed with DesR-P in equimolar amounts, DesKCSTAB was able to dephosphorylate only half of the DesR-P, and did so at twice the initial rate of wild type DesKC. In other words, there is no evidence that one DesKCSTAB can act as an enzyme to dephosphorylate more than one DesR-P molecule.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this may be a very important analysis to interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Saita et al., 2015 more fully, and for that matter, to extend our understanding of the HK-mediated P~RR dephosphorylation reaction.</p><p>But, within the scope of this manuscript, that DesKC<sub>STAB</sub> works in comparable ways to <italic>wt</italic>DesKC, as if it were trapped in the <italic>wt</italic> phosphatase-competent state, is absolutely relevant. And we understand that this comparison indeed allows for the point to be made, as the reviewers point out in the first part of their statement. Strengthening this argument even further, it seems pertinent to analyze the data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> in that article (besides <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which only concerns P~RR dephosphorylation), also revealing that DesK<sub>STAB</sub> is not able to turn on the signaling pathway in vivo, nor to auto-phosphorylate in vitro, in the low-temperature regime; again, indistinguishable from <italic>wt</italic>DesK in its phosphatase state.</p><p>Furthermore, the DesK<sub>DEST</sub> mutant, which comprises amino acid substitutions in the same coiled-coil region as DesK<sub>STAB</sub>, but seeking for an opposite, coiled-coil-destabilizing effect, indeed results in an in vivoopposite effect, displaying a gain-of-function, constitutive ‘on’ state of the signaling pathway, irrespective of the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of Saita et al., 2015). This is also relevant, because it validates the important assumption that mutations introduced at the chosen coiled-coil region, far from the reactional active site, do not interfere with the reaction itself (in contrast to previous mutated DesKC versions trapping the phosphatase state, such as DesKC<sub>His188Val</sub>, where the very phosphorylatable histidine was substituted, admitting doubts about its potential effect on the reaction). Saita et al. 2015 from a functional perspective, and now this report with high resolution structural data, actually confirm that DesKC<sub>His188Val</sub> was a pertinent mutant to trap a constitutive phosphatase-competent form of the HK.</p><p>DesKC<sub>His188Val</sub> was originally shown to maintain P~DesR phosphatase activity both in vivoand in vitro(Albanesi et al. 2004), and its structure as a free protein (i.e. not in complex with DesR), was solved in two different crystal forms (PDBs 3EHH and 3EHJ) (Albanesi et al., 2009). Those two structures are identical to the level of precision of the data, and we now observe that they both match the kinase’s conformation of the DesK<sub>STAB</sub>:DesR-REC complex that we are now reporting. This is yet a further strong argument consistent with the interpretation of DesK<sub>STAB</sub>:DesR-REC representing the pre-dephosphorylation ground-state of the phosphatase reaction.</p><p>To highlight all these arguments, we have now further elaborated the paragraph according to previous comment #1; adding the quantitative comparison of the kinase partner from the free DesKC<sub>His188Val</sub> crystal forms superposed onto the phosphatase complex we are now reporting; and included an additional panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (new panel E) with these superpositions.</p><p><italic>3a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the text in subsection “A single response regulator conformation is selected by the two functional states of the kinase” compare &quot;inactive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; structures of DesR REC with the conformation of DesR REC observed in complexes. It is worth noting that the structure used to represent the inactive state (4LE1) lacks not only a phosphoryl group analogue, but also the divalent metal ion necessary for phosphoryl group chemistry. There are some differences in structures of receiver domains with or without metal ion bound, so the lack of a metal ion probably exaggerates the differences between the &quot;inactive&quot; state and the conformation observed in the complexes. It is perfectly appropriate to use 4LE1 when a metal bound structure is not available; however, it would be better to clearly alert the reader to the lack of metal ion.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the fact that 4LE1 (our “inactive” RR form to compare with) has no metal bound in the active site, both in the main text as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>’s legend.</p><p>Although beyond the scope of this manuscript, and also for the sake of limiting its length to reasonable extents, we wish to follow up on this interesting observation in the context of this exchange with the reviewers.</p><p>We believe that inactive metal-free forms should not be excluded as relevant species in vivo. Relatively scarce data are available as to the actual Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinities of different RR REC domains (even less comparing phosphorylated vs non-phosphorylated).</p><p>One of the best studied examples in this respect, is that of CheY. This monodomain RR is claimed to be significantly metallated, even in the unphosphorylated form (so that the physiologically relevant “inactive” form of CheY would be “Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound unphosphorylated” CheY). Such a claim is supported mostly on two pieces of evidence: i-in vitromeasurements of CheY’s Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity at neutral pH (Lukat el al 1990), which falls approximately within the same order of magnitude, sub-mM/low mM range, as that of free intra-cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in enterobacteria (Froschauer et al. 2004 FEMS Microbiol Lett 237:49; Alattosava et al. 1985 J Bac 162:413), and ii- “direct” estimations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound CheY by <italic>in cell</italic> NMR methods (Hubbard et al. 2003 Mol Microbiol 49:1191), revealing signal peaks more similar to metallated than to non-metallated CheY species. However, it must be stressed, as the authors recognize in that Hubbard et al. paper, that these <italic>in cell</italic> NMR measurements were performed using cells that had overexpressed CheY to reach NMR-detection limits (~5 times higher concentrations of CheY than normal), which given a constant metal-binding affinity, and a tightly regulated intra-cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, is expected to result in a ~5-fold overestimation of the complexed form (not to account for the undetermined proportion of phosphorylated vs unphosphorylated CheY variants under such overexpression regimes). Taking all this evidence together, it doesn’t really seem sensible at this time to rule out the possibility of having significant amounts of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free CheY in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, mostly so when cells have low free metal concentrations (1mM or lower).</p><p>A scenario where the majority of inactive RR population is expected to be metal-free, is even more likely for other RRs displaying even lower Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity constants, as high as ~50mM K<sub>D</sub> (Guillet et al. 2002 JBC 277:42003; Bourret 2010 Curr Opin Microbiol 13:142). We have not measured the metal-binding constants for DesR REC. But, in any case, it seems to be important to use metal-free structures of RRs as inactive models whenever possible, in as much as metal-bound ones.</p><p>Our data support the hypothesis whereby the cognate kinase stabilizes (selects) a conformation of the REC domain, which is closer to the fully active form even when not yet phosphorylated nor metallated (as we had previously hypothesized only on the basis of in vivofunctional data and <italic>in silico</italic> modeling of the molecular details, Trajtenberg et al., 2014; now we can at last see the molecules). The series of incubations with increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (in the presence or absence of added BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) that we now report using the phosphotransferase complex crystals, allowed us to solve three independent crystal structures, that show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> binds into DesR’s active site only at higher soaked metal concentrations, with BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> never being detectable: this is, we believe, a first evidence that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is recruited with lower affinity due to kinase-binding mediated “preactivation”, reaching full metal occupancy in concert with actual phosphoryltransfer (implying that phosphorylation increases Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity, and vice-versa).</p><p><italic>3b) In the structure showed for the phosphotransferase and phosphatase reactions, the RR configuration is similar, corresponding in both cases to a partially activated (phosphorylated) conformation. However, in the phosphotransferase reaction the apo-RR should be recognized by P-HK, while the P-RR is recognized in the phosphatase reaction by the apo-HK. As is well know and the authors mentioned, the apo-RR and P-RR conformations are different. Therefore, the authors should analyze and discuss how are these conformations selectively recognized by the complementary HK conformation (structural determinants).</italic> </p><p>We greatly appreciate this comment, prompting us to include a new subsection within the Discussion.</p><p>In order to limit the extension of the main text, we wish to further exchange some ideas and data within this direct discussion with the reviewers. Hopefully you will find the most important points properly summarized within the Discussion subsection that we have added in the manuscript.</p><p>Our data indeed indicate that HKs are largely unable to discriminate binding to RR or P~RR, on the sole basis of structural determinants that would stand out from comparing the two complexes.</p><p>Technical difficulties in measuring HK:RR binding affinities for specific functional states (i.e. the HK in its phosphatase state with RR <italic>vs</italic> P~RR, compared to the phosphotransfer-competent HK with P~RR <italic>vs</italic> RR), have likely hampered in-depth analyses of this important issue for many HK:RR systems. Working with <italic>wt</italic> proteins most often implies simultaneous phosphoryl-transfer and dephosphorylation, confusing clear-cut interpretations. With these caveats considered, only a few HK:RR interactions have been thoroughly characterized, which actually lend further support to our hypothesis. EnvZ binds OmpR and P~OmpR with equivalent affinities (Yoshida et al. 2002). The same holds for PhoQ binding PhoP or P~PhoP (Castelli et al., 2003). CheA has slightly lower affinity (but within the same order of magnitude) for P~CheY than for CheY (Schuster et al., 1993Nature 365:343; Li et al. 1995 Biochemistry 34:14626). And, this 2- to 3-fold difference cannot be immediately interpreted in terms of potential CheA:CheY interface differences, to be directly compared to our data. Most importantly because, besides CheA’s P1 domain (containing the phosphorylatable His, hence certainly contacting CheY), CheA bears an additional P2 domain, which is a CheY-binding element not present in most HKs including DesK. Given that CheA-P2 binds to a surface on CheY [Welch et al. 1998 Nat Struct Biol 5:25] that is known to change according to CheY’s phosphorylation state (the α4β5α5 surface, which is the same surface that later binds FliM during downstream output response), it would not be surprising that CheA:CheY <italic>vs</italic> CheA:P~CheYbinding affinities change driven by CheA-P2:CheY binding modulation. Added to this, we still don’t know whether P~CheA binds to CheY with a significantly different affinity as apo-CheA does (our data predict those association constants to be similar, further studies needed to prove it).</p><p>DesK:DesR constitutes a particularly nice model in this respect, due to our ability to trap functional states using specific point mutations, ultimately facilitating the interpretation of HK:RR binding phenomena.</p><p>As we now discuss within the manuscript, the reported crystallographic and calorimetric evidence are very much consistent, both supporting the notion that no structural determinants are relevant for the HK to choose between the apo and phosphorylated forms of its RR partner at the molecular level.</p><p>A legitimate question can immediately be asked: if there are no structure-based discriminants, how does the system work in the cell, avoiding seemingly futile associations?</p><p>More data needs to be generated in order to unveil such in vivomechanisms at the cell level, beyond the scope of this paper. We are tempted to speculate that when the signaling pathway turns the HK off, at first large amounts of P~RR are present, such that the HK in its phosphatase state catalyzes P~RR dephosphorylation. At some point though, enough amount of apo-RR builds, competing with P~RR for HK binding. This could result in a biphasic HK-mediated P~RR dephosphorylation slope (an example of product inhibition), and the RR’s autodephosphorylation capacity could become increasingly relevant (as well as additional dedicated phosphatases such as CheZ, RapH, etc, if present). Such biphasic behavior might be a better interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Saita et al., 2015 Mol Microbiol 98:258 (already mentioned above in response to comment #2). A further derivation of this is that fairly stable complexes of HK:RR (with neither partner phosphorylated) cannot be excluded, perhaps playing biologically relevant roles. The low nanomolar affinity (~30nM) measured for CheA:CheY supports this notion (Schuster et al., 1993Nature 365:343), as the authors explicitly mention.</p><p>In turn, when the HK is activated, its own autophosphorylation dominates at high ATP concentrations, with intramolecular CA domains outcompeting RR binding (P~RR concentrations expected to be low). P~HK will most likely interact only with apo-RR, due to the strong electrostatic repulsion force that would result of placing two phosphoryl groups close in space.</p><p>Finally, we should also emphasize that for a correct activation and inactivation of the pathway, other important parameters must be considered, such as: 1- intracellular TCS protein concentrations and relative abundance, both of which might change with time; 2- potential subcellular localization (spatial segregation of HK and/or RR), which could also change with time in a signal-dependent manner; 3- RR dimerization/oligomerization, which could affect HK-binding in different ways according to variant quaternary structure organizations; 4- presence of dedicated P~RR phosphatases; 5- RR autophosphorylation with intracellular small phosphodonors; and probably many others. All of these parameters can easily be linked to the detailed time-course of appearance and disappearance of HK and RR phosphorylated species in the cell, independent of any structural determinants within the HK and RR molecules themselves.</p><p><italic>4) The authors missed some opportunities for more effective communication of key results. In particular, the mechanism of phosphatase activity by HK remains unresolved and whether or not the conserved His residue participates in the reaction is controversial. For example, a recent prominent review article [Bhate, Structure 23, 981 (2015)] states that although the His is not always required, &quot;in cases where the catalytic histidine is required, it likely acts as a base to assist the attack of water or hydroxide on the phosphoryl-aspartyl group&quot;. The findings reported in this manuscript place the His far from the attacking water.</italic> </p><p>We take the point and thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We have further elaborated our findings concerning the phosphatase complex, in the Results subsection entitled “The phosphatase to phosphotransferase transition: reconfiguring the reaction center for catalysis”. In particular, we embed our interpretations within the context of reports concerning phosphatase mechanisms postulated for HisKA and HisKA_3 HKs.</p><p>Bhate et al., 2015 indeed refer to HKs that use the reactive His during the P~RR dephosphorylation reaction. We have now added this reference, we agree it represents one of the most recent reviews in the field and a very helpful one. However, for the specific matter being discussed, this review doesn’t really refer to any original papers showing experimental evidence in favor of such catalytic role of the His in the phosphatase reaction. There is of course the early paper coming from Inouye’s team, claiming such a role (Zhu et al., 2000; now also referenced), although it should be stressed that it is contradictory to previous reports studying the same his kinase, EnvZ (e.g. Skarphol et al., 1997; or yet Hsing &amp; Silhavy 1997): perhaps the fact of using separate DHp and CA domains in the PNAS article might have led to equivocal readouts.</p><p>In contrast, several articles present converging evidence in support of a different residue playing a key role in mediating dephosphorylation: typically an amide side chain, one helical turn away of the phosphorylatable His, which has been proposed to position/assist a catalytic water to perform the nucleophilic attack onto the leaving phosphoryl group. We have thus also referred now to a few reports (Huynh et al., 2010; Willett &amp; Kirby, 2012; Skarphol et al., 1997) that show nonessentiality of the His, and instead a key role for the amide one helical turn C-terminal to it. As also shown in the phosphatase CheX complexed to CheY3 (Pazy et al., 2010), and further consistent with the CheZ:CheY (Zhao et al., 2002) and the RapH-Spo0F (Parashar et al., 2011) complex structures.</p><p>As we now describe more extensively, the phosphatase structure we now report is clearly favoring the latter hypothesis. In DesK it is Gln193, 5 residues C-terminal to the reactive His, poised to performing the water-assisting role. DesKQ193 is homologous to Gln404 in NarX, extensively studied by V Stewart and collaborators in the 2010 PNAS paper mentioned above, shown to be essential for phosphatase activity. Particularly illustrative is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in that article, to pinpoint equivalent amide-containing amino acids at that position in different HK families and dedicated phosphatases: the HDxxxQ motif of HisKA_3 HKs such as NarX and DesK (where H is the phosphorylatable His, and Q is the phosphatase-essential Gln), corresponds to a H[E/D]xx[T/N] in HisKA HKs (note one residue less in between the His and the amide; and the only case where a number of members display a Thr, instead of an amide side chain), or yet to motifs DxxxQ and ExxN in phosphatases like CheZ and CheX, with the amide-containing residue occupying equivalent structural positions when superposed onto the HKs.</p><p><italic>5) Similarly, for readers interested in mechanistic details, it would be helpful to include illustrations of the proposed active sites for the phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions showing just the relevant side chains and small molecules, and indicating distances and geometries, without the clutter of backbone ribbons.</italic> </p><p>We have now added these two panels as an additional figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) There is great merit in providing a proposed mechanism such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, which provides specific features that can be tested. I have two comments about the illustration and accompanying text:a) In subsection “A HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway” the authors say that a hydrogen bond is formed between His188 and Asp189. Is this modeled in the reported structures or just speculation? The reference cited (Quezada et al. 2005) actually demonstrated hydrogen bonding between the conserved His and a Glu that is 22 residues to the C-terminal side, not 1 residue C-terminal as in DesK. It might be worth citing Willett &amp; Kirby, PLOS Genetics 8, e1-003984 (2012), which provides evidence in multiple HKs that the acidic residue at variable position H<sup>+</sup>1 is critical for autophosphorylation, but not for phosphatase activity.</italic> </p><p>This hydrogen bond is expected to be present during autophosphorylation, hence not present in our reported structures. Both Casino et al. 2014, and Mechaly et al. 2014 papers, reporting autophosphorylating HKs, do observe this H-bond. The Quezada et al. 2005 article is referenced there, because even when the carboxylate group in that case (CheA) is indeed coming from a completely different place (compared to the more canonical DHp-containing HKs), it is a very nice paper where direct NMR spectroscopy data reveal how that carboxylate H-bond stabilizes the reactive protonation tautomer of the reactive His during autophosphorylation.</p><p>We regret the initial phrasing was not clear enough. We have now rephrased that fragment, hoping it is now clearer. We also agree that adding the Willett &amp; Kirby, 2012 reference is useful to further support the critical function of a carboxylate-containing side chain at position His+1 for autophosphorylation.</p><p><italic>b) The proposed dissociative phosphotransfer mechanism involves a key interaction between the conserved Ser/Thr residue of the RR and the phosphoryl group that has been released from the HK, before attack by the RR Asp. One prediction of this mechanism might be that phosphotransfer from HK to RR would be severely affected in the absence of the conserved Ser/Thr residue. I am aware of only one potentially relevant piece of data in the literature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of Appleby &amp; Bourret, J Bacteriol 180, 3563 (1998) shows that phosphotransfer occurs from CheA to a CheY mutant in which the conserved Thr is repaced by an Ala. Obvious caveats are that CheAs are different than other HKs, and that the experiment was not particularly sensitive to changes in phosphotransfer rate (i.e. the rate of phosphotransfer could have been dramatically slower but still observed).</italic> </p><p>Indeed, our model predicts that Thr80 might play a key role in HK-mediated phosphotransfer, and probably increasingly so according to the degree of dissociative character of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. We have now included a few words to make this point clearer for the readers. In the Discussion subsection “HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway.”, when explaining the conceptual model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we have now made this explicit, awaiting for direct and conclusive proof.</p><p>In favor of a key role of this Thr in the reactions that RRs undertake, it is an extremely well conserved residue at that position (at times replaced by a Ser, prone to play a similar role). But, we are aware of the paper you are citing (Appleby and Bourret, 1998), even taking into account the caveats associated to CheA’s singularities, is strongly suggesting that Thr80 (T87 in CheY) is not playing a catalytic role.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, very few papers actually interrogate the phosphoryl transfer activity substituting this ultra-conserved amino acid, in order to have a more solid background about its role. There is Ganguli et al., 1995, which had previously studied also CheY. And beyond CheA:CheY, Gautam et al. 2011 report data on DevR (<italic>aka</italic> DosR) from <italic>M. Tuberculosis</italic>, where they substitute the equivalent Thr82. Although both Ganguli and Gautam articles detect HK-mediated phosphotransfer activity in vitro, using a Thr-to-Ala substituted RR, they do report a significant decrease in such transfers. All these papers, including Appleby &amp; Bourret, observe substantial perturbations and even disruption of in vivosignaling when this Thr is substituted (and, consistently, Thr-to-Ser giving milder or undetectable deleterious effects). Taking those pieces of evidence together, it seems that this Thr is not a catalytic residue <italic>sensu strictu</italic> (i.e. one that directly participates in the chemistry within the reaction center, such that its substitution results in a drop of reaction velocity of several orders of magnitude, in practical terms usually to undetectable limits for in vitroenzymatic assays), but one that plays a major role in the reaction, detectable in vitro, and to the point of precluding normal biological function.</p><p>There are a number of positions that, derived from the analysis of the DesKC:DesR-REC structures, seem extremely interesting to further analyze in-depth, among others Thr80 in the RR, and also key positions in the HK component. The functional and structural consequences of such critical residue substitutions will be published in a separate paper. At this point, taking now into account the crystallographic evidence that we are reporting, it is tempting to speculate that Thr80 might play an increasingly essential role in phosphoryl-transfer, correlated to the increasing degree of dissociative character of such reaction for a given TCS pair.</p><p>In sum, the receiver Asp residue plays the catalytic role in all cases, performing the nucleophilic attack on the migrating phosphorus atom. If the His(HK)-to-Asp(RR) distance is short, the transfer is largely associative, and Thr80 might play less essential roles e.g. in further stabilizing ground states (e.g. modulating P~Asp stability). But, for TCS complexes where that His(HK)-to-Asp(RR) distance is large, such as in DesK:DesR and others, nucleophilic substitution chemistry predicts a non-negligible amount of free metaphosphate intermediate for the reaction to occur, and it is in this case where the conserved Thr is expected to play a more essential role (again, maybe not catalytic <italic>sensu strictu</italic>, but without which the velocity could be reduced substantially because of insufficient intermediate state stabilization – the limit of catalytic vs non catalytic becoming of course increasingly ambiguous).</p><p><italic>7) The apparently important role played in the reactions by variable RR residues is very interesting. For example, subsection “The phosphatase to phosphotransferase transition: reconfiguring the reaction center for catalysis” notes apparent hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group and Thr81 of DesK. One wonders what happens in the ~80% of RRs for which the residue corresponding to Thr81 is not a Ser or Thr. Similarly, in this section and elsewhere, the role of Phe82 in forming the phosphate lid is noted. One wonders what happens in the 2/3 of response regulators that do not contain an aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, His) at the position corresponding to Phe82. These are rich topics for future investigation. It might be worth noting someplace in the manuscript that the reported structures suggest important roles for variable residues, which by definition vary between systems.</italic> </p><p>This is certainly an interesting point, we have added a paragraph towards the end of the Discussion subsection “HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway”, highlighting the importance of some of these variable residues. Several of them had already been pinpointed by studying standalone RR catalytic activities (auto-phosphorylation and auto-dephosphoryation), mainly in CheY, but more recently also in RRs belonging to other families. We have thus added a few key references.</p><p>As mentioned now in the revised version of the text, we believe that the evolution of the HK:RR interface adds a new dimension in terms of selective pressure constraints, acting on several of these highly variable positions. Future studies focusing on HK-mediated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of RRs with substitutions on these positions, might reveal covariation constraints (epistasis again, but now between both protein partners), perhaps further explaining population distributions among RR families like the one summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> of Page et al., 2016.</p></body></sub-article></article>
