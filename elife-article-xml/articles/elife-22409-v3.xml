The efficacy of statins in improving motor symptoms and prolonging survival of mutant mice suggested a potential role of statins in the therapy of Rett syndrome. In the present study, we show that <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion had no effect on brain and reduced serum cholesterol levels and lovastatin (1.5 mg/kg, twice weekly as in the previous study) had no effects on motor deficits and survival when <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion was expressed on a background strain (C57BL/6J; B6) differing from that used in the earlier study. These findings indicate that the effects of statins may be background specific and raise important issues to consider when contemplating clinical trials. The reduction of the brain cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) found in B6.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice suggests the occurrence of changes in brain cholesterol metabolism and the potential utility of using plasma levels of 24S-OHC as a biomarker of brain cholesterol homeostasis in RTT.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22409.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22409.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>lovastatin</kwd><kwd>24S-hydroxycholesterol</kwd><kwd>genetic background</kwd><kwd>cholesterol metabolism</kwd><kwd>Mecp2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Invernizzi</surname><given-names>Roberto William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lovastatin ability to rescue motor deficits and survival in a mouse model of Rett syndrome is strongly influenced by the genetic background.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rett syndrome (RTT), is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations of the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein2 (<italic>MECP2</italic>), in more than 95% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>).

Increased cholesterol plasma levels and changes in the activity/expression of genes and proteins involved in the cellular uptake, synthesis and feedback regulation of circulating cholesterol have recently been found in RTT individuals carrying <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Justice et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Segatto et al., 2014</xref>), However, only one-third of RTT patients show elevated levels of plasma cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Justice et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cholesterol homeostasis is important for central nervous system function and defects in cholesterol synthesis may cause neurologic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waterham, 2006</xref>). Thus, altered cholesterol homeostasis may have a role in the pathogenesis of RTT and constitute a potential therapeutic target for a condition lacking specific treatments. The relationship between RTT and cholesterol is supported by recent findings showing that inactivation of <italic>Sqle,</italic> encoding squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011</xref>), and pharmacological treatment with the cholesterol lowering drugs statins improved motor deficit and enhanced survival in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>), a widely used experimental model of RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricceri et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice show complex changes in cholesterol levels, synthesis and metabolism in the brain and periphery, which depend on age, sex and line of mutant, among other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). Transient increase of total brain cholesterol levels is observed in 56 day (PND56) old male 129.<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> mice, but not at PND70, while serum cholesterol increased at both ages in males 129.<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> but not in 129.<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/+</sup></italic> heterozygous females or in another line of mutant mice, the B6.Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> raised on a different background strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Cyp46a1</italic>, encoding cholesterol-24-hydroxylase, the neuronal enzyme converting cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), increased at PND28 and markedly decreased in PND56 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). The reduced expression of <italic>Cyp46a1</italic> was replicated in PND56 B6.<italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> mice suggesting that this is a robust and background independent phenomenon that may lead to altered metabolism of cholesterol in RTT. In spite 24S-OHC has emerged as a biomarker of brain cholesterol metabolism in various neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leoni and Caccia, 2013</xref>) and a potent positive allosteric modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paul et al., 2013</xref>) it is not known whether alterations of this metabolite occur in RTT patients and in mouse models of the disease.</p><p>Thus, the relevance of these findings for the potential therapeutic effect of statins in RTT and the lack of replication studies of Buchoveckyâs and colleagues findings prompted us to re-assess the effects of <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion on brain and serum cholesterol levels, and the ability of lovastatin to prolong survival and rescue motor deficits in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice on a different background strain (B6), available from a commercial source.

We confirmed the robustness and reliability of the model, which in our hands, closely reproduces the originally observed differences in body weight, reduced lifespan and motor deficits between <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null and WT male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricceri et al., 2008</xref>). However, we were not able to reproduce the raise of brain and serum cholesterol and the beneficial effect of lovastatin on motor performance and survival observed previously in <italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> mice on a different background strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). This limits the generalizability of previous findings on the potential pathogenic role of cholesterol and the efficacy of statins in RTT.</p><p>The type of <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutation, dose of lovastatin, route and schedule of drug administration, mouse age, housing, behavioral tests and the lack of cholesterol in the diet used in our study are identical to those used by Buchovecky et al. Thus, other factors may account for the discrepancies between the present and the previous study. The main difference is the background strain of the <italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> mice, B6 in our study and 129 S6/SvEvTac (129) in Buchovecky et al. We observed a reduction of serum cholesterol in PND28 and PND56 <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice and no effect on brain cholesterol, regardless the age. The same allele deletion on the 129 background determined the opposite effect on serum and a transient increase of brain cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). It is known that genetic background is a source of variability that influences the expression of phenotype and drug response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cervo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sittig et al., 2016</xref>). In mouse models of RTT, genetic background influences the effects of <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion on body weight, cognitive, anxiety and social phenotypes resulting, in several cases, in directionally opposite effects of the same allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> male mice on a 129 background are obese, likely because of a systemic metabolic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kyle et al., 2016</xref>), while they are underweight in a B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>; present study). However, other phenotypes, such as motor deficits, are reproduced in different mouse models of RTT regardless of the genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with our findings, brain cholesterol and the expression of <italic>Cyp46a1</italic> was not affected in <italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic> mice on the B6 background, aged 7 to 56 days and no changes of brain levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol were observed at 7 and 14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, no increase in serum and brain cholesterol was detected in another line of <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice, the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> on a B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). These findings indicate that <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion is not sufficient by itself to affect brain cholesterol homeostasis but may require the interaction with modifier genes, as already suggested for the influence of genetic background on the effect of <italic>Mecp2</italic> on body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy of lovastatin in improving motor performance in male 129.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>) cannot be confirmed in mice carrying the same allele on a B6 background. Interestingly, lovastatin had no effects on serum cholesterol in WT mice regardless of the background strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). These findings are consistent with the scarce effect of statins in reducing circulating cholesterol in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pecoraro et al., 2014</xref>) and indicate that neither the background strain nor the mutation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> alone are sufficient to explain the effects of lovastatin on serum cholesterol observed in 129.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. This suggests that indirect mechanisms are likely involved in the ability of lovastatin to improve motor performance and survival in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice.</p><p>It could be argued that lovastatin may be effective only in mice showing altered cholesterol homeostasis, such as 129.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. The empirical finding that statins are more effective in lowering serum cholesterol when this was increased through a cholesterol-enriched diet or because of the deletion of the Apo-E carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pecoraro et al., 2014</xref>) apparently support this view. However, the fact that fluvastatin is effective in improving motor deficits in 129.<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/+</sup></italic> females, in which serum cholesterol levels are not changed, argues against this interpretation. In addition, it is unlikely that the concentration of lovastatin reaching the brain after the administration of 1.5 mg/kg is sufficient to suppress cholesterol synthesis. Even in mice given 3 mg/kg, brain levels of lovastatin were below 25 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), far less than the IC<sub>50</sub> and Ki for the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase estimated in vitro (77 and 150 nM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bischoff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff and Heller, 1998</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that direct inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is unlikely the mechanism by which lovastatin lowers cholesterol synthesis and improves motor deficits and survival in 129.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice.</p><p>Differences in the rotarod protocol between studies deserve some comments. We administered two rotarod sessions to mice on PND49-50 and PND56-57 while in the previous study mice underwent a single session. We were able to show deficits in rotarod performance in our <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice comparable to those seen previously in the same line of mutant mice on a B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mellios et al., 2014</xref>). Our mice learn the task as testified by the increased performance (latency to fall) from trial 1 to 8 while the performance of untreated 129.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice used in Buchoveckyâs study was very poor and did not improve across trials. It is unlikely that our protocol prevented the effect of lovastatin in the rotaroad since <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice of the same mutant line, genetic background, age, sex, and similar basal performance in the rotarod improved in response to clenbuterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mellios et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, using another motor test, the hanging-wire, we confirmed that lovastatin failed to rescue motor deficits of mutant mice. Thus, it is unlikely that our protocol masked potential effects of lovastatin on motor performance. However, we cannot exclude that previous learning of the task precluded the assessment of any effects lovastatin could have on motor learning in PND56-57 mice.</p><p>We found no changes in the expression of brain <italic>Cyp46a1</italic> in PND28 and PND56 <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. This fully agrees with recent data showing that <italic>Cyp46a1</italic> expression was not affected in B6.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice aged 14, 43 or 56 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez et al., 2017</xref>), but is in sharp contrast with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). However, we found a moderate, but highly significant reduction of brain 24S-OHC in males and confirmed this effect in females <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the reduction of 24S-OHC may be attributable to reduced activity of cholesterol-24-hydroxylase or other mechanisms. Since 24S-OHC is produced to a large extent by brain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BjÃ¶rkhem et al., 1998</xref>), low levels suggests reduced metabolism of neuronal cholesterol. The fact that 24S-OHC was reduced in fully symptomatic mutant mice, but not in younger, pre-symptomatic mice suggests that reduced cholesterol metabolism is mainly associated to the symptomatic stage of the disease. Interestingly, 24S-OHC was recently found to control neuron excitability through allosteric modulation of the NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paul et al., 2013</xref>). Excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is found in the brain of <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice. Selective impairment in excitatory synaptic transmission as well as elevation of neuronal activity occurs in different brain regions of <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calfa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shepherd and Katz, 2011</xref>). Altered composition of NMDA receptor subunits in cortical circuits contribute to the regression of visual cortical function in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2012</xref>) and the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to reverse functional deficits of forebrain circuitsâ activity induced by <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kron et al., 2012</xref>). These findings support the involvement of NMDA receptors in the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance found in the brain of <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice and suggest that changes in brain levels of 24S-OHC, by modulating NMDA receptor activity may contribute to Mecp2-induced alterations of brain circuitsâ excitability.</p><p>The importance of replication studies has recently been highlighted by the failure to confirm the potential benefit of bone marrow transplantation in a mouse model of RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Assessing the influence of background strain on the phenotypic expression of Mecp2 mutation may ultimately contribute to our understanding of the causes of the disease, the mechanism involved in drug action and the development of treatments for patients with Rett syndrome.</p><p>The present results show that lovastatin had no effect on motor performance and survival when the deletion of the Mecp2 allele is expressed on the particular background strain we have studied and do not negate the role of cholesterol and the potential therapeutic effect of statins in RTT. The present findings suggest that the response to lovastatin is under the control of inherent genetic or other biological mechanisms specific to the effects of lovastatin on brain function. Thus, the efficacy of lovastatin in RTT may be limited to those patients that reproduce alteration of cholesterol homeostasis through mechanisms similar to those described in mice responding to statins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). Further studies are needed to establish the mechanisms involved in the reduction of brain levels of 24S-OHC, its role in RTT and the feasibility of using plasma levels of this metabolite as a biomarker of brain cholesterol metabolism, which may help to sort out patients that may best respond to treatment aimed at re-balancing cholesterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice breeding and genotyping</title><p>Males, B6.<italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup> were used in all experiments except for measurement of 24S-OHC where <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> females were also tested. <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and wild type (WT) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories and maintained in a specific pathogen free animal facility under standard conditions of temperature (21Â Â±Â 2Â°C) and humidity (55Â Â±Â 5%), with food (Teklad Global 2018S; Envigo, Italy) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

The study builds on previous work showing alterations in cholesterol homeostasis in the brain of <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice on a 129S6/SvEvTac genetic background and the ability of lovastatin to increase survival and motor performance in these mice. The current study presents data that the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null B6 mice do not have altered cholesterol levels in brain, only a slight decrease in serum cholesterol levels, and slightly lower levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in brain. The authors also show lovastatin does not rescue survival or motor performance deficits. The authors attribute the difference in cholesterol levels and the response to lovastatin between the studies to the genetic background strain of the mice. The study is well conducted and the findings are interesting as they show that lovastatin may have limited benefits in correcting behavioral phenotypes in mutant mouse models with implications towards the clinic. Given the importance of replicating findings that have clinical implications in the development of treatments for patients with Rett syndrome the study is significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very well done study demonstrating that Lovastatin does not generally improve the phenotypes of mice lacking Mecp2. This is in contrast to a previous report that indicated that loss of function mutations in <italic>Sqle</italic> would modify in a positive fashion the phenotypes of <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice, and that treatment of these same mice with Lovastatin improved the phenotypes. Critically, the authors of this manuscript used the identical mouse mutation and the same dosing method as was used in the previous manuscript, and they abide by recommendations for rigor in preclinical studies (randomization, blinding, etc.). The major difference between their work and the previous work is the different strain background, with the previous work using 129 and this using B6. This is a very important aspect, and a strength of this study. <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice in a 129 strain are obese and develop a metabolic phenotype, whereas they are underweight in a B6 background. As the authors carefully describe, the potential benefit seen in the previous study was likely due to a strain specific effect, not a general effect of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutation. This is very important with regards to the development of new therapies in Rett syndrome, because it raises concerns that statin treatments likely will not be of broad benefit in Rett syndrome. Replication studies such as this are very important to the field and unfortunately are not published enough. It might be worthwhile for the authors to mention recent studies that showed a failure to replicate the benefit of bone marrow transplantation in Rett syndrome (PMID: 25993969), in support of the broad importance of replication studies. In summary, this is an excellent manuscript that deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The ability of lovastatin to improve symptoms associated with mutation of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene in mice is examined. The data show that administration of lovastatin at 1.5 mg/kg body weight to male knockout mice for a two or three week period failed to improve performance in rotarod or hanging-wire tests and did not extend lifespan. Lipid measurements reveal reduced serum cholesterol levels in the knockout mice but no changes in bran cholesterol levels. Slightly lower levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are observed in the brains of older male and female mutant mice but levels of the enzyme responsible for this metabolite, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, are not different between control and knockout animals.</p><p>These findings are in contrast to an earlier paper published in 2013 by Justice and colleagues, which reported broad changes in sterol metabolism in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice and an ability of statins to ameliorate many of the Rett-syndrome-like symptoms associated with loss of this enzyme.</p><p>As the earlier studies were done in mice with an inbred 129svEvTac background and the present studies were done with the same mutation on a Black6 background, the authors conclude that the beneficial effects of statins in this animal model system are strain-specific.</p><p>There are several shortcomings associated with the present study. First, that the background on which the <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutation was maintained had a large effect on statin outcomes was reported by Justice and colleagues in 2013. The present study confirms these findings but does not extend them. Second, only two lipids (cholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol) were examined here, whereas the lipid analyses reported in the Justice paper were more extensive. Third, since control studies were not performed here in a known responsive strain (SvEv), it is not possible to determine whether the administered statin was consumed, absorbed, or otherwise effective in the Black6 mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22409.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦] We ask that you address some of the comments raised below and most importantly make it clear that your data show that there is no effect of Lovastatin in the particular background strain you studied, which is different from the strain used by Buchovecky et al.

This and the limited funding available suggested to us to focus our investigations on a few key points. After we submitted our manuscript, a new paper confirmed the failure of <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion to affect brain cholesterol and <italic>Cyp46a1</italic> expression in the same line of B6.<italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice used in our study. In addition, the paper provided a more complete lipid analysis, which improved our knowledge on the effects of Mecp2 deletion on lipid metabolism.

With regards to the second part of the comment, we would like to point out that lovastatin was administered subcutaneously, hence, it did not need to be consumed. Available evidence suggest that lovastatin is absorbed and reach the brain of B6 mice better than less hydrophobic statins, such as pravastatin (Johnson-Anuna et al. 2005, JPET 312:786) and it effectively prevented audiogenic seizures in an experimental model of fragile X syndrome in B6 mice (Osterweil et al. 2013, Neuron 77:243).</p></body></sub-article></article>
