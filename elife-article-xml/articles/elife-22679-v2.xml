We apply phylogenomics and metabolic modeling to detect bacterial species that are evolving by gene loss, with the finding that Actinomycetaceae genomes from human cavities are undergoing sizable reductions, including loss of L-histidine and L-tryptophan biosynthesis.

Characterization of a dozen PriA homologs shows that these enzymes adapt from bifunctionality in the largest genomes, to a monofunctional, yet not necessarily specialized, inefficient form in genomes undergoing reduction. These functional changes are accomplished via mutations, which result from relaxation of purifying selection, in residues structurally mapped after sequence and X-ray structural analyses.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome dynamics, or the process by which an organism gains or loses genes, plays a fundamental role in bacterial evolution. Acquisition of new functions due to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or genetic duplications is broadly documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). Gene loss has also been implicated in rapid bacterial adaptation after experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hottes et al., 2013</xref>), but this process has not yet been confirmed in natural populations. Phylogenomics involves the comparative analysis of the gene content of a set of phylogenetically related genomes to expose new insights into genome evolution and function, and this approach has been classically applied to study how gene gain is associated with functional divergence in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Treangen and Rocha, 2011</xref>). Here, we propose that bacterial phylogenomics can be similarly applied to study evolution by gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albalat and Cañestro, 2016</xref>), specifically where enzymes are evolving within bacterial species that are undergoing genome decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Price and Wilson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The current bias toward in-depth functional analysis of proteins from genomes that are undergoing gene gain by HGT versus gene loss by decay is likely due to two factors. First, in genomes that are undergoing decay, there is a relaxation in the selection pressure that increases mutation rates in functioning proteins as these proteins begin to contribute less to cell fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wernegreen and Moran, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCutcheon and Moran, 2011</xref>). As a result, these proteins display higher-than-normal mutation rates, making in vitro analysis of protein function a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couñago et al., 2006</xref>). Second, there is only a brief window of opportunity to study the evolution of most proteins during genome decay in bacteria. This is because most proteins are monofunctional, and they are rapidly removed from the bacterial genome once they become dispensable due to gene loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use a bifunctional enzyme to study the evolution of substrate specificity after gene loss, as these enzymes may continue to operate when only one of their associated metabolic pathways becomes dispensable. We use genome-scale metabolic models to determine when each pathway is lost as well as when they become non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henry et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The phylum Actinobacteria, Gram-positive organisms with high (G+C)-content, are ubiquitous and show one of the highest levels of bacterial metabolic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barka et al., 2016</xref>). This phylum is known to display significant metabolic specialization, and phylogenomics has been previously applied to correlate genome dynamics with metabolic pathway evolution and enzyme specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz-Morales et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, within the deep-rooted family Actinomycetaceae, phylogenetic analyses have suggested the occurrence of genome decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we have observed that many actinobacterial species lack a <italic>trpF</italic> gene, while retaining a copy of the potentially bi-functional <italic>priA</italic> gene. The PriA enzyme is capable of operating in the L-histidine biosynthesis pathway as HisA, while also functioning in the L-tryptophan biosynthesis pathway as TrpF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barona-Gómez and Hodgson, 2003</xref>). As such, we suggest PriA is an ideal candidate to study protein evolution during the process of genome decay.</p><p>The product of the <italic>priA</italic> gene, which is a <italic>hisA</italic> homolog, catalyzes two analogous isomerizations of structurally similar substrates: (i) the conversion of <italic>N</italic>-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate (PRA) into 1-(<italic>O</italic>-carboxyphenylamino)-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate (CdRP) (TrpF or PRA isomerase activity); and (ii) the conversion of <italic>N</italic>-[(5-phosphoribosyl) formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (ProFAR) into <italic>N</italic>-[(5-phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (PRFAR) (HisA or ProFAR isomerase activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barona-Gómez and Hodgson, 2003</xref>). Moreover, evolution of PriA in response to genome dynamics has lead to the appearance of the SubHisA and PriB subfamilies, which have been shown to have different substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While these enzyme subfamilies were respectively discovered using phylogenetics in the genera <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, no study has ever centered on the metabolic genes associated with <italic>priA</italic> in the deep-branching organisms belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, such as those of the family Actinomycetaceae where the transition from HisA into PriA must have taken place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda-García et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plach et al., 2016</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22679.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>(βα)<sub>8</sub> barrel isomerases at which L-tryptophan and L-histidine biosynthesis converge.</title><p>Selected L-tryptophan (blue) and L-histidine (red) biosynthetic enzymes are shown.

We classify this bacterial family into four major evolutionary lineages, including two specific for the genus <italic>Actinomyces</italic>. One of these lineages shows extensive gene loss, including <italic>his</italic> and <italic>trp</italic> biosynthetic genes. After the loss of constrictions imposed by the retention of biosynthetic pathways, we found that evolutionary patterns correlate with the sub-functionalization, yet not necessarily specialization, of PriA into two new subfamilies, which we named SubHisA2 and SubTrpF. We support this classification by comprehensive in vivo and in vitro biochemical characterization of a dozen PriA homologs from <italic>Actinomyces</italic> and closely related taxa. X-ray structural analysis and molecular docking simulations were further used to start investigating the evolution of substrate specificity by gene loss in structural grounds. Our results demonstrate that gene loss can drive functional protein divergence, and provide unprecedented insights into the evolution of enzyme substrate specificity in retained enzymes after gene loss in the bacterial genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenomic resolution of the <italic>aA</italic>Actinomycetaceae family</title><p>To find evidence of gene loss in deep-branching organisms of the phylum Actinobacteria, specifically within genera belonging to the order <italic>Actinomycetales</italic>, we selected 133 representative organisms from 18 families with available genome sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

Specifically, as revealed by genome annotation using RAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aziz et al., 2008</xref>), lineage II, which has the highest (G+C)-content (68.32% on average) and the biggest genome size (3.04 Mbp on average), has the largest number of amino acid biosynthetic pathways (see next section). This observation contrasts with the results obtained for lineage IV, which shows reduced (G+C)-content (60.66% on average) and genome size (2.19 Mbp on average), as well as less amino acid biosynthetic pathways.

These models also had the fewest predicted essential nutrients with an average of 19 nutrients required. This result indicates that most biosynthetic pathways for essential biomass precursors are complete in the lineage II models. The lineage I and IV models were substantially smaller with an average of 850 and 843 gene-associated reactions, respectively. Although similar in size, the lineage I models had more required nutrients (25 on average) compared with the lineage IV models (22 on average). Finally, the lineage III models were the smallest of all, with an average of 817 gene-associated reactions. Surprisingly, these models still had fewer required nutrients than the lineage I models (23 on average). These results provide a meaningful biochemical context in which biosynthetic enzymes are evolving.</p><p>To study the metabolic diversity of each lineage in more detail, we performed a comparative analysis of the gene-associated reactions of our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Given the large metabolic and genetic diversity, we used less stringent parameters than those used for our core genome analysis sustaining our phylogenomics of previous section (see Materials and methods). This comparative analysis revealed that the lineage II genomes were the least diverse, with a very large fraction of reactions present in all models, including those for amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). All other lineages were more diverse. Interestingly, a comparative analysis of our models found that all models across all lineages share a common conserved core of 695 reactions. When we similarly compute a conserved core for each individual lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), we find that the 89% of reactions in the conserved core for each lineage are contained in the conserved core across all lineages.</p><p>From these modeling results, we clearly see that lineages I, III and IV are all undergoing the process of gene loss, resulting in a reduction towards a common set of core metabolic pathways. This explains the rapid development of diversity within each lineage, as well as the variability in minimal required nutrients predicted by our models. We can also apply our models to study the gene loss process from a mechanistic perspective by looking for patterns in the presence and absence of genes and reactions for two specific pathways of interest: L-tryptophan and L-histidine biosynthesis. Our models predicted genomes in lineages I, III, and IV (but none from lineage II) that required these amino acids as a supplemental nutrient, indicating the loss of these biosynthetic pathways in these organisms. We also observed that the presence of the <italic>priA</italic> gene, which takes part in both L-tryptophan and L-histidine biosynthesis, closely tracked with the presence of these pathways in these genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Only five enzymes out of nine were found to be soluble and could be purified as needed, which agrees with the high mutation rate encountered in the previous section. Fortunately, we obtained Michaelis Menten enzyme kinetics parameters for representative enzymes of all three evolutionary hypotheses, namely, three enzymes belonging to H1 and one enzyme each for H2 and H3, with the following results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). First, enzymes from Org15, Org21, and Org22 (H1) showed dual-substrate specificity but also poor catalytic efficiencies, namely, <italic>k<sub>cat/</sub>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>ProFAR</sup> from 0.01 to 0.1 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>k<sub>cat/</sub>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>PRA</sup> around 0.01 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>.

Third, PRA isomerase activity as the sole activity present in H3 was confirmed in the enzyme purified from Org42, with a <italic>k<sub>cat/</sub>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>PRA</sup> of 0.02 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>The obtained enzyme kinetics parameters suggest that mutations that accumulate during relaxation of purifying selection, which make these enzymes difficult to work with, affect the turnover (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>). In the case of the H1 enzymes, the poor turnovers are compensated for by relatively high substrate affinities (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>), mainly for ProFAR. However, this does not seem to be the case for the enzymes belonging to H2 and H3, which have poor <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> parameters not only for the substrate of the missing activity but also for the substrates they are active against, ProFAR and PRA, respectively. Therefore, PriA homologs from <italic>Actinomyces</italic> have poor catalytic efficiencies when compared with <italic>bona fide</italic> PriAs from its closely related genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that enzyme evolution from bifunctionality to monofunctionality under relaxation of purifying selection does not necessarily express itself in the same way as recorded during purifying or positive selection, where specialization and enzyme proficiency come together.</p><p>The case of the in vivo PRA isomerase activity detected for the enzyme from Org36, which could not be confirmed in vitro, may be related to the different resolutions of our enzyme assays. For instance, the detection limits for the PRA and ProFAR isomerase assay used in the present study are 0.0001 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.001 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noda-García et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite the poor catalytic efficiency of all <italic>Actinomyces</italic> enzymes investigated, these detection limits guarantee that our enzyme parameters are in agreement between them and with our hypotheses. Based on these results the family related to H1, which has both activities, is referred to as PriA, whereas the latter two enzyme subfamilies, related to H2 and H3, were renamed as SubHisA2 and SubTrpF, respectively.

Previous independent mutation of these two residues, even into similar amino acids, in SubHisA from <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> abolished the PRA isomerase activity of this monofunctional enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>). Analogously, the SubHisA2_Org36 has a change of Ser79 into Thr79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In this mutation, the methyl group of the threonine residue may affect the contact between PRA and the hydroxyl group common to these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), thus abolishing PRA isomerase activity. This effect agrees with the estimated binding affinities for ProFAR (−9.5 kcal/mol) and PRA (−9.2 kcal/mol) obtained after molecular docking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The energy-minimized docking model of the productively bound PRA, in agreement with the kinetic parameters from the preceding section, indicates that the catalytic residue Asp11 does not interact with the 2′-hydroxyl group from the substrate. A precedent for this contact is found in previous X-ray structural and mutagenesis analysis of <italic>bona fide</italic> PriA enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noda-García et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Due et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of PriA (H1) with SubTrpF (H3) revealed the mutations Gly126Cys and Trp139Gly. In PriA, Gly126 faces the active site near the catalytic residue Asp128. The introduction of the Cys side-chain in SubTrpF could influence the positioning of Arg137 with respect to Asp128, obstructing the accommodation of ProFAR, as this region interacts with a large phosphosugar moiety that is absent from PRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, Trp139, which is catalytically important for conversion of ProFAR by PriA, is mutated into several different amino acid residues in SubTrpFs. Trp139 is important for the correct positioning of the catalytic residues present in loop 5, and for substrate binding through stacking interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Due et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the indole group of Trp139 in PriAs can form a hydrogen bond with Asp128, stabilizing the knot-like conformation observed during ProFAR binding. Thus, mutation of this residue in SubTrpF is in agreement with the loss of ProFAR isomerase activity. Arg83 is also interesting as it is differentially missing from SubTrpF, and/or the fragment preceding it contains a two-residue insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Arg83 interacts with the second phosphate group of ProFAR, allowing its correct position in the substrate-binding pocket of PriA. Overall, these modifications in key residues disfavor the ProFAR binding affinities, a result that is in agreement with the enzyme kinetic parameters and the estimated binding affinities for ProFAR (−9.5 kcal/mol) and PRA (−9.7 kcal/mol) obtained after molecular docking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Although further research is needed to confirm the exact mutations and their roles leading to SubTrpF and SubHisA2 sub-families, our results provide a promising first step towards deciphering at the atomic level how relaxation of purifying selection influences the evolution of substrate specificity. At this point in time, when PriA, SubTrpF and SubHisA2 sequences and structures are still scarce, the effects of genetic drift, i.e. mutations related to taxonomic distance rather than functional divergence (as previously shown for the evolution of PriB from PriA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verduzco-Castro et al., 2016</xref>]) cannot be ruled out. An extra factor potentially hampering sequence and structural analysis is the higher-than-normal mutation rates of these protein sub-families, which translates into lack of sequence conservation and disordered regions in X-ray crystal structures. Our structural data, including the estimates for molecular binding affinities, can therefore only be used to support other biochemical and evolutionary evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study highlights the use of phylogenomics and metabolic models to identify and investigate gene loss in bacteria. Our results indicated that the distinctive reactions retained in each <italic>Actinomyces</italic> genome reflect the preservation of some full biosynthetic pathways over others, conferring a capacity to grow on different sets of environmental nutrients. This result in turn implies an exposure of these genomes to a diverse range of environmental conditions and selection pressures, while the phylogenetic proximity of these functionally diverse genomes speaks to a strong capacity for rapid adaptation to the diverse conditions present in the human body. The process of gene loss, associated with relaxation of purifying selection, is the key driver of this adaptation strategy. Thus, metabolic diversity in complex systems as the human microbiome might be characterized after reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories, which may reflect different bacterial functions and ecological sub-niches. The pattern of reaction conservation seen in our metabolic modeling analysis exemplifies a likely signature for gene loss, which could be used to identify these phenomena among other genome families. Remarkably, in this context, enzyme specialization does not necessarily means catalytic proficiency.</p><p>Our study of this gene loss process exposed evolutionary patterns of PriA in L-tryptophan and L-histidine biosynthesis pathways, with the potential to unveil the underpinning mechanisms driving the evolution of substrate specificity of retained enzymes. Because multifunctional enzymes may have more than one constraint operating on them, tracking functional evolution promptly after selection is relaxed during genome decay might be done more readily than with monofunctional enzymes. As shown here, only partial selection may be released in the retained bifunctional enzyme PriA. Indeed, the predicted metabolic phenotypes unveiled by flux balance analysis did correlate better with the evolutionary patterns revealed by metabolic gene occurrence and PriA phylogenetic reconstructions than they did with the natural history told by the species tree. To confirm this sort of evolutionary behavior, other instances of well-known multifunctional proteins, such as moonlighting proteins, may be investigated.</p><p>The occurrence of SubHisA2 in <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, together with the appearance of SubHisA in <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, demonstrates that subfunctionalization of PriA leading into HisA-like enzymes has occurred at least twice. Such phenotypic plasticity is a reflection of the intrinsic enzymatic proficiency of PriA upon two related but topologically dissimilar substrates; but, more interestingly, the evolutionary histories behind these independent subfunctionalization events responded to somehow contrasting evolutionary mechanisms. Whereas SubHisA is the result of positive selection after the acquisition of an entire <italic>trp</italic> operon by HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda-García et al., 2013</xref>), SubHisA2 responded to the loss of <italic>trp</italic> genes, and it evolved under relaxation of purifying selection. Consequently, SubHisA has drastic mutations in its catalytic active site, which have been shown to be responsible for its inability to catalyze PRA, whilst SubHisA2 shows some residual PRA isomerase activity, congruent with the observation that its active-site architecture is almost completely conserved.</p><p>The subfunctionalization of PriA into SubTrpF, in contrast, has been documented only here. This functional shift had to involve ‘non-proficient’ enzyme specialization, since the ancestral activity of PriA is ProFAR isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plach et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the appearance of SubTrpF with substitutions in its catalytic active-site could be discussed based on previous knowledge about PriA. These mutations actually resulted in the elimination of the ancestral ProFAR activity, which is remarkable because the driving force behind this process relates to the relaxation of purifying selection. In agreement, a recent study of PriA sequences obtained from a diverse metagenome, complemented by some of the SubTrpF sequences studied here, classified this enzyme subfamily at the transition from HisA into PriA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda-García et al., 2015</xref>). Since <italic>Actinomyces</italic> undergoes interspecies recombination with protein functional implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Do et al., 2008</xref>), such a mechanism may provide a means to explain the sequence heterogeneity found in these <italic>Actinomyces</italic> PriA homologs.</p><p>Our study, therefore, provides experimental evidence that gene loss can drive functional protein divergence. It also shows that, despite the fact that the retained enzymes possess low catalytic activities, they contribute to the maintenance of metabolism, and therefore, to fitness. Taken together, our evolutionary observations backed with metabolic modeling, biochemical and structural data, suggest multiple selection types associated with ecological micro-niches, e.g. environmental cues provided by the human body. Thus, enzyme subfamilies are the result of processes involving different selection types upon proteins with more than one function. Although further examples showing metabolic-driven evolutionary histories need to be identified, our study provides a strategy for the in-depth use of genome sequences for protein and bacterial evolutionary studies to understand enzyme function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phylogenomic and evolutionary analysis</title><p>The genomes of the genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and the family <italic>Actinomyceatceae</italic> were obtained from NCBI (NCBI accession numbers are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

We also favored the addition of reactions that would permit more gene-associated reactions in each model to carry flux.</p><p>Once models were built, we applied flux balance analysis (FBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orth et al., 2010</xref>) to predict minimal feasible media and classify reactions using a six step process: (i) set the biomass flux to a nonzero value; (ii) minimize the number of active exchange reactions to identify the minimal set of external nutrients that must be provided to permit growth; (iii) constrain exchange fluxes so that only the minimal exchanges are allowed to function; (iv) minimize and maximize each reaction flux to classify each reaction during growth on minimal media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003</xref>); (v) maximize biomass flux on minimal media and fix the biomass flux at its maximum value; and (vi) minimize the sum of all fluxes in the model to produce the simplest flux profile possible (e.g. removing all flux loops). Reactions with only positive or negative fluxes are classified as <italic>essential</italic>; reactions with only zero flux values are classified as <italic>nonfunctional</italic>; and reactions with zero and non-zero flux values are classified as <italic>functional</italic>.</p><p>For construction of the overall model per lineage, we identified all reactions that were associated with genes (i.e. not gapfilled) in at least 75% of the models included in the lineage, using a permissive e-value of 0.01. These reactions formed the basis of our lineage model. Then we applied the same gapfilling algorithm used with our genome models to permit the lineage model to grow. Finally, we applied our FBA pipeline to predict minimal media and classify reactions in the lineage model.

The protein was purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by His6-tag cleavage using recombinant His-tagged TEV protease. A second IMAC step was used to remove the protease, the uncut protein, and the affinity tag. Concentrated protein (37 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) was crystallized by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner Bio-One, USA). The crystals appeared at 289 K in conditions consisting of 0.2 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 M CAPS:NaOH pH 10.5, and 1.2 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/0.8 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. Prior to data collection crystals were cryoprotected in 2.4 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and subsequently flash-cooled. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K. Native datasets were collected at 19-ID equipped with an ADSC quantum Q315r CCD detector at 0.979 Å wavelength. The images were processed by using the HKL3000 software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Minor et al., 2006</xref>).

Protein structural homology models of SubHisA_Org36 and SubTrpF_Org41 were based on the crystal structure of PriA from PriA_Org15 (PDB:4X2R; this study). A standard modeling strategy using Robetta and Rosetta 3.5 (47) was adopted. Molecular models of PRA and ProFAR were built using Molden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaftenaar and Noordik, 2000</xref>), and optimal atomic configuration of both substrates was obtained using Gaussian 09 (Gaussian Inc., Wallingford CT, USA) through a quantic geometry optimization using a self-consistent field at the Hartree-Fock 6–31G* level. Polar hydrogen atoms and Gasteiger-Marsili empirical atomic partial charges were added using AutoDockTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morris et al., 2009</xref>). An extensive configuration sampling of PRA and ProFAR binding biophysical interactions with PriA catalytic site was performed with Autodock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>). Results were merged, refined, clustered, and energy sorted to produce a set of complex configuration predictions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Nelly Selem-Mójica, Víctor Villa-Moreno, José-Luis Steffani-Vallejo and Christian E.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>There are some issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The section on biochemical data requires a more clear version since there are questions about the significance and interpretation of the values reported. The interpretation of the parallel decay of both Trp and His pathways is not sufficiently convincing in the current version of the paper.</p><p>The interpretation of the mutations in the x-ray structure and models, together with the analysis of the MSA, are considered important but weak elements of the paper. The use of better methods and a more systematic approach will be required.</p><p>A new version should justify clearly the need of building complete metabolic models for the questions addressed in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The basic proposal of the paper is interesting and well positioned. The study of PriA dual enzyme acting in two pathways (His and Trp) as a model of the changes in response to a large genomic delection of complete pathways, is an interesting and original idea.</p><p>The work presented include:</p><p>First the basic phylogenetic analysis of the protein family with the distribution of the aa pathways and the <italic>PriA</italic> gene. (The analysis of the larger family presented in the first figure seems irrelevant for the rest of the paper). The results are interesting and demonstrate the existence of a potential relation between the absence of the enzymes of the two pathways and the distribution of the <italic>PriA</italic> gene.</p><p>The importance of the pathways is analyzed with metabolic models of the different genomes. The exercise is interesting but it is debatable if it is really necessary for the conclusions obtained. (&quot;Overall, we see from the modeling analysis that lineages I, III and IV are all undergoing the process of gene loss, with different genomes in these lineages losing different sets of metabolic genes.&quot; would not be enough with knowing that enzymes of the key His and Trp pathways are missing? What else do we learn that is important for the logic of the study?)</p><p>in vitro biochemical assays of some of the sequences of the key groups are presented to demonstrate the lack of restrictions of the enzymes of the SubHis and SubTrp groups. The results are partially consistent with the interpretation of the authors but the data suggest that the actual situation might be far more complex of what the model suggest. Indeed, it seems difficult to explain the poor catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes of the subHis and subTrp groups in the context of the adaptations to the corresponding missing pathways.</p><p>The analysis of the structure of the enzyme based on a single x-ray obtained for this paper and homology models of the other prototypic sequences. It is a correct analysis but very speculative. It provides very little solid evidence for the interpretation of the mutations.</p><p>The analysis of the variation at the sequence level based on the MSA alignmentof members of the family. In this case it is unclear how some specific positions are selected as key differences between SubTrp and SubHis. Some of the differences are not consistent with the conservations in the groups and it is unclear if they are conserved in other sequences of the family (for example, the T for S substitution in subHisA2_Org36 is not present in subHisA2_Org34).</p><p>Additionally, the analysis is not systematic and none of the various existing methods for the analysis of positions specific of subfamilies are used.</p><p>In summary, a very interesting idea and a potentially good model to explore the evolution of the function of an enzyme in similar genomes subject to specific gene losses. A great effort to combine different type of approaches from genomics to modelling, including biochemistry, phylogenetics and protein structures. To conclude: some not so optimal interpretation of the results and general lack of sufficiently convincing support for the proposed model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This Manuscript presents an imposing body of work showing how gene loss can drive the evolution of substrate specificity from retained enzymes. The authors did a thorough work, using multiple approaches to elaborate and support their hypotheses. More in detail:</p><p>1) Genome sequencing of the <italic>A. oris</italic> MG-1 strain.</p><p>2. Phylogenomic analysis of the Actinomycetaceae family, using 35 single-copy conserved proteins in 133 organisms.</p><p>3) Phylogenomic analysis 0f 205 single-copy proteins conserved in 41 organisms (33 from the Actinomycetaceae family, and 8 from the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus, used as an outgrup).</p><p>4) Metabolic model reconstruction and flux balance analysis on 33 Actinomycetaceae.</p><p>5) Molecular evolution analysis of the PriA gene within Actinomycetaceae.</p><p>6) Biochemical analysis of PriA enzymes.</p><p>7) Crystallographic analysis of PriA.</p><p>8) Structural modelling, analysis, and molecular docking to study the evolution of SubHisA2 and SubTrpF.</p><p>Overall, I found this work outstanding, and I think this is the kind of manuscript every evolutionary biologist would like to read. I really enjoyed it. I think the authors did a great job in designing the experiments, and in my opinion the methods, the results, the hypotheses and the conclusions are presented in a very clear and accurate form. I could not find any substantive concern about this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents an interesting analysis of two phenomena that are under-studied: gene loss, and generalist-to-specialist evolution. In general, we know a lot on gene gain (by duplication or HGT) and relatively little on gene loss, and, everyone assumes that generalists evolving to specialists is a dominating trend in evolution, whereas it could may well be that the opposite trend, highlighted here, is equally common. Overall, the scope of the work from phylogenetic to crystal structures is impressive, and the evolutionary trend and unraveled mechanisms of gene loss are well supported.</p><p>On the critical side, I must admit that I'm not so convinced that the effects of specialization and general decay of activity can be distinguished in this case. By and large, both activities (Trp and His reactions) drop down and largely in parallel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The detection limit for then in vitro assays is not specified (i.e., what n.d. values represent) but the residual, other activity may not be so far from the one detected and assigned as 'specialized'. The structural argumentation is weak – it's not that the authors did not make an effort to unravel the effects of mutations, but it's sometimes hard to understand what mutations are doing even within active-sites let alone in second-shell, and especially, when these enzyme variants are so crippled. In general, orthologous enzyme vary in activity, often over 3 orders, and even between relatively close species. So, I think that it's hard to say whether, and which part of, the change in activities can be attributed to gene loss and concomitant specialisation (to either Trp or His) and which part to an overall relief of selection (i.e., for both reactions). Finally, since these genome sequences are sporadic (unlike say hundreds of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that were sequenced), some mutations may relate to drift (polymorphism) and may not represent a long-term &quot;wild-type&quot; sequence. Previous cases analysed by this group are far more clear-cut in this respect (the effect of specialization). These caveats should be explicitly addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22679.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The section on biochemical data requires a more clear version since there are questions about the significance and interpretation of the values reported.

Reviewers questioned the detection limits of our enzyme assays, which were actually included in the original version, but we have now discussed them in relation to how the discovered enzymes have evolved. A key issue with regards to this discussion is the (preconceived) idea that we were reporting on a story related to specialization, as the generalist – specialist model prevails in the community, even when it is not referred to anywhere in the manuscript. After our results, we do not believe this model is appropriate when enzymes evolve under relaxation of purifying selection. We have clarified this point throughout the manuscript by explicitly stating “monofunctional, yet not necessarily specialized”. Indeed, the importance of our contribution is that it provides a comprehensive example that questions current models in many ways, and this was possible because we looked at natural – not directed or artificial – evolution. Also, as requested, we have also included a new figure to introduce the enzymes involved in this study, which will hopefully help the reader to better grasp the biochemical and evolutionary nature of the system we have investigated.</p><p><italic>The interpretation of the mutations in the x-ray structure and models, together with the analysis of the MSA, are considered important but weak elements of the paper. The use of better methods and a more systematic approach will be required.</italic> </p><p>Structural biology data.Reviewers questioned if putative mutations identified using only one structure, together with our homology models/molecular dynamics simulations, could lead to the conclusions reached. Indeed, reviewers are right and certainly our structural evidence is only useful in the context of other biochemical and evolutionary data. We did actually try to do some further sequence analysis, as suggested by you, but this was not possible due to the little data available. As reviewer 3 states “it’s not that the authors did not make an effort to unravel the effects of mutations, but it’s sometimes hard [...] when these enzymes are so crippled [...] (and) these genome sequences are sporadic”. In other words, there is nothing else we could do with the available data. Along these lines, it should be noted that sequence conservation under purifying selection is an assumption that lacks evidence – again, a preconceived notion as in previous point. In the light of this recognition, we proceeded more carefully about any conclusion related to the structural data by modifying all related writing throughout the manuscript. Specifically, we explicitly say this in a paragraph included at the end of the structural sub-section. We believe this explains our limitations but also embraces some of the specific possibilities raised by the reviewers, without diminishing our structural work.</p><p><italic>A new version should justify clearly the need of building complete metabolic models for the questions addressed in the paper.</italic> </p><p>Metabolic modeling data. Reviewers questioned the use of this approach, which hopefully is better justified now that we have provided a better organization of the relevant sections. This includes re-doing of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and re-allocation of some of the data included in this figure, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> to the Figure reporting the metabolic modeling, originally 3 now 4. We also worked on the writing when appropriate, to make clear that although occurrence / absence of any given gene can be noted relatively straightaway, overreaching and risky conclusions can only be avoided if genomes are seen through the eyes of high-quality annotations, such as metabolic models. We argue that this should become a new standard when assuming that enzymes are missing or present, which in turn translate into specific hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
