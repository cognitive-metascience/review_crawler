involved in many aspects of plant growth and development. The maturation of these peptides from their larger precursors is still poorly understood. We show here that the biogenesis of CLEL6 and CLEL9 peptides in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> requires a series of processing events in consecutive compartments of the secretory pathway. Following cleavage of the signal peptide upon entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the peptide precursors are processed in the cis-Golgi by the subtilase SBT6.1. SBT6.1-mediated cleavage within the variable domain allows for continued passage of the partially processed precursors through the secretory pathway, and for subsequent post-translational modifications including tyrosine sulfation and proline hydroxylation within, and proteolytic maturation after exit from the Golgi. Activation by subtilases including SBT3.8 in post-Golgi compartments depends on the N-terminal aspartate of the mature peptides. Our work highlights the complexity of post-translational precursor maturation allowing for stringent control of peptide biogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>precursor processing</kwd><kwd>peptide hormone</kwd><kwd>subtilase</kwd><kwd>subtilisin-like proteinase</kwd><kwd>peptide signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1101 Project D06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaller</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1101 Project A02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schumacher</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Step-wise processing of plant peptide hormone precursors by subtilisin-like proteinases in consecutive compartments of the secretory pathway is required for formation and secretion of the bioactive peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complementing the activity of the classical phytohormones, peptide hormones and growth factors are now recognized as an important class of signaling molecules for long-range signaling and for cell-to-cell communication over short distances, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter ‘Arabidopsis’), there are more than 1000 genes potentially encoding signaling peptides, apparently involved in all aspects of plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lease and Walker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghorbani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tavormina et al., 2015</xref>). There has been remarkable progress in recent years with respect to the characterization of peptide perception and signal transduction mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2018</xref>). The biogenesis of these signaling molecules, on the other hand, is still poorly understood. This is particularly true for the large group of signaling peptides that depend on a series of post-translational modifications (PTMs) for maturation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsubayashi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Proteolytic processing is required for all post-translationally modified signaling peptides to release the peptide entity from its precursor. Additional PTMs may include tyrosine sulfation, proline hydroxylation, and arabinosylation of the hydroxyproline residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsubayashi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>). Tyrosine sulfation is performed by a single tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) that is membrane-anchored in the cis-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komori et al., 2009</xref>). TPST requires aspartate on the amino side of tyrosin for substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komori et al., 2009</xref>). Tyrosine sulfation is a critical maturation step, as sulfated peptides usually depend on this modification for full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>). Proline hydroxylation is catalyzed by membrane-anchored prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) localized in ER and Golgi compartments. There are 13 P4Hs in Arabidopsis, some of which were shown to be required for the hydroxylation of extensin and possibly other hydroxyprolin (Hyp)-rich glycoproteins of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Velasquez et al., 2015</xref>). Which of the P4Hs act on signaling peptides, and whether or not they differ in preference for proline in a certain sequence context is still unclear. Proline hydroxylation is a prerequisite for subsequent glycosylation. As the first in a series of glycosylation steps, <italic>L</italic>-arabinose is transferred to the 4-hydroxyl by Golgi-resident Hydroxyproline <italic>O</italic>-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT). HPAT is encoded by three genes in Arabidopsis that are at least partially functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogawa-Ohnishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacAlister et al., 2016</xref>). To what extent differences in substrate specificity of HPATs may contribute to the selection of certain Hyp residues for glycosylation remains to be seen.</p><p>The identification of precursor processing proteases lags behind the other PTM enzymes. It was and is still hampered by the large number of possible candidates (907 peptidases are listed in the MEROPS database (release 12.0) for Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rawlings et al., 2016</xref>), by their generally low expression levels, by functional redundancy, and by the lack of a conserved processing site. As compared to tyrosine sulfation, proline hydroxylation and Hyp arabinosylation which occur at Asp-Tyr, Pro, and Hyp residues, respectively, and in contrast to animal systems, where peptide hormones are typically flanked by pairs of basic residues, there is no consensus motif that would mark the cleavage sites for processing of peptide precursors in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rawlings et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>). We may thus expect that many different proteases with different specificities for cleavage site selection are required for the processing of the many different precursors. Consistent with this notion, precursor processing enzymes have been identified in different classes of proteases, including a metacaspase and a papain-like enzyme among the cysteine peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wrzaczek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ziemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hander et al., 2019</xref>), a carboxypeptidase in the class of the zink-dependent metallo peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casamitjana-Martínez et al., 2003</xref>), and several subtilases (SBTs) among the serine peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engineer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schardon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beloshistov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doll et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichardt et al., 2020</xref>). SBTs thus seem to play a more general role in peptide hormone maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>SBTs constitute a large family of mostly extracellular proteases including e.g. 56 members in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rautengarten et al., 2005</xref>), 86 in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reichardt et al., 2018</xref>) and 97 in grapevine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Figueiredo et al., 2016</xref>). Expansion of the SBT family in plants involved both whole genome and tandem gene duplications with differential neo- and sub-functionalization resulting in many taxon-specific clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor and Qiu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reichardt et al., 2018</xref>). AtSBT6.1 stands out in this diverse family for several reasons. First, unlike most other plant SBTs that are soluble proteins targeted to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaller et al., 2018</xref>), AtSBT6.1 is a membrane protein, anchored by a C-terminal membrane-spanning helix to the Golgi and possibly the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>). Second, AtSBT6.1 is one of only two Arabidopsis SBTs that originated before the divergence of Metazoa and Viridiplantae, and is functionally conserved between animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor and Qiu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaller et al., 2018</xref>). Like Site-1-Protease (S1P), its orthologue in humans, AtSBT6.1 (alias AtS1P) cleaves membrane-anchored bZIP transcription factors in the Golgi to facilitate the translocation of their cytoplasmic domain to the nucleus for the induction of ER stress-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2007a</xref>). Furthermore, the cleavage site preference of AtSBT6.1 for the amino acid motives R-(R/K)-X-L or R-(R/K)-L-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>) is almost identical with the substrate specificity reported for human S1P (R-X-(L/V/I)-X; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seidah, 2013</xref>).</p><p>With its predominant Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parsons et al., 2012</xref>), AtSBT6.1 seems predestined to act in concert with TPST, P4Hs and HPATs in the biogenesis of post-translationally modified signaling peptides. Supporting this notion, potential AtSBT6.1/S1P cleavage sites can be found in many peptide precursors including members of the Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF), phytosulfokine (PSK), Clavata3/Embryo Surrounding Region (CLE) and CLE-Like (CLEL) families. The latter is also known as Golven (GLV) or Root Meristem Growth Factor (RGF) family and comprises 11 precursor-derived peptides of 13 to 18 amino acids carrying two additional post-translational modifications, i.e. tyrosine sulfation and hydroxylation of the ultimate proline residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuzaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitford et al., 2012</xref>). We refer to them here as CLEL, because not all family members are involved in root gravitropism (causing the GLV phenotype), or regulating the activity of the root apical meristem (as the name RGF would suggest). However, processing by AtSBT6.1 has so far only been shown for RALF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>), and in the particularly interesting case of CLEL6 (GLV1/RGF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>AtSBT6.1 was identified as a factor required for CLEL6 function in a screen for <italic>sbt</italic> mutants suppressing the CLEL6-overexpression phenotype (agravitropic root growth and increased hypocotyl elongation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>). The protease was shown to cleave the CLEL6 precursor at two canonical AtSBT6.1/S1P cleavage sites (R-R-L-R, R-R-A-L), and both cleavage sites turned out to be relevant for CLEL6 function, the second one even essential. The data indicate that AtSBT6.1 activity is required for the formation of the bioactive CLEL6 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly however, AtSBT6.1 cleavage sites are located in the variable part of the CLEL6 and other peptide precursors, considerably upstream of the mature peptide sequence. AtSBT6.1 activity is thus not sufficient and additional unknown protease(s) are required for peptide maturation. Completely unresolved is the question when and where the processing of peptide precursors takes place, particularly in relation to the other PTMs. While the Golgi is an obvious possibility for processing by AtSBT6.1, the enzyme has also been reported at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting apoplastic processing of the fully modified precursor as an alternative possibility. This has implicitly been assumed for cell wall-localized SBTs. However, as secretory enzymes they are co-targeted with their potential peptide precursor substrates providing ample opportunity for processing <italic>en route</italic>, in any compartment of the secretory pathway. These are the questions that are addressed here for the CLEL6 and CLEL9 peptide precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SBT activity is required for the maturation of CLEL6 and CLEL9 peptides</title><p>In order to confirm the involvement of SBTs in the maturation of CLEL6 (GLV1/RGF6), we used the inhibitor-based loss-of-function approach that was previously employed to demonstrate a role for redundant SBTs in the maturation of IDA (Inflorescence Deficient in Abscission) resulting in the shedding of Arabidopsis flower organs after pollination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schardon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stührwohldt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stührwohldt et al., 2018</xref>). CLEL9 (GLV2/RGF9) was included in the analysis because it acts redundantly with CLEL6 in the regulation of gravitropic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitford et al., 2012</xref>), and because it resembles CLEL6 with respect to predicted processing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Likewise, hypocotyl gravitropism was inhibited also by the expression of EPI10 controlled by either one of the two <italic>CLEL</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The same phenotype had been observed when <italic>CLEL6</italic> or <italic>9</italic> were silenced in transgenic plants by artificial micro RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitford et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that SBT activity is required for CLEL6 and 9 function. However, in contrast to <italic>CLEL6</italic> or <italic>9</italic>-silenced plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitford et al., 2012</xref>), the gravitropic response of roots was not affected in our EPI-expressing transgenics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This observation is consistent with the fact that the <italic>CLEL6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> promoters are active in the hypocotyl where they drive the expression of EPI inhibitors in epidermis and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitford et al., 2012</xref>), but not in any part of the primary root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reduced gravicurvature of P<italic><sub>CLEL6</sub></italic>:EPI1a, P<italic><sub>CLEL9</sub></italic>:EPI1a and <italic>tpst-1</italic> seedlings is rescued by addition of mature CLEL6 or CLEL9 peptides.</title><p>Gravicurvature of (<bold>A</bold>) three independent P<italic><sub>CLEL6</sub></italic>:EPI1a and (<bold>C</bold>) P<italic><sub>CLEL9</sub></italic>:EPI1a lines (gray bars; promoter constructs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) is significantly reduced in comparison to the wild type (white bars).

We thus refer to the cleavage by SBT6.1 as a necessary pre-processing step that precedes peptide activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stührwohldt and Schaller, 2019</xref>). Additional protease(s) are needed to mark the N-terminus and release the fully processed CLEL6 peptide.

To address the question whether pre-processing by SBT6.1 occurs within the secretory pathway or extracellularly, we transiently expressed the CLEL6 precursor fused to sfGFP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. The sfGFP tag was linked to the N-terminus of the precursor, just downstream of the signal peptide (construct named ‘Sec’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). GFP fluorescence was detected only in the apoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On an anti-GFP immunoblot a single band was detected corresponding in size to GFP with part of the precursor up to the first SBT6.1 cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red asterisk). Processing at this site is thus efficient when the precursor is allowed to pass through the secretory pathway.</p><p>When the precursor was equipped with a C-terminal KDEL-motif for ER retention (construct named ‘KDEL’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), processing was incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition to the apoplast, the fluorescence signal was now detected also in the ER and Golgi, as indicated by co-expression of ER (Vma12-mRFP) or Golgi (ManI-mCherry and ST-mCherry for early and late Golgi, respectively) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The signal in the ER and early Golgi compartments results from the unprocessed precursor, while the presence of extracellular GFP indicates that some of the precursor was processed to separate GFP from the ER retention signal. Partial processing also is apparent on the western blot, where two additional bands were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which we interpret as the precursor processed at the second SBT6.1 site (green asterisk), and the unprocessed precursor (black asterisk), respectively.</p><p>ER retention by the KDEL-motif is mediated by Golgi-resident K/HDEL-receptors, which effect retrograde transport of soluble ER proteins from the Golgi back to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelham, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phillipson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva-Alvim et al., 2018</xref>). Cleavage by SBT6.1 may thus occur either in the ER or in the Golgi. However, processing was abolished when anterograde ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport was inhibited by addition of brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nebenführ et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations indicate that exit from the ER is required for cleavage by SBT6.1, and we conclude that SBT6.1 acts in the Golgi, likely in an early Golgi compartment. This conclusion was confirmed by fusing the CLEL6 precursor to the N-terminal membrane anchor of ß−1,2-xylosyltransferase (XylT), which is sufficient to target reporter proteins to the <italic>medial</italic> Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pagny et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The same three cleavage products were observed as for the KDEL-tagged precursor at somewhat different ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) indicating that cleavage by SBT6.1 occurs before the precursor reaches the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network (TGN).</p><p>To assess the relevance of cleavage by SBT6.1 for processing and secretion, we masked both cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; RRLR and RRRAL) by alanine substitutions as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al.

The central band corresponding to the second cleavage site was lost for the Ala-substituted precursor confirming that SBT6.1 is responsible and necessary for this cleavage event. This may not be the case for the first cleavage event, as the corresponding band was still observed for the Ala-substituted precursor, suggesting that another protease may jump in when cleavage by SBT6.1 is prevented, or a different protease cleaves the mutant cleavage site. Interestingly, comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and I</xref>, we observed that secretion of the Ala-substituted precursor is reduced compared to the wild-type. For the Ala-substituted precursor, the GFP fluorescence signal was observed in both ER and Golgi in addition to the apoplastic space suggesting that cleavage by SBT6.1 may facilitate continued passage along the secretory pathway and, hence, additional post-translational modifications in post-Golgi compartments. This observation may explain why pre-processing by SBT6.1 is required for CLEL6 function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>), despite the fact that this cleavage event does not produce the mature peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by aspartate-dependent subtilase SBT3.8</title><p>After pre-processing of CLEL6 by SBT6.1 in the Golgi, additional processing at the N-terminus is required for maturation and activation. To localize this processing event subcellularly, we used an N-terminally sfGFP-tagged deletion construct of the CLEL6 precursor (Δ-Sec) lacking both SBT6.1 processing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Therefore, to test a possible involvement of SBT3.8 in the maturation of CLEL peptides, we expressed the enzyme with a C-terminal His tag and purified it from tobacco cell wall extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The activity of recombinant SBT3.8 was analyzed in comparison to a mock-purification from control plants using a synthetic, N-terminally extended CLEL6 peptide (eCLEL6) as substrate. eCLEL6 included seven precursor-derived amino acids in addition to the mature CLEL6 sequence. eCLEL6 was processed in a SBT3.8-dependent manner to produce the mature DYPQPHRKPPIHN peptide at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Consistent with the presence of two aspartate residues in the CLEL6 precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), two cleavage products were observed (marked by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), corresponding to cleavage after D71 (upper band) and D47 (lower band). The upper band was not observed for the D71A mutant, confirming that cleavage at this site is aspartate-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To further test whether processing by SBT3.8 at D71 is affected by sulfation of the neighboring tyrosine (Y72), we produced recombinant tyrosine-sulfated CLEL6 (sulfoCLEL6) in <italic>E. coli</italic> using an expanded genetic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, a CLEL6-(His)6 expression construct with an amber stop replacing the Y72 codon was co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with a suppressor tRNA recognizing the amber stop, and a matching aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase specific for sulfo-tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Co-translational incorporation of sulfo-tyrosine that was chemically synthesized and added to the growth medium resulted in the Y72-sulfated CLEL6-(His)6 precursor. If sulfo-tyrosine is not incorporated, translation terminates at the amber stop resulting in a truncated precursor lacking the C-terminal His-tag. The His-tag thus allowed for selective purification of the sulfated precursor, that was then tested as a substrate of SBT3.8. The tyrosine-sulfated CLEL6 precursor was cleaved by SBT3.8 in a time-dependent manner similar to the non-sulfated precursor, indicating that tyrosine sulfation does not affect SBT3.8-mediated aspartate-dependent processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared CLEL6 precursor processing in wild-type plants and in <italic>sbt3.8</italic> loss-of-function mutants. The recombinant CLEL6 precursor was cleaved efficiently by exudates prepared from wild-type plants, but not by <italic>sbt3.8</italic> exudates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data support a role for SBT3.8 in CLEL6 maturation in vivo. However, we did not observe any defect in the gravitropic response of the hypocotyl in <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutants, suggesting that there are other proteases acting redundantly with SBT3.8 in aspartate-dependent CLEL6 maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Maturation of the CLEL6 precursor in the secretory pathway.</title><p>As a first processing step, the signal peptide is cleaved off upon entry into the ER. After exit from the ER, the precursor is processed by SBT6.1 in the cis-Golgi at two S1P cleavage sites within its variable prodomain. Still in the Golgi, the peptide moiety is tyrosine-sulfated by TPST, and proline hydroxylated. Candidate proline-4-hydroxylases have been identified, but it is still unclear which of these enzymes is responsible for peptide modification. There is also circumstantial evidence for proline-4-hydroxylase activity in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stührwohldt et al., 2018</xref>).

The loss-of-function phenotype of EPI1a and EPI10-expressing transgenic plants was complemented by application of the mature CLEL6 and CLEL9 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), indicating that SBT activity is required upstream of the peptides, consistent with a role in peptide formation. SBT6.1 was previously shown to be necessary for CLEL6 function in a screen for <italic>sbt</italic> mutants suppressing the overexpression phenotype of the CLEL6 precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, two SBT6.1 cleavage sites were identified in the precursor, and the second site was found indispensable for CLEL6 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Addressing the sequence and subcellular sites of maturation events we show here that several consecutive processing steps are required for the biogenesis of CLEL peptides in Arabidopsis. Cleavage of CLEL precursors by SBT6.1 constitutes the first obligatory processing step in peptide maturation (not considering the co-translational cleavage of the signal peptide). However, the subcellular site of SBT6.1-mediated processing remained unresolved. We show here that SBT6.1 cleaves CLEL precursors soon after exit from the ER in an early Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the reported plasma-membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>) is irrelevant for the maturation of CLEL6 and 9.</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis of SBT6.1 cleavage sites impaired secretion of the CLEL precursors, as some of the signal got stuck in the ER and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,F</xref>). The variable pro-region of the precursor including the SBT6.1 cleavage sites is thus important for secretion. Similarly in the animal field, neurotrophins are synthesized as larger pro-proteins that need proteolytic processing to yield mature and biologically active neurotrophic factors, which play important roles in the development, maintenance and regeneration of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suter et al., 1991</xref>). For brain-derived and glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF, respectively) the cleavable prodomain was found to be required for post-Golgi trafficking. Sorting of BDNF and GDNF to secretory granules depends on sorting receptors of the Vps10p (vacuolar protein-sorting 10 protein) family, sortilin and sorLA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geng et al., 2011</xref>). Sortilin also facilitates prodomain-dependent export of hydrophobic conotoxins from the ER, by allowing them to escape ER quality control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conticello et al., 2003</xref>). Likewise, the prodomain of CLEL peptides may interact with unidentified sorting receptors to facilitate secretion or, alternatively, cleavage of the prodomain by SBT6.1 may provide a point of quality control, before the now partially processed precursor is allowed to leave the Golgi for final activation.</p><p>The requirement of SBT6.1-mediated processing for secretion provides an explanation for the perplexing finding that SBT6.1 cleavage sites and, by inference, cleavage by SBT6.1 are required for CLEL6 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghorbani et al., 2016</xref>), despite the fact that cleavage at these sites does not produce the active peptide. Additional processing is obviously required. We show here that this second obligatory cleavage event marking the N-termini of the mature CLEL6 and 9 peptides takes place in a post-Golgi compartment, i.e. in the TGN, in secretory vesicles, or ultimately in the apoplastic space. Our data suggest that cleavage by SBT6.1 allows for continued passage of partially processed (pre-activated) precursors through the secretory pathway, and thereby facilitates subsequent post-translational modifications in the Golgi (sulfation, proline hydroxylation) and post-Golgi compartments (proteolytic maturation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The second obligatory processing event and formation of the bioactive peptide hinged on the aspartate residue at the cleavage site (D71 for CLEL6 and D66 for CLEL9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). This processing step was inhibited by the SBT-specific inhibitor EPI10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that cleavage at the N-terminus of CLEL6 and 9 peptides also is mediated by SBT(s), particularly by Asp-dependent SBT(s). Here, we identified SBT3.8 as one of the enzymes that ultimately activate CLEL6 and CLEL9. Unlike SBT6.1 and 6.2, all other members of the plant SBT family are secretory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaller et al., 2018</xref>) that co-migrate with potential pro-peptide substrates through the secretory pathway towards the cell wall as their final destination, thus providing ample opportunity for interaction <italic>en route</italic>. Nonetheless, cleavage does not occur before the partially processed precursor leaves the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We see two possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First, the precursor may not be fit for cleavage, or second, the protease may not be active before exit from the Golgi.</p><p>The first scenario implies that post-translational modifications in earlier compartments are mandatory for subsequent SBT-mediated cleavage. Interestingly, tyrosin sulfation by TPST is known to depend on an adjacent aspartate residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komori et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, if the apparent aspartate-dependency of the N-terminal maturation step is only indirect, and the SBT responsible for this processing event rather needs sulfo-tyrosin for cleavage site recognition, post-translational modification by Golgi-resident TPST would be a prerequisite for SBT-mediated cleavage. However, this scenario is not supported by our data, since the CLEL6 precursor produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> was efficiently processed by SBT3.8, despite the lack of tyrosine sulfation. In fact, the sulfated und non-sulfated CLEL6 precursors were found to be cleaved similarly by SBT3.8, indicating that tyrosin-sulfation does not affect cleavage site recognition.</p><p>Alternatively, it may be the control of SBT activity rather than co-localization in the secretory pathway that determines the subcellular site of proteolytic pro-peptide activation. In general, SBT activity is controlled by the prodomain that acts as an intramolecular chaperone for folding, and as an inhibitor of the mature enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). SBT zymogens remain inactive until the prodomain is cleaved off auto-catalytically and subsequently released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cedzich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janzik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). Prodomain-mediated inhibition and latency of the zymogen are pH-dependent, and broken in a compartment-specific manner as the pH drops along the secretory pathway. In the well-studied case of furin, for example, the prodomain is released in a second autocatalytic cleavage event, which does not occur before the zymogen reaches the acidic environment of the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, SBT3 from tomato also requires the acidic pH of post-Golgi compartments for prodomain cleavage and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). These findings may explain why the second obligatory cleavage event by SBT3.8 and, possibly, additional redundant activities does not occur before peptide precursors exit the Golgi.</p><p>As an alternative to the pH-dependent release of the inhibitory prodomain, protease activity and cleavage site selectivity may be controlled by pH directly. Indeed, we did not observe cleavage of the N-terminally extended eCLEL6 peptide by SBT3.8 at neural pH, whereas mature CLEL6 was produced at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We conclude that processing of the CLEL6 precursor by SBT3.8 requires an acidic environment which is encountered only after exit from the Golgi. The extracellular localization of SBT3.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is fully consistent with precursor processing and release of mature CLEL peptides in post Golgi compartments including the apoplastic space.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>SBT3.8</italic></td><td>The ArabidopsisInformation Resource (TAIR)</td><td>At4g10540</td><td>amplified from genomic DNA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strainbackground (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21-RIL</td><td>Agilent</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strainbackground (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 pEVOL SYRS</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2009</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>sbt3.8</italic></td><td>Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center</td><td>SALK_052039</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>tpst-1</italic></td><td>Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center</td><td>SALK_009847</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>P<sub>CLEL6</sub>:EPI1a;

The D71A mutant was created by site-directed mutagenesis, confirmed by sequencing, and purified as above. For co-translational incorporation of sulfo-tyrosin, the Y72 codon of the proCLEL6 ORF in pETDuet1 was replaced with an amber stop (UAG) by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. The sulfoCLEL6 expression construct was transformed into electro-competent BL21 pEVOL SYRS carrying an amber suppressor t-RNA and a cognant sulfo-tyrosine specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).

Bacteria were grown on plates containing appropriate antibiotics (rifampicin, tetracycline and spectinomycin for C58C1 and gentamycin and spectinomycin for GV3101) at 28°C and were washed off the plates in 10 mM MES, pH 5.6 containing 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. A blunt syringe was used to infiltrate the bacterial suspension supplemented with 150 µM acetosyringone into the leaves. For total protein extraction, leaves were harvested two to three days after infiltration into liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder. The powder was thawed in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitor mix P (#39103, SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).

Apoplastic washes were harvested by centrifugation at 1100 x g. In order to obtain SBT3.8 in sufficient amounts and purity for assays, metal chelate affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The eluates were dialyzed against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 or 5.5, 10 mM NaCl and used for enzyme activity measurements. For the empty-vector control, apoplastic extracts from mock-infiltrated plants were subjected to the same purification scheme. To collect exudates from wild type plants and the <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutant, seedlings were grown in submerged culture in 0.5 x MS (Murashige-Skoog) medium with 1% sucrose for ten days as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohyama et al.

Reactions were performed at pH 5.5 and pH 7.0 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mM NaCl. 1.5 µl of the samples were mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization matrix (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) on the MALDI target, and mass spectra were recorded with a AutoflexIII mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in the reflector mode with external calibration (Peptide Calibration Standard II; Bruker Daltonics). Flex Analysis 3.0 was used for data analysis with a mass tolerance of 50 ppm for ions. Recombinant CLEL6 and the D71A mutant were digested with SBT3.8 in 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 5.5, 10 mM NaCl for the time indicated and separated by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hypocotyl bioassay with in vivo produced peptides</title><p>C-terminally sfGFP-tagged CLEL6/9 expression constructs were infiltrated into tobacco leaves.

Bioactive CLEL peptides must be processed from larger precursor proteins. In this work, the authors identify multiple cleavage steps occurring in consecutive compartments of the secretory pathway, and candidate subtilisin-like proteases, SBT6.1 and SBT3.8, required for these steps.

Certainly identification of the SBT capable of driving the next processing reaction would have made this work much more compelling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an engagingly written article about CLEL processing. The CLE-like family of peptides have been known for about 20 years; initially via genetics in Arabidopsis. There are many biological functions ascribed to this family, particularly during development-shoot meristems, root meristems, embryos all employ family members, and these proteins have also been found and studied in Maize, tomato, etc. The challenge of this family is that the active peptide are only 12 AA long and are processed and heavily modified. What I didn't appreciate until this manuscript was that, although many of the modification enzymes have been identified, the initial proteolytic processing is fairly uncharacterized. For a family as critical as this one, missing the first step is a big deal!</p><p>Subtilisin proteases (SBT) are found in all forms of life. In plants, there is a large family of SBTs, but most are extracellular. This manuscript focuses on SBT6.1, one of the few TM-domain forms, and one that is also thought to have emerged before the plant/animal split. SBT6.1 was recently shown to be required for activity of CLEL6 (Ghorbani, 2016). So, this manuscript must add something new. What's new is that they show where the first SBT6.1 processing takes place and, they tracked down a second processing step that need to take place in the Golgi and they found the residue in CLEL that is needed for this second step. They then do an assay that suggests another SBT (or something that can be inhibited by EPI, anyway) is needed later on, but don't know what it is.</p><p>The approach relies on several technical innovations, some of which I find very clever and others (though also clever) I am less convinced of the specificity of.</p><p>e.g., I like that they set up a transient cleavage assay (N. benthi) with GFP attached to the CLEL precursors + various tags in which they could monitor process through the secretory system with live cell imaging and also by Immunoblot against GFP to see where processing occurred.</p><p>I am a little worried about overexpression of a pathogen-derived EPI, in that its specificity isn't completely clear. I do like the genetic experiments of showing that EPIs driven with CLEL6 or CLEL9 promoters leads to a phenotype similar to loss of the CLEL6/9 peptides themselves, and can be suppressed by supplying synthesized, processed CLEL.</p><p>Strengths: This is well written and I am now convinced that it's important to understand the processing of the CLEL peptides and that the processing is going to be complicated. The assays are clever and the experiments appear to be done rigorously. The data are presented in a clear and straightforward manner in the figures.</p><p>Weaknesses: Relies on EPIs being highly specific (and also, highly effective). Biochemical assays are in a non-native system, although I recognize that it is likely not technically feasible to do the assays in Arabidopsis and they also include bioassays in Arabidopsis, so I am less concerned about this leading to completely artifactual results.</p><p>Although they demonstrated that it IS important for the peptides to be processed at the site they identified, is this a surprise based on previous work?</p><p>The manuscript does a nice job of demonstrating that a late Golgi SBT is likely to be involved, but then can't supply an answer as to which one it is, and I felt like there was no attempt to use other data sources (co-expression, for example) to narrow down the possibilities. All in all, I found this a bit too preliminary for an e<italic>Life</italic> paper.</p><p>The Discussion was quite long and speculative relative to the compact data section. It seems as if the authors are addressing some points of contention in the field, and I (as an outsider) don't come to the story with a particular bias that needs to be overcome. I will defer to others who are closer in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors studied biogenesis mechanisms of Arabidopsis CLEL6 and CLEL9 peptides by expressing their GFP fusion proteins using N. benthamiana transient expression system followed by Western blotting. Cumulative results suggested that SBT6.1-mediated cleavage within the variable domain is a prerequisite for continued passage through the secretory pathway and subsequent proteolytic maturation after exit from the Golgi. Furthermore, the authors proposed that the cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by an aspartate dependent subtilases.</p><p>Because the maturation mechanisms of plant peptide hormones is still poorly understood, the authors' efforts will contribute to expand our knowledge of the peptide hormone biogenesis. Indeed, their findings that cleavage within the variable domain is a prerequisite for continued passage through the secretory pathway and subsequent proteolytic maturation are interesting. However, some of the conclusions are not supported by the results, especially the assumed involvement of aspartate residue in the cleavage for final activation.</p><p>1) The authors concluded that aspartate-dependent processing is required for peptide activation of CLEL6 and CLEL9 based on a bioassay data using N. benthamiana leaf extracts transiently expressing GFP-CLEL6 and GFP-CLEL9 fusion proteins. This approach is, however, not quantitative and cannot exclude the possibility that structurally immature (larger or unmodified) peptide products are detected if present at high concentrations. Indeed, extracts from leaves expressing D-to-A mutants of CLEL6 and CLEL9 (that do not undergo proteolytic cleavage and posttranslational modification) still shows considerable activities (Figure 4A and B). Therefore, in addition to the bioassay experiments, mass spectroscopic analysis which can evaluate both actual structure and abundance of mature peptides is prerequisite to justify the conclusion.</p><p>2) Related to above points, there is no detailed explanation of methods for extraction of apoplastic peptides and bioassay. Explain in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) The authors used hypocotyl for bioassay in Figure 1, but used roots in Figure 4. This is confusing for readers. Use hypocotyl bioassay throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) In Figure 2B, it is better to indicate theoretical molecular sizes for each possible fragments. This information greatly helps understanding of SDS-PAGE bands shown in Figure 2C, E, and F. The same is true for Figure 3B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper is sufficiently well written. It provides incremental data about subsequent steps in the maturation of the plant secreted signal peptides CLEL6 and 9 (also known as RGF 6 and 9, or GLV 1 and 2, respectively, in Arabidopsis) and analyzes the subcellular compartments where proteolytic events take place. The work is overall sound, except for problems explained here below (and possibly the need for replicated experiments, depending on the feedback from the authors about the growth of roots treated with &quot;cell wall washes&quot;). But it has a narrow scope and shows some weakness in the interpretation of the results. The manuscript is worth publishing, but I do not feel that it is a major contribution to its field.</p><p>Subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by an aspartate-dependent SBT” fourth paragraph. Provided additional explanations are given (see below), I will trust that the experiments illustrated in Figure 4C to E show that CLEL extracts have an impact on root growth, and that there is a differential response between the wt and D&gt;A extracts. However, the explanation of the root growth referring to the &quot;waving phenotype&quot; is incorrect. On dense agar plates slanted backward, wild-type untreated roots &quot;wave&quot;, that is their normal growth pattern which is explained as a recurrent alternation between obstacle avoidance response and gravitropic response. In Whitford et al., 2012, CLEL peptides added to the medium do not induce waving, but they alter the waving pattern. In fact, the peptides induce &quot;coiling&quot; rather than waving: because of a reduction in gravitropism: roots often form complete loops as they grow away from the vertical.</p><p>In the experiments presented here, the control roots do not wave, but simply grow down (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The lack of waving may be due to the angle of the plate (vertical or even slanted forward), the composition of the medium, the concentration of the agar. What is reported in this manuscript is that treated roots do not follow as strictly the vertical direction compared to the controls, they meander… but they don't wave. If my interpretation is right, the text should be corrected by removing all references to &quot;waving&quot; and simply state that treated roots have a reduced gravitropic response.</p><p>Related to these experiments, the authors should address the following questions that are not covered in the Results or Materials and methods sections?</p><p>How were the roots grown (germination, medium, agar type and concentration, temperate(s) light and light cycles)? How exactly was the variable &quot;changes in root growth direction&quot; calculated? Can they mention other papers describing this method to measure gravitropism? How many independent primary roots were analyzed per treatment, in how many independent experiments and with how many independently prepared cell wall extracts? How where the apoplastic washes prepared? What does the expression &quot;treated with equal amount of these cell wall extracts&quot; exactly mean? There is not sufficient information in the manuscript about these experiments.</p><p>Is there not a contradiction to state that the variable pro-region of the precursor, containing the known SBT6.1 cleavage sites, is important for secretion and to show that a truncated version of the precursor NOT containing this pro-region is processed just fine (Figure 3C)? Furthermore, I understand that the authors assume [subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by an aspartate-dependent SBT”, first paragraph] that the two parts of a precursor protein stay in the same subcellular compartment(s) after proteolytic cleavage, as the presence of the GFP signal corresponding to the protein segment on the amino terminus is interpreted as indicating where the CLEL processed peptide (on the other side of the cleavage site) also resides (Figure 3D). Is this assumption warranted?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The biogenesis of CLEL peptides involves several processing events in consecutive compartments of the secretory pathway&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this manuscript, the authors show that several CLE-like peptides are processed several times, with early proteolytic cleavage within the pro-peptides variable domain is a prerequisite for continued passage through the secretory pathway and subsequent proteolytic maturation. The identification of candidate proteases for these two events was also shown.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issue is that the claim that SBT3.8 processes CLEL in vivo is not clearly supported by the available data. Although it is shown in this revised manuscript that SBT3.8 can cleave CLEL and that SBT3.8 is expressed, secreted and active at the right conditions, the key missing evidence is the absence of cleavage in the <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutant. The data also indicate that <italic>sbt3.8</italic> should have a gravitropic phenotype. The authors must provide evidence for these two to be able to conclude that SBT3.8 processes CLEL in vivo. The editor expects that these experiments would be performed; if the results are that there is still some cleavage of CLELs in the mutant and/or that there is no gravitropic phenotype, this will not rule out the paper being published, but it will require that the text and summary figures are modified to accurately convey the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55580.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Using the subtilase-specific EPI inhibitor, we had shown in the original manuscript that the protease responsible for the final processing step is a subtilase. We had also shown that this processing event depends on an aspartic acid residue at the cleavage site within the precursor, and that it occurs in a post Golgi compartment. However, we had not yet identified the proposed asp-dependent protease. In this revised manuscript we show that the missing protease is subtilase SBT3.8. SBT3.8 cleaves the recombinant precursor in an asp-dependent manner. Cleavage by SBT3.8 was further shown to be pH dependent. Cleavage was only observed at acidic pH, which is consistent with the proposed localization of this cleavage event late in the secretory pathway, in a post-Golgi compartment.</p><p>Senior editor (post-decision communication)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors have identified an SBT that they can show has the needed activity against a CLEL precursor and they can show, in vivo, where this enzyme is located (ideally in a stable Arabidopsis line since transient N. benthi localization has been shown to lead to artifacts), then I would be happy to reconsider this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that CLEL precursors are processed at the predicted site by SBT3.8, that cleavage depends on the critical aspartate residue at the cleavage site, and that cleavage by SBT3.8 only occurs at acidic pH as it is found in late compartments of the secretory pathway including the cell wall.

EPI1 is a two domain inhibitor, consisting of one typical (EPI1b) and one atypical (EPI1a) Kazal inhibitor domain. EPI10 comprises three domains, two typical and one atypical Kazal domain. Tian et al. (doi:10.1186/1471-2091-6-15) reported that the so-called ‘atypical Kazal domain’ of EPI1 and EPI10 is highly specific for subtilases, while the ‘typical’ Kazal domains show less specificity and may also inhibit other proteases. This is why we used EPI1a (i.e. the subtilase-specific atypical domain of EPI1) in addition to EPI10 in our experiments. The same phenotype (reduced gravitropic response of the hypocotyl in EPI expressing transgenics) was observed for both inhibitors. Because of the specificity reported for EPI1a, we conclude that the phenotype is caused by the inhibition of subtilase activity. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer. We cannot formally exclude the possibility that EPI1a may exert some additional, unknown effects in plants. On the other hand, with the identification of SBT3.8 as the final processing protease, we confirm the predicted involvement of subtilase(s).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do like the genetic experiments of showing that EPIs driven with CLEL6 or CLEL9 promoters leads to a phenotype similar to loss of the CLEL6/9 peptides themselves, and can be suppressed by supplying synthesized, processed CLEL.</p><p>Strengths: This is well written and I am now convinced that it's important to understand the processing of the CLEL peptides and that the processing is going to be complicated.

This is certainly true. We cannot expect to see an effect, unless the activity of endogenous subtilases is sufficiently inhibited. Therefore, expression level and binding affinity of the EPIs must be high enough to inhibit potentially redundant subtilases that are present in the respective tissue. In a previous study, we had analyzed the Kd of inhibitor binding to a plant subtilase (SBT4.13) and found it to be in the low nM range (23 nM for EPI1a, 13 nM for EPI10). For two other subtilases (SBT4.12 and SBT5.2) half-maximal inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) by EPI1a was observed at 0.8 and 6.4 nM, respectively (doi:10.1126/science.aai8550). Because of the low-nM binding/inhibition of different plant subtilases, we considered the EPIs suitable for targeting subtilase activity in vivo. The phenotype we observe for EPI1a and EPI10 over-expressors (reduced gravitropic response of the hypocotyl in the present study, a phenocopy of the abscission defect of the ida mutant in Schardon et al., 2016) suggests that concentration/affinity of the EPIs was in fact high enough to exert an effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biochemical assays are in a non-native system, although I recognize that it is likely not technically feasible to do the assays in Arabidopsis and they also include bioassays in Arabidopsis, so I am less concerned about this leading to completely artifactual results.</p><p>Although they demonstrated that it IS important for the peptides to be processed at the site they identified, is this a surprise based on previous work?</p></disp-quote><p>For SBT3.8, we now also include in vitro assays using purified recombinant enzyme (SBT3.8) and substrate (the CLEL6 precursor), as well as synthetic peptide substrates. With respect to cleavage by SBT6.1 you are absolutely right; previous work had shown that SBT6.1 is required for CLEL6 function (CLEL9 was not addressed in this study). Therefore, it was not surprising to us to see that cleavage by SBT6.1 at the predicted site is important. What is new here is not the fact that SBT6.1 is important, but why it is important. SBT6.1 does not generate the bioactive peptide; it is important because cleavage by SBT6.1 is necessary for continued passage through the secretory pathway. Therefore, all subsequent maturation events in consecutive compartments of the secretory pathway depend on the initial cleavage by SBT6.1. Other novel aspects include the characterization of the subsequent N-terminal processing event, its localization and cleavage specificity, and the identification of the protease responsible for it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript does a nice job of demonstrating that a late Golgi SBT is likely to be involved, but then can't supply an answer as to which one it is, and I felt like there was no attempt to use other data sources (co-expression, for example) to narrow down the possibilities. All in all, I found this a bit too preliminary for an eLife paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this point – we should have addressed the identity of the SBT predicted to contribute to peptide maturation late in the secretory pathway. We followed your suggestion and used expression data to narrow down on the identity of the SBT responsible for N-terminal processing in the late Golgi. We reasoned that SBTs that are involved in the production of bioactive CLEL peptides might be upregulated in mutants that are deficient in such peptides. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of all 56 Arabidopsis SBTs in hypocotyls of the <italic>tpst</italic> mutant, which cannot produce sulfated peptides including CLEL6 and 9. Four SBTs were found to be upregulated, including SBT3.8. Further analysis showed that SBT3.8 is able to cleave the precursor at the predicted site in an aspartate-dependent manner (please see our response to the editor for further details on this point). With these data included, the story is much more complete and we hope that you will not consider it preliminary anymore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion was quite long and speculative relative to the compact data section. It seems as if the authors are addressing some points of contention in the field, and I (as an outsider) don't come to the story with a particular bias that needs to be overcome. I will defer to others who are closer in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to be more concise in the Discussion; parts which may have been distracting to readers not directly involved in the field have been removed (about 300 words).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Because the maturation mechanisms of plant peptide hormones is still poorly understood, the authors' efforts will contribute to expand our knowledge of the peptide hormone biogenesis. Indeed, their findings that cleavage within the variable domain is a prerequisite for continued passage through the secretory pathway and subsequent proteolytic maturation are interesting. However, some of the conclusions are not supported by the results, especially the assumed involvement of aspartate residue in the cleavage for final activation.</p><p>1) The authors concluded that aspartate-dependent processing is required for peptide activation of CLEL6 and CLEL9 based on a bioassay data using N. benthamiana leaf extracts transiently expressing GFP-CLEL6 and GFP-CLEL9 fusion proteins. This approach is, however, not quantitative and cannot exclude the possibility that structurally immature (larger or unmodified) peptide products are detected if present at high concentrations. Indeed, extracts from leaves expressing D-to-A mutants of CLEL6 and CLEL9 (that do not undergo proteolytic cleavage and posttranslational modification) still shows considerable activities (Figure 4A and B).</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated this experiment using the hypocotyl bioassay (see also point 3). The effect of the D-to-A substitution was stronger in this experiment. No bioactivity was observed for the D-to-A substituted CLEL6 precursor, and that of the CLEL9 precursor was much reduced. Nevertheless, we agree with your point. There is some residual activity (at least for CLEL9) and, therefore, the aspartate is not absolutely required for bioactivity. For processing on the other hand, the aspartate is essential. SBT3.8 was found to cleave recombinant CLEL6 and a synthetic, N-terminally extended CLEL6 peptide that included 7 precursor-derived amino acids (Figure 5). Substitution of Asp by Ala abolished processing of the recombinant precursor.</p><p>As you suggested, the residual activity observed for the CLEL9 precursor in the bioassay may very well be due to immature (longer or unmodified) peptides, that retain some (probably reduced) receptor binding activity. We thus agree in that the aspartate, while required for processing by SBT3.8, is only important but not absolutely required for bioactivity. In our revisions, we paid attention not to overstate our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, in addition to the bioassay experiments, mass spectroscopic analysis which can evaluate both actual structure and abundance of mature peptides is prerequisite to justify the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to do this but, unfortunately, failed. We were unable to detect the fully processed and post-translationally modified CLEL6 or CLEL9 peptides in cell wall extracts by mass spectrometry. In fact, this is why we developed the bioassay as a tool for the detection of the bioactive peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to above points, there is no detailed explanation of methods for extraction of apoplastic peptides and bioassay.

In the revised manuscript, we added some more detail in the figure legend, and the full procedure in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors used hypocotyl for bioassay in Figure 1, but used roots in Figure 4. This is confusing for readers. Use hypocotyl bioassay throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that the use of two different bioassays may cause some confusion. Therefore, we repeated the experiment shown in Figure 4 using the hypocotyl bioassay. The result is fully consistent with the previous root bioassay; in fact it is even more clear. The D-to-A substitution abolished bioactivity for the CLEL6 precursor; only for the D-to-A mutant of CLEL9 precursor, some residual activity was observed (please also see our response to point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2B, it is better to indicate theoretical molecular sizes for each possible fragments. This information greatly helps understanding of SDS-PAGE bands shown in Figure 2C, E, and F. The same is true for Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. This point was also raised by reviewer #3, who requested to indicate more clearly what forms in Figure 2A correspond to the bands in Figure 2C, E and F. We tried different ways of how to help readers to interpret the SDS-PAGE bands and came up with the following solution. Rather than indicating the theoretical masses, we added a scheme to panel A of Figures 2 and 3, showing each of the possible fragments in a different color. Asterisks of the same color are used to mark the SDS-PAGE bands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper is sufficiently well written. It provides incremental data about subsequent steps in the maturation of the plant secreted signal peptides CLEL6 and 9 (also known as RGF 6 and 9, or GLV 1 and 2, respectively, in Arabidopsis) and analyzes the subcellular compartments where proteolytic events take place. The work is overall sound, except for problems explained here below (and possibly the need for replicated experiments, depending on the feedback from the authors about the growth of roots treated with &quot;cell wall washes&quot;). But it has a narrow scope and shows some weakness in the interpretation of the results. The manuscript is worth publishing, but I do not feel that it is a major contribution to its field.</p></disp-quote><p>By adding the identification and characterization of SBT3.8 as the protease responsible for aspartate- and pH-dependent processing at the N–terminus of CLEL peptides we extended the scope considerably. Considering the limited knowledge we have about the proteases and factors that govern proteolytic maturation of peptide hormones, we feel that our study now makes an important contribution to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by an aspartate-dependent SBT” fourth paragraph. Provided additional explanations are given (see below), I will trust that the experiments illustrated in Figure 4C to E show that CLEL extracts have an impact on root growth, and that there is a differential response between the wt and D&gt;A extracts. However, the explanation of the root growth referring to the &quot;waving phenotype&quot; is incorrect. On dense agar plates slanted backward, wild-type untreated roots &quot;wave&quot;, that is their normal growth pattern which is explained as a recurrent alternation between obstacle avoidance response and gravitropic response. In Whitford et al., 2012, CLEL peptides added to the medium do not induce waving, but they alter the waving pattern. In fact, the peptides induce &quot;coiling&quot; rather than waving: because of a reduction in gravitropism: roots often form complete loops as they grow away from the vertical.</p><p>In the experiments presented here, the control roots do not wave, but simply grow down (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The lack of waving may be due to the angle of the plate (vertical or even slanted forward), the composition of the medium, the concentration of the agar. What is reported in this manuscript is that treated roots do not follow as strictly the vertical direction compared to the controls, they meander… but they don't wave. If my interpretation is right, the text should be corrected by removing all references to &quot;waving&quot; and simply state that treated roots have a reduced gravitropic response.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this interpretation. Since ‘waving’ is the normal behavior of wild type roots, we cannot refer to the difference between roots treated with wt and D&gt;A extracts as the ‘waving phenotype’. The suggested wording that ‘treated roots show a reduced gravitropic response’ is much more appropriate. Thank you for this suggestion. However, on request of reviewer #2, we replaced the root growth bioassay by a hypocotyl bioassay in the revised manuscript. Therefore, the changes to the subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by aspartate dependent subtilase SBT3.8” and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 legend, are now obsolete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to these experiments, the authors should address the following questions that are not covered in the Results or Materials and methods sections?</p><p>How were the roots grown (germination, medium, agar type and concentration, temperate(s) light and light cycles)? How exactly was the variable &quot;changes in root growth direction&quot; calculated? Can they mention other papers describing this method to measure gravitropism? How many independent primary roots were analyzed per treatment, in how many independent experiments and with how many independently prepared cell wall extracts?</p></disp-quote><p>Some of the points raised here (those directly related to the root growth bioassay) are obsolete (see point above). The hypocotyl bioassay was performed in three independent experiments using independent cell wall extracts. The data shown in Figure 4 are the representative result of one of these experiments. This information was included in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How where the apoplastic washes prepared? What does the expression &quot;treated with equal amount of these cell wall extracts&quot; exactly mean?</p></disp-quote><p>The CLEL precursors and D-to-A mutants were expressed as GFP fusion proteins. Therefore, we used GFP fluorescence to quantify expression levels. ‘equal amounts of cell wall extracts’ referred to equal amounts of GFP fluorescence as a measure of protein expression. We agree that this statement is unclear; it was rephrased in the revised manuscript (subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by aspartate-dependent subtilase SBT3.8”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is not sufficient information in the manuscript about these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission. In the revised manuscript, we added some more detail in the figure legend, and the full procedure in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there not a contradiction to state that the variable pro-region of the precursor, containing the known SBT6.1 cleavage sites, is important for secretion and to show that a truncated version of the precursor NOT containing this pro-region is processed just fine (Figure 3C)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good observation. The fact that the truncated precursor lacking most of the prodomain is efficiently processed (Figure 3C) does indeed suggest that it is a minor fraction that is retained intracellularly (Figure 3D). The effect caused by mutation of the SBT6.1 cleavage sites is clearly more pronounced, as both secretion and processing are affected. We therefore toned down the relevance of the prodomain as compared to cleavage by SBT6.1 for secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, I understand that the authors assume [subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by an aspartate-dependent SBT”, first paragraph] that the two parts of a precursor protein stay in the same subcellular compartment(s) after proteolytic cleavage, as the presence of the GFP signal corresponding to the protein segment on the amino terminus is interpreted as indicating where the CLEL processed peptide (on the other side of the cleavage site) also resides (Figure 3D). Is this assumption warranted?</p></disp-quote><p>In this example (the Δ-Sec construct), most of the GFP signal is extracellular (Figure 3D), and most of the precursor is processed (Figure 3C). Therefore, in this particular case, the two parts of the precursor are expected to be in the same compartment (the cell wall). However, we do not assume that this is generally the case. For the KDEL or XylT-tagged precursors, for example, GFP fluorescence indicates that the N-terminal part of the protein is retained in the ER or Golgi, respectively. Cleavage of these precursors would separate the C-terminus from the retention signals and, therefore, any cleavage product would be expected to continue along the secretory pathway, potentially ending up in the cell wall.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issue is that the claim that SBT3.8 processes CLEL in vivo is not clearly supported by the available data. Although it is shown in this revised manuscript that SBT3.8 can cleave CLEL and that SBT3.8 is expressed, secreted and active at the right conditions, the key missing evidence is the absence of cleavage in the sbt3.8 mutant. The data also indicate that sbt3.8 should have a gravitropic phenotype. The authors must provide evidence for these two to be able to conclude that SBT3.8 processes CLEL in vivo. The editor expects that these experiments would be performed; if the results are that there is still some cleavage of CLELs in the mutant and/or that there is no gravitropic phenotype, this will not rule out the paper being published, but it will require that the text and summary figures are modified to accurately convey the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared CLEL6 precursor processing in wild type and the <italic>sbt3.</italic>8 loss-of-function mutant. Since we have no way of analyzing the processing of endogenous peptide precursors in planta, we prepared cell wall exudates of wild type plants and <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutants. Wild-type exudates efficiently cleaved the CLEL6 precursor, <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutant exudates did not. CLEL6 precursor cleavage thus depends on SBT3.8 under these conditions. The data were added as Figure 5—figure supplement 2B. In order not to overstate our results, we write in the text:’ these data support a role for CLEL6 maturation in vivo’ (subsection “The cleavage for final activation occurs in a post-Golgi compartment by aspartate dependent subtilase SBT3.8”, last paragraph). We do not claim that SBT3.8 is the only protease capable of CLEL6 precursor processing. In fact, evidence shows that there must be redundant activities: the gravitropic response of the hypocotyl turned out to be unaffected in the <italic>sbt3.8</italic> mutant (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). Therefore, to acknowledge the presence of redundant activities, we changed the wording in the Abstract and Discussion. Also, we revised the model in Figure 6, including ‘other D-dependent subtilases’ in addition to SBT3.8, for the final processing event.</p></body></sub-article></article>
