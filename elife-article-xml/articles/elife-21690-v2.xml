unclear. We demonstrate that to permit long-term survival in response to sudden glucose depletion, yeast cells activate lipid-droplet (LD) consumption through micro-lipophagy (µ-lipophagy), in which fat is metabolized as an alternative energy source. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation triggered this pathway, which required Atg14p. More gradual glucose starvation, amino acid deprivation or rapamycin did not trigger µ-lipophagy and failed to provide the needed substitute energy source for long-term survival. During acute glucose restriction, activated AMPK was stabilized from degradation and interacted with Atg14p. This prompted Atg14p redistribution from ER exit sites onto liquid-ordered vacuole membrane domains, initiating µ-lipophagy. Our findings that activated AMPK and Atg14p are required to orchestrate µ-lipophagy for energy production in starved cells is relevant for studies on aging and evolutionary survival strategies of different organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21690.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21690.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microautophagy</kwd><kwd>vacuole-membrane domains</kwd><kwd>ATG14</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>lipid-droplets</kwd><kwd>starvation-induced lifespan extension</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lippincott-Schwartz</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lippincott-Schwartz</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larabell</surname><given-names>Carolyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-5CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larabell</surname><given-names>Carolyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon AMPK activation by acute glucose restriction, Atg14p shifts its distribution from ER exit sites to liquid-ordered membrane domains on the vacuolar surface where, together with Atg6p, it facilitates LD-specific autophagy (i.e., microautophagy of lipid droplets) for energy production and long-term survival of starved cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introducton</title><p>Nutrient-depleted cells can only persist long-term by initiating a two-pronged survival response: they need to be able to recycle cytoplasmic components and they need a source of energy available from within the cell. The first is achieved through self-digestion involving bulk autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yen and Klionsky, 2008</xref>), and the second requires a shift to metabolizing lipids for ATP production given the unavailability of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardie and Carling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zechner et al., 2012</xref>). Unless both responses are triggered, cell and organismal survival are jeopardized.</p><p>How bulk autophagy and lipid consumption pathways are coordinated to permit long-term survival in starved cells represents a fundamental and challenging question. Its answer is particularly relevant to aging research as caloric restriction and enhanced lifespan in various organisms are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantó and Auwerx, 2011</xref>). But not all caloric restriction programs have the same beneficial effects on organismal health and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greer and Brunet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). For example, yeast cells starved by different nutrient regimes either die quickly or live long-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2009</xref>); mice strains with differing sensitivities to different nutrients show variable responses to caloric restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2010</xref>); and non-human primates exhibit short or long lifespans on different starvation diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colman et al., 2014</xref>). These results raise the possibility that cells mount distinct survival responses depending on the starvation condition, with only some regimens activating both lipid catabolism and autophagy, which are necessary for long-term survival.</p><p>In this study, we use imaging and functional analysis approaches to investigate the conditions, and signaling and organellar systems, that trigger bulk autophagy and lipid consumption pathways to permit long-term survival under starvation. Using the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as our model system, we demonstrate that to initiate and sustain bulk autophagy and lipid droplet (LD) breakdown pathways together, starved cells need to sense an acute reduction in glucose levels. Cells undergoing gradual glucose reduction or mere amino acid starvation, by contrast, only induce bulk autophagy without initiating LD consumption, and do not survive long-term. We further show that LD consumption in cells undergoing acute glucose starvation occurs by the process of micro-autophagy of LDs (i.e. µ-lipophagy), which is dependent on AMPK activation and core autophagic machinery. Atg14p plays a particularly important role in this process. It shifts its distribution from ER exit sites (ERES) to liquid-ordered membrane domains on the vacuolar surface in response to AMPK activation where, together with Atg6p, it facilitates vacuole docking and internalization of LDs. Cells that cannot activate AMPK or that lack Atg14p or Atg6p do not deliver LDs into the vacuole for degradation and fail to thrive under acute glucose starvation. These findings highlight the importance of µ-lipophagy and its regulation for understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying lifespan extension under calorie restriction and show a fundamental plasticity in the regulation and function of core autophagy components in response to different metabolic or stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cellular responses associated with prolonged lifespan under acute glucose restriction</title><p>Prior work in budding yeast has shown that different regimens of depleting glucose during starvation lead to dramatically different cellular lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, cells growing in synthetic minimal (SD) media (containing a restricted set of amino acids) with 2% glucose that are shifted into 0.4% glucose with no nutrient replenishment (i.e. acute glucose restriction, Acute GR) survive significantly longer than those placed in similar media containing 2% glucose (i.e. gradual glucose restriction, Gradual GR), even though a majority of nutrients become completely depleted within 1 day under both conditions. This surprising effect is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, with ~99.9% of cells starved by gradual GR dying within 9 days and nearly all cells starved by acute GR still alive after 25 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Prior to glucose restriction, cells had very low oxygen consumption rates due to the cell’s reliance on glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otterstedt et al., 2004</xref>). By day 1 of GR, acutely-restricted cells had amplified their oxygen consumption rates to 2.2X that of gradually restricted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thereafter, acutely restricted cells maintained this higher respiratory rate, whereas gradually restricted cells exhibited a negligible oxygen consumption rate by day 3.</p><p>We also investigated the effect of oxidative stress on long-term cell viability under acute or gradual GR. Only cells undergoing acute GR remained viable after exposure to different oxidative stressors (i.e. hydrogen peroxide and menadione) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with their viability resembling that of cells undergoing acute GR without stressors. Examining mitochondria morphology next, we observed that cells undergoing acute GR for 3 days had highly fused and elaborate mitochondria, whereas those undergoing gradual GR had exceedingly fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Cells undergoing acute GR thus appear to have greater respiratory rates, increased stress resistance, and more highly fused mitochondria than cells undergoing gradual GR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Relationship between LDs and the vacuole under acute GR</title><p>A crucial way that cells alleviate metabolic demands during glucose deprivation is to form and consume LDs, whose fatty acid products fuel mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>). In studying this response, we found that cells genetically modified so they could not form LDs died quickly under glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Velázquez et al., 2016</xref>]). Moreover, cells without vacuolar lipases had reduced survival rates under GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>]). These results suggested that metabolic reprogramming for long-term survival under glucose starvation requires the activities of LDs and the vacuole.</p><p>To visualize LDs and the vacuole under glucose starvation, we employed soft X-ray tomography (SXT). This technique gives a full 3D tomographic view of cryo-immobilized cells at 50 nm resolution, with no chemical fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larabell and Nugent, 2010</xref>). Organelles are distinguishable based on the extent they absorb X-rays, with carbon-rich organelles (such as LDs) absorbing more X-rays and generating higher contrast than fluid-filled organelles, such as the yeast vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In non-starved cells imaged using SXT, LDs (appearing as black spherical structures) were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, with none appearing within the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Non-starvation). A similar cytoplasmic location was observed for LDs in cells undergoing gradual GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, Gradual GR). By contrast, in cells starved by acute GR, LDs were observed in both the cytoplasm and vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, Acute GR); those in the vacuole appeared to have been engulfed as whole droplets. Quantification of the images revealed that approximately 60% of cells starved by acute GR contained vacuole-localized LDs compared to only ~10% of cells starved by gradual GR and none of non-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggested that under acute GR cells quickly activate a cellular response pathway involving LD delivery into the vacuole, where LDs are digested to fuel mitochondrial OXPHOS.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21690-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21690.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A representative SXT movie of yeast cells under gradual GR.</title><p>SXT images of cells grown under gradual GR for 1.5 days were processed and segmented to show individual organelle morphologies (LDs: green; nucleus: purple; vacuole: pale yellow; mitochondria: gold).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21690.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21690.005</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21690-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21690.006</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>A representative SXT movie of yeast cells under acute GR.</title><p>SXT images of cells grown under acute GR for 1.5 days were processed and segmented to show individual organelle morphologies (LDs: green; nucleus: purple; vacuole: pale yellow; mitochondria: gold).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21690.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21690.006</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Vacuole uptake of LDs under acute GR occurs by µ-lipophagy</title><p>LD delivery to and degradation in the vacuole could occur either by an autophagy -dependent or -independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

Under acute GR, phosphorylated Snf1p levels measurably increased after 18 hr and were maintained thereafter. Under gradual GR, by contrast, significant levels of phosphorylated Snf1p were present at 18 hr, but the levels fell thereafter, becoming very low by 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

This indicated rapamycin treatment antagonizes AMPK activity. As µ-lipophagy depends on AMPK activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Acute GR), this could explain why rapamycin treatment decreases µ-lipophagy under acute GR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effect of rapamycin treatment on cell survival under acute or gradual GR.

The shortened lifespan of <italic>atg14Δ</italic> cells under acute GR was similar to that seen for <italic>atg1Δ</italic>, <italic>atg5Δ</italic>, and <italic>atg23Δ</italic> cells, which lack core general autophagy machinery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3A</xref>).

Under no GR or gradual GR, Atg14p was localized solely within the cytoplasm in a dispersed and/or punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The punctate structures co-localized with Sec13p (a subunit of the COPII vesicle coat mediating ER-to-Golgi transport) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), supporting prior work implicating Atg14p in the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures at ER exit sites (ERES) under nitrogen starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graef et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to this distribution, Atg14p in cells undergoing acute GR became highly enriched on the vacuole surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Notably, Atg14p failed to redistribute onto the vacuole surface and remained at ERES in <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells undergoing acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), in which AMPK is absent and µ-lipophagy is inhibited. Re-introduction of Snf1p-HA into <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells under acute GR led to Atg14p re-localizing onto the vacuole surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), and reversed the growth defects seen in these cells under glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggested that under acute GR, Atg14p redistributes in an AMPK-dependent manner from ERES to vacuolar membranes where it helps to induce µ-lipophagy. Atg14p appeared to function downstream of AMPK in this pathway because <italic>atg14Δ</italic> cells did not prevent AMPK (i.e. Snf1p) from being phosphorylated under acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), whereas <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells prevented Atg14p from re-localizing onto the vacuole (see above).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21690.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Atg14p is enriched on the vacuole surface upon AMPK activation during acute GR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT and <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells harboring Atg14-3×GFP were grown under no GR, gradual GR, or acute GR for ~24 hr with or without Snf1p-HA.

Little or no L<sub>o</sub> domains were observed in either <italic>atg14Δ</italic> or <italic>atg6Δ</italic> cells under acute or gradual GR, with the effect most potent in <italic>atg6Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). Given that Atg6p resides on the vacuole membrane irrespective of the starvation condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), the results suggested Atg14p triggers large-scale L<sub>o</sub> formation under acute GR, with a critical supportive role played by Atg6p. Consistent with this, fewer large-scale L<sub>o</sub> domains formed in <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells under acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>), a condition where Atg6p resides on the vacuole surface but Atg14p is not recruited there (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A key nutrient in the cell’s decision whether or not to proliferate is glucose. In its presence, cells grow/divide; in its absence, cells instead switch on catabolic pathways (e.g. autophagy and fatty acid breakdown) and OXPHOS, which allow long-term survival until glucose becomes available again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Granot and Snyder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Werner-Washburne et al., 1996</xref>). The underlying mechanism(s) for this response, including the relevant signaling and organellar systems, is unclear yet it is fundamental for understanding cell behavior under various physiological conditions. Here, we used budding yeast as a model system to study this survival response, focusing on the key players and pathways. We found that for cells to survive long-term under full nutrient starvation, they need AMPK/Snf1p, the cell’s major ATP sensor, to be activated and stabilized. This occurred when cells sensed an acute depletion of glucose at the beginning of starvation (i.e. acute GR). This induced the pathways for µ-lipophagy, general autophagy, OXPHOS and stress resistance necessary for long-term survival. In contrast, all these pathways were attenuated and cellular lifespan shortened in cells lacking AMPK activity (i.e. <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells). The finding that AMPK acts as a critical upstream regulator of yeast cell survival under starvation supports prior work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> similarly implicating AMPK’s role in lifespan extension under dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Other nutrient depletion conditions besides acute GR, including rapamycin treatment or gradual GR, did not maintain AMPK activity once it was switched on, and resulted in shortened cellular lifespans. We speculate this effect arose because TOR is inhibited early on by these treatments: this would induce bulk autophagy and cause a surplus in amino acids, raising ATP levels to antagonize AMPK activity. While rapamycin treatment directly inhibits TOR, gradual GR would do so by causing cells to sense amino acid depletion before glucose reduction from the medium, leading to TOR inhibition and its prevention of AMPK activation. This can explain why no sustained AMPK activation or enhanced longevity occurred under gradual GR, even in cells lacking Reg1p (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates Snf1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonawitz et al., 2007</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Further work is needed to understand at the molecular level how TOR inhibition antagonizes AMPK activation under gradual GR. However, prior work has demonstrated that mTOR inhibition activates overall protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), and we found that both rapamycin and gradual GR treatments caused proteasomal degradation of AMPK (in contrast to acute GR treatment, which resulted in long-term AMPK activation).</p><p>A key survival promoting role of AMPK under acute GR that we observed was the induction of µ-lipophagy, which by causing LDs to be digested provides precursors for mitochondrial energy production in the absence of glucose. In support of this role, cells undergoing acute GR with genes deleted for AMPK (i.e. <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells) showed diminished LD consumption rates - comparable to those of cells undergoing gradual GR (where AMPK activation is not maintained). The conclusion that LD consumption in cells undergoing acute GR occurred by µ-lipophagy arose from two observations. First, LD consumption was autophagy-dependent; deletion of core autophagy genes blocked it (and caused diminished cell lifespan). Second, LDs were directly taken up into the vacuole, as interpreted from our results using SXT and AIRY-scan imaging and prior work using transmission EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vevea et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine what autophagic component(s) are essential for initiating µ-lipophagy under acute GR, we screened a yeast library of known autophagy genes. Under acute GR, <italic>ATG14</italic> was at the same time necessary for µ-lipophagy and unnecessary for general autophagy. No other gene had these characteristics, pointing to Atg14p (a subunit of the PI3K complex I) as a major component necessary for µ-lipophagy under acute GR. That said, <italic>ATG14</italic> was required for general autophagy under nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kametaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, there appears to be a fundamental plasticity in the regulation and function of core autophagy components under different starvation conditions- with Atg14p directing bulk autophagy under TOR inhibition, but driving µ-lipophagy under AMPK activation (i.e. acute GR).</p><p>To understand how Atg14p could be modulated to control different autophagy pathways, we examined its subcellular localization upon induction of different autophagic pathways. Under gradual GR or rapamycin treatment (where TOR is inhibited and bulk autophagy induced), Atg14p was enriched on punctate elements in the periphery of cells. These structures represented ERES, whose elements have previously been shown to recruit Atg14p in an early step in autophagosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graef et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, during acute GR (where AMPK is active and µ-lipophagy is induced), Atg14p became enriched on the vacuole membrane, localizing to L<sub>o</sub> domains defined by lack of vacuolar Vph1p labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toulmay and Prinz, 2013</xref>). Inhibiting TOR through rapamycin treatment during acute GR caused Atg14p to redistribute back to ERES, and also led to blocking of µ-lipophagy. Thus, Atg14p shifts its distribution under different starvation regimens to facilitate different autophagic pathways.</p><p>What causes Atg14p’s redistribution from ERES/cytosol onto the vacuolar surface upon acute GR remains unclear but could be related to the physical interaction between Snf1p and Atg14p that we observed arising under these conditions. This interaction could help stabilize Snf1p against proteasomal degradation (occurring when TOR is inactivated or under glucose-rich conditions) and may signal Atg14p’s redistribution from ERES onto the vacuole.</p><p>Atg14p’s role on the vacuole surface is likely related to the formation of large L<sub>o</sub> domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which are proposed to function as entry portals for LD uptake into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We observed that LDs dock exclusively at L<sub>o</sub> domains on the vacuole surface. That Atg14p helps stabilize/form these large L<sub>o</sub> domains is supported by our findings that: (1) Atg14p localizes on the rims of these domains, (2) deletion of Atg14p abolishes the domains, and (3) conditions that prevent Atg14p from redistributing onto the vacuole (including deletion of <italic>SNF1</italic>, rapamycin treatment, or gradual GR) diminishes the L<sub>o</sub> domains and results in no LD uptake into the vacuole.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21690.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for AMPK-Atg14p-dependent L<sub>o</sub> domain formation on the vacuole and its role in μ-lipophagy during acute GR.</title><p>In cells undergoing acute GR, LDs and the vacuole coordinate to mediate μ-lipophagy. This response involves AMPK/Snf1p activation and Atg14p redistribution to liquid-ordered membrane (L<sub>o</sub>) domains on the vacuole surface. Atg14p in cells starved by gradual GR, where AMPK is inactive, does not associate with the vacuole, and instead resides at ER exit sites (ERES). Under acute GR, vacuole-associated Atg14p preferentially resides on the edges of L<sub>o</sub> domains and drives large-scale L<sub>o</sub> domain formation in concert with Atg6p. The enlarged L<sub>o</sub> domains now serve as LD recruitment sites, with LDs moving to the vacuole from the perinuclear ER area. LDs on the L<sub>o</sub> domain then bud into the vacuolar lumen and undergo degradation to recycle stored fat molecules, resulting in the extension of lifespan of starved cells during acute GR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21690.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21690.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21690-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>In examining the subcellular distribution of other autophagy-related PI3K complex I components (including Atg6p, Atg38p, Vps15p, Vps34p and Vps38p), we found that only Atg6p resides on the vacuole surface with Atg14p under acute GR conditions. Atg6p interacts with Atg14p to form a PI3K complex involved in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>), so we studied Atg6p’s distribution under different starvation conditions. Unlike Atg14p, Atg6p resided on the vacuole whether cells were fed or starved. Under acute GR, when large L<sub>o</sub> domains formed, Atg6p localized within these large domains. Deletion of <italic>ATG6</italic> prevented any L<sub>o</sub> domain formation under acute GR. This suggested Atg6p works in conjunction with Atg14p to generate the large L<sub>o</sub> domains, with Atg14p crucial for triggering L<sub>o</sub> domain formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Exactly how Atg14p could stimulate vacuolar micro-domain formation is unclear, but it may involve LDs themselves, which by contributing sterols to the vacuolar surface could stimulate micro-domain formation, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al. (2014)</xref>.</p><p>LDs play other role(s) during starvation than simply providing an alternate carbon source for energy production when glucose is absent. This includes supplying lipids for bulk autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shpilka et al., 2015</xref>), and serving as a reservoir for stress-induced excess/damaged lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Velázquez et al., 2016</xref>). While important, these other LD functions are not sufficient for cells to survive long-term under nutrient starvation unless LD consumption is occurring by µ-lipophagy. Evidence supporting this came from our findings that in glucose-starved cells in which µ-lipophagy is absent (i.e. <italic>atg14Δ</italic> cells, <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells, cells under gradual GR, or rapamycin-treated cells), less energy is produced relative to cells engaged in µ-lipophagy, and cells survive only short-term. Selective autophagy pathways such as mitophagy or pexophagy have been suggested to be important in the long-term survival of starved cells through organellar quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suzuki, 2013</xref>). That µ-lipophagy is more significant than either of these for cell longevity under starvation by acute GR conditions was suggested by our findings that in mitophagy-deficient (e.g. <italic>atg32Δ</italic> and <italic>atg33Δ</italic>) cells or pexophagy-deficient <italic>atg11Δ</italic> cells, µ-lipophagy and long-term survival still occurred.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that AMPK and vacuole-associated Atg14p activities play critical roles in cell survival under acute GR by triggering µ-lipophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The key step for this process is early onset AMPK signaling caused by acute GR. This leads to the relocation of Atg14p, which also physically interacts with AMPK/Snf1p, from ERES to the vacuole. On the vacuole surface, Atg14p initiates µ-lipophagy by working in conjunction with Atg6p and other core autophagy machinery. Through their cooperative roles in promoting µ-lipophagy, these components enable yeast cells undergoing acute GR to dramatically extend their lifespans relative to cells experiencing gradual GR or rapamycin treatment. Cells only preserved Snf1p activity and stimulated µ-lipophagy when Snf1p was activated as a consequence of acute glucose depletion (no similar response occurred when TOR was deactivated by amino acid loss or rapamycin treatment). This supports the notion that AMPK activation selectively promotes autophagic recycling of stored carbon-energy sources (e.g. lipids), while TOR inhibition activates autophagy pathways leading to recycling of nitrogen sources (i.e. digestion of protein-enriched compartments). Thus, under different nutrient stresses, yeast cells choose distinct autophagic pathways for digestion of different substrates (e.g. lipids versus amino acids) to optimize cell metabolism and survival. Given the shared cellular machinery between yeast and other organisms, these findings are germane to understanding cell survival mechanisms under different starvation regimens and should be relevant for clarifying cellular mechanisms for abnormal metabolic processes associated with cancer, obesity and aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and media</title><p>Yeast BY strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>.

restriction, and genetic manipulations</title><p>Glucose restriction (GR) experiment was performed with SD and SC media containing either 2% (wt/vol) glucose (gradual GR) or 0.4% (wt/vol) glucose (acute GR). For non-starvation (no GR) conditions, yeast cells grown under YPD or SD and SC media containing 2% glucose were analyzed when they are in an early log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &lt; 0.4). Briefly, yeast strains from frozen permanent stocks at −80°C were patched onto YPD agar plates. After 2 days of growth at 30°C, cells from patches were inoculated into 5 mL of YPD in 14 mL polypropylene tubes and grown overnight at 30°C in a shaker at ~250 rpm. After ~18 hr, the yeast culture was diluted 1/100 into 5 mL of 2% glucose SD (or SC) medium and grown overnight at 30°C in a shaker at ~250 rpm. After ~18 hr, 0.05 ~ 0.1 OD Unit (OD<sub>600</sub><bold>×</bold> mL) of yeast cells was transferred to fresh 5 mL of either 2% glucose SD (or SC) for gradual GR or 0.4% glucose SD (or SC) for acute GR. Then, cells were grown at 30°C in a shaker at ~250 rpm without nutrient replenishment to induce glucose starvation. In the case of LD defective cells (i.e. LDΔ, SEΔ, and TAGΔ cells), which completely failed to grow under the above gradual or acute GR conditions, glucose starvation was induced by transferring cells grown under YPD media directly to 2% glucose SD. The OD<sub>600</sub> was routinely measured on days 1, 2, and 3 to confirm culture saturation by using Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). The transformants were generated as described using EZ-Yeast Transformation Kit (MP Biomedicals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Drug treatment</title><p>Rapamycin (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make 1 mM stock solution and added to SC media containing 2% or 0.4% glucose at 40, 50, 100, 250, or 500 nM concentration. MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) was dissolved in DMSO to make 10 mM stock solution and added to SD medium with 2% glucose at 10 μM concentration. For vacuole staining, CMAC-Ala-Pro (7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin-L-alanyl-L-proline amide, Thermo Scientific Inc.) was dissolved in DMSO to make 10 mM stock solution and added to 200 μL of yeast cultures at 100 μM concentration, followed by 4 hr incubation at 30°C before imaging experiments. For lipid droplet staining, Nile red (Thermo Scientific Inc.) was dissolved in DMSO to make 1 mg/mL stock solution and added to 500 μL of yeast cultures at 1 μg/mL concentration, followed by 15 min incubation at 30°C before imaging experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell lifespan, cellular respiration and stress resistance measurements</title><p>Cell lifespan/viability was evaluated by using a vital dye (i.e. erythrocin B) or by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvers et al. (2009b)</xref>. The rate of oxygen consumption was monitored using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oroboros Instruments Corp.). During a cell lifespan experiment, cell cultures (1.5 mL) were transferred to an airtight chamber maintained at 30°C with magnetic stirrer, and oxygen content was monitored for at least 20 min according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modification. The rate of oxygen consumption was normalized with OD<sub>600</sub>. Sensitivity to oxidative stress-inducing agents (i.e. 2.5 mM hydrogen peroxide and 30 μM menadione) was measured by determining colony forming units (CFUs) per mL of yeast culture. Briefly, 1 hr prior to stress resistance test, YPD agar plates with or without previously indicated oxidative stressors were freshly prepared. During lifespan measurement, a serial fivefold diluted culture was plated onto the aforementioned agar plates. These replica plates were incubated further at 30°C for 3 days to visualize viable colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Autophagic flux and LD degradation assays</title><p>Degradation flux of autophagosomes, cytosolic autophagic substrates, peroxisomes, and LDs were performed according to Alvers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvers et al., 2009b</xref>) with slight modification using α-RFP (Ajay Sharma, CBMP, NICHD) or α-GFP (Abcam, # ab290) antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Yeast cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, AMPK phosphorylation analysis</title><p>Cell lysates were prepared by a glass-bead method using immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (0.1% NP-40 (4-nonylphenyl poly(ethyleneglycol), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM DTT (4-dithiothreitol)) or CHAPS buffer (1% CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 100 mM NaCl) with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific Inc.). For IP experiments, 25 OD Unit of yeast cells were collected and washed once with cold IP or CHAPS buffers. Cell pellets were resuspended with 0.5 mL IP or CHAPS buffers in 2-mL microfuge tube containing 0.25 g of 0.5 mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.). Then, the tube was placed on a vortex mixer at 4°C for 20 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at top speed at 4°C for 15 min and supernatants were transferred to fresh tube with 30 μL of Protein A-Sepharose4B (Thermo Scientific Inc.) pre-treated with 2 μL of rabbit α-GFP (Ajay Sharma, CBMP, NICHD) or total rabbit IgG (Thermo Scientific Inc.). All tubes were incubated at 4°C on a rotator. After 1 hr incubation, beads were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 s at 4°C and then resuspended and washed 3 times in 1 mL cold IP or CHAPS buffers. To remove NP-40, beads were washed twice in IP buffer without NP-40 and DTT. After removing all remaining buffer, beads were resuspended with 60 μL of 2X Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at top speed at 4°C for 5 min. Samples were stored at −80°C prior to performing Western blot analysis.</p><p>For AMPK phosphorylation experiments, 5 OD Unit of yeast cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min and the pellets were immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen. Using cold IP buffer containing 0.25 g of 0.5 mm glass beads, cell pellets were homogenized to extract proteins as described in the above. Afterwards, BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific Inc.) was performed to determine protein concentrations. The same amount of proteins (i.e. 10 or 15 μg) was used for western blot analysis. In addition, protein loading was monitored using TGX Stain-Free Precast Gels System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphorylated and total Snf1p was determined as modified from McCartney and Schmidt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCartney and Schmidt, 2001</xref>) using α-phospho AMPK (Cell Signaling, #2535) and α-HA tag HRP (Abcam, #ab128131) antibodies, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell survival measurements under rapamycin</title><p>Freshly prepared yeast patch was inoculated into 5 mL of SC media containing 2% glucose and was grown at 30°C in a shaker at ~250 rpm. After ~18 hr, the cell culture was diluted 1/100 into 5 mL of SC media containing 2% or 0.4% glucose. After ~18 hr, cells were diluted by the equal volume of the corresponding media that contain 0.5 or 1 μM rapamycin, followed by growing them at 30°C in a shaker at ~250 rpm. At the indicated times, 0.00046 OD Unit cells were plated onto YPEG (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2%(vol/vol) ethanol, 3%(wt/vol) glycerol) agar plate after four serial fivefold dilutions. These plates were incubated further at 30°C for 4 days to visualize viable colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ATP measurements</title><p>Two OD Unit of yeast cells are collected in 1.5-mL microfuge tube by centrifugation at top speed for 1 min and washed once with cold distilled water. Supernatant was removed and 0.75 mL of 90% acetone was added to the pellet. Resuspended cells were heated at 90°C to allow the acetone to evaporate off for 30 min. Approximately 50 μL of solution is remaining. Assay buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) was added to make it to the final volume of 500 μL. The concentration of ATP was then measured according to ATP Determination Kit (Thermo Scientific Inc.) by following the manufacturer’s instruction using a luminescence microplate reader (BioTek U.S.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Soft X-ray images of cryogenic yeast samples were collected using XM-2, the National Center for X-ray Tomography soft X-ray microscope at the Advanced Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and reconstructed according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larabell and Nugent, 2010</xref>). Organelles were segmented for data analysis according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uchida et al. (2011)</xref>. Epifluorescence images of live cells were acquired using EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Scientific Inc.) equipped with DAPI (357/44 Ex; 447/60 Em), GFP (470/22 Ex; 510/42 Em), and RFP (531/40 Ex; 593/40 Em) light cubes. Confocal fluorescence images of live cells were acquired using Leica SP5 equipped with white light laser (WLL) (Leica Microsystems) or a customized Nikon TiE inverted scope equipped with a Yokogawa spinning-disk head (#CSU-X1, Yokogawa) and a Photometrics EM-CCD camera (Evolve 512). 488 and 561 nm or 563 nm WLL lines were used for exciting GFP and DsRed, respectively, and the emission signals were sequentially collected to minimize crosstalk. To image cells, 5 μL of cell cultures was mounted directly under a coverglass or 200 μL of cell cultures were plated and incubated in NuncLab-Tek II Chambered Coverglass (Thermo Scientific Inc.) at RT. Fixed cells were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscopy with a 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.4 NA oil objective (Carl Zeiss). DAPI, GFP, and DsRed were excited with 405, 488, and 561 nm lines, respectively, and the raw image data was processed using the commercial Zen software package (Carl Zeiss) and Imaris software (Bitplan), or ImageJ (National institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Yeast fixation for AIRY-scan imaging</title><p>Cells were fixed using cold 4% paraformaldehyde with 3.4% sucrose at RT for 15 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vojo Deretic as the Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors describe how yeast carry out, under certain physiological conditions, a variant of lipophagy (autophagic degradation of neutral lipid stores often referred to as lipid droplets) through vacuolar uptake of lipid droplets/bodies. This process morphologically resembles microautophagy and in its genetic requirements and requires Atg14 re-positioning from ER exit sites to the vacuole. Curiously, inhibition of mTOR inhibits this process (unlike in the majority of other autophagic processes where mTOR conventionally plays a negative regulatory role).</p><p>The initial reviews ranged from significant to minimal experiments and revisions. This led to a discussion that resulted in the following consensus recommendation:</p><p>Please address points 1 and 2 experimentally (with details clearly outlined by the reviewers in the section reporting complete reviewers' comments), and point 3 textually (details from reviewing editor given below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The events post Atg14 association to the vacuole in the clearance of lipid droplet are not clear. The data that Atg14 localizes to ergosterol enriched domains is not convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). What other components are recruited to the ergestorol enriched vacuolar domains? The details are clearly outlined by the reviewers in the section reporting complete reviewers' criticisms.</p><p>2) Is the effect of lipophagy on cell survival direct? The reviewers have suggested experiments that could potentially help address this concern. What is the effect of deletion of regulators of Snf1 on cell survival? The details are clearly outlined by the reviewers in the section reporting complete reviewers' criticisms.</p><p>Complete reviewer comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the present manuscript, Seo et al. delineate principle regulatory differences of yeast cells transitioning to stationary phase in the presence of high (2%) or medium (0.4%) glucose concentrations critically determining chronological lifespan. Specifically, yeast cells activate a sustained autophagy response, which includes the selective turnover of lipid droplets (lipophagy), when AMP-dependent kinase Snf1 is stabilized and activated in the presence of low glucose (0.4%). Snf1 activity is required for re-localization of Atg14, a subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex I that can also physically interact with Snf1 as shown in this manuscript, from ER exit sites to vacuoles and function in lipophagy without affecting general autophagy. Snf1 and Atg14 function is required for the long lifespan of yeast cells during chronological aging in the presence of low glucose concentrations.</p><p>The manuscript presents data that indicate important differences in the regulation of autophagy and cell metabolism dependent on glucose concentrations and critical consequences for cell survival during starvation. Furthermore, the data further evidence for fundamental plasticity in the regulation and function of core autophagy components defined by metabolic or stress conditions. Hence the findings in the present study will be of great interest in the autophagy and aging field.

The data that Atg14 localizes to ergosterol enriched domains is not convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). What other components are recruited to the ergestorol enriched vacuolar domains? The details are clearly outlined by the reviewers in the section reporting complete reviewers' criticisms.</italic> </p><p>To further characterize the events post-Atg14p association to the vacuole, we a) provide more convincing data that Atg14p localizes to ergosterol-enriched domains (which we now refer to as L<sub>o</sub> vacuole domains), b) demonstrate what other components are recruited to these L<sub>o</sub> domains, and c) address other concerns related to this topic raised by the reviewers.</p><p>A) To provide more convincing data that Atg14 localizes to L<sub>o</sub> domains, we imaged Atg14-GFP expressing cells undergoing acute GR by AIRY-scan superresolution microscopy and analyzed the data using a 3D volume rendering method (Imaris). With the improved spatial resolution and 3D renderings of Atg14p and Vph1p (or Pho8p) (i.e., liquid-disordered membrane (L<sub>d</sub>) domain markers (Toulmay and Prinz, 2013)), we confirmed that Atg14p localizes to L<sub>o</sub> domains on the vacuolar membrane. We further showed that LDs, labeled using Erg6-DsRed, localize exclusively in large L<sub>o</sub> vacuole membrane domains prior to being internalized into the vacuole in cells undergoing acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This suggests L<sub>o</sub> domains serve as preferential sites for LD uptake into the vacuole. By contrast, in cells undergoing gradual GR, in which Atg14p localizes to ERES instead of the vacuole membrane, L<sub>o</sub> domains on the vacuole were much less apparent and LDs remained cytoplasmic, with none taken up into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>We also used AIRY-scan confocal microscopy to examine the vacuolar localizations of Atg14p, Atg6p and a vacuole L<sub>d</sub> domain marker under acute GR. 3D volume reconstruction and maximum projection images revealed Atg14p molecules localizing as punctate elements within vacuolar L<sub>o</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Single z-slices from these images showed Atg14p was preferentially localized on the edges of L<sub>o</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, Single z-slice), in close association with LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Atg6p was also localized in L<sub>o</sub> domains at the vacuole surface but was more broadly distributed relative to Atg14p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>To address whether Atg14p and/or Atg6p are critical for creating the large L<sub>o</sub> domains on vacuole membranes under acute GR, we deleted the gene for each protein and then examined whether or not L<sub>o</sub> domains were formed. Little or no L<sub>o</sub> domains were observed in either <italic>atg14△</italic> or <italic>atg6△</italic> cells under acute or gradual GR, with the effect most potent in <italic>atg6△</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). Given Atg6p resides on the vacuole membrane irrespective of the starvation condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), whereas Atg14p redistributes to the vacuole membrane in response to acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), the results suggested Atg14p helps drive large-scale L<sub>o</sub> formation under acute GR, with a critical supportive role played by Atg6p. Consistent with this, fewer large-scale L<sub>o</sub> domains formed in <italic>snf1△</italic> cells under acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>), a condition where Atg6p resides on the vacuole surface but Atg14p fails to be recruited (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>B) To demonstrate what other components are recruited to the vacuole under acute GR, we monitored the distribution of GFP-tagged Atg6p, Atg38p, Vps15p, Vps34p, and Vps38p, which are autophagy-related, PI3K complex I components. Vacuole association of each PI3K complex I component was scored by AIRY-scan confocal microscopy image analysis. Prior to glucose starvation, Atg6p and Vps15p both showed significant association with the vacuole surface. Atg6p remained localized to the vacuole after shifting to either acute or gradual GR, but Vps15p redistributed off the vacuole upon acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). The other PI3K complex I components (i.e., Atg38p, Vps34p, and Vps38p) remained primarily cytosolic with no increased vacuolar association upon shift to either acute or gradual GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Therefore, only Atg6p and Atg14p reside on the vacuole surface under acute GR. Atg6p remained prominently localized at the vacuolar surface even when AMPK was inactive (i.e., in <italic>snf1Δ</italic> cells or during gradual GR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), whereas Atg14p was primarily ERES-associated under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). Therefore, only Atg14p’s vacuolar localization was AMPK-dependent.</p><p><italic>2) Is the effect of lipophagy on cell survival direct? The reviewers have suggested experiments that could potentially help address this concern. What is the effect of deletion of regulators of Snf1 on cell survival? The details are clearly outlined by the reviewers in the section reporting complete reviewers' criticisms.</italic> </p><p>We provide additional data, including experiments suggested by the reviewers, that now strongly suggests that µ-lipophagy has a direct role in cell survival under starvation. First, when we prevent LDs from forming in cells by knocking out key LD biosynthetic enzymes (i.e., LDΔ, SEΔ, and TAGΔ cells), cell viability under starvation drops significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since LDs are absent and no µ-lipophagy occurs in these cells, the results support the idea that µ-lipophagy’s downstream effects (i.e., LD consumption to drive OXPHOS) are essential for cell survival under glucose starvation. Second, removal of Atg14p, the protein we propose helps direct µ-lipophagy, prevents µ-lipophagy without blocking general autophagy, and reduces overall cell viability under acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Third, different conditions that prevented Atg14p from relocating from ERES onto the vacuole (where Atg14p functions in µ-lipophagy) caused reduced cell survival under acute GR. These conditions included: knock-out of AMPK (s<italic>nf1△</italic> cells); inactivation of TOR through rapamycin-treatment; and inactivation of TOR through amino acid removal. Fourth, µ-lipophagy and long-term survival still occurred in mitophagy-deficient (e.g., <italic>atg32Δ</italic> and <italic>atg33Δ</italic>) cells or pexophagy-deficient <italic>atg11Δ</italic> cells undergoing acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that µ-lipophagy is more significant than either mitophagy or pexophagy for cell longevity under starvation by acute GR conditions.</p><p><italic>Complete reviewer comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) What is the relative contribution of sustained general autophagy and selective lipophagy for cell survival?</italic> </p><p>Our data suggest that both general autophagy and µ-lipophagy are critical for long-term survival under nutrient starvation. When either pathway is compromised or inhibited, long-term survival under starvation is lost. For example, we observed µ-lipophagy is absent and general autophagy is present in both <italic>atg14Δ</italic> cells and cells starved by rapamycin-treatment or gradual GR; and these cells failed to live long-term. We further found that blocking autophagy by knocking out genes for core autophagy machinery (e.g., Atg1p and Atg5p) significantly reduced long-term cell viability under acute GR.</p><p>As mentioned above, a major point of our study is that cells switch on both µ-lipophagy and bulk autophagy pathways under acute GR to allow selective recycling of LDs (via µ-lipophagy) as an alternative energy source and recycling of proteins (via bulk autophagy) as a nitrogen source. Mitophagy or pexophagy were not needed since blocking either of these pathways by deleting <italic>ATG11</italic> or <italic>ATG32</italic>, respectively, did not decrease long-term cell survival under acute GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors provide evidence indicating that conditions inducing lipophagy are correlated with longevity during acute GR.

This is based on our observation that other conditions in which cells are unable to switch on µ-lipophagy (e.g., rapamycin-treatment or gradual GR) result in cells having shortened lifespans. Without µ-lipophagy-mediated LD catabolism, therefore, general autophagy alone is not sufficient to enable long-term cell survival under prolonged glucose starvation. We speculate that one of µ-lipophagy’s downstream roles is to provide energy for sustaining general autophagy or other selective autophagy pathways under long-term starvation. Further studies are needed to test this possibility.</p><p><italic>In addition, AMPK/Snf1 deletion compromises the regulation of a number of cellular functions other than lipophagy including fatty acid synthesis, mitochondrial activity, and b-oxidation of fatty acids, which likely contribute to the shortened phenotype observed for this mutant.</italic> </p><p>We agree that these other processes likely contribute to the shortened phenotype observed for the <italic>snf1△</italic> cells.</p><p><italic>First, to strengthen the postulated role for lipophagy in lifespan regulation, the authors should measure wild type cell survival in SC media in the presence or absence of rapamycin during gradual and acute GR.

As rapamycin treatment reduces µ-lipophagy, this result supports the thesis that µ-lipophagy plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival during glucose depletion. We further measured the lifespans of cells undergoing gradual or acute GR under different amino acid starvation conditions (i.e., SD versus SC). Similar to rapamycin-treatment, amino acid depletion dramatically shortened the lifespans of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The work would benefit from a more detailed characterization of the apparent antagonizing roles of AMPK and TORC1 in regulating differences between nutrient sensing (amino acids vs carbon source starvation) and types of autophagy.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more detailed characterization of the antagonizing roles of AMPK and TOR would add to the paper. To address this, we now provide more detailed analysis and discussion on this topic. First, we found that AMPK cannot be activated under starvation conditions when TOR is inhibited beforehand (i.e., rapamycin treatment, gradual GR, or acute GR in rapamycin-treated cells). We speculate that this arises because TOR inhibition induces bulk autophagy and causes a surplus of amino acids, raising ATP levels to antagonize AMPK activity. Second, we demonstrate that rapamycin and gradual GR treatments (which each inhibit TOR) cause proteasomal degradation of AMPK. This relates to the finding that mTOR inhibition activates overall protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (Zhao et al., 2015). Third, we show that addition of rapamycin to cells undergoing acute GR causes AMPK to be degraded and cell longevity to be shortened. We discuss this from the perspective of the role of µ-lipophagy in long-term survival under starvation, and µ-lipophagy’s requirement for AMPK activation. Indeed, the results help explain why treatments that inhibit AMPK activation, despite triggering TOR inactivation and bulk autophagy pathways, are insufficient for promoting long-term cell survival. Overall, our data suggest that the antagonism between AMPK activity and TOR inhibition allows cells to engage in different types of autophagy to suit their metabolic demands under different starvation conditions. Therefore, cells starved of amino acids prior to glucose removal (i.e., gradual GR or rapamycin-treatment) switch on only bulk autophagy pathways to recycle nitrogen sources. In cells starved acutely of glucose before amino acid withdrawal (i.e., acute GR), by contrast, both µ-lipophagy and general autophagy pathways are switched on. Consequently, these cells are able to survive long-term due to LDs being used as an alternative energy source.</p><p><italic>What is the mechanism for Atg14-dependent lipophagy?

In this context, the conclusion that Atg14 localizes to egosterol enriched vacuolar domains is not sufficiently supported by data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Without a functional context, these data are too preliminary. The manuscript would be improved by focusing on the mechanism of lipophagy.</italic> </p><p>In the revised paper, we have made considerable effort at characterizing the mechanism(s) underlying µ-lipophagy, including further study of the roles of specific autophagy components, and more detailed imaging of LDs, Atg14p and Atg6p localizations on the vacuole. Prior studies have demonstrated that ergosterol is a key factor required for generating liquid-ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) membrane domains on the vacuole surface (Toulmay and Prinz, 2013), and shown that Atg14p co-localizes with Ivy1p, a L<sub>o</sub> domain marker on the vacuole (Wang et al., 2014). Using AIRY-scan super-resolution imaging combined with 3D volume rendering, we show more clearly that Atg14p localizes to L<sub>o</sub> vacuolar domains and is excluded from liquid disordered (L<sub>d</sub>) membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We find Atg14p localizes on the edges of the L<sub>o</sub> domains, whereas Atg6p is more broadly redistributed to the L<sub>o</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We further show that L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> domains do not form in cells lacking either Atg6p or Atg14p, and that the domains are reduced in cells lacking Snf1p. From this and other data in our paper, we speculate that vacuolar-localized Atg14p helps differentiate L<sub>o</sub> domains, perhaps by serving to link LDs to the vacuole surface, which would allow sterols from the LD to further drive phase partitioning on the vacuole surface. Once LDs are docked on L<sub>o</sub> domains, the domains internalize with their associated LDs. These findings open up many new questions about µ-lipophagy that future studies should address.</p></body></sub-article></article>
