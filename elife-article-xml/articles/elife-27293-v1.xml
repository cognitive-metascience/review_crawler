However, feedback creates the potential for unstable network responses. We examined how concentrations of key metabolites and signaling pathways interact to maintain homeostasis in proliferating human cells, using fluorescent reporters for AMPK activity, Akt activity, and cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> redox. Across various conditions, including glycolytic or mitochondrial inhibition or cell proliferation, we observed distinct patterns of AMPK activity, including both stable adaptation and highly dynamic behaviors such as periodic oscillations and irregular fluctuations that indicate a failure to reach a steady state. Fluctuations in AMPK activity, Akt activity, and cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> redox state were temporally linked in individual cells adapting to metabolic perturbations. By monitoring single-cell dynamics in each of these contexts, we identified PI3K/Akt regulation of glycolysis as a multifaceted modulator of single-cell metabolic dynamics that is required to maintain metabolic stability in proliferating cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>primary metabolism</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-08-1-0609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albeck</surname><given-names>John G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-R01-CA105134-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brugge</surname><given-names>Joan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS055031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yellen</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stuart HQ and Victoria Quan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Yin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual cells display heterogeneous fluctuations in metabolic activity, with amplitude and kinetics controlled by interlocking feedbacks between glycolysis and the Insulin/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central function of cellular metabolic regulation is to ensure an adequate supply of metabolites for bioenergetics and biosynthetic processes. To maintain metabolic homeostasis, cells utilize feedback loops at multiple levels in an integrated metabolic-signaling network. For instance, glycolysis is regulated by feedback control at the level of phosphofructokinase, which senses the availability of ATP and the respiratory intermediate citrate. Additionally, in response to ATP depletion, the energy-sensing kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulates glucose uptake and suppresses energy-consuming processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardie, 2008</xref>). These homeostatic pathways respond to bioenergetic stress by increasing or decreasing the appropriate metabolic fluxes to return the cell to a state with stable and sufficient levels of key metabolites. While bioenergetic stress can occur when any of a number of metabolites becomes critically limited, we focus in this study on the key metabolite ATP because of its broad importance as an energy source for cellular processes, and because AMPK activity can be used as a reliable indicator of low ATP:AMP ratios within the cell. We therefore use the term bioenergetic stress here to indicate a situation in which the concentration of available ATP is reduced, as indicated by AMPK activation.</p><p>Bioenergetic stress can result from a loss of ATP production, such as when nutrients become limited or metabolic pathways are inhibited by a pharmacological agent. Alternatively, ATP depletion can also result from an increase in ATP usage, such as when anabolic processes are engaged during cell growth. Because anabolic processes such as protein translation can use a large fraction (20–30%) of cellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buttgereit and Brand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>), it is unsurprising that cellular proliferation and metabolic regulation are tightly linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1976</xref>). Growth factor (GF) stimulation activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays a key role in proliferation by stimulating both cell cycle progression and mTOR activity, leading to increased protein translation. Simultaneously, Akt activity promotes glucose metabolism by stimulating the activity of hexokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>) and phosphofructokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Novellasdemunt et al., 2013</xref>) and translocation of glucose transporters (Glut1 and Glut4) to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wieman et al., 2007</xref>), while PI3K enhances the activity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and aldolase to increase glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The balance of anabolic and catabolic processes is particularly important in epithelial tissues, as they maintain the capacity to proliferate throughout adult life. Most cancers arise in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>) and involve a loss of both signaling and metabolic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). The AMPK and Akt pathways play key roles in this balance, intersecting through multiple crosstalk points and feedback loops to control both glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and protein translation at the level of mTOR. In principle, an optimal feedback response to an ATP-depleting perturbation would allow ATP to rapidly increase and stabilize at a sufficient level, while unstable responses such as continuing fluctuations or oscillations could be deleterious for the cell. However, a system with multiple feedbacks requires unavoidable tradeoffs in efficiency and robustness, and feedback increases the potential for instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>). Experimentally, such unstable metabolic responses have been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danø et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh and Chance, 1964</xref>) and in specialized post-mitotic mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Rourke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tornheim and Lowenstein, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), confirming the potential for instability during metabolic adaptation. However, in epithelial cells, little is known about the kinetic relationships between signaling and metabolic activity that allow proliferation and other anabolic processes to proceed in step with energy production.</p><p>To understand the kinetics of homeostasis, single-cell data are needed because of the potential for metabolic state to vary even among genetically identical cells. Events that are asynchronous among cells, and subpopulations with differential behaviors, are not apparent in the population mean due to their tendency to ‘average out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</xref>). Until recently, dynamics in metabolism could only be measured effectively under conditions where fluctuations are synchronized across populations of cells, because biochemical techniques such as mass spectrometry provide broad measurement capabilities but reflect the population average rather than individual cells. However, advances in fluorescent reporters now enable real-time monitoring of metabolic and signaling dynamics in individual intact cells. Genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based reporters have been designed to respond to specific metabolites by changes in their fluorescence output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tantama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsien, 2005</xref>). As a result, metabolic and signal transduction states, including cytosolic NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), glutathione redox potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>), ATP-ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>), and AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsou et al., 2011</xref>), can now be monitored in living cells.</p><p>In this study, we established a panel of proliferative epithelial cells expressing multiple fluorescent biosensors to enable detailed tracking of single-cell metabolic responses. We first used pharmacologic compounds to induce bioenergetic stress and to establish the range of cellular responses, finding that different forms of metabolic inhibition trigger strikingly different kinetics of adaptation and reveal conditions under which stable adaptation fails. We then used this framework to examine how metabolic adaptation functions in proliferating cells. We found that periods of bioenergetic stress occur throughout the normal cell cycle, and we identified a prominent role for PI3K/Akt regulation of glycolysis in mediating metabolic stability at the single-cell level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescent reporters enable single-cell imaging of metabolic and signaling dynamics</title><p>MCF10A mammary epithelial cells are dependent on GF stimulation for proliferation and can be stimulated to proliferate at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ram et al., 1995</xref>), making them a useful experimental system to examine the relationship between proliferation and metabolic kinetics. We generated MCF10A cell lines stably expressing a panel of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters for central components of the metabolic-signaling control network. First, the sensor AMPKAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was constructed to monitor the activity of AMPK. Using the FRET-based AMPKAR biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsou et al., 2011</xref>), we improved its dynamic range by using a brighter donor fluorescent protein mTurquoise2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goedhart et al., 2012</xref>) and an extended ‘EV’ linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>). In live cells, AMPK activation was calculated based on a linear ratiometric method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birtwistle et al., 2011</xref>), which we term ‘AMPK index’ (see Materials and methods for details of activity calculations). We verified the sensing capability of AMPKAR2 by treating MCF10A-AMPKAR2 cells with the direct AMPK activator AICAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Following AICAR application, all cells showed an immediate increase in the AMPK index and reached a steady state within 5 hr. When cultured in the absence of glucose, pyruvate, and glutamine for 24 hr, MCF10A-AMPKAR2 cells showed elevated AMPK index, which decreased abruptly upon glucose addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cells cultured in combinations of glucose, pyruvate, or glutamine displayed varying elevated levels of steady-state AMPK index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), demonstrating that AMPKAR2 could monitor AMPK status across a range of physiological concentrations of nutrients in individual live cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and validation of live-cell reporters for AMPK (<bold>A–D</bold>), cytosolic NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (<bold>E–H</bold>), and Akt kinase activity (<bold>I–L</bold>).</title><p>A,E, and I depict schematic diagrams for each of the reporters.

To maintain compatibility with red-wavelength reporters for dual imaging and to simplify cell tracking, we generated a nuclear-targeted Peredox fused to the YFP mCitrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). NADH is a major redox cofactor in glycolysis, which generates NADH from NAD<sup>+</sup> via the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reaction in the cytosol. As NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> exchange freely between nuclear and cytosolic compartments, Peredox nuclear signal reports the cytosolic NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> redox state and serves as an indicator of glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung et al., 2011</xref>). Once normalized by the fused mCitrine signal to correct for variations in biosensor expression, Peredox nuclear signal is thus defined as the ‘NADH index.’ To verify cytosolic NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> redox sensing, we exploited the lactate dehydrogenase reaction,which interconverts pyruvate and lactate with concomitant exchange ofNADH forNAD<sup>+</sup>. MCF10A-Peredox cells treated with lactate, or pyruvate in combination with iodoacetate (IA) as a glycolytic blockade, exhibited rapid (&lt;3 min) changes to reach maximal and minimal sensor responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), indicative of cytosolic NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> redox sensing. Consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung et al., 2011</xref>), steady-state NADH index increased with glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), and Peredox could detect glycolytic dynamics in individual live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). A control reporter with a mutation in the NADH-binding site (Y98D) predicted to abrogate NADH binding failed to respond to the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To track PI3K/Akt pathway activity, we constructed a reporter based on the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a. Akt phosphorylation of FOXO3a promotes its cytoplasmic retention; with low Akt activity, dephosphorylated FOXO3a translocates to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran et al., 2002</xref>). To monitor Akt activity, we thus fused a red fluorescent protein mCherry to a truncated FOXO3a gene in which transcriptional activity was abrogated to minimize any interference on endogenous gene transcription, a strategy previously shown to specifically report Akt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross and Rotwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maryu et al., 2016</xref>). We refer to this construct here as AKT-KTR; the Akt activity indicated by its cytosolic-to-nuclear fluorescence ratio is referred to as the ‘Akt index’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Upon insulin application following GF deprivation, MCF10A-AKT-KTR cells showed an abrupt increase in Akt index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), consistent with the expected Akt stimulation. Conversely, pharmacologic treatment with the Akt inhibitor MK2206 induced an immediate decrease in Akt index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and L</xref>), confirming that AKT-KTR could report Akt activity dynamics in individual live cells. We generated dual-reporter cell lines expressing both AKT-KTR and AMPKAR2, or AKT-KTR and Peredox, allowing Akt activity and metabolic status to be measured in the same cell. To track the relationship between proliferation and metabolic analysis, we also constructed a cell line expressing both AMPKAR2 and a reporter of S/G2 phase, GMNN-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>). In comparison to parental cells, reporter-expressing cells did not differ substantially in bulk metabolic properties, including basal oxygen consumption and lactate secretion, with the exception of AMPKAR2/AKT-KTR cells, which had a higher maximal glycolytic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We used our reporter cell lines to establish the relationship between metabolic, signaling, and cell cycle parameters under different GF stimuli. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Worster et al., 2012</xref>) insulin treatment induced the strongest activation of Akt index, while epidermal growth factor (EGF) produced a more moderate activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Glucose uptake and NADH index were also highest in insulin-treated cells, intermediate in EGF-treated cells, and lowest in the absence of GFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), while the average AMPK index correlated inversely with Akt index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Because EGF stimulated proliferation more strongly than insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), these metabolic parameters correlated poorly with proliferative rate. Together, these results suggest that the increased rates of glucose uptake and metabolism stimulated by Akt activity are the primary determinants of metabolic status under each GF. Accordingly, treatment of insulin-cultured cells with an Akt or PI3K inhibitor decreased glucose uptake and NADH index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) while increasing AMPK index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When NADH and AMPK index were tracked in individual cells, we found a high degree of variance over time within each cell, with some cells showing pronounced peaks and troughs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While this behavior appeared to correlate with certain GF conditions, we lacked a framework to quantify and interpret these dynamics; we therefore turned to defined metabolic perturbations as a tool to first establish basic homeostatic responses for single cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Glucose metabolism drives adaptation to the bioenergetic stress of proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean Akt index, measured by AKT-KTR, following stimulation with EGF or insulin.

The asynchronous nature of these fluctuations argued against imaging artifacts or environmental fluctuations, which would affect all cells simultaneously. Similar kinetics were observed at all reporter expression levels, with moderate trends toward higher pulse frequency and shorter pulse duration in cells with higher reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunofluorescence detection of phosphorylated ACC (pACC), an AMPK substrate, showed indistinguishable staining patterns in parental and reporter-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, the large cell-to-cell variation in pACC staining pattern observed by immunofluorescence in cells fixed at later time points is exactly what would be expected given the asynchronous fluctuations observed in live-cell experiments. Similar kinetic patterns were also observed in other mammary epithelial cell lines (184A1 and MCF12A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that they are not specific to the MCF10A cell line. Finally, the kinetics of feedback responses were common to the point of inhibition, as other inhibitors of the electron transport chain including metformin and antimycin A induced pulses with durations similar to those of oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Together these data indicate that the kinetics observed are not narrowly confined to specific experimental conditions and may provide general insight into metabolic regulation in epithelial cells.</p><p>Because pulsatile AMPK activity was a common feature of the single-cell response to multiple perturbations, we developed a ‘pulse score’ to quantify the cumulative intensity of fluctuations for each cell over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and Materials and methods section). Oligomycin and IA-treated cells showed significantly increased pulse scores relative to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, other perturbations resulted in different kinetic variations; for instance, at low and intermediate doses, CCCP induced a rapid increase in AMPK index, with a magnitude comparable to the other perturbations, that was maintained at a steady-state level for many hours with a low pulse score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Higher doses of CCCP, which are known to inhibit respiration, exhibited similar effects as oligomycin. We speculate that, at concentrations where CCCP acts only as an ionophore, a new stable steady state is reached due to ATP consumption by the F0/F1 ATPase working in reverse and pumping protons to maintain the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient; when proton flow is blocked by oligomycin (or potentially by high doses of CCCP), AMPK kinetics are determined by other processes, which we investigate below.</p><p>Using AMPKAR2/GMNN dual reporter cells, we examined cell fates in response to each metabolic inhibitor (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). IA-treated cells rapidly ceased cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) and underwent lysis at varying times 12–24 hr following treatment. In oligomycin-treated cells, cell cycle progression slowed but still led to normal mitoses, and viability was unaffected. While 1 µM CCCP induced greater average AMPK index than oligomycin, neither cell cycle progression nor cell viability were altered. Thus, cellular responses to metabolic perturbations do not correlate with overall magnitude of bioenergetic stress as measured by AMPKAR. These differences in cell fate are likely to result from the modulation of distinct pathways by these agents, but it is nonetheless noteworthy that highly persistent dynamics are associated with more extreme changes in cell behavior, as this suggests that the kinetics of stress response may play a role in determining cell fate.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-27293-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.019</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Cell fates in response to metabolic perturbation.</title><p>MCF10A-AMPKAR2-mCherryGMNN cells were imaged in iGM and treated with 10 µM IA, 4.5 µg/ml oligomycin, or 1.6 µM CCCP.

The average period of these oscillations ranged from 18 min at 20–40 μM to 30 min at 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For IA at 10 μM or greater, the percentage of cells displaying oscillations (defined as five or more successive pulses with a spacing of 1 hr or less) was &gt;95%; this percentage fell to &lt;60% at 5 μM IA, and no oscillation was detected at concentrations of 2.5 μM or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). At intermediate concentrations (5–10 μM), IA-induced oscillations persisted for as many as 20 hr but typically ended with cell death (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Cells expressing Peredox or AKT-KTR treated with IA also exhibited oscillations in NADH index and Akt index, respectively, with kinetics similar to those seen in the AMPK index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). Oscillations were not observed when using the Peredox control reporter Y98D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To test whether the IA-induced oscillations in AMPK, Akt, and NADH indices were interrelated, we utilized AMPKAR2/AKT-KTR and Peredox/AKT-KTR dual reporter cells. AKT-KTR oscillations were tightly phase-locked with both AMPKAR2 and Peredox oscillations; each cycle of AKT-KTR response corresponded to one cycle of AMPKAR2 signal and one cycle of Peredox signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Phase locking was present in &gt;90% of cells. In each cycle, peak signals of each reporter were phase-shifted relative to one another. In cells expressing Peredox and AKT-KTR, cycles initiated with a drop in NADH index that was followed approximately 0.25 cycles later by a drop in Akt index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In cells expressing AMPKAR2 and AKT-KTR, the initial decrease in Akt index coincided with an increase in AMPK index, and peaks of Akt and AMPK index remained shifted by 0.5 cycles thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Based on these relative phase shifts, we constructed a composite diagram of the relationship between the three parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Rectangles indicate pools of metabolites, with the cellular concentration of the pool indicated by the intensity of blue coloring (blue high, white low). Flux between pools is indicated by gray arrows, with rate of flux indicated by the width of the arrow. In state (0), cells in the presence of insulin and glucose operate at a high level of glycolytic flux and ATP levels are high. Upon IA treatment (1), flux from upper glycolysis (UG) to lower glycolysis (LG) is reduced, and ATP levels begin to fall. (2) Low ATP levels stimulate multiple positive feedback regulators of flux to UG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). (3) Positive feedback drives an increase in the availability of glucose and UG metabolites; the decrease in Akt activity during this phase may be due to relief of mTOR inhibition by flux through HK (connection #4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), leading to negative feedback inhibition of Akt (connection #6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). (4) High levels of UG increase the levels of LG metabolites, overcoming the partial inhibition of flux imposed by IA; ATP levels rise, and net feedback switches from positive to negative. (5) Reduction of glycolytic flux leads to a relaxation of the levels of glycolytic metabolites; negative feedback deactivates. In a normal (non-IA-inhibited) state, this level of flux would be sufficient to maintain ATP levels, and the cell would return to a normal state (0). However, since IA remains present, flux from UG to LG is again inhibited and the cell returns to state (1), beginning a new repetition of the cycle.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27293-fig4-figsupp4-v1"/></fig></fig-group><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-27293-video5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.025</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>AMPK and Akt activity oscillations in response to IA.</title><p>MCF10A-AKT-KTR/AMPKAR2 cells were imaged in iGM2 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, and were treated at time 0 with 10 µM IA.

Analysis of glycolytic flux using <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose confirmed that 10 μM IA reduced the appearance of labeled pyruvate and lactate by approximately 50%, while 50 μM IA reduced labeling by approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Lactate secretion was reduced moderately by 10 μM IA and more strongly by 50 μM IA; together these measures indicate that glycolytic flux is reduced to an intermediate rate by 10 μM IA. We then compared the pulse scores for IA-treated cells in the presence of varying extracellular concentrations of glucose and pyruvate. In the absence of glucose, IA treatment failed to induce oscillations in AMPK or NADH index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). The incidence of oscillations, and the corresponding pulse score, increased with the extracellular glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 4–5 mM, while the average period and amplitude remained essentially constant. In contrast, pyruvate alone, although capable of serving as an ATP source for MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) was unable to sustain IA-induced oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Pyruvate also had no effect on IA-induced AMPK index oscillations in the presence of glucose, although it rendered NADH index oscillations undetectable by lowering the resting NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that pyruvate does not fuel ATP production at a high enough rate to impact the rapid oscillatory changes during IA treatment. The data support the conclusion that these rapid oscillatory dynamics originate from changes in flux in glycolysis, with downstream metabolic processes playing little role.</p><p>Oscillations often arise in feedback systems in which there is a delay between induction of feedback and recovery of the feedback-controlled variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glass et al., 1988</xref>). The co-oscillation of Akt activity along with AMPK and NADH indices suggests the involvement of a complex feedback structure involving PI3K/Akt, AMPK, and also mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this idea, multiple inhibitors of mTOR and PI3K activity suppressed IA-induced NADH oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Suppression was most potent with BEZ235, which inhibits PI3K, mTORC1, and mTORC2 activity, and strong but somewhat less potent with Torin1, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both Rad001, which inhibits mTORC1 alone, and BKM120, which inhibits only PI3K, had more limited but still significant ability to block oscillations. Withdrawal of insulin and EGF from the growth medium, which both reduces Akt and mTOR activity and glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Worster et al., 2012</xref>), also resulted in attenuation of IA-induced oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), while inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, which could link pulses of AMPK activity to NADH production, reduced the persistence of AMPK index oscillations, but did not eliminate them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Taken together, the observation that oscillations are most potently suppressed when multiple candidate feedback controllers are inhibited supports the concept of a multi-tiered feedback control system that does not depend critically on any single linkage. The phase relationship between the measurable variables in this system indicates the existence of delays between feedback activation and recovery of ATP and NADH and supports a model in which the slowed flux through glycolysis due to IA treatment triggers a cyclic series of feedback events that drive regular oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Modulation of glucose metabolism controls stable adaptation to mitochondrial ATPase inhibition</title><p>Oligomycin-induced fluctuations in AMPK differed from IA-induced oscillations in their longer time scale (2–6 hr), in their irregular nature, and in that they were not tightly associated with coordinated changes in NADH and Akt indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To investigate the role of glycolysis in oligomycin-induced fluctuations, we examined the effect of glucose concentration in the absence of the alternate fuel sources glutamine and pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). At 0 mM glucose, the baseline AMPK index was high, and oligomycin treatment led to a small increase in AMPKAR index with no subsequent adaptation, followed by cell death in 100% of cells within 12 hr. In 17 mM glucose (the baseline concentration for MCF10A media), oligomycin induced a rapid initial pulse of AMPK activity and subsequent adaptation, with &gt;75% of cells returning to baseline AMPK index within 2 hr. Following this adaptation, cells displayed regular pulsatile dynamics in AMPK index, with an average period of ~2.5 hr; the first two pulses of AMPK index were highly synchronous among cells, followed by gradual de-synchronization. As with the initial pulse, each burst of AMPK activity lasted 2–4 hr, suggesting that continuing oligomycin treatment induced ongoing bioenergetic challenges, which were, nevertheless, overcome by cells maintained at 17 mM glucose. At glucose concentrations of 3.4 mM and 1.7 mM, cells were unable to achieve full adaptation, with &lt;25% and&lt;10% of cells returning to baseline within 2 hr, and subsequent pulses in AMPK index were relatively dampened and prolonged. Thus, under high glucose levels, recovery of ATP levels occurs quickly and completely, but gives rise to recurring pulses of AMPK activity, suggesting that changes in the rate of ATP production by glucose metabolism via glycolysis generate these pulses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.027</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Requirement of glucose and glycolytic metabolism for AMPK fluctuations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-cell measurements of AMPK index in MCF10A cells in response to oligomycin at different glucose concentrations.

Top panel shows the condition of EGF-stimulated cells in high glucose, which display strong oscillations upon oligomycin treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, first panel). In state (0), glucose metabolism operates at a moderately high level, and ATP levels are high. (1) When oligomycin is added, ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation is blocked, and ATP levels begin to fall; AMPK activity increases. (2) Positive feedback increases the rate of flux into upper glycolysis. (3) Increased glycolytic flux increases ATP production and AMPK activity is reduced; pools of TCA intermediates in the mitochondria become saturated. (4) Negative feedback regulation of glycolysis is triggered both by high ATP levels and by buildup of citrate in the TCA cycle, leading to reduction of glycolytic flux. (5) ATP levels fall as a result of reduced glycolysis; TCA saturation dissipates through usage of TCA intermediates in other pathways and proton gradient leakage (together indicated as ‘leak’ flux). In this state, glycolytic flux is insufficient to maintain ATP levels in the continuing presence of oligomycin, and the cell returns to state (1). The middle panel indicates the condition of EGF stimulation in the presence of intermediate levels of glucose (~2 mM; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, third panel). (0) External glucose levels are not limiting in the basal state, and cells are able to maintain moderately high ATP levels. (1) Oligomycin blocks ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP levels fall. (2) Positive feedback regulation increases the rate of flux through glycolysis; however, relative to the top panel, lower available glucose levels limit the extent to which glycolytic flux can increase. (3) Increased glycolytic flux leads to a moderate rise in ATP levels, but this increase is smaller than in the top model, and negative feedback to glycolysis is not triggered. This state persists stably as glycolysis continues to operate at a rate sufficient to supply some ATP in the continuing presence of oligomycin, but not enough to return to initial levels. The bottom panel shows the condition of insulin-treated cells in the presence of high glucose and glutamine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, lower right panel). In state (0), high Akt activity induced by insulin stimulates a high level of glycolytic flux and high ATP levels. (1) When oligomycin is added, ATP levels drop moderately, but not as far as in the top panels due to the higher glycolytic flux; AMPK activity increases moderately. (2) Positive feedback due to the loss of ATP stimulates further increase in glycolytic flux. (3) Increased glycolytic flux replenishes ATP and increases pools of TCA metabolites. (4) Negative feedback to upper glycolysis is triggered by an increase in ATP, but is counteracted by the insulin-stimulated high activity of Akt; glycolytic flux remains high. Meanwhile, glutamine entering the TCA cycle through anaplerotic reactions alleviates the negative feedback by allowing citrate to continue through the TCA cycle and preventing its buildup. Therefore, cells continue to be able to maintain a high level of glycolytic flux, providing high levels of ATP even in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27293-fig5-figsupp2-v1"/></fig></fig-group><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-27293-video7.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.030</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>AMPK activity dynamics as a function of glucose level.</title><p>MCF10A-AMPKAR2 cells were imaged in iGM modified to lack glutamine and pyruvate and to contain the indicated concentrations of glucose.

In the presence of glutamine, treatment with insulin strongly suppressed oligomycin-induced pulses in AMPKAR index, relative to non-GF treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). While EGF moderately increased the strength of pulses, co-treatment with both EGF and insulin led to suppression of pulses. This suppression was negated by co-treatment with Akt inhibitor, which strongly enhanced oligomycin-induced AMPKAR pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Similarly, in the presence of insulin, moderate inhibition of glycolysis with a dose of IA too low to independently stimulate oscillations resulted in amplification of oligomycin-induced AMPK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Glutamine was required for the suppression of oscillations by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), but regardless of the presence of insulin, cells cultured in the presence of glutamine without glucose failed to recover their AMPK index and died within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that glutamine may play a role in supporting glucose metabolism, but cannot alone provide sufficient ATP in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. Pyruvate had no effect on the kinetics of oligomycin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest a model in which increased flux through glycolysis stimulated by insulin is able to attenuate recurrent ATP shortages during continued inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Akt-stimulated glucose uptake is required for bioenergetic stability in proliferation</title><p>Finally, we returned to the question of how GF stimulation and proliferation impact bioenergetic stability even in the absence of overt metabolic perturbations. We quantified the AMPK pulse scores for GF-stimulated MCF10A cells; we found that while AMPK index fluctuations under these conditions were less pronounced than in IA- or oligomycin-stressed cells, significantly more fluctuations occurred in non-GF- or EGF-treated cells relative to cells treated with insulin or a combination of insulin and EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To find the basis for these differences, we first examined AMPK index fluctuation over the cell cycle. AMPK activity was more pulsatile in G0/G1 cells relative to cells in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, this moderate difference between cell cycle phases does not explain the overall effect of GFs on AMPK kinetics: compared to EGF-treated cells, insulin-treated cells are more likely to be in G0/G1 but have a lower probability of AMPK index fluctuations. We therefore next investigated the involvement of Akt by simultaneously monitoring both Akt and AMPK in dual reporter MCF10A-AMPKAR2/AKT-KTR cells. Analysis of fluctuations in both reporters on a cell-by-cell basis revealed a high frequency of inverse events, with a pulse in AMPK index mirrored by a decrease in Akt index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis indicated that such inverse events were highly overrepresented in the population relative to their expected occurrences at random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that AMPK fluctuations may result at least in part from rises and falls in Akt activity and the associated rate of glucose uptake.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.031</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Linkage of AMPK and Akt activity fluctuations in the absence of chemical metabolic stresses.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Single-cell measurements of AMPK index in MCF10A cells in the presence of EGF (20 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), or both.

Given the extensive interconnections between metabolic regulation and GF signaling at the level of Akt, mTOR, and AMPK, intricate metabolic dynamics in single cell physiology have long been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plas and Thompson, 2005</xref>) but never examined in detail. Here, using a panel of fluorescent biosensors for key metabolic regulators, we show that individual cells experience frequent deviations in bioenergetic and signaling parameters, both during proliferation and in response to metabolic challenges. As fluctuations in ATP and NADH availability can influence functions such as DNA synthesis and gene expression, understanding these metabolic dynamics, rather than simply average or baseline concentrations, will be crucial in developing an integrated model for the control of cellular metabolism and growth.</p><p>Our results point to a central role for insulin/PI3K/Akt regulation of glycolysis in modulating cellular metabolic stability. Despite its relative inefficiency in ATP yield per molecule of glucose, glycolysis can, at least under certain conditions, produce ATP at a faster rate than oxidative phosphorylation if sufficient glucose is available; this ability is best documented in muscle cells during anaerobic activity but could conceivably extend to other situations such as hypoxic cells within a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>). The data presented here suggest that the regulation of glycolysis by glucose availability and insulin/PI3K signaling can play both positive and negative roles in bioenergetic stability. For example, insulin enhances the occurrence of IA-induced oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), but has a suppressive role for oligomycin-induced oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In our models, this difference is consistent with the configuration of the network in each case. In the case of IA treatment, where a bottleneck is imposed between upper and lower glycolysis, higher glucose input stimulated by insulin would, by mass action, force increased flux through this bottleneck. In a situation where delayed feedback drives oscillations (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), this increased flux would amplify the resulting oscillations. In contrast, during treatment with oligomycin, increasing the flux through glycolysis by treatment with insulin effectively bypasses the imposed blockade on TCA production of ATP, dampening the effects of negative feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the ability of glycolytic flux to adapt quickly may provide the ability to quickly restore ATP levels when they fall, facilitating energetic stability under some conditions. In other circumstances, the rapid changes in ATP and other metabolites made possible by glycolysis may expose the cell to oscillatory behavior, as slower regulatory processes attempt to catch up.</p><p>Because ATP plays a central role in providing energy for many essential cellular processes, even short lapses in availability can potentially compromise cellular function and viability; it is likely that evolution has selected for feedback kinetics that rapidly reverse any decrease in ATP to prevent levels from falling dangerously low. Consistent with this idea, we find that cells provided with different fuel sources (glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate) are able to adapt and maintain steady levels of AMPK activity with few fluctuations, albeit at different set points that depend on the fuel source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). However, optimization for such rapid and efficient adaptation comes with the potential that for certain conditions stable adaptation cannot be achieved, and unstable (e.g. oscillatory) responses result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>). In terms of nonlinear dynamics, such responses occur in limited regions of parameter space near unstable fixed points. Accordingly, we find that epithelial cells can be forced into persistent oscillatory behavior within certain intermediate conditions. For example, IA-induced oscillations are most persistent at intermediate doses of 10–20 μM; at lower doses, cells successfully adapt after brief cycling, whereas at higher doses, cells simply fail to adapt and remain at a high level of AMPK activity and low NADH. The conditions where we observe unstable behavior – including inhibition of lower glycolysis or mitochondrial ATP production, or culture in the complete absence of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake – likely represent situations that are unusual under normal physiological function. However, such conditions may occur under pathological circumstances, including mutations of metabolic enzyme genes or pharmacological or toxic compounds that impair metabolic function and may be important for the understanding of tissue function in these cases. In the epithelial cells examined here, metabolic oscillations coincide with impairment of cellular function ranging from slowed proliferation to cell death, suggesting that the oscillations represent a deleterious side effect of feedback control. On the other hand, it has also been proposed that sustained glycolytic oscillations could play an important role in fine-tuning certain cellular functions, such as insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodner et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies of glycolytic oscillations have measured periods ranging from several seconds to 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Rourke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tornheim and Lowenstein, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Oscillations have been recapitulated in isolated extracts of both yeast and mammalian myocytes, indicating that the core glycolytic enzymes alone are sufficient, with the allosteric regulation of PFK playing a central role. Our observations differ from these studies in the longer period of the oscillations (20–30 min in the case of glycolytic inhibition by IA; 3–6 hr in the case of mitochondrial inhibition by oligomycin), as well as in implicating a role for Akt and AMPK in oscillations. We speculate that in the epithelial cells examined here, a core glycolytic oscillator becomes entrained through feedback connections to these additional regulatory pathways that are central to growth and homeostasis in this cell type. Our data also suggest that metabolic oscillations may be a wider phenomenon than previously thought, as we demonstrate their occurrence in cells not typically considered highly metabolically active, and also find that they may occur with heterogeneous phasing that makes oscillations impossible to detect without single cell methods. The tools developed here will be of use in detecting and analyzing similar oscillations in other cell types and conditions.</p><p>Given that over 90% of human tumors arise in epithelial tissue and that abnormal cell proliferation underlies tumorigenesis, understanding metabolic requirements for proliferating epithelial cells can have profound implications in oncology research. Our findings offer a potential explanation for the metabolic advantage conferred by aerobic glycolysis in tumors and proliferating cells. Existing hypotheses for why aerobic glycolysis is common in proliferating cells include rapid ATP generation by glycolysis (though less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation), as well as increased fluxes to glycolytic intermediates for biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). We find that in the presence of EGF, where ATP and NADH are low but proliferative rate is high, cells display increased bioenergetic instability and sensitivity to inhibition of oxidative respiration, which can be reversed by insulin-mediated activation of Akt. In the context of tumor microenvironments with fluctuating nutrient and oxygen supply, such instability is likely deleterious and may create selective pressure for genetic alterations to enhance glycolysis, such as activating mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, which are among the most frequent mutations across all cancer types. Investigating the effects of oncogenic mutations on metabolic stability may thus be important in developing therapies that target the altered metabolism of tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A</td><td>Brugge Lab, Harvard Medical School</td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0598">CVCL_0598</ext-link></td><td>Clone 5E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janes et al., 2010</xref>) used for all experiments</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF12A</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:CVCL_3744">CVCL_3744</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>184A1</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:CVCL_3040">CVCL_3040</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A-AMPKAR2</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A-AMPKAR2-GMNN</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A-AMPKAR2-AKTKTR</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A-Peredox</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF10A-Peredox-AKTKTR</td><td>This paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Epidermal growth factor</td><td>Peprotech</td><td>Cat#AF-100–15</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Insulin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#I9278</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-pACC</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat#11818 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2687505">AB_2687505</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Sodium iodoacetate</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#I2512</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#C2759</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Oligomycin A</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#75351</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BKM120</td><td>Axon Medchem</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#1797</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>MK2206</td><td>Selleck Biochemicals</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#S1078</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BEZ235</td><td>Axon Medchem</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#1281</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Torin-1</td><td>Tocris Biosciences</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#4247</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Torin-2</td><td>Selleck Biochemicals</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#S2817</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Rad001</td><td>Selleck Biochemicals</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#S1120</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (synthetic)</td><td>pPBJ-puro-AMPKAR2-nes</td><td>This paper</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (synthetic)</td><td>pMSCV-puro-AKTKTR-mCherry</td><td>This paper</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (synthetic)</td><td>pMSCV-puro-Peredox-nls-mCitrine</td><td>This paper</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td>Available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (synthetic)</td><td>pMSCV-puro-GMNN-mCherry</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeck et al.

Unless noted otherwise, where single-cell recordings are shown, the displayed cells were chosen by random number generation in MATLAB with a threshold for minimum tracking time to eliminate cells in which recording was terminated prematurely due to failure of the tracking algorithm, and the chosen tracks were manually verified to be representative of successfully tracked cells and consistent with the overall range of cell behaviors. Cell recordings determined by manual inspection to have poor tracking or quantification accuracy were discarded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Imaging facilities were provided by the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School and the Cell Biology Imaging Facility at UC Davis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Albeck and colleagues use a panel of biosensors to investigate the dynamics of metabolic homeostasis in single proliferating epithelial cells in response to a variety of pertubagens. Reporters for AMPK activation, Akt activation and NADH abundance were examined in single cells and populations, over time periods spanning several hours. All three probes reported predictable responses to major metabolic stressors, and some perturbations were accompanied by oscillatory responses in the metabolic/signaling state, many of which persisted for hours. Comparing the activity of multiple reporters simultaneously in the same cell suggested coordinated, inverse oscillations of Akt and AMPK. Overall, the authors find that when cells lack access to signals promoting metabolic flux and/or fuel to supply the relevant pathways, they enter into a prolonged pattern of pulsatile metabolic activity mediated by anti-synchronized cycles of AMPK and Akt. The attempt to resolve patterns of metabolic regulation at the single cell level is the main novelty of this work and addresses a key challenge in the field of cell metabolism. Although all three reviewers found some aspects of the work interesting, a number of concerns about the relevance of the study were raised.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors provide a great deal of information about cellular responses to stresses, but need to do more to tie these findings together in a way that will effectively communicate the core concepts to a broad audience. One approach would be to simplify the Results and Discussion around the key concept that glucose availability and insulin signaling are major drivers of the ability to achieve energetic stability in stressed cells.</p><p>2) The authors need to provide evidence that introduction of the probes does not affect glycolysis and its homeostatic regulation per se compared to parental cells.</p><p>3) Are these responses common to all epithelial cells or are they an idiosyncrasy of MCF10A cells? Generating a small subset of results (e.g. induction of oscillations in response to IA) in another cell line would inform on reproducibility and robustness.</p><p>4) A key concern is that it is unknown how relevant these fine-tuned oscillations are given the non-physiological conditions used. Clearly the oscillations are most dramatic under very harsh conditions (IA, oligomycin, etc.). A comparison with more therapeutically or physiologically relevant compounds such as metformin might be informative and would enhance the overall relevance of the paper to a broad audience. Furthermore, more should be done to quantify the metabolic responses to some of the inhibitors. The most obvious place to do this would be in the IA experiments. IA inhibits GAPDH, limiting both glycolysis and NADH production, yet the data suggest that glycolysis is required for oscillations in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. It would be helpful to know, for each of the IA concentrations used, how much glycolytic flux persists in a population of cells. Measuring glucose uptake is not adequate – ideally, the authors would use a radioisotope or stable isotope assay to measure flow through glycolysis (e.g. measuring conversion of 13C-glucose to 13C-lactate). The NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio should also be measured across the population of cells for each IA concentration.</p><p>5) The kinetics of AMPK oscillation suggests that it could be driving NADH production. An obvious but unexplored mechanism is that AMPK induces fatty acid oxidation, which produced NADH. Does etomoxir or CPT1 silencing break the link between AMPK activation and NADH production?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Akt regulation of glycolysis mediates bioenergetic stability in epithelial cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Although all referees felt that the revision was markedly improved, they also felt that the issue of whether the sensors are influencing metabolism at the cellular level was not addressed thoroughly enough. The revision does compare metabolism between parental MCF10A cells and cell lines expressing the various sensors, but the reviewers found this experiment insufficient for two reasons.</p><p>First, it did not examine the influence of the sensors on metabolism at the cellular level, and specifically on metabolic oscillations in single cells; and second, although the cell lines have qualitatively similar responses to perturbations in the Seahorse experiment, the data do show a substantial metabolic impact for some of the probes, both at the level of basal metabolic rates and in the amplitude of some of the responses. Therefore it is still possible that the sensors themselves contribute to the metabolic activities they were designed to report.</p><p>A consultation including the Reviewer, Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor concluded that the paper could be considered again after one additional round of revision that more thoroughly addresses the question of the influence of sensor expression on metabolism. One way to address this concern would be to correlate expression levels/concentrations of both the AMPK and Akt sensors with oscillation frequency. Presumably you would be able to extract these data from previous live-cell imaging experiments, therefore allowing you to revise the paper quickly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors provide a great deal of information about cellular responses to stresses, but need to do more to tie these findings together in a way that will effectively communicate the core concepts to a broad audience.

We also show now that antimycin produces similar AMPK activity kinetics to both oligomycin and metformin, suggesting that this pattern of AMPK induction is common to inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP production. Because inhibition of the ETC or of OxPhos can occur in many physiologically and pathologically relevant situations, we think these new data help to increase the broader interest of the paper.</p><p>We also now include multiple experiments, including radioisotope tracing of glycolytic products, quantifying the glycolytic flux under high IA, low IA, and untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data all indicate that at 10 μM IA where oscillations are strongest, glycolytic flux is intermediate, supporting the conclusion that this treatment slows but does not eliminate flux through glycolysis.</p><p>We have also performed the experiment to measure NADH/NAD+ ratio across the cell population, and we show these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. The changes observed with IA treatment occur in a similar direction to the measurements made by the reporter. However, there is a difficulty in comparing these experiments, as the bulk assay includes all of the subcellular pools of NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup>, while the reporter only indicates the cytosolic/nuclear pool. We believe that the fact that mitochondrial NADH accounts for a large fraction of the total NADH explains the relatively small change in NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in the population assay. Because of this caveat, the modest effect size, and the more conclusive glycolytic flux measurements made by 13C labeling, we have chosen not to include this panel in the current version of the paper. However, we would be happy to include this panel if the reviewers feel that it would add significantly to the paper.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27293.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Population measurement of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in response to IA treatment.</title><p>Measurements of NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> were made on MCF10A cells following treatment with the indicated compounds for 2 hr, using the NAD/NADH Glo Assay (Promega) and the protocol of Sullivan et al., 2015 (PMID: 26232225).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27293-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The kinetics of AMPK oscillation suggests that it could be driving NADH production.

Similar to PI3K inhibitors, we find that high concentrations of etomoxir dampen but do not eliminate oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We agree that this is an important caveat to consider, and we have now addressed it in two ways:</p><p>1) We have performed the suggested analysis, which is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Using a dataset of &gt;3,000 cells we have divided the cells into bins by expression of either AMPKAR2 or Akt-KTR, and have calculated the distribution of pulse parameters within each of these subpopulations. We also show representative single-cell traces from the bottom-10 and top-10 percentiles of expression for each reporter. The result of this analysis is that the kinetics of oscillatory behavior are qualitatively similar across all reporter expression levels. Quantitatively, we observe a moderate trend toward shorter and more frequent pulses in cells with higher reporter expression. While this trend could suggest that reporter expression influences dynamics to a limited extent, the effect size is substantially weaker than the other effects we report in our study and is not strong enough to suggest that reporters severely distort the dynamics of the observed metabolic responses. It is also worth noting an alternative explanation for this correlation, which is that the cell-specific factors leading to higher reporter expression in certain cells may also modify their metabolic behavior.</p><p>2) We have taken a new experimental approach, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, in which we directly compare reporter-expressing and non-reporter-expressing (parental) MCF10A cells under the same conditions, performing an immunofluorescence time course to detect phosphorylation of the physiological AMPK target ACC. Because ACC and the AMPKAR2 reporter are both direct targets of AMPK, we expect these immunofluorescence measurements to be very similar to the reporter data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, albeit at fixed time points. As shown in the images, for both parental and reporter cells we do in fact observe an increase in pACC-positive cells after 1 hour of oligomycin treatment, followed by a decrease at 2 hours, and then an increase at 3 hours, mirroring the average behavior measured by AMPKAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, in both cell types examined, after &gt;3 hours of treatment with either IA or oliogmycin we observe cells with both very strong and very weak pACC staining, which is exactly the pattern that would be expected in asynchronously oscillating cells measured at a fixed time point. The similarity of pACC patterns between parental and reporter cells, and to live-cell AMPKAR measurements, further supports the conclusion that the reporters do not substantially alter the drug-induced dynamics of AMPK activity.</p><p>Together, we think that these new analyses adequately establish that expression of reporters is effectively neutral for the effects being studied. We have rewritten the relevant parts of the Results section to highlight our efforts to establish that our observations are not specific to the experimental system and methodology used.</p><p>We also note here that we have made a correction to our pulse analysis software; in the process of performing the re-analysis above, we discovered a bug which caused some peaks to be missed and reduced the accuracy of the scoring. We have updated all plots showing pulse scores accordingly; the affected plots are <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. The changes are very minor and none of the conclusions or statistical comparisons are affected, but we feel that it is important to use the most accurate analysis possible and to be forthright with any changes to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
