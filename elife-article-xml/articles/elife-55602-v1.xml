At the same time, <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the most frequent cause of skin and soft tissue infections. Dermal macrophages (Mφ) are critical for the coordinated defense against invading <italic>S. aureus,</italic> yet they have a limited life span with replacement by bone marrow derived monocytes. It is currently poorly understood whether localized <italic>S. aureus</italic> skin infections persistently alter the resident Mφ subset composition and resistance to a subsequent infection. In a strictly dermal infection model we found that mice, which were previously infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, showed faster monocyte recruitment, increased bacterial killing and improved healing upon a secondary infection. However, skin infection decreased Mφ half-life, thereby limiting the duration of memory. In summary, resident dermal Mφ are programmed locally, independently of bone marrow-derived monocytes during staphylococcal skin infection leading to transiently increased resistance against a second infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>immune memory</kwd><kwd>dermis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>S<italic>taphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) is an important human pathogen, which causes severe invasive infections including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, and septicemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Noskin et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>S. aureus</italic> stably colonizes the anterior nares and moist areas of the skin in up to 30% of healthy people with a high fidelity of clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Verhoeven et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and its individual human host usually maintain a stable partnership with high adaptation at the mucocutaneous membranes. Specific and lasting immunity to virulent microorganisms has traditionally been assigned to the adaptive immune system, more specifically to long-lived memory T cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2009</xref>). However, in the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, high frequencies of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific antibodies and circulating T cells do not safely protect from invasive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stentzel et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, humans and mice with global defects in lymphocyte development do not exhibit an exquisite susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, despite the frequent encounters outlined above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmaler et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, infections with <italic>S. aureus</italic> are a primary indicator of a deficiency in cellular innate immunity, that is MyD88/IRAK4 deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feuerstein et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, several studies have identified Mφ as being essential for the rapid and coordinated defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic> invading the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feuerstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abtin et al., 2014</xref>). The concept of innate immune memory, where microbial effectors induce mechanisms in mononuclear phagocytes which increase their ability to protect against infections, offers an attractive solution to this conundrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Netea et al., 2011</xref>). As an example, priming with LPS boosts resistance to <italic>S. aureus</italic> 3 weeks after injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>). More specifically, it was very recently reported that staphylococcal soft tissue infections induce a more robust immune response to a second challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanisms for the establishment of innate memory involve phosphorylation of the stress-response transcription factor ATF7, epigenetic programming through histone modifications leading to stronger gene transcription upon re-stimulation as well as metabolic changes of Mφ via mTOR- and HIF-1α–mediated aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). These observations have indeed largely reshaped our understanding of immunological memory, which can currently best be conceptualized as multidimensional and gradual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pradeu and Du Pasquier, 2018</xref>). Despite the increasing consensus that immunological memory in myeloid cells impacts on host defense, its contribution to infections in specific compartments remains unclear. As an example, certain organisms, for example mycobacteria, appear to alter transcriptional programs on the stem cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). This seems particularly important for the memory of tissue Mφ resident in submucous tissues like the dermis, which are seeded prenatally and are then rapidly replaced by monocyte-derived Mφ. In staphylococcal skin infection, the dermal Mφ subset composition changes due to infiltrating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feuerstein et al., 2015</xref>). Scrutinizing whether, and if so how, these dynamic alterations impact on the memory response of the individual Mφ and of the skin as an organ seems essential to unravel target cells and genes and to ultimately modify local host resistance. Thus, we have analyzed in an intradermal <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection model, whether, in which cells and how an ‘<italic>S. aureus</italic> memory status’ develops and how this impacts on Mφ subset composition in the dermis, as well as on the response to a second infection with the same pathogen in vivo.</p><p>We found that staphylococcal skin infection directly induced a memory signature in individual dermal Mφ, signified by the increased expression of STAT1 and CXCL9, but at the same time increased Mφ turnover by naive bone-marrow derived cells, which eventually extinguished the memory. Since colonization only partially induced memory, it is tempting to speculate on minor penetrating infections to be a prerequisite for an efficient and lasting local secondary response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intradermal <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection increases resistance to secondary infection</title><p>In order to analyze the impact of an <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection on immunity against a second infection, mice were intradermally (i.d.) infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (primed), were left untreated or received a vehicle injection. After 3 weeks, the mice were (re-)infected with the same inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Bacterial burden and myeloid cell composition of the skin were analyzed after 5 days of (re-)infection, when initial neutrophil (PML) recruitment ceased and the bacterial load was declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feuerstein et al., 2015</xref>). 5 days after infection incoming Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ can be distinguished from resident Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> cells (within the CD64<sup>hi</sup> population) based on a ‘waterfall’ of Ly6C and MHC2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). 3 weeks after primary <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, that is immediately before the second infection, CD64<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ (gating strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas <italic>S. aureus</italic> could not be cultured and PML were virtually absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Previous infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (primed) significantly increased bacterial killing and was associated with fewer neutrophils in the tissue 5 days after the 2<sup>nd</sup> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we determined the kinetics of dermal myeloid cell recruitment during secondary infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic> in naïve and primed mice at five dpi. In addition to the reduced number of neutrophils, primed mice had less Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> skin macrophages compared to naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As shown in our previous work, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD64<sup>hi</sup> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>int</sup> skin Mφ are progeny of recruited Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and will eventually differentiate into resident Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> Mφ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feuerstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolter et al., 2019</xref>). In previously infected mice, we observed a slight increase of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> dermal Mφ and an increase of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ already 24 hr after (re-)infection while by day 5 Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ were lower in primed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast to Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ, PML counts were largely unaffected one day after secondary infection. However, increased bacterial killing was already apparent one day after reinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To further explore, whether the enhanced antimicrobial properties after (re-)infection were due to ongoing inflammation after the primary infection or rather recall phenomena, we analyzed bacterial load, neutrophil counts and histological alterations for three weeks after primary infection. We found that bacteria were no longer detectable and that skin infiltrating PML, Ly6C expression and tissue edema were back to base line 2 weeks after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intradermal <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection increases resistance to secondary infection.</title><p>(<bold>A, D</bold>) Wt mice were i.d. infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (10<sup>7</sup> CFU in 10 µl PBS (primed) or not (naive)), (re-)infected 3 weeks later with the same bacterial dosage and analyzed for bacterial load and skin infiltrating PML after an additional 5 days (n: eight biological replicates representing two independent experiments).

During steady state, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ only accounted for less than 1% of skin immune cells. After secondary infection periods of 1 or 5 days, the number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal Mφ increased to 2–3% of total skin cells in wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). While this increase was absent in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> Mφ numbers were similar to wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This indicates a dynamic turnover process which is highly dependent on the respective timeline of infection. We next tested whether, despite significantly reduced numbers of inflammatory monocytes, enhanced resistance against <italic>S. aureus</italic> could be induced in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in vivo. First, we found naïve <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to exhibit an overall higher bacterial burden after primary <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. However, a rechallenge of previously infected <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed increased bacterial killing (as indicated by a reduction in <italic>S. aureus</italic> CFU), decreased infiltrating PML, and less skin IL-1β concentrations as compared to naïve counterparts 5 days after (re-)infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further investigate whether this memory phenotype could be transferred with bone marrow from primed to naïve mice, we injected CD45.1 mice i.d. with <italic>S. aureus</italic> or PBS.

We found that dermal Mφ from primed mice showed higher pro <italic>IL1B</italic> expression and more TNF-α production than Mφ from naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Thus, the early Mφ response relies on recognition of the bacterial particle, rather than on secreted factors or active proliferation. The usage of fixed bacteria allows a focus on the Mφ activation status irrespective of the bacterial killing capacity. Upon challenge of primed mice for 4 hr with fixed <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), we observed significantly more skin-infiltrating PML and Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> Mφ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and visible skin erythema in previously infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In full agreement with the above results, primed mice had increased concentrations of CXCL1 in whole tissue lysates compared to naïve counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This strongly suggested that the initial response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> primed Mφ for an increased responsiveness to the second infection resulting in the more rapid recruitment of peripheral blood cells. While enhanced bacterial killing occurs in the absence of inflammatory monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) we aimed to investigate whether Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells invading the infected dermal microenvironment were primed as well. As Ly6C is downregulated by macrophages upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolter et al., 2019</xref>), we sorted dermal Mφ from <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>gfp/+</sup> reporter mice 3 weeks after primary infection (without secondary infection). We sorted two populations, namely CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>lo</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> resident Mφ and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>int</sup> Mφ which are partly Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and derived from incoming monocytes. We found both subsets to exhibit increased expression of <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl9</italic> compared to cells sorted from naïve mice. Interestingly, the expression of both genes was higher in the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> subset, indicating that, while innate memory occurs in the absence of incoming Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> Mφ, these cells can also be primed in the microenvironment of the infected ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not find <italic>S. aureus</italic> to prime Mφ from different sources (bone-marrow, peritoneal cavity) for an enhanced secondary response in vitro as established for other effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ifrim et al., 2014</xref>).

The increased turnover of dermal Mφ was confirmed by a complementary approach employing chimeras harboring bone marrow from congenic mice (B6-CD45.2 bone marrow in B6-CD45.1 mice), which allowed to discriminate previously resident Mφ from Mφ derived from the (transplanted) bone-marrow, combined with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Eight weeks after transplantation of 10<sup>7</sup> wt bone marrow cells, mice were infected i.d. with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Compared to uninfected mice, an increased replacement of the resident dermal Mφ pool by donor derived cells was observed up to six weeks after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We speculated that immune memory would be prolonged in <italic>Ccr2<sup>-</sup></italic><sup>/-</sup> mice, in which monocyte input after infection is largely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, increased bacterial killing could be observed in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice following secondary infection in mice that had been primed 6 weeks previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right panel), while no difference in PML numbers was observed between primed and naïve mice (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>S. aureus-</italic>induced innate memory is a transient phenomenon, which is lost within 6 to 12 weeks due the replacement of resident Mφ by monocyte-derived Mφ (model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of innate immune memory during <italic>S. aureus</italic> skin infection.</title><p><bold>Steady State</bold>: CD64<sup>hi</sup>, Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> Mφ have a half-life of 5–6 weeks and are replaced by CCR2<sup>hi</sup>, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> incoming monocytes.

It seems inherently plausible that evolution has equipped this system with means to adapt to repeated microbial encounters, since they are likely to reoccur. Accordingly, it has been appreciated for over 50 years that Mφ downmodulate the response to endotoxin after exposure, a phenomenon called tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greisman and Hornick, 1975</xref>). More recently, the opposite, for example propagation of cytokine transcription by a second microbial challenge, as compared to the first, has been linked to epigenetic changes and metabolic programming. Notably, much of the groundwork was done in vitro, and microbial components like β-glucan and LPS, and microorganisms, such as yeast, vaccine strain mycobacteria and herpes viruses have been found to reprogram Mφ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton et al., 2007</xref>). Very recently <italic>S. aureus</italic> has also been shown to induce a Mφ dependent protective immunity in a penetrating skin and skin structure infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Systemic infections including those with focal onset, which are typically conceived by the host as sickness, and diffusible effectors are conceptually challenging, since they induce a cascade of multicellular intermediate events, including cytokines and soluble mediators. These, in turn, have the potential to change the activation state of distant immune cells and organs. In contrast, most challenges, which are imposed on the mucocutaneous innate immune system, include very local ground work, for example removal of bacteria or confinement to small abscesses, efferocytosis, tissue repair etc. They do not involve activation of systemic immunity. Here, we aimed to mimic this daily grind of dermal Mφ with a discrete and strictly intradermal staphylococcal infection model, in order to better grip mechanisms underlying cell autonomous priming by bacteria residing in immediate proximity. This model recapitulates the initiation of the immune response by resident dermal Mφ, the recruitment of PML and monocytes to the site of infection, the killing of bacteria and the contraction of inflammation without measurable circulation of bacteria and cytokines, and without effect on the mouse wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feuerstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feuerstein et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it differs sharply from subcutaneous <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, which lead to strong inflammation, large abscesses, dermonecrosis and bacterial dissemination to organs like the spleen, kidney and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). Another caveat of severe infection models with bacterial dissemination, for example to the bone-marrow, is the difficulty in excluding long term survival of bacteria in body niches. In the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, bacteria have been found to survive in osteoblasts from mice for months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tuchscherr et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found here that mice showed stronger PML and monocyte recruitment and bacterial killing early in dermal staphylococcal infection, if it had been preceded by an intradermal staphylococcal infection three weeks before, indicating that lasting immune priming indeed occurred at the local level. The memory effect was strictly dependent on skin resident dermal Mφ, and did not require mature T, B and NK cells, as well as monocytes. The transcriptional effects of dermal Mφ memory in situ were rather subtle, since intradermal <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection led to persistent transcriptional changes in only 65 genes compared to vehicle control. Yet, the circumscribed transcriptional changes acquired in vivo, which translated into an altered inflammatory response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> ex vivo, further substantiated the interpretation that Mφ are primed for an enhanced secondary response on the single cell level.</p><p>It seems notable that the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced memory signature in dermal Mφ comprised activation of STAT1, whereas type I inflammatory genes were not increased. It appears that the immediate innate immune response is fully resolved 2 weeks after infection in our model, as indicated by the absence of culturable bacteria, of skin infiltrating PML and of type I cytokines in the tissue at this stage. Among the signaling intermediates, metabolic and epigenetic changes which have been previously implicated in Mφ memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>) STAT1 appears to play a dominant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). It is intriguing that the STAT1-dependent chemokine CXCL9 possess direct antimicrobial activity independent of its chemotactic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Reid-Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). However, whether this CXCL9 property directly impacts on the defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the dermis remains to be established. A major observation was that substantial memory lasted for less than six weeks in vivo. This finding is in line with data from Garcia-Valtanen et al., who observed a decline in the β-glucan induced memory in vivo in a similar time span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Valtanen et al., 2017</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that ‘naive’ bone marrow-derived cells dilute out the resident Mφ population and thereby terminate immunological memory in local <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. First, monocyte-deficient mice exhibited somewhat longer lasting immunological memory as compared to wt mice. Next, we did not find <italic>S. aureus</italic> to convincingly prime monocytes, bone marrow-derived Mφ or peritoneal Mφ in vitro. In other words, innate memory appears to require terminally differentiated Mφ in the tissue environment. This is in contrast to what has been described for soluble TLR ligands and other microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ifrim et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the memory phenotype could not be transferred by bone-marrow transplantation. However, the transfer experiments showed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection led to a strong redistribution of the skin myeloid cell subsets with high numbers of infiltrating bone marrow-derived monocytes. This indicated a strong dilution of resident dermal Mφ within 6 weeks. Of note, recipient mice were irradiated without shielding of the heads, a method to protect resident cells of the ear skin from irradiation damage. This could hinder proliferation of resident dermal Mφ after transplantation and after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, when it is normally high (own unpublished data) and could putatively maintain innate memory conditions. We therefore simulated <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced changes of the dermal Mφ compartment with an additional in vivo model where we labelled specifically resident dermal Mφ, and not bone marrow-derived monocytes (own observations), with the phagocytic cell dye PKH26. We found that the normal half-life of dermal Mφ (35 days in homeostasis) was shortened to approximately 10 days after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>The skin constitutes a remarkable host-microbe interface, where micrometers decide between harmless colonization by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which occurs in up to 30% of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Noskin et al., 2007</xref>) and invasive infection. However, the physical barrier of the epidermis appears to be less tight than commonly thought, since nucleic acids from <italic>S. aureus</italic> can be found in the non-lesional dermis of up to 30% of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crisp et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we wondered, whether <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as a regular component of the skin microbiota, would subject dermal Mφ to constant innate memory, thereby compensating for rapid replacement of programmed <italic>M</italic>φ. Analysis of transiently <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonized sDMDMm2 mice hinted at innate memory effects by colonization, yet the effects were modest. However, it remains an attractive hypothesis that <italic>S. aureus</italic> gets access to the dermis via disruption of the epidermis by minimal mechanical trauma and through preformed gaps, for example hair follicles. This may propagate the dynamic and flexible nature of the dermis as a large immune organ with high adaptation to colonizing bacteria.</p><p>In summary, tissue resident dermal Mφ are programmed independently of bone marrow-derived monocytes during staphylococcal skin infection to mediate increased resistance against a second infection. However, the infection-induced turnover of resident skin Mφ limits the duration of this innate memory response.</p><p>We propose that reprogramming of Mφ serves different purposes related to pathogen-specific infection biology. In the case of colonizing or minimally invasive <italic>S. aureus</italic>, innate memory is restricted to the dermal niche and wanes over weeks. This local recall phenomenon is reminiscent of the recently reported priming of alveolar Mφ in local adenovirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, systemic spread of staphylococci like in sepsis is relatively rare and carries a high risk of death. Thus, under these conditions, innate memory is likely futile. In contrast, microorganisms with an intracellular lifestyle and limited virulence, for example mycobacteria, may induce innate memory of cells in central components like hematopoietic stem cells in order to allow for individual adaptations in host resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Dermal Mφ (CD45<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>hi</sup> CD64<sup>hi</sup> CD3<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup>) were sorted by FACS (MoFlow Astrios), resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS with antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, 10 mg/ml) and plated in 48 well plates (30,000 cells/well, Corning Costar). The next day, adherent dermal M<italic>φ</italic> were washed once and stimulated with medium containing hf <italic>S. aureus</italic> (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 50) for 2 hr at 37 °C C or with medium without hf <italic>S.aureus</italic> as control. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy micro kit, according to instruction manual (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>). For expression levels without re-stimulation, dermal Mφ (CD45<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>hi</sup> CD64<sup>hi</sup> CD3<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup>) were sorted by FACS (MoFlow Astrios), and directly resuspended in RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy micro kit, according to instruction manual (Qiagen).

Three weeks later dermal Mφ (CD45<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>hi</sup> CD64<sup>hi</sup> CD3<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup>) were sorted by FACS (MoFlow Astrios), and directly resuspended in RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy micro kit, according to instruction manual (Qiagen). Further sample processing was performed at an Affymetrix Service Provider and Core Facility, ‘KFB - Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics’ (Regensburg, Germany; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kfb-regensburg.de">www.kfb-regensburg.de</ext-link>). In brief, 1 ng of total RNA was used for reverse transcription to synthesize single-stranded (ss) cDNA with a T7 promoter sequence at the 5' end. Next a 3’ adaptor was added and the ss cDNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA, which acted as a template for a pre- in vitro transcription (IVT) amplification by a nine cycle PCR. Afterwards antisense RNA (complimentary RNA or cRNA) was synthesized and linearly amplified by an in vitro transcription (IVT) of the double-stranded cDNA template. 20 µg of cRNA was purified and reverse transcribed into double-stranded (ds) cDNA, whereat unnatural dUTP residues were incorporated at a fixed ratio relative to dTTP. Purified ds cDNA was fragmented using a combination of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) at the dUTP residues followed by a terminal labeling with biotin. 5,5 µg fragmented and labeled ds cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Clariom S mouse arrays for 16 hr at 45°C in a GeneChip hybridization oven 640. Hybridized arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station FS450, and the fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Fluidics and scan functions were controlled by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console v4.1.3 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Microarray data analysis</title><p>Summarized probe set signals in log2 scale were calculated by using the GCCN-SST-RMA algorithm with the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Console v1.4 Software. After exporting into Microsoft Excel, average signal values, comparison fold changes and significance P values were calculated. Probe sets with a fold change above 2.0 fold and a student’s t test P value lower than 0.05 were considered as significantly regulated.

The data suggests that the local innate memory may be involved, in particular mediated by resident macrophages. While priming altered the transcriptional signature of resident macrophages, such changes were transient, which was attributed to increased turnover of resident macrophages after priming.</p><p>While the issue of innate memory is of interest, many aspects of this study were hard to follow. Key controls were missing or not done correctly or experiments were not explained in enough detail, confounding interpretation of important experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important issue that does not seem to have been addressed adequately is the relative contributions of embryonic resident macrophages, inflammatory monocytes, and monocyte-derived resident macrophages to the innate memory. The authors should use an appropriate BM chimera (head protection) or another similar strategy to address this issue.</p><p>2) Many experiments were hard to follow (e.g., Figure 6D), and need to be explained in more detail.</p><p>3) Gating strategy needs to be shown (e.g., Figure 1C, D, Figure 4, Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>4) Authors should be explicit (e.g., Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> or Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macs) and consistent with macrophage nomenclature throughout study.</p><p>5) Authors should show an analysis of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> macs in Figure 1G.</p><p>6) Figure 3A: It seems like the authors treated primed mice with clodronate and naïve mice with control liposomes.

The authors should use an appropriate BM chimera (head protection) or another similar strategy to address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the relative contribution of putatively distinct tissue mononuclear cells is at the heart of the study. We acknowledge that we did not fully succeed in communicating our substantial efforts to address this question. Our previous approach was manifold.</p><p>⦁ Inflammatory monocytes:</p><p>– First, we analyzed CCR2-deficient mice, where circulating monocytes (Feuerstein et al., 2015) and, as confirmed in Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A of the current manuscript, the monocyte progeny Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dermal macrophages (Kolter et al., 2019) are drastically reduced in staphylococcal skin infection. We found monocyte-deficient mice to develop “innate memory” similarly to wild type mice, i.e. CCR2-deficient mice showed enhanced bacterial killing and clearing of infection after a second staphylococcal challenge.</p><p>– Second, we showed that a distant dermal infection (one ear) does not induce memory in the other ear (Figure 3D), although both ears are connected via the blood stream and thus circulating monocytes. This suggests that memory is induced by local, resident cells.</p><p>– Third, we transplanted bone-marrow (the source of monocytes) from a challenged mice to a naïve mice, which did not induce memory (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>In summary, we did not find any evidence for monocytes being essential for innate immune memory in staphylococcal skin infection.</p><p>⦁ Embryonic resident macrophages:</p><p>The clodronate-depletion model strongly indicated that resident cells, and not newly arising bone-marrow derived macrophages provided memory function. Yet, dermal macrophages are a mixed population in relation to origin. The postnatal half-life of the macrophages is approximately 8 weeks, i.e. at the age of 8 weeks 50% of dermal macrophages are derived from definitive hematopoiesis, i.e. are monocyte-derived. The remaining macrophages are largely derived from cells emerging after E10.5, i.e. fetal liver monocytes, which are seeded in sequential prenatal waves (Kolter et al., 2019, and Hoeffel et al., 2015. Immunity 42, 665-678).</p><p>– Methods for fate-mapping of fetal liver monocytes with the necessary sensitivity and specificity, to discriminate their function in local infection, are – to our best knowledge – not available. Moreover, many fate-mapping models rely on tamoxifen treatment, which has substantial immunomodulatory properties impaction on the course of skin infection (Kolter and Henneke, unpublished observation).</p><p>– Bone marrow chimeras do not really solve the problem, since dermal macrophages of the recipient mice before infection will already be a mixed population consisting of those derived from fetal liver monocytes and from definitive hematopoesis.</p><p>In order to make further progress regarding this point we have sorted and analyzed Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>int</sup> macrophages, which are monocyte-derived, and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>lo</sup> macrophages, which are in part prenatally seeded for the transcriptional training signature. Notably, that both previously resident and newly monocyte-derived macrophages acquired a memory signature 3 weeks after staphylococcal infection consisting of increased expression of <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Accordingly, although monocyte-derived macrophages are not essential for the in vivo acquisition of innate memory, the can still be primed to receive a transcriptional memory signature. However, the latter apparently only do so when entering the tissue early after infection, i.e. macrophages derived from monocytes entering the tissue at later stages will extinguish in vivo memory (new model in Figure 7, new Figure 6E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many experiments were hard to follow (e.g., Figure 6D), and need to be explained in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the description related to Figure 6D and have changed the language to improve clarity in several occasions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Gating strategy needs to be shown (e.g., Figure 1C, D, Figure 4, Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).</p></disp-quote><p>The gating strategy is now depicted in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors should be explicit (e.g., Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> or Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macs) and consistent with macrophage nomenclature throughout study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the denomination accordingly to increase consistency as rightfully asked for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Authors should show an analysis of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> macs in Figure 1G.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the respective information to Figure 1 as a new panel (new Figure 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3A: It seems like the authors treated primed mice with clodronate and naïve mice with control liposomes. In which case, this cannot be the corresponding FACS analysis for Figure 3B. If so, Figure 3A and B should be repeated by treating primed mice with clodronate or control liposomes, then showing effects on bacterial burden and with the corresponding FACS profiles to indicate depletion of dermal macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the description of this experiment was not sufficiently clear. Indeed, the experimental protocol was as follows: Both groups of mice were infected with <italic>S. aureus.</italic> After 2.5 weeks, either clodronate liposomes or control liposomes were injected. Infection was indicated by the red stars in the figure. We apologize for the imprecision and have changed the figure to better explain the procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors need to show PKH26 labeling specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that this is an important point. Accordingly, we have added new data (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), which show PKH26 labeling in dermal Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macrophages, but not in incoming Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> macrophages after infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The CFU is strikingly different between Figures 2B and 1C. wt is not included in Figure 2B, leading one to wonder what wt may have looked like. The authors should repeat to include wt in same experiment, or at least the authors need to explain this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the careful analysis of our data. We acknowledge that indeed the bacterial burden in higher in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> after infection than in wt mice. However, taking this basic difference into account <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice show a robustly increased bacterial killing after priming, which lasts even longer than the priming effect in wt mice (Figure 6E). In order to accommodate these facts we have changed the text in the Results section relating to Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Regarding the half-life of resident dermal macrophages, Figure 1F seems to be pointing to more dermal Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macrophage 5 dpi while in Figure 6C, it seems <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection is decreasing the dermal macrophage number. Are the two sets of findings discrepant? Again, an analysis of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> macs in Figure 1G would help clarify the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify this. Dermal macrophages are constantly renewed by macrophages differentiating as a progeny of recruited Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. Ly6C appears to be rapidly downregulated under these conditions. This, together with some self-renewal of resident macrophages, keeps the overall macrophage density in the skin stable. The half-life of the macrophages is approximately 5-6 weeks (Figure 6C and D). Notably, in these figures only macrophages resident at the beginning of the experiment are depicted and not those replacing them. In infection, macrophages differentiating as a progeny of recruited Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes quantitatively increase dermal Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> macrophages in the skin at 5dpi (downregulation of Ly6C appears to be fast in vivo during infection). This is depicted in Figure 1F. After infection, previously resident macrophages will be more rapidly replaced by “new” macrophages derived from monocytes. In order to make this point clearer we refer the reviewers to Figure S6E from our previous paper on dermal macrophage origin, which elucidates the macrophage subset redistribution after staphylococcal infection (Kolter et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 3A: absolute numbers need to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the respective data (new data, Figure 3B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
