Carbon-coated Kapton tape suffers from strong autofluorescence that prevents fluorescence microscopy, from scratches that impair EM imaging, and from the problem that it is not easily carbon-coated uniformly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2018</xref>) (a step that is necessary to avoid charging during imaging). Recently introduced carbon-nanotube tapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2018</xref>) solve most of these issues, although they require a custom device for reel-to-reel plasma hydrophilization and manual grounding of all cut tape stripes with conductive tape on top. Other non-destructive collection approaches require excellent ultramicrotomy skills and intense monitoring of ribbons during sectioning and collection onto flat substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horstmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spomer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koike et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Templier and Hahnloser, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The invention of MagC was motivated by the wish to collect sections directly onto silicon wafers for excellent fluorescent LM and EM imaging conditions without tape-related issues and at high packing density, thereby facilitating convenient bulk staining procedures with liquids and uninterrupted imaging in automated fluorescent light and electron microscopes, including next-generation multibeam electron microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eberle and Zeidler, 2018</xref>). In MagC, a piece of resin containing superparamagnetic nanoparticles is glued onto a polymerized sample block so that all cut sections carry magnetic material. Remote magnetic actuation then allows the agglomeration of floating sections in the center of a large bath attached to a diamond knife until they are deposited onto an underlying silicon wafer. Finally, the order of the sections is retrieved computationally after section collection. Two volumetric correlative LM-EM datasets of connectomics-grade brain tissue are presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Magnetic resin</title><p>Magnetic epoxy-based resin containing 8% (w/w) iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puig et al., 2012</xref>) was produced for remote actuation.

A hole was drilled in the bottom to fill and empty the bath with a motorized syringe pump. A piece of silicon wafer was immersed in the bath and was slightly tilted relative to the water level (by about two degrees) to avoid accumulation of water surface dust in the center of the wafer at the end of the water withdrawal. After alignment of the knife and cutting a few sections, automatic sectioning was started and allowed to continue uninterrupted until the last section was cut. A ionizer whose tip was placed close to the diamond knife created a very soft air current that gently detached sections from each other every few sections without impairing the cutting process. The sections floated freely at the water surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Magnetic collection</title><p>To collect the floating sections after the sectioning, a permanent magnet (cylindric, 15 mm diameter x 8 mm) was placed above the water surface with a 1 mm air gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A few sections (about a dozen) that were loosely attached to the walls of the bath were gently detached with an eyelash probe and remained undamaged. The magnet, actuated by a robotic arm, scanned the surface of the water bath, taking a snaking path. At the end of the scan, the sections were accumulated in the center of the bath. Water was then withdrawn with a motorized syringe pump, while the 1 mm air gap was maintained by lowering the magnet with manual robotic control. Two small heating pads placed below the bath were turned on when the water level reached the level of the substrate. The elevated wafer temperature generated by the heating pads (about 40 <sup>o</sup>C) accelerated the evaporation of the water left at the wafer surface and avoided the formation of wrinkles in the deposited sections. The wafer was finally placed on a hot plate at 50 <sup>o</sup>C for 30 min.

After low-resolution (5x) reflection whitefield and fluorescent imaging of the wafers, the location and orientation of the sections was semi-automatically inferred. After calibration of four landmarks, medium resolution (20x) fluorescent imaging was automatically performed on the magnetic portion of each section. The cloud of fluorescent beads (2 μm mean diameter) contained in the magnetic resin was revealed in this imagery. As the section thickness (50 nm) was smaller than the diameter of the beads, each bead was visible in at least a dozen consecutive sections, so that the pairwise similarity of all sections could be computed. Solving a traveling salesman problem on the graph of pairwise similarities retrieved the serial order (which was confirmed later manually with EM) with only a single error occurring when a high concentration of beads (1% w/w) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A lower concentration yielded more errors (0.2% w/w, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). With the same methodology, the serial order could also be retrieved using the brain tissue EM imagery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Nevertheless, the EM imagery in the dataset (and especially before and after the tears) did not exhibit the usual vertical streaks caused by knife defects, hinting at a mild temporary knife defect. In Dataset 2, no tears were present in the tissue portion of the sections. Just a single tear was present in the magnetic portion of one section (section #22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5b</xref>).</p><p>In addition, an experiment was performed with a magnetically augmented block (one section shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>) with two purposes: (i) to assess knife damage due to the magnetic resin by cutting about 5000 sections with the same knife portion and counting the number of sectioning fails between sections #4000 and #5000, and (ii) to assess the continuity of the imagery across a sectioning restart that included a sham MagC collection (see 'Materials and methods') and a 20 hr long break.

The first streak in section #1000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, panel d1) was no longer present in section #1500, but a pair of closely spaced vertical streaks appeared again at section #2000, probably at the same location (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d3</xref>). Both the second vertical streak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3d2</xref> and the aforementioned streak pair disappeared after the knife cleaning at section #2000.

Here, I magnetically collected hundreds of consecutive sections of nominal thickness 50 nm directly onto silicon wafers, offering both excellent fluorescent LM (no autofluorescence, easy to immunostain and coverslip) and excellent EM (no charging thanks to good conductivity, very flat substrate).</p><p>The high packing density of the sections collected with MagC has allowed the imaging of more than 500 sections from a single piece of silicon wafer, as small as about 2 cm x 2 cm. Such substrates are easy to handle, process, load into microscopes, and store. The high packing density presented advantages for postembedding immunostaining: a few drops of liquids were easily and conveniently deposited at the wafer surface to simultaneously stain hundreds of sections. The packing density also enabled seamless automated light and electron microscopy imaging: after loading the small silicon wafer chip into the microscope of interest and after a simple wafer coordinate calibration, automated acquisition was performed for several hours to several days without interruption.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Block orientation and use of a dummy</title><p>I tested different block orientations (magnetic/tissue parts in left/right, bottom/top, top/bottom and oblique orientations) and found that cutting quality was best when the tissue was placed at the bottom and the magnetic resin at the top. The learned precept is that the most important part of the block, the tissue part, should be cut first. However, in this configuration and with nominal cutting thicknesses below about 60 nm, I noticed that sections tended to go back slightly towards the knife edge at the end of the cutting of some sections, so that the top of the cut section covered the knife edge. This covering tended to impair the sectioning quality (compression) of the bottom of the next section, which was the precious tissue part. To solve this issue, I glued a dummy piece of heavy metal-stained resin-embedded brain tissue at the top of the block, which prevented the knife-covering effect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Quality of the section cutting</title><p>A potential concern with MagC is that the iron oxide nanoparticles might damage the fragile diamond edge, thus shortening its longevity compared to that when sectioning a block without magnetic resin. Three tears were found in Dataset 1, spanning nine sections in total, and a single tear was found in the magnetic portion of one section in Dataset 2. In the additional cutting experiment with 5000 sections, no tear was noticed among the ~1000 sections observed between sections #4000 and #5000.</p><p>Overall, neither in Datasets 1 and 2 nor in the 5000 sections experiment did major section quality issues arise from knife defects potentially resulting from the magnetic nanoparticles. The maximum number of magnetic sections that can be cut reliably on a same knife slot at a given thickness remains to be assessed, but the experiments showed that MagC is well suited at least for moderate (500 sections) and large-scale experiments (5000 sections).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Quality of the section collection</title><p>The folding or warping of sections during deposition onto a substrate is a common ultramicrotomy concern. These unwanted effects typically arise when the water surface shows strong convexity profiles produced by hydrophobic substrate portions and walls, as sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5f</xref>. The three main precepts to avoid folding or warping drawn from my own experience and from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horstmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koike et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Templier and Hahnloser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wacker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) are to handle sections far from walls, to have a low contact angle between the water surface and the substrate, and to heat the substrate. These three precepts were followed in MagC by maintaining the sections in the center of the knife boat, by making the silicon wafer hydrophilic with a plasma treatment, and by heating the wafer with heating pads placed below the knife boat. As a result, the absence of fold in the collected sections was confirmed in the LM wafer overviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and when browsing the correlative LM-EM stacks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Automation of MagC and comparison with ATUM</title><p>How far can MagC be automated? Magnetic augmentation is unlikely to become an automated procedure even though it is not a complicated manual one. It requires manual handling of the tissue and magnetic blocks, and of the easy-to-use mounting helper device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Final trimming of the block requires solely moderate ultramicrotomy skills. In comparison, ATUM solely requires standard ultramicrotomy trimming.</p><p>Thanks to the ionizer, which gently moves floating sections away from the diamond, sectioning for MagC was fully automated without user intervention. The short sectioning durations for Datasets 1 and 2 (up to only about 1 hr) did not require compensation for water evaporation, but this can be automated too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Compared to ATUM, the decoupling of sectioning from collection in MagC on one hand removes the need for a failproof collection device running concurrently with sectioning, but on the other hand, maintains the risk of a sudden catastrophic failure until collection is finished (e.g. if the magnet were to touch the water's surface, hundreds of sections could potentially be lost simultaneously). Instead, sections that are collected continuously with ATUM can be gradually considered safe almost immediately upon sectioning.</p><p>In the two main datasets presented here, detaching a few sections from the bath walls after sectioning was performed manually with an eyelash probe, which presented a small risk of damaging sections and required moderate ultramicrotomy skills. Blowing air manually with a Pasteur pipette seems to be similarly effective and inherently safer, and it could be automated.</p><p>The robotic actuation of the moving magnet was manually controlled and could be automated with a predefined scan path. Similarly, the motorized control of the water level and the magnet height was manual and could also be automated. Overall, if section detachment of a few sections from the walls could be automated, then the collection procedure starting from cutting onset until the sections are positioned on the wafer would be fully automated.</p><p>ATUM, unlike MagC, requires the additional manual cutting of the tape into strips and its gluing onto wafers. ATUM and MagC both require the acquisition of overview imagery of the sections on substrates for localization. Automated section localization is, at present, still aided by manual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hildebrand et al., 2017</xref>) but could be soon fully automated with sufficient precision, given that similar tasks of finding numerous instances of objects in microscopy images are convincingly reaching full automation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hollandi et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore a single fully automated post-collection procedure can be foreseen for MagC, consisting of wafer overview acquisition, section localization, bead imagery acquisition, and section order retrieval upon insertion of a wafer into a programmatically controlled light microscope.</p><p>MagC might therefore be fully automated with the exception of three manual steps: manual magnetic augmentation, manual initiation of sectioning, and final insertion of a wafer into a light microscope for automated section mapping and ordering.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Upscaling</title><p>Can MagC reach the axial depths and volumes currently obtained with other volumetric EM techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kornfeld and Denk, 2018</xref>), such as the ~15,000 ATUM-collected sections reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hildebrand et al. (2017)</xref>?</p><p>The first route to collecting significantly more than the ~500 sections of Dataset 1 is to collect more sections simultaneously covering a larger area at the water surface. For this, larger baths such as that in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> or even larger could handle many thousands of sections. Concerning the actuation, a conservative claim drawn from the experience of developing MagC is that small magnets (up to about ~20 mm in diameter) can carry sections that occupy an area that is roughly the same size as the area of the magnet (50 nm thick sections,~50/50 ratio of tissue to magnetic resin, 8% magnetic particle concentration). Sections did not accumulate in the center of the magnets, but rather at their periphery, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. This border effect, characterized by leaving a central portion free of sections, was also observed with larger magnets, indicating a scaling of the collection area with the magnet perimeter instead of, perhaps counter-intuitively, its area. Tuning the magnetic field of permanent magnets with special arrangements such as Halbach arrays or using mobile magnets are options to increase the collection area.</p><p>A second route for upscaling consists of collecting more sections on several wafers, either simultaneously or sequentially.</p><p>For simultaneous collection onto more than one wafer, very large baths could accommodate multiple large wafers and multiple robotically actuated magnets could parallelize the collection procedure with a final water withdrawal, resulting in the simultaneous collection onto several wafers.</p><p>For the sequential collection of sections onto more than one wafer, MagC procedures (sectioning, water removal, substrate heating and removal) would be performed one after the other. The success of this approach depends on a core issue, which in part motivated the invention of MagC: long sectioning interruptions impair sectioning quality upon restart. This half a century old restart issue remains unaddressed in the literature and goes beyond the scope of the presentation of the MagC invention here. Only recently have two laboratories, to my knowledge, built precise closed-loop knife positioning systems that could be used to investigate the general restart issue (Briggman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggman, 2015</xref>] and Hesse [iTome, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vimeo.com/album/4102790">https://vimeo.com/album/4102790]</ext-link>) labs). Even without this equipment, an additional experiment was performed with a commercial ultramicrotome to assess the behavior of a magnetic block after a sectioning restart. The continuity of the collection was demonstrated by manual inspection and by the seamless tracing of a few small neurites across the restart. Nevertheless, this continuity required the manual collection of four sections (#1,#2, #3, #6) that lacked or were disconnected from the magnetic portion upon sectioning, while it would have been possible to collect the other sections with the standard MagC procedure. This experiment did not characterize in depth nor solve the longstanding ultramicrotomy restart issue but at least demonstrated that handling a magnetically augmented block does not seem to deviate much from handling a standard block as regards sectioning restart. If this single experiment is representative, then the optimal implementation of a sequential MagC procedure would be as follows: after magnetic accumulation of almost all sections to a central place, the experimenter would have to collect manually the non-magnetic tissue portions floating around at the surface (in the restart experiment shown here, it would have been the four cuts #1, #2, #3 and #6), before performing the standard MagC procedure. This implementation would require both good ultramicrotomy skills so that these manual collection operations are performed reliably and some adjustments to the image assembly pipeline to deal with partial sections. Also, solving the general restart issue for regular blocks might come close to solving this issue for magnetically augmented blocks.</p><p>A third route for the upscaling of MagC is to collect thicker sections and to submit them to cycles of broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Templier, 2018</xref>) or gas cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayworth et al., 2019</xref>) ion beam milling and EM imaging.</p><p>Finally a fourth route, changing the magnetic/tissue ratios, might only give marginal improvements. On one hand, reducing the magnetic area of augmented sections would lead to a final section density increase (though less than two-fold given the current ~50/50 tissue/magnetic ratio), but issues arising from weaker magnetic forces or from the use of higher magnetic particle concentrations (with potentially aggregates damaging the diamond edge) would have to be dealt with. On the other hand, increasing the magnetic area of augmented sections might marginally increase the attraction range of a magnet and thus the collection area, but it would probably barely compensate, if at all, for the decrease of the tissue/magnetic ratio.</p><p>Regarding the sample block sizes, the edge lengths of the magnetically collected sections reported here are in the range 0.5–1.4 mm (Dataset 1: 0.5 × 0.5 mm; Dataset 2: 0.8 mm x 1.4 mm; MultiSEM: 1.1 mm x 1.2 mm; Video experiment: 0.9 mm x 1.1 mm). For blocks with much larger cross-sectional areas, such as whole small mammalian brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mikula and Denk, 2015</xref>), the magnetic actuation should in theory be easier because the actuation force scales with the magnetic area, while the friction force scales with the section side length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Palagi et al., 2011</xref>), but the ability to section such large blocks has not yet been tested.</p><p>Uneven section thickness in serial sectioning is common when no enclosure around the ultramicrotome is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2006</xref>) and occasional missed cuts were observed with a nominal cutting thickness of 30 nm. Most of the work on MagC was performed with a nominal thickness of 50 nm and a definitive lower limit for section thickness was not thoroughly assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, MagC solves the challenge of collecting hundreds of serial ultrathin sections with a high packing density directly onto silicon wafers.

The locations of the beads from the two fluorescent channels were merged into a single final channel. I computed a dissimilarity value for every pair of sections. For each pair of bead center sets, descriptor matching was performed (using the descriptor-based bead alignment available in Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Preibisch et al., 2009a</xref>]). If no geometric match was found for a given pair of sections, then the dissimilarity value was set to a fixed large number. If a geometric match was found, then a matching affine transform was computed and applied to the first bead set, thus bringing the pair of bead sets into a same coordinate system. In this common coordinate system, the bead centers contained outside a central bounding box were excluded from further calculations to avoid considering beads that are present in one section but not in the other one due to a limited field of view and due to the different orientations of the section. The pair of remaining bead sets was then matched again with the descriptor-based tool. For each match, that is each pair of two matching beads, the absolute difference of the diameters of the matching beads was computed. The dissimilarity of two sections was then defined as the sum of these diameter differences across all matching beads. A traveling salesman problem was formulated using the dissimilarities as distances between nodes of a graph, and the problem was solved with the Concorde solver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Applegate et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Section-order retrieval with EM</title><p>An EM section was made of a mosaic of EM tiles (3 × 3 or 2 × 2). For a given pair of EM sections, a dissimilarity was computed for each pair of corresponding mosaic tiles and averaged across the tiles to yield the complete dissimilarity between two EM sections. The dissimilarity of two tiles was calculated as follows: an affine transform matching was sought between the pair of images using the SIFT matching algorithms implemented in Fiji. If no affine transform was found, then the pair of tiles was given an arbitrary high dissimilarity. If a transform was found, then it was used to align the two tiles and a normalized cross-correlation was computed in a central box of 2000 × 2000 pixels. The value (2 – correlation) was used as the dissimilarity value between the two tiles. When averaging the dissimilarities across tiles for a given pair of EM sections, the non-matching tiles were excluded if other tiles were matching. It made the dissimilarity value more robust to artifacts that may have prevented a match from being found in one of the tiles. As with the beads, an open traveling salesman problem was solved with the computed dissimilarities that yielded the original order, as confirmed with manual inspection of the EM stack.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Imaging</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Wafer overview</title><p>The sections on wafers were imaged in mosaics at low resolution (5x air objective) with widefield reflection brightfield and fluorescent light microscopy (so-called DAPI, GFP, and RFP channels) using a Zeiss Z1 microscope.

Using a python script controlling the microscope through Micromanager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stuurman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>), landmarks were mapped to generate a rigid transform between the coordinates of the low-resolution wafer overview imagery and the coordinates of the wafer in the microscope stage. The mapping consisted of manually driving the x-y stage to the first two landmarks and clicking a button. The custom software then conveniently placed the stage at the calculated locations of the remaining landmarks for the user to adjust the exact location. After manual calibration of the hardware autofocus (Nikon, #PerfectFocusSystem), fluorescent LM acquisition was performed automatically with the same script controlling the microscope through Micromanager. Depending on the cross-sectional area of the magnetic resin, a single field of view or a mosaic of fields of views can be acquired at each section. A single field of view was used for the datasets presented here. Hardware autofocus was performed at each field of view. The channels that were used were the standard so-called GFP and RFP for the fluorescent beads, and DAPI for visualization of the coumarin dye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Fluorescently stained tissue</title><p>Drops of mounting medium (Molecular Probes, #S36937) were deposited on the freshly stained sections and were subsequently covered with standard microscope coverslips of appropriate size to cover the area of collected sections. The coverslip was maintained in place with a pair of small magnets (one below the wafer, one above the coverslip, supermagnete, #S-04–01 N, neodymium cylinder, 1 mm thickness, 4 mm diameter).</p><p>The silicon wafer substrate was placed in the holder of an inverted fluorescent light microscope (Nikon Ti Eclipse, illumination: Lumencor, #Spectra). Landmarks were mapped with my custom software in two steps: first with a 20x dry objective, then with a high-magnification 63x oil-immersion objective. The reason for this two-step procedure is that the use of an inverted microscope prevented intuitive manual navigation to find the initial first two landmarks, which would have been a cumbersome task using solely a high-magnification objective. After successful mapping with the 20x air objective, immersion liquid was added onto the coverslip and the holder was put back in the same position. The script then guided the user through all landmarks, so that they only had to adjust the high-magnification objective precisely at the landmark locations suggested by the low-magnification objective mapping. As with the bead imaging earlier, an affine transform was computed to transform the coordinates from the wafer overview imagery to the microscope stage coordinates.</p><p>We defined all imaging parameters in our custom python software: fluorescent channels (GFP, RFP, YFP, brightfield), exposure times (500 ms and 1 ms for {GFP, RFP, YFP} and brightfield, respectively), z-offset per channel (relative to the autofocus channel reference), imaging grid (2 × 2 and 1 × 1 mosaic for Datasets 1 and 2, respectively). Multichannel mosaics were automatically imaged for all sections with hardware autofocus activated at each field of view.</p><p>After LM imaging, the pair of small magnets was gently removed before removing the cover slip while taking care that the immersion oil did not come into contact with the wafer.

An autofocus-autostigmation-autofocus sequence was performed at the center of each mosaic. To avoid performing that sequence on a low-contrast area, such as a large cell body or a blood vessel, a subregion was automatically selected around the center of the mosaic that contained maximal contrast (as determined by the intensity after applying an edge filter).

The first section had only a small partial magnetic part, which nevertheless remained stuck to the second section, therefore it was still successfully magnetically collected with all of the other sections.</p><p>The timeline of the events that occurred during the collection was as follows: 1. Ultramicrotome start (00:02); 2. Cutting (from 00:19); 3. Cutting stopped (06:21); 4. Removal of ionizer (06:32); 5. Magnet scanning (from 07:02); 6. Blowing away two sections from wall (17:25); 7. Blowing away one section from wall (20:42); 8. Water removal (from 27:15); 9. Heating (from 31:33); 10. Wafer pickup (45:41).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I thank N Broguiere and H Gnaeggi for comments on the manuscript and help in the design of the custom knife boat, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see below, both reviewers value the innovative approach of the method. However, both reviewers request a more elaborate discussion of the limitations of the approach. At the same time, reviewer 2 lists a series of insufficiencies of the manuscript's presentation, which we expect to be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>In particular, the raw data should be available for the reviewers before the manuscript can be accepted. Similarly, the data should be made available (and stay available) for the readers after eventual publication.</p><p>Finally, we ask you to resubmit the paper as a Tools and Resources paper, as it is a Methods paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;MagC, magnetic collection of ultrathin sections for volumetric correlative light and electron microscopy&quot; Templier details a novel solution to a historically vexing problem -how to reliably collect hundreds of ultrathin sections for serial electron microscopic 3D reconstruction.</p><p>Traditionally electron microscopists will carefully trim and prepare the sample block so that the resulting ultrathin sections stick together in long trains in the order they were cut while floating in the diamond knife boat (e.g. Harris et al., 2006). These trains of sections can be collected on a silicon wafer by carefully nudging them with an eyelash while water is drained from beneath them (e.g. Burel et al., 2018). Templier's method avoids the complications involved in ensuring trains of sections reliably form while cutting. It also avoids complications involved in ensuring that these trains stay in position above the silicon wafer as the water is drained. He does this by eschewing train formation altogether, instead trimming the block to a point and positioning an air current source to ensure that sections do not stick together to form trains. Crucially, Templier describes how to augment the sample block with superparamagnetic nanoparticles (along with fluorescent beads) prior to ultrathin sectioning so that each individual ultrathin section will be attracted by a permanent magnet which, following completion of sectioning, is positioned 1 mm above the water's surface and swept over the boat to collect and concentrate all sections directly above a submerged silicon wafer. The water is then withdrawn, and heating pads are engaged, causing the ultrathin sections to adhere to the silicon wafer supposedly without wrinkle formation. Templier describes how section ordering can be restored computationally by imaging the fluorescent beads in LM and calculating the correlation matrix of all collected sections.
