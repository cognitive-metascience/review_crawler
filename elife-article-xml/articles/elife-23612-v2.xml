At early developmental stages, glutamatergic synapses are sparse, immature and functionally 'silent', expressing mainly NMDA receptors. Here we show in 2- to 3-week-old young neurons of adult mice, that brief-burst activity in glutamatergic fibers is sufficient to induce postsynaptic AP firing in the absence of AMPA receptors. The enhanced excitability of the young neurons lead to efficient temporal summation of small NMDA currents, dynamic unblocking of silent synapses and NMDA-receptor-dependent AP firing. Therefore, early synaptic inputs are powerfully converted into reliable spiking output. Furthermore, due to high synaptic gain, small dendritic trees and sparse connectivity, neighboring young neurons are activated by different distinct subsets of afferent fibers with minimal overlap. Taken together, synaptic recruitment of young neurons generates sparse and orthogonal AP firing, which may support sparse coding during hippocampal information processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>synapse formation</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptor signaling</kwd><kwd>silent synapses</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project 31003A_13301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bischofberger</surname><given-names>Josef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Young neurons of the adult hippocampus are synaptically activated by a small group of non-overlapping afferent excitatory fibers, due to high synaptic gain and sparse connectivity, important for sparse and orthogonal coding during hippocampal information processing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the adult hippocampus new neurons are continuously generated throughout life. Appropriate control of new synapse formation is not only critically important for the survival of the young cells but also for proper circuit function. During postnatal development, new synapse formation is initiated via activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on dendritic shafts and the first glutamatergic synapses are believed to form as ‘silent synapses’ lacking postsynaptic AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, in adult born neurons spine formation is dependent on NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sultan et al., 2015</xref>). The first glutamatergic synapses are mostly silent synapses expressing NMDA receptors but no AMPA-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>). These early NMDA-only synapses are activated during learning and shape dendrite development as early as 1–2 weeks post mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tronel et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the time window between 1–3 weeks after cell division is not only important for spine formation, it also constitutes a critical period for NMDA-dependent survival, as cell death during this period is strongly increased in newborn neurons with a genetic deletion of the NR1 NMDA receptor subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tashiro et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the functional impact of silent synapses in adult-born granule cells is largely unclear.</p><p>The AMPA component substantially increases during the following weeks and glutamatergic synapses induce AMPA-receptor dependent firing of APs after about 4 weeks post mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongiat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>). Glutamatergic AP firing in young granule cells might be important to generate synaptic output, but also to support activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at input and output synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischofberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). At this stage, however, firing of young cells has been proposed to be relatively unspecific. Due to reduced GABAergic inhibition and cellular ‘hyperexcitability’ the young population might be active under many different behavioural conditions, not discriminating between different memory items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marín-Burgin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, it was claimed that synapse-evoked firing is difficult to obtain in newborn neurons up to 4 weeks post mitosis, due to low excitatory synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dieni et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the current model suggests that glutamatergic synapses in adult-born hippocampal granule cells do not induce specific AP firing before being fully mature at about 6 weeks after mitosis. In contrast, behavioural data suggest the opposite, indicating a contribution of young neurons to hippocampus-dependent learning tasks already around ~3–4 weeks post mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clelland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kheirbek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2012</xref>), probably by improving pattern separation. The reasons for this discrepancy between the apparent lack of specific AP firing and the contribution of new neurons to learning at this young age are unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that already at ~2–3 weeks newborn young granule cells generate input-specific sparse and orthogonal AP firing. At this stage they form ‘silent’ synapses which are dynamically unblocked during brief burst-activity in presynaptic fibers. This reliably induced NMDA-receptor dependent AP firing in the young neurons. Finally, we used paired patch-clamp recordings in neighbouring granule cells to show that the young neurons can be excited by a small non-overlapping population of afferent glutamatergic fibers, well suited to support sparse coding of neuronal information already from 2 weeks post mitosis onwards.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Large NMDA-receptor dependent EPSPs in newly generated 2 week old granule cells</title><p>Newly generated young granule cells in the adult hippocampus form glutamatergic synaptic connections at about 2 weeks, mainly as functionally silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongiat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>).

For comparison mature neurons were recorded at the outer border of the granule cell layer using the same stimulation intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, ~30 µA). Whereas mature granule cells showed large AMPA-receptor mediated EPSCs at −80 mV (1291 ± 304 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 7), the synaptic currents in 2 wpi neurons were more than 100-fold smaller (3.3 ± 1.0 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6). By contrast the difference in EPSP amplitude between mature and 2-week-old cells was much less pronounced (13.9 ± 2.8 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 14 versus 3.2 ± 0.4 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 6) and the ratio between EPSP and EPSC was about 25-times larger at 2 wpi (2.17 ± 0.47 mV/pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6) compared to mature neurons (0.08 ± 0.01 mV/pA, <italic>n</italic> = 19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, synaptic responses were obtained in DCX-DsRed expressing neurons with an estimated age of 2–3 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 12), while neurons between 3–4 weeks post mitosis (R<sub>in</sub> = 0.5–2 GΩ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, yellow, <italic>n</italic> = 19) showed intermediate AMPA-receptor mediated EPSC amplitudes and EPSP-EPSC ratios. Taken together, the data indicate that glutamatergic synapses can effectively depolarize newly generated granule cells younger than 3 weeks, although AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic currents are tiny.</p><p>Synaptic activity in the dentate gyrus in vivo is rhythmically patterned at theta-gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>). To study subthreshold postsynaptic integration during patterned synaptic activity, we applied brief bursts of 5 stimuli with low-intensity (20 µA) at approximately gamma frequency (50 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). On average, newly generated cells at 2 wpi showed a burst EPSP amplitude of 30.2 ± 3.7 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 8) not significantly different from mature granule cells (29.8 ± 1.6 mV; <italic>n</italic> = 13, p=0.91, Mann-Whitney). Plotting the amplitude of single EPSPs in young and mature granule cells versus R<sub>in</sub> revealed a strong dependence on maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Fitting the data with a sigmoidal decay indicates that EPSP size reaches 50% of mature levels at 1.9 GΩ, corresponding to an estimated age of about 3 weeks post mitosis. By contrast, plotting the burst amplitude versus R<sub>in</sub>, was not significantly dependent on R<sub>in</sub> as suggested by linear regression analysis (p=0.08, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). This is remarkable, as it shows that strongly different amplitudes of synaptic currents in young and mature cells generates the same burst EPSP amplitude. This indicates that the increase in synapse number is largely balanced by a concomitant (homeostatic) decrease in excitability and decrease in the impact of synaptic currents onto membrane depolarization.</p><p>In some mature and young neurons the burst stimulation evoked action potentials (APs). Therefore, these cells were omitted from the analysis above. To examine subthreshold integration in all granule cells, we adjusted stimulation intensity (~10–20 µA) to evoke burst EPSPs with a peak potential just below the AP threshold and quantified the ratio of burst EPSP versus single EPSPs in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). As single EPSPs were smaller in young cells, the ratio of the burst amplitude relative to single EPSPs was ~4 times larger at 2 wpi (9.57 ± 0.29, <italic>n</italic> = 11) compared to mature neurons (2.66 ± 0.14, <italic>n</italic> = 20, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We further plotted burst–EPSP ratios against the membrane time constant measured in the very same neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i,j</xref>), showing a significant correlation (p&lt;0.0001, Spearman Correlation r = 0.83). This suggests that the high membrane resistivity and associated slow membrane time constant contribute significantly to the effective temporal summation of EPSPs during brief burst activity. These data show that an about 100-fold difference in EPSC-EPSP conversion in young neurons compensates for the much smaller synaptic currents to finally reach similar burst amplitudes in young and mature neurons.</p><p>Using voltage-clamp recordings we confirmed that new glutamatergic synapses onto newborn young granule cells express a relatively high density of NMDA receptors and show a large NMDA-AMPA receptor ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>). Slow NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic currents in the absence of AMPA-receptor currents constitute the typical finger print of ‘silent synapses’. This appears to be the predominant type of glutamatergic synapses in young neurons before 3 weeks of cell age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref>), whereas in mature neurons rapid AMPA-receptor currents dominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, NMDA currents in young cells at 2 wpi are about ~50 times smaller (9.2 ± 2.3 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 6) compared to mature neurons (414 ± 83 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 7, p&lt;0.01), consistent with a low synapse density at 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23612.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional properties of NMDA-receptor mediated EPSCs in young GCs.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of NMDA-receptor mediated EPSCs in presence of CNQX (top,+40 mV) and of CNQX-sensitive AMPA-mediated EPSCs (bottom, −80 mV) in a mature (<bold>a</bold>) and 2–3 week old DsRed neuron (<bold>b</bold>).

First, young neurons showed typically a single postsynaptic spike, whereas mature cells fired on average about three spikes per burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ab</xref>). Second, spike amplitude was smaller in young neurons (108.5 ± 2.5 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 21) than in mature cells (143.3 ± 1.3 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 5, p&lt;0.0001).

These results are consistent with the notion that the density of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels is lower in the young versus mature neurons. Finally, spiking in young cells started with longer delay (98 ± 9 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 21) than in mature cells (45 ± 7 ms, n = 5, p&lt;0.0001), relative to stimulation onset, consistent with the slow membrane time constant and prolonged temporal summation of EPSPs in young neurons. Notably, single stimuli with high intensity could evoke APs in mature granule cells, but never induced spiking in young neurons with R<sub>in</sub> above 2 GΩ (data not shown).</p><p>Whereas application of CNQX blocked burst-evoked AP firing in mature neurons, spiking was largely unaffected in 2- to 3 week old cells generating 1.28 ± 0.11 and 1.34 ± 0.15 APs per burst in control and CNQX, respectively (p=0.69, <italic>n</italic> = 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Similarly, spike half-duration and peak amplitude was not significantly affected. The only difference was a ~50% larger spike latency relative to burst onset in CNQX (172 ± 15 ms vs 98 ± 10 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 16). However, the most important component in young cells is provided by NMDA receptors, as application of AP5 largely blocked AP generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–e</xref>). After application of both, CNQX and AP5, a residual small and slow subthreshold depolarization remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As we were not able to block this component, we could not test or rule out a potential contribution to voltage-dependent activation of NMDA receptors in the young neurons. By contrast, mature granule cells still fired APs in AP5 in response to burst stimulation with high success rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The number of spikes per burst, however, was reduced (1.12 ± 0.23 versus 3.16 ± 0.39, <italic>n</italic> = 5, p=0.0011).</p><p>These results show that AP firing on fully connected mature granule cells is critically dependent on strong AMPA-receptor activation with some modulation by NMDA receptors. By contrast, in young neurons NMDA receptors are critically important and silent synapses can be dynamically unsilenced by brief-burst activity to reliably evoke AP firing in absence of AMPA receptors. Again, this supports the conclusion, that the lower synapse number in young cells is balanced by the enhanced intrinsic excitability. Remarkably, this can generate glutamatergic AP firing in young cells with similar probability as in mature granule cells despite a more than 100-fold difference in EPSC amplitude at resting membrane potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selective activation of young granule cells by a low number of NMDA synapses</title><p>As the young cells are very sensitive to small glutamatergic currents, they might respond non-specifically to diffuse populations of active presynaptic fibers. On the other hand, the young neurons show a smaller dendritic tree which may restrict the number of potential presynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). To address this topic we first quantified the morphology of the dendritic tree of biocytin-filled young and mature granule cells, which showed a cone-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The diameter of the dendritic cone was on average 4-fold smaller in young (86 ± 15 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 8) versus mature neurons (324 ± 17 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 7, p=0.0003). Furthermore, the height of the cone was smaller in young (127 ± 13 µm) than in mature cells (188 ± 12 µm, p=0.0037) suggesting that the total cone volume is substantially smaller in the young neurons. This indicates that the chance that an entorhinal afferent fiber might target a specific young neuron is much smaller than for a given mature cell. To assess the probability by which glutamatergic afferent fibers might successfully activate adult–born young granule cells, we varied the location of the stimulation electrode tangentially in the molecular layer at a fixed radial distance at about 50–100 µm from the granule cell layer to activate different subsets of presynaptic fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>, stimulation sites that successfully induced spike discharge were spatially much more restricted in DCX-DsRed positive young neurons relative to mature granule cells. Although young neurons could fire very successfully in response to proximal stimulation, the firing probability quickly fell below 50% after tangentially moving the stimulation electrode by a few tens of micrometers. On average, the half-width of the dendritic ‘firing field’ was about 5-times more narrow in young neurons than in mature granule cells (76.7 ± 8.1 µm versus 360.8 ± 70.6 µm in <italic>n</italic> = 15 and <italic>n</italic> = 11 cells, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Finally, the AP peak amplitude decreased with increasing latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). These data indicate that initially (&lt;50 ms) GABAergic depolarization might facilitate NMDA receptor activation. However, due to further increase in GABAergic synaptic conductance during the burst, the larger GABAergic conductances lead to reduced spike amplitude and finally (&gt;80 ms) to shunting inhibition of spiking, similar to what was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heigele et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the slow time course of GABAergic synaptic transmission in adult-born young granule cells creates a window for early excitation followed by delayed shunting inhibition.

In strong contrast to the canonical model of synapse formation, we unexpectedly found that ‘silent’ glutamatergic synapses can initiate AP firing in newborn young granule cells at early developmental stages. We identified several key factors important for input-specific AP firing with silent synapses. First, although there is a normal Mg<sup>2+</sup>-block of NMDA receptors, these receptors can generate EPSPs from resting membrane potential due to the high electrical input resistance in young cells. Second, brief bursts of a few presynaptic spikes generate large temporal summation of PSPs, sufficient to unblock further NMDA receptors generating a large dynamic increase in synaptic gain to induce AP firing. As the neurons mature, the increase in synapse number is balanced by a gradual decrease in excitability and impact on membrane depolarization. Third, GABAergic synaptic transmission shortens the time window for burst-evoked firing via depolarizing shunting inhibition. Finally, systematically activating different sets of afferent fibers indicates that firing of young cells is not unspecific, but rather dependent on small non-overlapping populations of afferent input fibers, due the sparse connectivity combined with high synaptic gain, generating differential and orthogonal spike output in neighboring young cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>AP firing by silent synapses</title><p>The first glutamatergic synapses onto newly generated young granule cells are formed around 2 weeks post mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>). As in most developing young neurons, these first synapses show functional characteristics of typical silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>). Morphologically, young granule cells rapidly grow dendrites throughout the molecular layer during the first 3 weeks post mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>). They show thin filopodia-like protrusions, which are believed to form immature contacts with pre-existing afferent glutamatergic fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toni et al., 2007</xref>). Based on these data, glutamatergic (silent) synapses at 2–3 weeks were deemed to be insufficient for spike initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongiat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chancey et al., 2013</xref>). By using brief burst stimulation (5@50 Hz), we found that glutamatergic synapses can reliably induce action potentials even in 2- to 3-week-old neurons similar to mature neurons, given that the appropriate afferent fibers are stimulated. This is surprising, as not only the AMPA conductance at these synapses is tiny and negligible, but also the NMDA-receptor mediated currents are much smaller than in mature neurons (~50 times lower at 2 wpi).</p><p>The canonical model of NMDA-receptor activation at cortical glutamatergic synapses is based on a sequential activation of AMPA receptors, depolarizing the membrane to relieve voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDA receptors. The adult-born young granule cells show two major differences to that model. First, although there is normal Mg<sup>2+</sup> block, the NMDA receptors contribute to EPSPs at resting membrane potential (around −80 mV) because the small 3% Mg<sup>2+</sup>-resistant fraction of the NMDAR-mediated conductance is sufficient to depolarize young cells due to the high input resistance (2–8 GΩ). Second, temporal EPSP summation during burst activity dynamically unblocks the remaining NMDA receptors. This is a consequence of the slow membrane time constant of 2- to 3-week-old granule cells and means that AMPA receptors are not necessary for burst-evoked AP firing if the postsynaptic input resistance is high enough. Therefore, the synapses are largely ‘silent’ with isolated single stimuli but ‘speak up’ with brief repetitive afferent activity of a few presynaptic APs at around gamma frequency (~50 Hz). The requirement for brief burst activity does not allow for spike-to-spike transmission. By contrast, this will filter out low frequency input signals and will restrict spike output to young cells getting highly active afferent glutamatergic synaptic inputs.</p><p>Silent synapses are the major type of glutamatergic input at early embryonic and postnatal developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaac et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 1996</xref>). Our results show that synaptic silence is not as stereotypic as previously thought and appears to be highly context dependent. Given that the input resistance of young neurons can be relatively high, AP firing by silent synapses might also apply to different types of neurons during early brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Connectivity with afferent fibers</title><p>Interestingly, the burst EPSP amplitude as well as the firing probability in young neurons was similar to mature cells using the same stimulation intensity. This would indicate that a similar population of afferent glutamatergic fibers were activated and responsible for spike initiation in both cell types. However, the connectivity profile between afferent fibers and postsynaptic neurons is very different in young and mature granule cells. The amplitude of synaptic NMDA-receptor mediated currents at 2 wpi was about 2% relative to mature cells, increasing up to ~15% at 3 weeks. Assuming that the density of synaptic NMDA-receptors is about the same in immature (silent) and mature hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takumi et al., 1999</xref>), this would indicate, that the density of synapses is much more sparse at 2–3 weeks post mitosis (range 2–15%) than in mature neurons. This is consistent with morphological data showing that the density of dendritic protrusions (including filopodia and spines) is about ~25% at 3 weeks post mitosis relative to the density of protrusions in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toni et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The data are also in line with previous physiological studies showing that spiking in 4-week-old immature granule cells with high Rin is limited by a small amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents in response to perforant-path stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>). This effect was even more pronounced with stimulation in the entorhinal cortex, generating much smaller excitatory synaptic currents in newborn 4-week-old cells than in mature neurons. As a consequence spiking probability was lower, suggesting that low synaptic connectivity prevents immature neurons from responding broadly to cortical activity, potentially enabling excitable immature neurons to contribute to sparse and orthogonal neuronal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dieni et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these ideas we have found that successive lateral movement of the stimulation electrode in the molecular layer lead to successful stimulation in a spatially much more restricted area in young as compared to mature granule cells. The 5-times smaller ‘firing fields’ in young cells nicely fit with morphological analysis showing a smaller dendritic cone diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), less dendrites and a 4-fold smaller total dendritic length at 2 wpi (~500 µm) as compared to mature granule cells (~2000 µm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using paired recordings from two adjacent young or mature neurons with comparable distance, young granule cells showed very small overlap when different populations of afferent fibers were activated. The minimal overlap between ‘firing fields’ in two adjacent young cells indicates that individual cells probe for activity in different non-overlapping sub-populations of afferent fibers. The requirement for brief-burst activity in presynaptic fibers will further sparsify the neuronal output signal in the young granule cell population. This suggests that different activity patterns in afferent fibers will generate sparse and highly different (orthogonal) output patterns in the young neuron population. Furthermore, our data indicate that silent-synapse induced firing can be fine-tuned by newly formed GABAergic synapses at this early developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heigele et al., 2016</xref>). The gradually increasing GABAergic conductances during burst inputs temporally constrains spiking output in young neurons by restricting the time window for firing via early excitation and late shunting inhibition - without much change in total number of spikes.</p><p>Taken together, this indicates that sparse and orthogonal firing in young neurons is much more stereotyped and robust, while firing in mature cells potentially could be sparse, but is much more dependent on the complex interplay of thousands of glutamatergic afferents with a large population of local GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dieni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications for synapse formation and information processing</title><p>What is the functional role of sparse and orthogonal firing of newborn granule cells at this early developmental stage? Behavioral studies suggest that adult neurogenesis favor the disambiguation of similar memory items by promoting pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kheirbek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, young cells show enhanced excitability and reduced I/E balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marín-Burgin et al., 2012</xref>), which was suggested to generate relatively unspecific firing of newborn cells. However, the restricted entorhinal connectivity shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dieni et al. (2016)</xref> together with our new findings, showing efficient burst firing with sparse connectivity, offer a new perspective which might solve the apparent contradiction. At 2 wpi, there are approximately 200-times less glutamatergic synapses (4*50) in young cells. Furthermore, the paired recordings showed that the sparse synaptic connectivity together with the enhanced electrical excitability generates distinct activation profiles of neighbouring young neurons indicating that two adjacent young cells probe for activity in two different non-overlapping sub-populations of afferent fibers. Taken together, this would enable highly specific NMDA-receptor activation by brief burst firing in specific small subsets of afferent fibers. As increasing synapse numbers with development appear to be balanced with decreasing excitability, the synaptic connectivity gradually shifts from a low-number-high-impact state towards a high-number-low-impact scenario.</p><p>It is well known that synaptic and extrasynaptic dendritic NMDA receptors are involved in the formation of new synapses during long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>). It was shown in cortical pyramidal cells of developing rats that a small number of brief glutamate pulses onto a dendritic shaft is sufficient to induce rapid growth of new spines, dependent on the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>). Newly generated granule cells express a high density of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors during the time period of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmidt-Salzmann et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, it was suggested that newly generated granule cells form new synapses with entorhinal boutons previously synapsing onto spines of preexisting mature granule cells in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adlaf et al., 2017</xref>). Together with our new data, this would suggest that NMDA-receptor activation and AP firing in young neurons by coincident brief burst firing support new synapse formation within a restricted number of non-overlapping sub-populations of afferent fibers favouring sparse coding of neuronal input information.</p><p>At early developmental stages (&lt;4 weeks post mitosis) there is only limited information about output synapses. However, at 14 dpi the young granule cells form already an axon with ~1000 µm length and synapses in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faulkner et al., 2008</xref>). At 17 dpi large mossy fibre boutons (MFB) in CA3 were reported, and at 21 dpi the axon length and MFB density are already close to mature values indicating that the neurons are able to contribute to hippocampal network processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence, the young neurons would be able to contribute to learning and memory as soon as 3–4 weeks after mitosis in a unique and input specific manner as suggested by behavioral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data show for the first time NMDA-receptor dependent AP-firing in young hippocampal neurons, evoked by glutamatergic synapses largely devoid of AMPA receptors. We have identified several key factors including the high input resistance, the slow membrane time constant and the slow gating kinetics of NMDA receptors, which provide the basis for dynamic NMDA-receptor unblocking and AP firing driven by a small number of ‘silent’ synapses. Finally, the enhanced synaptic excitability does not generate unspecific firing in young neurons. By contrast, it allows for a more restricted activation of the young neurons with small non-overlapping sparse connectivity, well suited to support hippocampal information processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed under the control of the doublecortin (DCX) promoter were maintained in a C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couillard-Despres et al., 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Shaoyu Ge (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study addresses a role for NMDA receptors and sparse synapse connectivity in firing of adult born hippocampal granule cells. The topic is timely and important for understanding the mechanism by which young granule cells contribute to hippocampal circuit function. The main findings are novel and should be of general interest. However, the reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. In particular, revisions are requested to strengthen the present conclusions and to highlight the significance of the new findings more clearly in the context of previous literature. Please note that points 1 and 3 of essential revisions require additional experiments. For point 3, the reviewers have noted that the authors may already have some data (biocytin fills of mature and young granule cells) that are suitable for analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to compellingly demonstrate a requirement for NMDARs in spikes elicited in young granule cells in the presence of intact AMPAR-mediated depolarization. To this end, the representative traces for the experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> should be included along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-F</xref>, and the effect of APV on subthreshold depolarization should be quantified. Also, the claimed sufficiency of NMDARs for spiking in young neurons needs clarification, given the small depolarization that remains in the presence of CNQX+APV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>2) The temporal property of spikes is noticeably different between young and mature neurons: in young neurons, the spikes appear after a delay following the stimulus train. One should analyze the spike latency to clarify the temporal differences, and also measure the spike widths to address the possibility of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Moreover, one should include detailed information on how the cell firing probability has been determined.</p><p>3) With respect to the narrow firing field and the scarce overlap of dendritic arbor to incoming inputs of young granule cells, it will be informative to compare the dendritic tree size between young and mature neurons in tangential and radial directions by including a fluorescent cell fill or by biocytin fill (the authors appear to possess such data already) and subsequent analysis of synapse density. The spatial relationship between the location of the stimulation, synapse density, and the limit of the dendritic arbor that gives rise to the restricted firing response need to be discussed (also see point 4 below).</p><p>4) The authors should provide a more accurate and measured discussion of their results in the context of prior results and interpretations. In particular, the main conclusion about input overlap appears to counter the interpretation of Marin-Burgin et al., (2012) but support the interpretation of Dieni et al., (2016), and yet the authors make little effort to reconcile their results with these prior findings. Dieni et al., (2016) is not mentioned, and Marin-Burgin et al., (2012) is only briefly, and inaccurately, described.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors attempt to compare the contribution of perforant-path (OML) vs. hilar mossy cell (IML) inputs for evoking the NMDAR-dependent spiking in young DG neurons. However, the use of DCG-IV with the intention of activating presynaptic mGluR on entorhinal axonal projections is problematic if DCG-IV also activates mGluR2 on granule cells to open GIRK channels (Brunner et al., 2013). Therefore, interpretation of the effects of DCG-IV is not as straightforward as presented. Given that the dissociation between OML and IML inputs is not crucial to the main conclusions of the paper, it is recommended that this figure is removed or strengthened.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Silent synapses generate sparse and orthogonal action potential firing in adult-born hippocampal granule cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) One should clearly acknowledge in the text that one cannot rule out the potential contribution of CNQX- and APV-insensitive depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in driving NMDA receptor activation in young neurons.</p><p>2) The interpretation of present results will be further strengthened if the results are discussed in light of previous reports that are highly complementary. Dieni et al., 2013 and 2016 showed that immature GCs have higher spiking probability than mature GCs when the stim electrode is near recorded cells but lower spiking probability when the electrode is far from recorded cells. The inverse relationship between EPSC amplitudes/small dendritic trees and intrinsic excitability, and its contribution to maintaining sparse AP firing was a main point of Dieni, 2013. Further, Dieni, 2016 also used a statistical model to demonstrate how the low overlap in afferent fibers to new neurons promotes orthogonalization of output patterns, very similar to experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The authors should articulate the main findings of the existing literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23612.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The authors need to compellingly demonstrate a requirement for NMDARs in spikes elicited in young granule cells in the presence of intact AMPAR-mediated depolarization.

Thus, we have inserted new traces to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to convincingly show this. The effect of AP5 on subthreshold EPSPs was included already as supplement previously.

Moreover, one should include detailed information on how the cell firing probability has been determined.</italic></p><p>Details about quantification of spike firing probability are now in the Materials and methods section. Properties of burst evoked APs were analysed and reported in the Results subsection “Efficient NMDA-dependent spiking in young granule cells “including AP amplitude, AP half-duration and latency as requested. The half-duration of spikes in young cells (5.2 ± 0.8 ms) and the amplitude (109 ± 3 mV) of APs are similar to previously reported TTX-sensitive APs in adult born granule cells. By contrast, spikes were much larger and shorter than TTX-resistant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes in young granule cells (half-duration 87 ± 8ms, amplitude 18 ± 1mV, Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004), clearly showing that we are not counting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spikes.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to the narrow firing field and the scarce overlap of dendritic arbor to incoming inputs of young granule cells, it will be informative to compare the dendritic tree size between young and mature neurons in tangential and radial directions by including a fluorescent cell fill or by biocytin fill (the authors appear to possess such data already) and subsequent analysis of synapse density. The spatial relationship between the location of the stimulation, synapse density, and the limit of the dendritic arbor that gives rise to the restricted firing response need to be discussed (also see point 4 below).</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the referee for this suggestion. We performed morphological analysis of biocytin-filled neurons and report the data in the Results section and in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This morphological analysis shows a cone-like narrow dendritic arborisation in young cells which is 4-times more narrow than mature and fits nicely to the electro–physiologically determined narrow dendritic firing fields.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors should provide a more accurate and measured discussion of their results in the context of prior results and interpretations. In particular, the main conclusion about input overlap appears to counter the interpretation of Marin-Burgin et al., (2012) but support the interpretation of Dieni et al., (2016), and yet the authors make little effort to reconcile their results with these prior findings. Dieni et al., (2016) is not mentioned, and Marin-Burgin et al., (2012) is only briefly, and inaccurately, described.</italic></p><p>We would like to apologize for the inaccurate references. Being more precise, we now mention in the Introduction the low I/E ratio proposed by Marin-Burgin et al., (2012), as well as the low excitatory connectivity proposed by Dieni et al., (2016). Furthermore we discuss the potential implications of our data in the context of Dieni et al., (2016) and Marin-Burgin, (2012) in subsections “AP firing by silent synapses “and subsection “Functional implications for synapse formation and information processing “, respectively.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors attempt to compare the contribution of perforant-path (OML) vs. hilar mossy cell (IML) inputs for evoking the NMDAR-dependent spiking in young DG neurons. However, the use of DCG-IV with the intention of activating presynaptic mGluR on entorhinal axonal projections is problematic if DCG-IV also activates mGluR2 on granule cells to open GIRK channels (Brunner et al., 2013). Therefore, interpretation of the effects of DCG-IV is not as straightforward as presented. Given that the dissociation between OML and IML inputs is not crucial to the main conclusions of the paper, it is recommended that this figure is removed or strengthened.</italic></p><p>We thank the referees for drawing our attention to the Brunner paper. We believe that DCG4- resistant component in the inner ML might serve as a control, arguing against a strong GIRK channel mediated effect on young GC dendrites. However, dendritic signal processing is complex and a detailed analysis would definitively exceed the scope of the present study.</p><p>Therefore, we decided to remove this figure. Nevertheless, we would like to keep a ‘speculative’ sentence in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One should clearly acknowledge in the text that one cannot rule out the potential contribution of CNQX- and APV-insensitive depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in driving NMDA receptor activation in young neurons.</italic></p><p>This is now written in Results subsection “Efficient NMDA-dependent spiking in young granule cells”.</p><p><italic>2) The interpretation of present results will be further strengthened if the results are discussed in light of previous reports that are highly complementary.
