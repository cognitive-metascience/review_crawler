Humans and mice alike experience rich active touch of the face. Because most facial muscles lack proprioceptor endings, the sensory basis of facial proprioception remains unsolved. Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but also by those innervating whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae. Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>whisker</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>touch</kwd><kwd>primary afferent</kwd><kwd>trigeminal ganglion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Kyle S</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Duo</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hongdian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS104834-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Kyle S</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Duo</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hongdian</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiology and information theory show that diverse classes of mechanoreceptors in the face inform the mouse brain about whisking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proprioception is the sense of where the body or its parts are in space. To interpret touch, it is critical that the brain also knows where in space the touched body part was at the time of contact. Thus, touch and proprioception are intimately linked during normal sensory-motor function. Touch begins with the activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in the skin. Information about body position can come from efference copy signals that report the motor commands ultimately used to control muscles. However, the nervous system contains dedicated mechanoreceptive proprioceptor endings to provide feedback about actual, rather than intended, position. Classical proprioceptors include muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ afferents.</p><p>Many rodents use rapid motions of their mystacial vibrissae (whiskers) to explore the tactile world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wineski, 1983</xref>). Curiously, the muscles controlling these ‘whisking’ motions, as with other facial muscles, lack classical proprioceptor endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, feedback about whisker position must occur via self-motion-triggered (‘reafferent’) activity of peripheral mechanoreceptors other than classical muscle proprioceptors, such as the cutaneous LTMRs responsible for sensing touch. Neurons throughout the whisker somatosensory system respond to whisker self-motion in a manner that depends on the relative position of the whisker within the current whisk cycle, or whisk ‘phase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campagner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hires et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leiser and Moxon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2016</xref>).

These LTMRs include Merkel-type endings, which are slowly adapting and thought to play a major role in perception of object shape and texture. Individual Merkel and unidentified slowly adapting whisker afferents respond both to touch and to self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>). Self-motion (reafferent) responses arise from diverse mechanical sensitivities of whisker afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campagner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>), and may be used by the brain for whisker proprioception (for behavioral studies addressing whisker proprioception, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knutsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mehta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). Neurons in the brainstem (one synapse downstream from mechanoreceptors) with tactile receptive fields on parts of the face other than whiskers can also respond during whisking in a manner that reports whisk phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that mechanoreceptors innervating facial parts other than whiskers could encode whisker motion, including whisk phase, but this has not been tested. What is the full set of possible mechanoreceptor sources of information that could tell the mouse brain about whisker motion, and how do they compare to one another?</p><p>Here, we addressed this question by recording whisker motion and electrophysiological responses from primary mechanoreceptor afferents innervating several distinct structures on the face, including regions of hairy skin, vibrissae other than the mystacial whiskers, and jaw muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We compared the encoding of whisker motion among these different populations of mechanoreceptors to that of whisker mechanoreceptors. We find that a subset of hairy skin mechanoreceptors encodes whisker motion at levels comparable to whisker mechanoreceptors. However, as a population, whisker and other non-whisker vibrissae mechanoreceptors encode the most information about whisker motion. Our results suggest that information about whisking arises from multiple sensory sources, providing the brain with a robust basis for facial proprioception.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41535.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recording whisking and facial mechanosensory afferent spiking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of types of afferents (open circles with dotted lines) recorded, grouped by type of receptive field: trigeminal ganglion (TG, beige) low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) with receptive fields localized to (1) a mystacial whisker follicle (filled black dots; e.g. black whisker), (2) hairy skin (e.g. gray patch on cheek), or (3) a non-mystacial vibrissa (red dots; e.g. black supraorbital vibrissa), and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (MeV) proprioceptors innervating facial muscles.

From these video frames, we measured several kinematic variables derived from the whisker’s angular position (<italic>θ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). During whisking, <italic>θ</italic> can be decomposed into three quantities that the brain appears to process differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2011</xref>): midpoint (<italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic>), amplitude (<italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic>), and phase (<italic>Φ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; Materials and Methods). Whisker primary motor cortex (wM1) robustly encodes <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic> and <italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huber et al., 2012</xref>) and sends this information along cortico-cortical pathways to primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the brain could use efference copy to keep track of <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic> and <italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic>. A small fraction of neurons in wM1 does encode <italic>Φ</italic>, including after transection of the infraorbital nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2011</xref>) that carries sensory information from the whisker pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörfl, 1985</xref>). However, the encoding of <italic>Φ</italic> by neurons across all levels of the ascending somatosensory system, as well as the elimination of phase signals in wS1 after peripheral block of whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fee et al., 1997</xref>), indicate a major reafferent contribution to phase coding in the brain. For this reason, and because whisk phase is thought to be a key coordinate scheme for whisker sensation, we focused analysis on the encoding of whisk phase. However, we also analyzed encoding of <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic> and <italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic> to determine whether they too could be directly sensed, and encoding of whisker angle (<italic>θ</italic>), angular velocity (<italic>θ'</italic>), and angular acceleration (<italic>θ''</italic>), as these quantities give insight into the mechanical basis of what makes mechanoreceptors spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>).

Many of these afferents were direction-selective, preferring manual deflections in either the protraction or retraction direction (not shown). A subset of these whisker afferents was more active during whisking (n = 42 ‘whisking-sensitive’ units, defined in Glossary), consistent with prior work (see Materials and Methods for comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>) and strongly modulated by phase, preferring to fire at a particular phase of the whisk cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This sharp phase tuning largely reflects sensitivity to inertial stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>). We used information theory analyses to quantify how well spiking of single mechanoreceptors encoded phase and other variables related to whisker kinematics. Specifically, we calculated the mutual information (MI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cover and Thomas, 2006</xref>), a measure of association between two random variables derived from their joint probability distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), between (1) spike counts obtained during 2 ms video frames, and (2) binned values (Materials and Methods) of kinematic variables extracted from the video frames, including <italic>θ</italic>, <italic>θ'</italic>, <italic>θ''</italic>, <italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic>, <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic>, and <italic>Φ</italic>. Mutual information between phase and spike count for whisker afferents, expressed as an information rate via multiplying by the 500 Hz sampling frequency, was 9.1 ± 23.8 bits/s (median ± interquartile range [IQR]; n = 42 whisking-sensitive units). To determine which kinematic variable best accounted for the spiking of whisker afferents, we calculated a ‘normalized mutual information’ by dividing MI by the spike count entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamali et al., 2016</xref>). This quantity gives the fraction of spike count uncertainty accounted for by a given kinematic variable.

Afferents responded to manual deflections of all small hairs or a small number of guard hairs within the mapped receptive field, were rapidly adapting, and responded to touch in all directions (not shown).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed experiments in which we cut different branches of the facial nerve, which supplies motor innervation for whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörfl, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fee et al., 1997</xref>), and observed the effects on motion of the whiskers and non-mystacial vibrissae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–K</xref>). If the supraorbital or genal vibrissae move actively, abolishing whisking of the mystacial whiskers should not impact their movement. First, in a new group of mice (n = 3), we again measured movement of whiskers and non-mystacial vibrissae, but using dual-view videography such that we could simultaneously measure motion of whiskers on both the left and right sides of the face, together with motion of the non-mystacial vibrissae on the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>).

For example, pad afferents encoded the angular position and velocity of the whiskers, kinematic variables that can be used in combination with stresses induced by whisker touch to compute both the azimuthal and radial location of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knutsen and Ahissar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mehta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solomon and Hartmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>). The radial distance of an object contacted by the whiskers can be determined using ratios of different contact stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pammer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solomon and Hartmann, 2011</xref>). However, alternative schemes compute radial distance using knowledge of whisker angle or velocity to disambiguate changes in whisker bending moment due to object location from those due to self-motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solomon and Hartmann, 2011</xref>). Pad afferents may thus play a role in supporting redundant methods for object localization.</p><p>Cutaneous afferents have been reported to be active during self-motion in systems other than the whisker system. During jaw movements in rabbits, non-direction-selective hairy skin afferents were found to respond to self-motion in a manner proportional to movement speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appenteng et al., 1982</xref>). In humans, microneurography studies have reported activity in cutaneous afferents related to movement of the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johansson et al., 1988</xref>), ankle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimonetti et al., 2007</xref>), knee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edin, 2001</xref>), and finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edin and Abbs, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulliger et al., 1979</xref>). Thus, ‘cutaneous’ (reafferent) signals of potential use for proprioception occur across a wide variety of body parts and animal species. While our focus was on whisking-related proprioception, in future work it will be important to understand the degree to which the mechanoreceptors we recorded encode other aspects of facial motion.</p><p>Using high-speed videography, we found correlated motions of the non-mystacial vibrissae and the mystacial whiskers. In rodents, major aspects of the structure and innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fundin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wineski, 1985</xref>) of the supraorbital and genal vibrissae closely resemble those of mystacial vibrissae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fundin et al., 1994</xref>). Motions of these non-mystacial vibrissae were assessed in the golden hamster, and they were found to be relatively immobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wineski, 1983</xref>). In opossum, the genal vibrissae were observed to be mobile, contain intrinsic protractor muscles, and move in phase with mystacial whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grant et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that in mice the supraorbital and genal vibrissae are indeed mobile and move in phase with mystacial whiskers. In the case of the supraorbital vibrissae, we confirm that this whisking motion is under active neuromuscular control and persists after cutting the motor nerve that drives whisking of the mystacial whiskers. The observation of tight coupling of whisker and non-mystacial vibrissa movements adds to our understanding of the exquisitely coordinated orofacial motor actions in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurnikova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welker, 1964</xref>) and suggests that their premotor circuits are linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleinfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McElvain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Afferents with receptive fields on these structures, especially the supraorbital and genal vibrissae, displayed strong phase tuning and carried information about phase comparable to that of whisker afferents.</p><p>While the supraorbital and genal vibrissae afferents encoded the phase of the whiskers in the whisk cycle, these non-mystacial vibrissae are unlikely to contact objects that are in reach of the whiskers. Thus, an interesting possibility is that afferents with non-mystacial vibrissae receptive fields could provide the brain with a phase signal that is, unlike that of touch-sensitive whisker afferents we report here and in past work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>), unperturbed by contacts between whiskers and objects in the world. It will be important to determine whether the strong correlations in phase we observed between non-mystacial vibrissae and whiskers generalize across behavioral conditions, such as during behavioral tasks in freely moving animals. Moreover, tasks that require highly precise information about the phase of a particular whisker to be combined with touch signals may require direct sensing of phase by afferents innervating that whisker itself. Whisker afferents that respond to whisking in air but not touch have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>), and could serve the role of separating contact from phase signals with high precision.</p><p>Recent reports have found that neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus can be activated during periods of whisker motion, leading to the suggestion that MeV neurons encode whisking kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mameli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mameli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mameli et al., 2014</xref>). However, these studies were limited to anesthetized animals. To clarify whether MeV must be considered as a source of information about whisking kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>) during behavior, we recorded extracellularly from MeV units during periods of active whisking and during periods of licking. We found that MeV units did not encode whisk phase nor other rapid aspects of whisker motion. MeV units did encode the midpoint of whisking, albeit very modestly relative to other afferent classes. MeV houses the muscle spindles of jaw muscles, which spike during jaw movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodwin and Luschei, 1975</xref>). We therefore speculate that these weak correlations with midpoint occur due to coordinated motion of the jaw and whisker pad, perhaps with subtle jaw muscle changes occurring at more protracted whisking midpoints (which occur at higher locomotion speeds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>). However, we identified MeV units in our extracellular recordings based on responses to licking (presumably jaw-motion-correlated), or based on a unit being recorded on the same tetrode (nearby location) as a licking-correlated unit. It is possible that MeV houses neurons that we did not sample and that encode other aspects of whisking.</p><p>Together, our results provide a quantitative survey of how much information mechanoreceptors in the face can provide the mouse brain about whisking. Our data reveal that non-mystacial vibrissae can whisk in phase with the whiskers, and that mechanoreceptors innervating these non-mystacial vibrissae, as well as a subset of mechanoreceptors innervating facial hairy skin, can provide the brain with information about whisker motion comparable to mechanoreceptors that innervate the whiskers. Whisker mechanoreceptors provided the best, but not the only, source of information about whisking for the brain to use in whisker proprioception. We conclude that the coding of whisker self-motion occurs via a multitude of sensory signals arising from distinct classes of facial mechanoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">WaveSurfer</td><td valign="top">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wavesurfer.janelia.org/">http://wavesurfer.janelia.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">StreamPix 5 or 7</td><td valign="top">Norpix</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015773">SCR_015773</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Janelia Whisker Tracker</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clack et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB 2014a, 2016b, or 2018a</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Adobe Illustrator</td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010279">SCR_010279</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">High speed CMOS camera</td><td valign="top">PhotonFocus</td><td valign="top">DR1-D1312-200-G2-8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Telecentric lens</td><td valign="top">Edmund Optics</td><td valign="top">Cat #: 55–349</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Tungsten microelectrode 2 MΩ</td><td valign="top">World Precision Instruments</td><td valign="top">Cat #: TM33A20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Tetrode microdrive (custom-built)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Fine 0.3 mm tip water-based marker</td><td valign="top">Platinum Art Supplies</td><td valign="top">Cat #: B01FWIE032</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Suture thread 8/0</td><td valign="top">Fine Science Tools</td><td valign="top">Cat #: 12051–08</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Prior to electrophysiological recordings to target the maxillary and opthalmic branches of the TG, two small openings (0.5 mm anterior-posterior, 2 mm medial-lateral) in the skull were made centered at 0 and 1.0 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to Bregma, with dura left intact. To target mandibular branch neurons with jaw hairy skin receptive fields, a craniotomy was opened at 2 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to Bregma. Craniotomies were covered acutely with hemostatic gelatin sponge (VetSpon, Ferrosan Medical Devices) or chronically with silicone elastomer (Kwik-Cast, WPI) followed by a layer of dental acrylic (Jet Repair Acrylic).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgical preparation – MeV recordings</title><p>Custom microdrives with eight tetrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>) were built to make extracellular recordings from MeV neurons.

A ~1 mm diameter craniotomy was made (centered at −5.4 mm caudal to bregma, 0.9 mm lateral to midline) for implanting the microdrive to a depth of 2 mm,~0.5 mm dorsal to MeV. Adult mice (9–18 weeks old) were implanted with a titanium headcap for head-fixation. The microdrive was advanced in steps of ~100 µm each day until reaching MeV, identified by the presence of clear high-frequency firing responses to jaw opening and/or closing.

Mice were head-fixed and placed on a linear treadmill to promote whisking, as mice whisk during running. Voluntary bouts of running were encouraged by providing subsequent water rewards via a custom lickport. On training days (2–10 days total), mice were weighed before and after each session to determine the volume of water consumed. If mice consumed &lt;1 ml, additional water was given to achieve 1 ml total. During recordings, treadmill position was tracked with a custom optical rotary encoder comprised of a 3D printed encoder disk (2 cm diameter, 20 holes) and a commercial photointerrupter (1A51HR, Sharp).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whisker and other hair trimming</title><p>One day prior to electrophysiological recording, non-whisker hairs on the left side of the face were trimmed short with fine forceps and microdissection scissors (Fine Science Tools), during isoflurane (1.5%) anesthesia. For TG recordings, all whiskers and microvibrissae were trimmed short except β, γ, δ, B1-4, C1-4, and D1-4. For improved tracking of whiskers, we minimized obstruction of the field of view by hairs that were not whiskers intended to be tracked. We did not use chemical hair remover. Fur between the whiskers was manually removed by plucking or trimming. Non-whisker hairs were maintained at this short length by repeating this procedure as necessary. Receptive fields on facial hairy skin were always on fur cut &lt;1 mm by trimming. Whisker and non-mystacial vibrissa afferents were recorded while the vibrissa in the receptive field was at or near its intact length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Trigeminal ganglion electrophysiology</title><p>Recordings from TG afferents were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, awake mice were head-fixed and allowed to run on the treadmill. The craniotomy was exposed and covered with PBS. A single tungsten recording electrode (2 MΩ nominal, Parylene coated; WPI) was lowered ~5.5 mm until it reached the TG. The tissue was allowed to relax at least 10 min to stabilize recordings. An identical reference electrode was lowered to a similar depth or placed outside the craniotomy in the PBS. The differential electrophysiological signal between recording and reference electrodes was amplified 10,000x, bandpass filtered between 300 Hz and 3,000 Hz (DAM80, WPI), and acquired at 20 kHz in 5 s sweeps. Electrophysiology, high-speed video, and other measurements were synchronized by Ephus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suter et al., 2010</xref>) or WaveSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wavesurfer.janelia.org">http://wavesurfer.janelia.org</ext-link>) software. A micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments) advanced the recording electrode until a well-isolated unit responsive to manual touch stimulation was encountered. The unit’s receptive field, response type (RA or SA), and direction selectivity were manually classified. Small manual movements of the treadmill encouraged the mouse to run and whisk. After recordings, the craniotomy was covered with silicone elastomer and a thin layer of dental acrylic. Spike waveforms were obtained by thresholding high-pass filtered (500 Hz) traces and clustered using MClust-4.1 or MClust-4.4 (AD Redish et al.). A subset of TG whisker afferent recordings is reanalyzed from a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>), as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. This subset includes 33 that were selected based on responses to either touch or whisking. Fifteen of these 33 (45%) were whisking-sensitive, similar to the fraction of whisking-sensitive units reported previously (36%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>). The remaining whisker afferents reported here were selected based on responses to whisking and therefore cannot be used to estimate the fraction of whisking-sensitive neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MeV electrophysiology</title><p>Water was intermittently delivered via a lickport tube placed below the animal’s snout. Lick signals were recorded by a custom electrical circuit designed to detect when the tongue contacted the lickport. Lick traces and voltage traces from individual tetrode wires were acquired continuously at 30 kHz (Intan Technologies). Signals were bandpass filtered online between 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz, highpass filtered offline below 500 Hz, and spikes were detected using a threshold of 4–6 standard deviations of the filtered signal. The timestamp of the peak of each detected spike, as well as a 1 ms waveform centered at the peak, were extracted from each channel of the tetrode for spike sorting, and clustered using MClust (AD Redish et al.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mapping facial hairy skin receptive fields</title><p>The touch receptive fields of TG units were identified with a hand-held probe, while monitoring activity using an audio monitor (Model 3300, A-M Systems). When a whisker receptive field could not be found, the receptive field could often be located after probing hairy skin on the entire face. In these cases, before recording began, the extent of the receptive field was mapped by determining the region of hair and skin in which gentle touch with fine forceps (Dumont AA, tip dimensions 0.4 mm x 0.2 mm; FST, #11210–10) evoked spikes and marked with a fine, water-based color marker (0.3 mm tip, Micro-Line, Platinum Art Supplies). Following the recording, the mouse’s head with marked receptive fields and a micro-ruler (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #62096–08) were photographed (13 megapixel camera, LG Stylo 2) from the side, above, and/or below. The receptive fields were then compiled on a template ‘face map’. The template image was drawn by outlining the profile and fiducial marks (e.g. eye, whisker follicles, nostrils) of a side view image of a mouse’s face in Adobe Illustrator CS 6 (Adobe Systems, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010279">SCR_010279</ext-link>). The approximate shape, location, and relative size of each imaged receptive field were mapped onto the template by: outlining the receptive field, locating nearby fiducial marks in the original image, applying a fixed scaling to match receptive field and template image dimensions, and translating to align to fiducial marks in the template image. Using the SVG Interactivity Panel in Illustrator, receptive fields were tagged with unique identifier text and their coordinates exported to a text file subsequently read into MATLAB (MathWorks, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>). Borders of each zone of the face (e.g. pad, cheek) were drawn by outlining and connecting fiducial marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Receptive fields were designated to the zone in which the center of mass was located.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>High-speed videography</title><p>Video frames (640 pixels x 480 pixels, 32 µm/pixel) were acquired at 500 Hz using a PhotonFocus DR1-D1312-200-G2-8 camera (90 µs exposure time) and Streampix 5 software (Norpix, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015773">SCR_015773</ext-link>). Light from a 940 nm LED (Roithner Laser) was passed through a condenser lens (Thorlabs), through the whisker field, reflected off a mirror (Thorlabs), and directed into a 0.25X telecentric lens (Edmund Optics). Ephus or WaveSurfer triggered individual camera frames (5 s, 2500 frames per sweep) synchronized with electrophysiological recordings. To record microvibrissa movement, whiskers were trimmed, except for the D-row whiskers used for tracking whisker movement. The LED was rotated 30° to capture an oblique view of the profile of the mouse’s face, thus maximizing the apparent length of the microvibrissae to enable tracking. To record facial and supraorbital vibrissa movements, the mouse’s fur was trimmed to &lt;1 mm, as described above. Whiskers and microvibrissae were trimmed to the base, except for the A-row whiskers used for tracking whisker movement. An additional mirror was placed in the light path to capture a side view of the mouse’s face.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Video analysis</title><p>All whisker tracking was performed using the Janelia Whisker Tracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clack et al., 2012</xref>). X-Y coordinates of the whisker objects for each frame were obtained by tracing the backbone of each whisker at subpixel-resolution. To reduce noise in measurement of <italic>θ</italic>, we truncated the tracked whisker trace at its intersection with that frame’s ‘facemask’, a curve offset from an outline of the face profile. The facemask was drawn for each frame, briefly, by fitting a smoothing spline to the contour of the face and performing several other image processing steps in MATLAB (MathWorks, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severson et al., 2017</xref>).

A simple ‘linking’ algorithm was used to ensure the same whisker was tracked across frames. Traced objects outside of the expected region of interest, for example whisker pad, and outside of the expected length range were excluded. Whisker identity was then determined based on its follicle X-coordinate in either ascending or descending order. Finally, a number of events could render individual videos ineligible for further processing. These events included objects placed in or entering the video frame or grooming behavior. Using a custom GUI, every sweep was inspected to determine if an exclusion event had occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Processing kinematics</title><p>We used the Hilbert transform to quantify the instantaneous phase (<italic>Φ</italic>), amplitude (<italic>θ<sub>amp</sub></italic>) and midpoint (<italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic>) of bandpass (8–30 Hz, Butterworth) filtered <italic>θ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2011</xref>).

Two mirrors were placed in the light path to capture a side view of the mouse’s face. Facial hair and whiskers were trimmed short except two A-row whiskers for tracking whisker movement. Displacement of each pixel for each frame was estimated by applying an image registration algorithm (MATLAB ‘imregdemons’ with pyramid level iterations 32, 16, 8, and 4) that aligns each ‘moving’ frame with a ‘fixed’ template frame. First, fixed and moving frames were resized by half on each dimension (to 320 pixels x 240 pixels; MATLAB ‘imresize’ with bicubic smoothing) to reduce compute time and file size. Next, pixel values outside of the face and in the eye were set to zero. Image registration was then applied to every video frame in the session. We then calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the time series of x-dimension pixel displacement values (Δx) and whisker position (<italic>θ</italic>) time series. Y-displacement values were not used for calculating correlations because they could not be estimated as accurately from 2D images, due to substantial out-of-image-plane curvature of the mouse face that varies along the y-dimension. Mean Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> values for each facial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) were obtained by averaging <italic>r</italic> values across all pixels within each facial region.

A small incision was made 3 mm caudal to whisker delta on the left side. To abolish movement of the mystacial pad, the buccal branch of the facial nerve was cut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörfl, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fee et al., 1997</xref>)) using microdissection scissors (Fine Science Tools). To further assay control of movement of the supraorbital vibrissae, a small incision was made dorsal and caudal to the left eyelid. The facial nerve was cut at the junction of the temporal and zygomatic branches. Following nerve cut, the incision was closed with fine suture thread (8/0, Fine Science Tools #12051–08) and coated with antibiotic ointment (Pac-Kit). Mice were injected postoperatively with buprenorphine HCL (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., Par Pharmaceutical). Behavioral recordings were conducted after at least one day of postoperative recovery. Whisking was recorded before and after surgical intervention using high-speed video (500 Hz; 90 or 250 µs exposure time for genal and supraorbital recordings, respectively) to assess the effect of motor nerve lesions on non-mystacial vibrissa movements. Whisking periods (defined in Glossary) were determined by tracking a whisker on the right, unaffected, whisker pad. Movements of mystacial and non-mystacial vibrissae on the left side and mystacial whiskers on the right side were recorded simultaneously with a single camera using mirrors to split the image.

As expected due to the relatively slow variation in <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic>, MI values for <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic> increased with bin size up to the largest bin size tested (64 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). Our goal was not to determine the maximum MI values that could be obtained based on each kinematic variable, but rather to compare identically calculated MI values across different classes of facial mechanoreceptors. The relative abilities of different mechanoreceptor classes to encode <italic>Φ</italic> and <italic>θ<sub>mid</sub></italic> were similar across choices of window sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C,F</xref>). Therefore, for simplicity, we used the 2 ms bin size that corresponded to an individual video frame for all kinematic variables.</p><p>Similarly, while MI values could be maximized for each unit by shifting the window for spike count relative to that for kinematic variables, the delay at which peak MI occurred was heterogeneous across units of the same mechanoreceptor class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3G</xref>), and for simplicity we therefore chose to use temporally aligned (simultaneous) windows. However, the exposure time for each video frame occurred in the first 90 µs of the 2 ms frame period, whereas spike counts were measured over the full 2 ms frame period. There was thus an effective delay between the mean windows used for kinematic variable and spike count measurements of ~955 µs.</p><p>To calculate ‘normalized MI’ for each recording, we first calculated the entropy of the spike count distribution:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced> <mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Normalized MI was then computed as:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi> <mml:mi/> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Glossary</title><p>‘Whiskers’: macrovibrissae located on the mystacial pad.</p><p>‘Non-mystacial vibrissae’: vibrissae that are not whiskers; includes supraorbital and genal macrovibrissae, and the microvibrissae.</p><p>'Whisking' periods: Frames with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> &gt; 2.5° and <italic>f<sub>whisk</sub></italic> &gt; 1 Hz for the tracked whisker.</p><p>'Non-whisking' periods: Frames with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> &lt; 1° for the tracked whisker.</p><p>‘Whisking-sensitive’: Applies to a unit with 95% confidence interval (CI) on mean spike rate during whisking in air non-overlapping with 95% CI for mean spike rate during non-whisking and with mean spike rate &gt;1 Hz during whisking.</p><p>‘Whisker afferents’ or ‘whisker mechanoreceptors’: LTMRs with single-whisker receptive fields, presumably which innervate the whisker follicle.</p><p>‘Proprioceptors’: Mechanoreceptors presumed to associate with muscle spindle or Golgi tendon organ structures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ernst Niebur for discussion of data analysis and Bilal Bari for demonstration of MeV recording.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;What can facial mechanoreceptors tell the mouse brain about whisking?&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ehud Ahissar (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Severson and colleagues provides a systematic examination of whisking information conveyed by different categories of facial mechanoreceptors in the mouse. The paper includes a detailed quantitative analysis of the motion of different facial regions associated with whisking and quantified how different populations of mechanoreceptors encode the position, phase, speed, acceleration and midpoint of whisking. This represents an important body of data for the understanding of vibrissa-based perception.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a timely, well conducted and important piece of work, but raised several related questions over the possible causes of the non-mystacial vibrissae movements and what their functional role might be, as well as over some aspects of the analyses carried out.</p><p>1) An important issue is whether facial non-whisker receptors really convey whisking information, or whether this is just a side effect of the facial strain patterns caused by whisking. In other words, that facial non-whisker receptors convey some whisking information may be an unavoidable consequence of the fact that the skin, particularly at and around the whisker pad, moves when the whiskers do, and that the non-mystacial vibrissae also move in a correlated fashion. Furthermore, for hairy skin receptors, except those on the pad, whisk phase encoding is really quite weak (MI equaling around 1% of response entropy). This raises doubts over whether you are really demonstrating a pathway for whisking information.</p><p>2) To address this, the reviewers ask that you provide information, either from the literature (e.g., Grant et al., 2013) or from your own anatomical analysis, about the musculature. Do the vibrissae possess intrinsic muscles? If not, is their motion primarily driven via the skin or via extrinsic muscles? Whether their motion is active or passive, and what drives it, is important for both the interpretation of the data, and for future models attempting to use these data to address perceptual mechanisms (e.g., predictions for reafference delays and amplitudes would differ significantly in the passive and active cases).</p><p>3) A general aim was to investigate whether facial proprioception relies on reafferent activity of cutaneous low-threshold mechanoreceptors: wouldn't this be better served by comparing encoding of whisker motion to encoding of other forms of facial (e.g. gestural) movement? Similarly, the hypothesis (Abstract) that &quot;redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a proprioceptive signal&quot; robust against perturbations, is only very briefly touched upon in the Discussion, but could have been fleshed out. In the absence of such arguments, the manuscript reads as a quantification of measures whose functional relevance (and biological significance) is unclear.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that the non-whisker vibrissae can &quot;provide the brain with a phase signal that is.… unperturbed by contacts&quot;. While this is in general correct, the authors should consider the reliability of the signal and its relevance to various tasks. Signals from the non-whisker vibrissae may vary significantly in different conditions, such as head-fixed versus freely moving versus palpating an object. Also, importantly, they would not be accurate enough to allow the determination of fine spatial phases (as with fine textures, for example) during palpation, a determination that should require a tight coupling between the phase/angular coding and contact coding in the same whisker (as whiskers are not strongly coupled in such cases). This point should be addressed in the paper, at least by discussing it and suggesting future experiments.</p><p>5) Can you identify ways in which the additional information provided by non-whisker coders might resolve ambiguities or become important? Perhaps different receptors might represent different aspects of the sensory signal, e.g. filtered over a particular frequency range. Or, given that you partially tracked facial movement, can you tell whether some receptors encoded cutaneous facial movement (over e.g. a particular dimension) better than whisking, i.e., can you quantitatively compare information about different forms of movement? If the whiskers are primarily driven passively through pad motion, might their signals be used to differentiate lateral from axial forces in contacting whiskers? Further discussion of how the coding of whisker speed might be used is also merited.</p><p>6) Another major issue is more technical and concerns the MI calculations. How safe are they against biases from limited sampling? How many observations per bin typically went into the analysis? How do MI values vary if one subsamples from the observations? Did the 2 ms resolution of sampling windows (equal to the experimental resolution, 1/500 Hz) take into account sampling considerations – i.e. given that kinematics were filtered &lt; 30 Hz, and only varied slowly over 2 ms, would using a longer sampling window affect the calculations? Did you incorporate a delay between the stimulus and response windows, or did you take them to be simultaneous? If the latter, how did you account for response latency – wouldn't it be useful to set a gap between the windows, determined by maximizing MI as a function of gap length for a couple of experiments and then fixing across each data set?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41535.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a timely, well conducted and important piece of work, but raised several related questions over the possible causes of the non-mystacial vibrissae movements and what their functional role might be, as well as over some aspects of the analyses carried out.</p><p>1) An important issue is whether facial non-whisker receptors really convey whisking information, or whether this is just a side effect of the facial strain patterns caused by whisking.

In short, for the supraorbital vibrissae, whisking is under active neuromuscular control separate from the mystacial whiskers, and therefore coding by supraorbital afferents is not an unavoidable, passive consequence of whisker motion.</p><p>However, a major goal was to determine both what is and what is <italic>not</italic> a plausible source of information about whisking, in the interest of “killing the problem” (e.g. although MeV neurons have been proposed as encoders of whisker kinematics, we find that they are active during whisking but transmit limited information about rapid aspects of whisker motion). By directly comparing whisker afferent signals to those from a nearly exhaustive survey of alternative possibilities, our work provides essential context for future studies that focus on sensory signals arising from the whiskers. For instance, while past work has addressed proprioceptive sensing by the whisker afferents, a comprehensive survey such as ours is a prerequisite to answering the question: “How can mice know where their whiskers are?” We agree that for many (but not all) hairy skin mechanoreceptors, their activity is unlikely providing a useful pathway of whisker-related information. However, the exceptions – especially pad afferents – are strong encoders of whisking kinematics and thus may be of functional importance, as detailed in the manuscript and in our responses below. The fact that we found any hairy skin mechanoreceptors that strongly encode whisking kinematics is likely to be surprising to many readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To address this, the reviewers ask that you provide information, either from the literature (e.g., Grant et al., 2013) or from your own anatomical analysis, about the musculature.

We agree this is an important question. Rather than examining the musculature, we have addressed this point using an alternative strategy that we believe more directly probes the active/passive distinction, and which we hope the reviewers and Editor find satisfying. Specifically, we performed a series of new experiments in which we sequentially cut branches of the facial motor nerve, together with dual-view high-speed videography, to determine whether supraorbital and genal vibrissae motion depends on the motion of the mystacial whiskers.</p><p>The results show that the supraorbital vibrissae, but possibly not the genal vibrissae, are under separate and active neuromuscular control vis-à-vis the whiskers. These new experiments are summarized in Figure 4G and depicted in more detail in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-K and in Videos 6-7.</p><p>(We recommend viewing Video 6, in particular, as the quickest way to appreciate the results of these experiments.)</p><p>We have added a paragraph describing these new experiments to the Results:</p><p>“The motion of supraorbital and genal vibrissae could occur under active neuromuscular control, or passively due to mechanical coupling with the moving mystacial pad. […] Thus, genal vibrissae motion is passive or dependent on the buccal innervation of the whisker pad, whereas whisking by the supraorbital vibrissae is active and under neuromuscular control separate from the mystacial whiskers.”</p><p>In the Discussion, we cite the Grant et al. work and discuss our new results by changing:</p><p>“Here, we show that in mice, supraorbital and genal vibrissae are indeed mobile and whisk in phase with the whiskers.”</p><p>to:</p><p>“…In opossum, the genal vibrissae were observed to be mobile, contain intrinsic protractor muscles, and move in phase with mystacial whiskers (Grant et al., 2013). […] In the case of the supraorbital vibrissae, we confirm that this whisking motion is under active neuromuscular control and persists after cutting the motor nerve that drives whisking of the mystacial whiskers.”</p><p>The methods for these nerve cut experiments are described in the Materials and methods section titled “Facial nerve lesion experiments”:</p><p>“Facial nerve lesion experiments. Mice were injected preoperatively with ketoprofen (5 mg/ml, s.c., Ketofen) to reduce inflammation and lidocaine (5%, s.c., Vedco) to anesthetize the area around the incision. A small incision was made 3 mm caudal to whisker delta on the left side. […] Nerve cut experiments were performed on 3 mice, with 15 total videographic recording sessions: for each mouse, first 2 sessions under control conditions, then 2 sessions after buccal branch cut, then 1 session after the temporal/zygomatic cut.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A general aim was to investigate whether facial proprioception relies on reafferent activity of cutaneous low-threshold mechanoreceptors: wouldn't this be better served by comparing encoding of whisker motion to encoding of other forms of facial (e.g. gestural) movement?

In the absence of such arguments, the manuscript reads as a quantification of measures whose functional relevance (and biological significance) is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a comparison of encoding of whisking kinematics and other aspects of facial motion by individual units would be highly interesting, but this analysis would require us to reacquire essentially our full dataset with new videographic methods. This is because we did not simultaneously record unit activity and high-speed video of facial motions other than whisking (with video tailored to vibrissae motion, not general face motion). We now acknowledge the importance of such a comparison as part of future work in the Discussion:</p><p>“While our focus was on whisking-related proprioception, in future work it will be important to understand the degree to which the mechanoreceptors we recorded encode other aspects of facial motion.”</p><p>We have added two paragraphs to the Discussion, in response to points 4 and 5 that also address this point – specifically that flesh out discussion of biological significance. Please see our responses to points 4 and 5 below for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest that the non-whisker vibrissae can &quot;provide the brain with a phase signal that is.… unperturbed by contacts&quot;. While this is in general correct, the authors should consider the reliability of the signal and its relevance to various tasks. Signals from the non-whisker vibrissae may vary significantly in different conditions, such as head-fixed versus freely moving versus palpating an object. Also, importantly, they would not be accurate enough to allow the determination of fine spatial phases (as with fine textures, for example) during palpation, a determination that should require a tight coupling between the phase/angular coding and contact coding in the same whisker (as whiskers are not strongly coupled in such cases). This point should be addressed in the paper, at least by discussing it and suggesting future experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point. We have discussed this issue now by changing:</p><p>“While these afferents encode the phase of the whiskers in the whisk cycle, the supraorbital and genal vibrissae are unlikely to contact objects that are in reach of the whiskers. […] Alternatively, whisker afferents that respond to whisking in air but not touch have also been found and could serve this role (Szwed et al., 2003).”</p><p>To:</p><p>“While the supraorbital and genal vibrissae afferents encoded the phase of the whiskers in the whisk cycle, these non-mystacial vibrissae are unlikely to contact objects that are in reach of the whiskers. […] Whisker afferents that respond to whisking in air but not touch have been found (Szwed et al., 2003), and could serve the role of separating contact from phase signals with high precision.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can you identify ways in which the additional information provided by non-whisker coders might resolve ambiguities or become important? Perhaps different receptors might represent different aspects of the sensory signal, e.g. filtered over a particular frequency range. Or, given that you partially tracked facial movement, can you tell whether some receptors encoded cutaneous facial movement (over e.g. a particular dimension) better than whisking, i.e., can you quantitatively compare information about different forms of movement? If the whiskers are primarily driven passively through pad motion, might their signals be used to differentiate lateral from axial forces in contacting whiskers? Further discussion of how the coding of whisker speed might be used is also merited.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to point #3, we did not collect simultaneous facial motion data and neural recordings, so cannot quantitively compare the encoding of whisker motion with other aspects of facial motion. Doing so would require acquisition of a substantial new dataset in which we record both whisker video and facial motion video together with electrophysiology. However, we have added further discussion of how non-whisker coders may disambiguate sensory signals, and of the coding of whisker speed. Specifically, we added this paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Mechanoreceptors with receptive fields on the whisker pad were especially informative about whisker kinematics, presumably because of their proximity to the whiskers and the fact that motion of the whisker pad itself is an integral part of whisking (Hill et al., 2008). […] Pad afferents may thus play a role in supporting redundant methods for object localization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Another major issue is more technical and concerns the MI calculations. How safe are they against biases from limited sampling? How many observations per bin typically went into the analysis? How do MI values vary if one subsamples from the observations? Did the 2 ms resolution of sampling windows (equal to the experimental resolution, 1/500 Hz) take into account sampling considerations – i.e. given that kinematics were filtered &lt; 30 Hz, and only varied slowly over 2 ms, would using a longer sampling window affect the calculations? Did you incorporate a delay between the stimulus and response windows, or did you take them to be simultaneous? If the latter, how did you account for response latency – wouldn't it be useful to set a gap between the windows, determined by maximizing MI as a function of gap length for a couple of experiments and then fixing across each data set?</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted new analyses to address these points, which are shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 2 deals with the issue of limited sample sizes. It depicts the number of video frames (samples) that go into the MI calculations for each unit (on average, 12,552 frames per bin; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C, E), and shows the results of analyses in which we obtained bootstrap confidence intervals on the MI values for each unit (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, D), as well as plotted the width of the 95% confidence interval as a function of the number of video frames per bin for each unit (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, E). These figure panels also depict the MI values (with confidence intervals) alongside the corresponding MI values calculated after randomly shuffling spike count and kinematic variable quantities with respect to one another. Together, the results shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2 make it clear that our results are not sensitive to biases from limited sampling. For example, in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A the MI values for all units are shown with 95% CI and grouped by unit type, and it is evident that phase coding by whisker and non-mystacial units is, as populations, superior to that of other classes.</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 3 deals with the issue of the size of sampling windows, and the offset between windows used to quantify spike count and kinematic variable values. Regarding bin size for MI calculations, MI values were not much affected by small changes in bin size for phase (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B). As expected due to the slowly varying nature of midpoint, MI values for midpoint increased with increasing bin sizes. However, our goal was not to determine the maximum MI values that could be obtained based on each kinematic variable, but rather to compare identically calculated MI values across different classes of facial mechanoreceptors. Therefore, for simplicity, in the text we used the 2 ms bin size that corresponded to an individual video frame for all kinematic variables. Figure 6—figure supplement 3 does however show MI values for phase and midpoint separately for each unit across several bin sizes and grouped by mechanoreceptor class, for those readers who prefer to examine the results using choices of other bin sizes.</p><p>Similarly, we now show the MI values for phase across multiple offsets between the windows used for kinematic variable estimation and spike counting, separately for each unit and grouped by mechanoreceptor class. In the main text and figures, however, we use simultaneous windows. We made this choice in part because the offset that maximized MI was heterogeneous across individual units, even for those of the same mechanoreceptor class, and an ideal offset to use for each class was not obvious. While the brain could in principle keep track of a separate delay for each unit, this would imply a much more complicated decoding model. We do however note that there was a built-in delay of ~955 microseconds from the mean of the window used to estimate kinematic variables and the mean of the window used to count spikes (which we now explain in the Materials and methods). For comparison, the typical conduction delay for an A-beta afferent over the roughly centimeter distance separating its termination in the skin to the recording site in the trigeminal ganglion is ~200 microseconds. Thus, our use of “simultaneous” windows corresponding to the 2 ms frame period actually includes a delay substantially longer than the conduction delay, leaving a bit of time for mechanical and transduction delays.</p><p>We describe these new analyses and figures in the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Confidence intervals on the MI values for each unit (Figure 5E, Figure 6—figure supplement 2) were obtained by bootstrap after resampling frames with replacement and recalculating MI for 1000 iterations. […] There was thus an effective delay between the mean windows used for kinematic variable and spike count measurements of ~955 µs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
