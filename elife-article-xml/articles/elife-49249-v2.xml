spindle orientation balances proliferation and differentiation. In the developing murine epidermis, planar and perpendicular divisions yield symmetric and asymmetric fate outcomes, respectively. Classically, division axis specification involves centrosome migration and spindle rotation, events occurring early in mitosis. Here, we identify a novel orientation mechanism which corrects erroneous anaphase orientations during telophase. The directionality of reorientation correlates with the maintenance or loss of basal contact by the apical daughter. While the scaffolding protein LGN is known to determine initial spindle positioning, we show that LGN also functions during telophase to reorient oblique divisions toward perpendicular. The fidelity of telophase correction also relies on the tension-sensitive adherens junction proteins vinculin, α-E-catenin, and afadin. Failure of this corrective mechanism impacts tissue architecture, as persistent oblique divisions induce precocious, sustained differentiation. The division orientation plasticity provided by telophase correction may enable progenitors to adapt to local tissue needs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oriented cell division</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>epidermal differentiation</kwd><kwd>adherens junction</kwd><kwd>cell-cell adhesion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship F31 DE026956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lough</surname><given-names>Kendall J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award K08 DE026537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrd</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006156</institution-id><institution>Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award SKF-15-165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Telophase reorientation corrects errors in spindle orientation that persist after imprecise initial spindle positioning during early mitosis, and contributes to balancing self-renewal with differentiation during epidermal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem and progenitor cells utilize asymmetric cell divisions to balance self-renewal and differentiation. Cell fate decisions can be influenced by the division axis, with the choice between symmetric and asymmetric fate outcomes dictated by positioning of the mitotic spindle. Mechanistically, precise control of division orientation may serve to equally or unequally partition fate determinants, or restrict access to a stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>). Errors in division orientation can lead to defects in differentiation and cell identity, with the potential to drive overgrowths associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumüller and Knoblich, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The developing murine epidermis serves as an excellent model for studying how oriented cell divisions direct cell fate choices. Basal progenitors are capable of dividing either within the plane of the epithelium or perpendicular to it, resulting in symmetric or asymmetric divisions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smart, 1970</xref>). This process is governed by a conserved complex of spindle orienting proteins, including the essential linker LGN/Gpsm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). During epidermal and oral epithelial stratification, LGN is recruited to the apical cortex in ~50% of mitoses, and LGN loss leads to increased planar divisions and severe differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a parsimonious explanation for the observed bimodal distribution of division angles is that perpendicular divisions occur when sufficient levels of LGN are recruited to the apical cortex during early mitosis, and planar divisions occur when this apical recruitment fails.</p><p>In this and other models, it is assumed that the division axis is established relatively early in mitosis, either through directed centrosome migration or spindle rotation. As an example of the former, in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> testis and larval neuroblasts, one centrosome migrates to the opposite side of the cell during prophase, and the metaphase spindle forms along, and remains fixed by, this centrosomal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rebollo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). In other systems—including the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryonic neuroblasts, and progenitors of the vertebrate neuroepithelia—the spindle dynamically rotates during metaphase to align with extrinsic niche-derived or intrinsic polarity cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geldmacher-Voss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hyman and White, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaltschmidt et al., 2000</xref>). Collectively, these studies support the view that spindle orientation generally operates prior to anaphase onset.</p><p>On the other hand, there are hints from other studies that the metaphase-anaphase transition involves dynamic reorganization of the spindle orientation machinery. For example, in HeLa cells it has been shown that while LGN is essential for NuMA localization during early mitosis, LGN becomes dispensable during anaphase, when NuMA’s cortical localization is dependent upon phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kotak et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether LGN functions to orient spindles at late stages of mitosis in other, polarized cell types, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, utilizing ex vivo live imaging in combination with mosaic RNAi, we find that division orientation in the developing murine epidermis is not determined solely by LGN localization during early mitosis. Surprisingly, LGN appears to play a &quot;maintenance&quot; role during anaphase/telophase, while an LGN-independent pathway involving adherens junction (AJ) proteins also acts to refine imprecise initial spindle positioning. We show that spindle orientation remains dynamic even into late stages of mitosis, and surprisingly, division axes remain random and uncommitted long after metaphase. While most cells enter anaphase with planar (0–30°) or perpendicular (60–90°) orientations and maintain this division axis through telophase, a significant proportion (30–40%) are initially oriented obliquely (30–60°), but undergo dramatic reorientation, a process we term telophase correction. In addition, we demonstrate that the α-E-catenin/vinculin/afadin cytoskeletal scaffolding complex is required for this correction to occur, and likely functions to modulate the tensile properties of the cell cortex by altering how actin is recruited to AJs. Mutants defective for telophase correction display precocious stratification which persists into later stages, highlighting the importance for this mechanism in generating normal tissue architecture. Furthermore, using genetic lineage tracing in <italic>afadin</italic> (<italic>Afdn</italic>) mutants, we confirm that uncorrected oblique divisions result in a strong bias toward differentiation over self-renewal.</p><p>Collectively, these studies support a novel two-step model of oriented cell division, where intrinsic factors such as LGN provide spatial cues that guide initial spindle positioning during early mitosis, while extrinsic factors such as cell-cell adhesions may provide a tension or density-sensing mechanism that refines the division plane during telophase to ensure normal tissue architecture. Our data further suggest that these mechanisms are modulated over developmental time to coordinate progenitor-expansive and differentiative programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Randomized division orientation persists into anaphase</title><p>During peak stratification, epidermal basal cells undergo either LGN-dependent perpendicular divisions or LGN-independent planar divisions, with roughly equal frequency. LGN is invariably apical when recruited to the cell cortex during prophase and remains apical at telophase in perpendicular divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). However, this bimodal distribution of division angles only emerges by ~E16.5, because the apical polarization of LGN is less efficient at earlier ages, resulting in a high proportion of oblique angles, and fewer perpendicular divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Our previous studies reported a bimodal distribution of division angles at late stages of mitosis and randomized division angles during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), while other groups have reported that spindle rotation occurs during prometaphase and is fixed to a bimodal distribution by late metaphase/early anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>). While these studies agree that spindle rotation occurs, they come to different conclusions about when and how the spindle axis becomes fixed to a bimodal distribution.</p><p>Because these studies vary in the ages examined and the method used to identify mitotic cells at specific stages, we sought to apply a rigorous and unambiguous methodology to identify metaphase, anaphase and telophase cells at a single timepoint (E16.5), when nearly all divisions are either planar or perpendicular. Because phosphorylation at Ser10 and Ser28 of histone-H3 (pHH3) declines rapidly after metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</xref>) antibodies raised against pHH3 vary in their ability to detect anaphase cells, and do not label telophase cells at all. Thus, we used another marker, Survivin (Birc5), which localizes to centromeres through metaphase, and redistributes to central spindle fibers and the cleavage furrow during anaphase and telophase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beardmore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caldas et al., 2005</xref>). In this manner, anaphase and telophase cells can be readily distinguished by their pattern of Survivin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since its original use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>), Survivin has been used by multiple groups across a variety of tissues to measure the division axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asrani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dor-On et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ichijo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Telophase reorientation corrects oblique anaphase orientations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sagittal sections from E16.5 embryos showing mitotic basal cells at indicated stages. Yellow arrows indicate division axis relative to basement membrane (dashed white line).

We noted that anaphase and metaphase cells were comparatively rare, each occurring at ~1/5 the frequency of telophase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In agreement with our previous observation, metaphase plates were oriented randomly, suggesting that spindle rotation occurs during metaphase. Surprisingly, however, the distribution of division angles remained random at anaphase, only establishing a bimodal distribution during telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This trend held for each mouse strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), demonstrating that differences in genetic background are unlikely to explain discrepancies in anaphase orientation reported by our group and others. Of note, because of the relative scarcity of anaphase divisions, they make a negligible contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare ‘telophase&quot; to &quot;ana+telo&quot;), perhaps explaining why in previous studies, so few oblique divisions are reported in total Survivin+ pools. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that basal cells remain uncommitted to a final plane of division beyond metaphase, and suggest that a previously uncharacterized spindle orientation mechanism occurs after anaphase onset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Oblique anaphase divisions reorient during telophase</title><p>As a next step, we performed ex vivo live imaging of E16.5 embryonic epidermal explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cetera et al., 2018</xref>), in order to examine the dynamics of spindle orientation at late stages of mitosis. To easily discriminate the basal layer of the epidermis from the underlying dermis and visualize cell nuclei during mitosis we utilized two combinations of alleles: 1) <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup> + Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, where cell membranes are GFP+ in the epidermis and tdTomato+ in the dermis, and 2) <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup> + Krt14<sup>H2B-GFP</sup></italic>, where epidermal cell membranes are tdTomato+ and nuclei are H2B-GFP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In both allele combinations, accurate measurements of the division angle relative to the epidermal-dermal border could be made in z-projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup> + Krt14<sup>H2B-GFP</sup></italic> combination was particularly useful for visualizing both the initiation of cleavage furrow ingression and the separation of nuclei that occurs at anaphase onset (defined as t = 0). Since cell nuclei could not be visualized in the <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup> + Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic> background, we defined anaphase onset as the frame in which cleavage furrow ingression could be first visualized. Of note, in both allele combinations, the duration of anaphase was observed to be short—typically two 5’ frames elapsed where mGFP or mtdTom was not visible between daughter nuclei—providing an explanation for why anaphase cells were rarely observed in fixed tissue.</p><p>In both imaging paradigms, we observed a high proportion (~2/3) of basal cells which entered anaphase at either planar or perpendicular orientations that remained relatively fixed for the duration of the imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">2</xref>). However, as suggested by our analyses of fixed tissue, many basal progenitors also frequently initiated anaphase at oblique angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; t=0, φ=division angle). Notably, these oblique divisions invariably corrected to either planar or perpendicular within an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>). When the angle of division was plotted over time, we noted that this reorientation, hereafter referred to as telophase correction, generally occurred within the first 30 minutes of anaphase onset. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Since little or no reorientation occurred after 1h, we assigned this as the imaging endpoint (t=+60min, θ=division angle). Of note, the distribution of division angles observed in these movies at anaphase onset (φ) and 1h later (θ) was remarkably similar to the distribution of anaphase and telophase orientations observed in fixed tissue (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G to 1C</xref>). When the behavior of individual cells was plotted at anaphase onset relative to 1h later, we observed that when φ&gt;60°, correction tended to occur toward perpendicular, and when φ&lt;30°, correction tended to occur toward planar, while oblique angles were less predictable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Thus, we sought to examine whether <italic>Afdn</italic> loss could also lead to uncoupling of the division axis from LGN polarity cues during mitosis, perhaps independently of NuMA. To test this, we co-stained prefixed E16.5 <italic>Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Afdn</italic> cKO sections with LGN and α-tubulin in order to visualize spindles during metaphase, and cleavage furrow ingression later in telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Importantly, while afadin loss altered telophase division orientation, it had no effect during metaphase, where spindles were randomly-oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the apical LGN crescent aligned with the metaphase spindle axis—regardless of its orientation—in both <italic>Afdn</italic> cKO and control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

However, in telophase cells, while LGN remained apically-positioned in both controls and <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants, the orientation of the spindle axis became uncoupled from LGN in <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of α-E-catenin or vinculin phenocopied afadin loss, demonstrating that AJ perturbation does not alter LGN localization, but does affect the ability of telophase cells to reorient in response to apical cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>These findings, together with our observation that AJ and LGN mutants differ in their planar telophase correction phenotypes, suggest that afadin, α-E-catenin and vinculin act independently of LGN in the context of spindle orientation. As further evidence, we find that while LGN strongly colocalizes with known binding partners Gαi3 and Insc, afadin demonstrates minimal colocalization with LGN either pre- or post-chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Finally, there are several contexts during epidermal development where LGN is not required for division orientation. First, although hair placode progenitors undergo perpendicular asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ouspenskaia et al., 2016</xref>), LGN is weakly expressed and is not required for proper division orientation in mitotic placode cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>). Second, while LGN loss reduces perpendicular divisions in the interfollicular epidermis at E16.5, LGN is dispensable at E14.5, when the majority of divisions are planar and LGN is rarely cortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Afdn</italic> knockdown increases the frequency of oblique divisions in both contexts, suggesting an LGN-independent function for afadin in both perpendicular and planar divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that afadin is a minor or transient LGN-interactor in vivo and support a polarity- and LGN-independent role for afadin in telophase correction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Telophase correction and early mitotic spindle orientation function as parallel pathways</title><p>We next sought to test genetically whether the telophase correction pathway can override the initial spindle positioning cues provided by LGN.

In E14.5 <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> mosaic epidermis, we noted that Keratin-10 (K10)—a marker of differentiated cells—was enriched in RFP+ mutant regions compared to RFP- wild-type regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). While basal cell density was similar between <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> embryos and non-transduced littermates, the density of differentiated cells—whether assessed by their suprabasal (SB) position or K10 expression—was significantly higher in <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Consistent with previous observations in E18.5 <italic>Ctnna1</italic> knockout epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vasioukhin et al., 2001</xref>), the precocious differentiation observed in these mutants persisted into later ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Notably, in contrast to a previous report that late embryonic <italic>Ctnna1</italic> epidermis is hyperproliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vasioukhin et al., 2001</xref>), we do not observe any elevation in mitotic cells in either E14.5 or E16.5 <italic>Ctnna1</italic> epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which is more in agreement with a recent study that showed a mild increase in BrdU+ cells but net growth disadvantage of <italic>Ctnna1<sup>912</sup></italic> basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we feel it is more likely that the precocious differentiation observed in <italic>Ctnna1<sup>912</sup></italic> mutants is due to persistent oblique divisions caused by errors in telophase correction, rather than to hyperproliferation. Collectively, these data suggest that telophase correction influences differentiation throughout epidermal development.</p><p>While the previous experiments demonstrated that AJ loss alters both division orientation and promotes differentiation, they do not address whether telophase correction errors directly impact cell fate choices. To explore whether afadin loss alters fate decisions, we performed short term (72h) lineage tracing experiments using <italic>Krt14<sup>CreER</sup>; Rosa26<sup>Confetti</sup></italic> reporter mice in combination with <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> knockdown, and examined the number of progenitor (basal) and differentiated (SB, K10+) progeny within resultant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). The lentiviral shRNA strategy was chosen to target <italic>Afdn</italic> because the alternative—<italic>Krt14<sup>CreER</sup></italic>-mediated deletion of the <italic>Afdn<sup>fl</sup></italic> allele—would result in <italic>Afdn</italic> deletion occurring simultaneous with, rather than prior to, clonal induction. Moreover, in contrast to lentiviral-delivered <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic>, <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>Afdn</italic> did not cause obvious differentiation defects (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>), likely because <italic>Afdn</italic> deletion occurs later with <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We administered a single dose of tamoxifen at E14.5 by oral gavage, then harvested embryos at E17.5, when we analyzed clones obtained from <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> RFP+ and uninjected (wild-type) littermates. In agreement with our mitotic index measurements, knockdown of <italic>Afdn</italic> did not alter the distribution of clone sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> clones frequently displayed a greater proportion of suprabasal cells per clone when compared to uninjected littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We utilized clonal density arrays to display clone size distributions, such that basal and SB cells/clone are plotted on x and y axes, respectively, and darker colors indicate higher frequencies of specific clone types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrd et al., 2019</xref>). These data demonstrate that <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> contain a higher proportion of SB-rich clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><p>We further characterized clones into four subtypes: (1) balanced (1:1 ratio of basal:SB cells), (2) basal-rich (basal:SB ratio&gt;1), (3) SB-rich (basal:SB ratio&lt;1), and delamination (basal cells=0). Delamination is an alternative differentiation mechanism to asymmetric cell division, whereby a basal cell detaches from the underlying basement membrane and initiates differentiation without dividing. We previously showed through lineage tracing that delamination drives the initial phase of stratification, while asymmetric cell divisions predominate during peak stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). While we did not observe clear delamination events in our 3-6 hour live imaging experiments, genetic lineage tracing revealed that a similar and significant fraction of clones in both WT and <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> epidermis (48% vs 40%) arose from delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1I</xref>). A comparison of the mitotic clone distribution between WT and <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> clones revealed that <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> epidermis contains a much greater number of SB-rich clones (24% vs 2% in WT), at the expense of the basal-rich (29% vs 41%) subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Since delamination events slightly decrease in <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants compared to WT controls, this further suggests that the excess differentiation observed in <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants is attributable to an increase in asymmetric cell divisions rather than compensatory delamination.</p><p>We conclude that the excess oblique divisions observed in <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants, which fail to be corrected during telophase—impacts cell fate decisions, favoring differentiation over self-renewal. This further implies that a high proportion of oblique divisions are operationally asymmetric. In conclusion, we provide several lines of evidence that telophase correction contributes to establishing proper epidermal architecture: (1) the tensile AJ components afadin, α<bold>-</bold>E-catenin and vinculin fail to correct during telophase, leading to a persistent excess of oblique divisions, (2) AJ mutants which fail at telophase correction induce excess stratification, and (3) the failure of oblique divisions to correct to planar during telophase leads to a bias toward differentiation over self-renewal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A two-step mechanism for division axis determination</title><p>These studies shed new light on the mechanisms governing oriented cell divisions in the developing epidermis and identify telophase correction as an important contributor to balancing symmetric and asymmetric divisions throughout stratification. While previous studies have demonstrated essential roles for canonical spindle orientation genes in division orientation, we now show that initial spindle positioning is only one part of the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our data suggest that LGN and associated proteins operate early in mitosis to promote perpendicular divisions, but do so with a high degree of imprecision, resulting in a wide distribution of anaphase division angles. While this function of LGN is required for perpendicular divisions to occur, this fails to explain the bimodal distribution of division angles observed in telophase. In the second phase of our model, telophase cells undergo dynamic reorientation towards a planar or perpendicular orientation, where the direction of correction is dependent on contact with the basement membrane via a basal endfoot. We further demonstrate that LGN is also required for this second phase of spindle orientation, as its maintenance at the apical cortex promotes perpendicular-directed telophase correction. Moreover, the fidelity of telophase correction relies on the actin-scaffolding α-E-catenin/vinculin/afadin pathway, highlighting a role for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics in division orientation. In this way, our findings now provide a mechanistic explanation for the randomized division orientation observed in <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mutants more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>). Importantly, while our data support a model wherein vinculin regulates dynamic assembly of AJs, we cannot exclude the possibility that vinculin may play similar roles in cell-matrix integrin adhesions, which may also impact telophase correction.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two-step model of division orientation.</title><p>Model of OCD in the embryonic epidermis. During stratification, LGN (green) is recruited to the apical cortex in ~50% of mitoses, promoting perpendicular divisions. For OCDs with perpendicular and planar anaphase orientations, the division angle is fixed at anaphase onset, exhibiting minimal change in radial orientation during telophase. Importantly, the activity of LGN and its binding partners is imprecise, frequently resulting in oblique orientations at anaphase. In these cases, the apical daughter either retains or loses basement membrane contact following cytokinesis (red or blue nuclei, respectively). If contact is maintained, the apical daughter will reorient into a planar position. In contrast, if contact is lost, the apical daughter further stacks above its basal partner. Upon loss of α-E-catenin, vinculin, or afadin, telophase reorientation in either direction fails, resulting in persistent oblique divisions. In comparison, LGN loss reduces perpendicular anaphase orientations, while oblique divisions are properly corrected in a contact dependent manner. <italic>Afdn</italic> loss on an <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutant background restores oblique divisions and largely rescues the <italic>Gpsm2</italic> differentiation defect.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49249-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Corrective mechanisms in oriented cell divisions</title><p>Our findings contribute to a growing number of corrective mechanisms which can counterbalance stem cell division orientation errors in order to preserve tissue homeostasis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, the &quot;telophase rescue&quot; pathway—mediated by the scaffolding protein Dlg and motor protein Khc73—can compensate for errors in spindle orientation by relocalizing fate determinants, thus preserving normal daughter cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>). However, telophase rescue differs from the telophase correction we report here in that division orientation errors are not corrected in telophase, but rather, the fate determinants themselves are repositioned relative to the new division axis. In the developing epidermis, it has been shown that Insc overexpression can promote apical LGN localization and drive an increase of perpendicular divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>), but that under some circumstances, NuMA can redistribute laterally, perhaps in an effort to prevent the hyper-differentiation that would be driven by excessive asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>). Our data here, where afadin, α-E-catenin, and vinculin can override the perpendicular-correcting cue provided by LGN, provide a potential molecular explanation for this plasticity.</p><p>Other examples of dynamic oriented cell divisions include cyst stem cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, which display randomized spindle angles until anaphase, at which point one centrosome becomes anchored at the interface with the niche-defining hub cell, driving division away from the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, dividing cells within the monolayered <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epidermis partially extrude during mitosis and frequently demonstrate oblique division angles, which are corrected by reinsertion into the epithelium in an adhesion-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergstralh et al., 2015</xref>). A more extreme example of this extrusion/reinsertion model has been observed in intestinal organoids, where mitotic intestinal stem cells migrate to the luminal surface and undergo planar divisions before reinserting into the epithelium on either side of a Paneth cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McKinley et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, genetic alterations in MDCK cells—specifically, <italic>Gpsm2</italic> knockdown or <italic>Par1b</italic> overexpression—can drive out-of-plane divisions which are capable of correcting during anaphase via an apical actomyosin compressive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lázaro-Diéguez and Müsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these studies and ours suggest that many of these corrective mechanisms rely on polarity, cell-adhesion, and actin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insights into epidermal cell fate specification</title><p>In the <italic>Drosphila</italic> neuroblast, the orientation of cell division is directly linked to cell fates via the asymmetric inheritance of transcription factors and other fate determinants which promote differentiation in one daughter cell and preserve stemness in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoblich, 2008</xref>). While no such fate determinant has been identified in epidermal progenitors, our results add to a growing body of evidence that division orientation and cell fates are tightly linked. While previous studies have used short-term lineage tracing to correlate patterns of division orientation with fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), the lineage tracing experiments performed in this study are the first to demonstrate that perturbations to division orientation lead to altered cell fate outcomes.</p><p>Importantly, given the timing of telophase correction, our observations also shed new light on the timing and speculative mechanisms of cell fate commitment during mitosis. In the normal developing epidermis, a large proportion of mitoses (30–40%) progress to anaphase at oblique orientations. While telophase reorientation normally sorts these indeterminate divisions into symmetric or asymmetric outcomes, the evidence from loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Ctnna1</italic> and <italic>Afdn</italic> mutants—resulting in a hyper-stratified epidermis and lineages biased toward differentiation—suggests that a significant portion of oblique divisions are operationally asymmetric, likely resulting in differentiation of the obliquely-positioned daughter cell. Furthermore, these data suggest that retention of basement membrane contact is a potentially potent driver of basal progenitor identity. Taken together, our results indicate that while the early presence of LGN in pro/metaphase may bias cells towards adopting an asymmetric outcome, the finality of this decision is not determined until telophase reorientation mechanisms push or pull cells into the suprabasal or basal layers, respectively. Telophase correction thus provides a potential source of plasticity in the fate choices made by epidermal basal cells. It is tempting to speculate that AJ components in mitotic cells function as a mechanosensor that tranduces information about the local cellular environment that favors planar correction when tension is high and perpendicular correction when tension is low.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

All procedures were performed under IACUC-approved animal protocols (16-162). For live imaging experiments we utilized either: (1) mT/mG (<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J</sup></italic>; Jackson Labs #007576 via Liqun Luo, Stanford University) homozygous females with at least one copy of the <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dassule et al., 2000</xref>) (crossed to males of the identical genotype), or (2) <italic>Krt14<sup>H2B-GFP</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> heterozygous females (crossed to identical males).

The procedure for producing, concentrating and injecting lentivirus into amniotic fluid of E9.5 embryos has been previously described and is briefly detailed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Live imaging</title><p>The live imaging protocol used in this study was adapted from the technique recently described by the Devenport lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cetera et al., 2018</xref>). A 1% agar solution/media solution containing F-media (3:1 DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 1% Sodium bicarbonate + 1% Sodium Pyruvate + 1% Pen/Strep/L-glut mix), was cooled and cut into 35mm discs. Epidermal samples measuring ~4-6mm along the AP axis and ~2-3mm along the medial-lateral axis were extracted from the mid-back of E16.5 mT/mG embryos. These explants were placed dermal-side down onto the gel/media disc, then sandwiched between the gas-permeable membrane of a 35mm lumox culture dish (Sardstedt; 94.6077.331). Confocal imaging was performed utilizing a Zeiss LSM 710 Spectral confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 40X/1.3 NA Oil Plan Neo objective. Images were acquired with 5 minute intervals and a Z-series with 0.5 µm step-size (total depth ranging from 20-30 microns) for 3-9 hours. Explants were cultured at 37°C with 5.0% CO<sub>2</sub> for &gt;1.5 hours prior to- and throughout the course of imaging. Divisions occurring close to the tissue edge or showing any signs of disorganization/damage were avoided to exclude morphological changes associated with wound-repair. 4D image sets were deconvolved using AutoQuant X3 and processed using ImageJ (Fiji).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Lentiviral injections</title><p>For full protocol, please see Beronja, et al. (ref. 24). This protocol is approved via IACUC #16-162/19-155. Pregnant CD1<italic>, mTmG/Krt14-Cre</italic>, or <italic>Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> females were anesthetized and the uterine horn pulled into a PBS filled dish to expose the E9.5 embryos. Embryos and custom glass needles were visualized by ultrasound (Vevo 2100) to guide microinjection of ~0.7 μl of concentrated lentivirus into the amniotic space. Three to ten embryos were injected depending on viability and litter size. Following injection, the uterine horn(s) were reinserted into the mother’s thoracic cavity, which was sutured closed. The incision in the skin was resealed with surgical staples and the mother provided subcutaneous analgesics (5 mg/kg meloxicam and 1-4 mg/kg bupivacaine). Once awake and freely moving, the mother was returned to its housing facility for 5-7 days, at which point E14.5-16.5 embryos were harvested and processed accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Lineage tracing</title><p>Krt14<sup>CreER</sup>; Rosa26<sup>Confetti</sup> females were mated to males with the identical genotype. At E9.5, ~half of the viable embryos were injected with <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> H2B-mRFP1 high titer lentivirus (see above for detailed surgical procedure). Activation of the <italic>Krt14<sup>CreER</sup></italic> allele was initiated by tamoxifen (dosed at 100 μg per gram dam mass) delivered by oral gavage at E14.5, five days following lentiviral injection). Females were monitored for 24 hours following tamoxifen dosing for signs of abortion or distress. Embryos were harvested at E17.5 (~72 hours after tamoxifen delivery) and backskins were embedded in OCT and sectioned sagittally (8μm thick sections). Slides were stained with Abcam Chicken αGFP polyclonal antibody (Abcam ab13970) which enhanced the membrane-CFP, nuclear-GFP, and cytoplasmic-YFP fluorophores of the <italic>Confetti</italic> allele. Images were acquired for every labeled clone using a 40x/1.15NA objective with a 1.5X digital zoom. Sparse clones (&lt;1% total cells) were evaluated for both the number of basal and suprabasal cells (distinguished by staining with αKrt10 antibody; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Clones with only suprabasal cells in the stratum spinosum or first stratum granulosum (SG3) layer were assumed to be delamination events – those above SG3 were excluded. Suprabasal (SB) to basal cell ratios were quantified for each clone by dividing the # of SB cells by the # of basal cells. Clones with a ratio &gt;1 were binned as 'SB-rich' while clones with a ratio &lt;1 were binned as 'basal-rich' – clones with an equal number (ratio = 1) were binned as 'balanced'.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Constructs and RNAi</title><p>For afadin and vinculin RNAi targeting, we tested ~10 shRNAs for knockdown efficiency in primary keratinocytes. These sequences were selected from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) Mission shRNA library (Sigma) versions 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 and cloned using complementary annealed oligonucleotides with AgeI/EcoRI linkers. For LGN and α-catenin, we utilized an shRNA that had been previously validated with our lentiviral injection technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). shRNA clones are identified by the gene name with the nucleotide base (NCBI Accession number) where the 21-nucleotide target sequence begins in superscript (e.g. <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic>). Lentivirus was packaged in 293FT or TN cells using the pMD2.G and psPAX2 helper plasmids (Addgene plasmids #12259 and #12260, respectively). For knockdown screening, primary keratinocytes were seeded at a density of ~150,000 cells per well into 6-well plates and grown to ~80% confluency in E-Low calcium medium and infected with an MOI of ~1. Approximately 48 h post-infection, keratinocytes were treated with puromycin (2 μg/mL) to generate stable cell lines. After 3-4 days of puromycin selection, cells were lysed and RNA isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated and amplified from 10-200 μg total RNA using either Superscript VILO (Invitrogen) or iScript (Bio-Rad). mRNA knockdown was determined by RT-qPCR (Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast RT-PCR) using 2 independent primer sets for each transcript with <italic>Hprt1</italic> and cyclophilin B (<italic>Ppib2</italic>) as reference genes and cDNA from stable cell lines expressing Scramble shRNA as a reference control. Primer efficiencies were determined using dose-response curves and required to be &gt;1.8, with relative transcript abundance determined by the ΔΔCT method. RT-qPCR runs were performed in triplicate with the mean knockdown efficiency determined by calculating the geometric mean of the ΔΔCT values for at least two independent technical replicates.

E16.5 embryos were skinned and flat-mounted on Whatman paper. In both cases, infected and uninfected littermate controls were mounted in the same blocks to allow for direct comparisons on the same slide. For α-tubulin staining of metaphase spindles, samples were kept warm and pre-fixed with room-temperature 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes before OCT embedding. Frozen samples were sectioned (8 μm thick) on a Leica CM1950 cryostat, mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (ThermoFisher) and stored at -80°C. For staining, sections were thawed at 37°C for 5-15 min, fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and blocked for 1h with gelatin block (5% NDS, 3% BSA, 8% cold-water fish gelatin, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS). Primary antibodies were diluted in gelatin block and incubated overnight in a humidity chamber at 4°C. Slides were then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in gelatin block at room temperature (~25°C) for 2 hours, counterstained with DAPI (1:2000) for 5 minutes and mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen).

Metaphase spindle orientation was measured as the angle between a vector orthogonal to the metaphase plate and parallel to the basement membrane. Anaphase cells were identified by both nuclear condensation and widely distributed surviving staining between daughter cells. Telophase cells were distinguished due to reduced nuclear condensation and dual-punctate Survivin staining. Division orientation was measured as the angle between a vector connecting the center of each daughter nucleus and a vector running parallel to the basement membrane. The same methodology was used to measure division orientation in live imaging experiments. In cases lacking nuclear labeling, the position of the nuclei was inferred based on cell volume/shape changes. Telophase correction (θ-ϕ) was quantified as the difference between division orientation at anaphase onset (ϕ) and division orientation 1 h later (θ). The presence of basal contact for the more apical daughter was determined by analyzing cell morphology in both <italic>en face</italic> and orthogonal perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Adhesion assays</title><p>Quantification of fluorescence intensity in adhesion assays was performed by orthogonal linescans at three positions along the junction length (~25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, and 75<sup>th</sup> quarter). In cases where junctions appeared punctate, discreet puncta were evaluated to avoid measuring regions lacking junction formation. Signal centers were set based on maximum intensity of either E-cadherin or α-E-catenin (where appropriate). To quantify ratios, the geometric mean fluorescent intensities of the 3 values nearest the junction center were used. Quantification of junction continuity was performed by linescans of E-cadherin fluorescence intensity along the entire length of the junction, excluding the vertex of multiple cells (i.e. tricellular junctions). We then calculated % of these intensity measurements above a threshold, which was evaluated for each individual junction using the mean center intensity of three orthogonal scans described earlier in this paragraph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>LGN localization/intensity</title><p>LGN localization patters (e.g. apical, weak/absent, or other) were determined for cells labeled with pHH3, irrespective of the lentiviral H2B-RFP reporter to avoid bias. Imaging was performed with WT controls and experimental samples on the same slide to avoid variation in antibody staining. Radial localization of LGN was measured by determining the angle between two vectors: one drawn from the LGN signal center to the center of the nucleus, the other drawn parallel to the basement membrane. Crescents oriented at the apical side were given positive values, while those at the basal side were given negative values. Radial variance between LGN signal and spindle or division axis were determined by drawing two vectors: one for the radial orientation of the LGN signal center and a second between either the spindle poles or between the center of the daughter nuclei. Radial fluorescent intensity values were measured by linescans originating at the site of basement membrane contact and tracing the edge of the cell. Each measurement along the length of the scan was then set as a part of whole, operating with the assumption that ~50% of the total length would represent the apical surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Whole mount fluorescence intensity</title><p>Quantification of fluorescence intensity in wholemount imaging of oblique telophase cells (as performed for pMLC2, phalloidin, α18 and α-E-catenin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) was performed by drawing linescans in the en-face perspective around the entire cortex at a series of focal planes: apical plane of the apical daughter, 'endfoot' of the apical daughter, mid-cell of the basal daughter and mid-cell of an interphase basal neighboring cell. For each image, background levels were determined using mean fluorescent intensity for each channel in a neighboring cell nucleus. This background value was subtracted from the mean cortical intensity of the appropriate channel. Fluorescence intensity ratios were quantified using background subtracted mean fluorescence intensities.</p><p>Cell density and live cell division orientation. Local cell density was calculated by counting the number of neighboring cells and dividing this number by their area. Area was measured in a single z-plane determined to be the cell center by orthogonal slices. Regions where the tissue sloped at an extreme angle were excluded due to inability to capture cell centers for all neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Differentiation/stratification analyses</title><p>E14.5 differentiation was quantified by imaging ~10 regions of the backskin in sagittal sections stained with β4 integrin, K10 and H2B-RFP. For each region, the number of basal and suprabasal cells were counted and the length of the region measured by the length of the underlying basement membrane (to account for tissue wrinkling/curvature). To quantify cell density, cell counts were divided by the length of each region in microns. At later stages (E16.5 or E18.5) we quantified K10 thickness by imaging ~10 regions of the backskin in sagittal sections stained with β4 integrin, K10 and H2B-RFP. Using the K10 channel, a thresholded, binary mask was created and filled, then used to measure the area above threshold. This thresholded area was then divided by the length of the underlying basement membrane (measured by β 4 integrin stain). <italic>n</italic> values for these analyses are representative of the number of regions imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Mitotic index</title><p>Mitotic Index was quantified at E14.5 and E16.5 by imaging the entire length of sagittally-sectioned backskin stained for β4 and pHH3. pHH3+ basal cells were counted and the length of the entire backskin was measured by length of the underlying basement membrane. <italic>n</italic> values are indicative of the number of individual embryos analyzed.</p><p>All statistical analyses and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 8 and Origin 2015 (OriginLab).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alpha Yap (Reviewer #1); Carien M Niessen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports and characterizes an interesting mechanism to regulate the orientation of cell division. Whereas much of this field has concentrated on how spindle orientation may be defined at the onset of anaphase, the authors show that there are additional mechanisms that correct orientation of the dividing cell in the later transition to telophase. This is prompted by the observation that cells are found with intermediate orientations at anaphase, which is corrected by telophase. The authors show that such correction involves two mechanisms: 1) A role for LGN in &quot;perpendicular&quot; correction, that extends its current role in anaphase specification; and 2) A role for the AJ cytoskeleton, that functionally involves α-catenin, vinculin and afadin. The latter is interesting because it appears to be dominant: although LGN-depleted cells can correct to planar orientation (perhaps because of this junctional input), correction appears to be fundamentally compromised (division planes are close-to randomized) when these AJ-actin linkers are depleted.</p><p>Characterization of this phenomenon of orientation correction is a valuable contribution to the field. This value is enhanced because it has been i) performed in a complex tissue model; and ii) in a stratified epithelium where decisions of perpendicular vs. planar division have consequences for cell fate (as the authors pursue in Figure 7).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more data regarding the physiological importance of telophase rescue. Is the cortex of either the dividing cell or its immediate neighbours altered in e.g. afadin and vinculin depletion? The authors have studied this in an in vitro model of junction formation, but one might suspect that the orientation correction mechanism involves generating some anisotropy in the cortex, e.g. concentration of Myosin II. It is difficult to discern the cytokinetic furrow in most videos and to clearly tell when abscission occurs. This is especially true for planar rescues, which could as likely be to cell respreading as cells exit mitosis. Along these lines, it would be nice to include some of the H2B-RFP videos in addition to the cell membrane videos that are included in the supplementary data section.</p><p>2) There is very little analysis of phenotypes resulting from loss of telophase rescue. Thus, the physiological significance of this process is questionable. Is the same precocious differentiation seen in vinculin mutant and acatenin mutants as well as afadin. Do they have later phenotypes that are consistent with spindle orientation functions? In addition, some of the work linking these proteins to junctional tension/organization comes only from cultured keratinocytes though the mutants are in hand. It would be ideal to see adherens junction/actin/tension markers in intact skin.</p><p>3) This work seems somewhat at odds with other reports in the field, including those from the PI. For example, LGN knockdown cells were reported to have almost entirely planar divisions, yet here they are reported to be quite random until telophase. Were those previous spindle orientation measurements all performed in telophase? And what about divisions orientation quantitations from multiple other groups that have reported more clear spindle orientations during anaphase?</p><p>4) Ultimately, one would like to know how to &quot;order&quot; the contributions of α-catenin, vinculin and afadin in this phenomenon. For example, at first glance it is slightly surprising that vinculin should decrease apparent tension across α-catenin, when the recruitment of vinculin to α-catenin is thought to be promoted by application of tension to the latter. This might reflect a contribution of vinculin to forces applied on integrin adhesion (which are secondarily transmitted to junctions) or simply the difficulty of parsing pathways that may not be linear. I mention this purely as a comment out of interest.</p><p>5) Revised discussion of the role vinculin in integrins. The authors don't directly address whether vinculin function at integrin or cadherin adhesions are required for telophase rescue. This should be directly stated.</p><p>The authors don't comment on whether vinculin knockdown (and other mutants) have a significant effect on perpendicular spindle telophase rescue. It appears from the data that these might affect perpendicular as well as parallel spindles. If so, this should be discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Telophase correction refines division orientation in stratified epithelia&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers thought that the conclusions on tension regulation are too strong and should be tuned down in the text and legend titles. Once these revisions are complete, the manuscript will be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I think the authors have reasonably responded to the questions raised in my earlier review. This is now a near-gigantic manuscript that reports an interesting phenomenon. Given its size and depth one can also quibble about details. But I think that the field would be better served by having the story out for consideration and replication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Substantial changes have been made, both experimentally and in writing, that strengthens the manuscript. I think it is largely suitable for publication.</p><p>I really wish that they would have included analysis of tissue thickness/premature differentiation of vinculin mutants, which would have strengthened the results (this data should be in hand).</p><p>I do have some reservations in inconsistency with the data with much other published work including the α-catenin knockdown data and the data on delamination at early stages of stratification. The Devenport lab does not see this with live imaging (and neither do we), although the Wickstrom group has. Since they performed imaging at E14.5, it would be great if they could state whether the rate of delamination they see in their videos validates their lineage tracing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper is improved and has addressed some of my major concerns. The lineage tracing data have helped to show that there is a likely direct consequence in terms of cell density in the different layers, even though if I understand Figure 7G and H correctly, this seems to have no direct effect on epidermal thickness or differentiation (time point of analysis is not mentioned though in the legends of these panels).</p><p>I do still feel that the authors conclusions on tension regulation are too strong as it is all based on staining (Figures 3 and 4) and should be tuned down in the text and legend titles as no experiment directly addresses the role of tension or hyper contractility. For example, the phosphomyosin staining is suggestive of increased contractility, but there is no direct evidence for this (laser ablation, etc.) and in addition the resolution in the images does not really allow one to make this very clear statement as in the legend title that a hyper contractile basal endfoot directs planar telophase correction. I realise that such experiments, especially in vivo are not trivial, but even in none of their in vitro experiments the authors directly test tension, but it is all based on staining. The authors should not misunderstand me, but the strength is the telophase correction pathway and the role of junctions in this pathway that is independent of LGN, but whether these are direct consequences of tension is beyond this manuscript and can be suggested and discussed but requires quite a bit more to show that convincingly.</p><p>Having said that, and if the authors are willing to tune those conclusions down, I think this is a very nice contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49249.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more data regarding the physiological importance of telophase rescue.

These analyses were performed by whole mount staining E16.5 epidermis with phalloidin and pMLC2 and quantifying fluorescence intensity in rare, obliquely oriented telophase divisions (Figure 3D). These measurements demonstrated a greater accumulation of pMLC2 in the basal endfoot than compared to the apical cortex of the “correcting” daughter cell, suggesting anisotropic contractility during telophase correction.</p><p>Further supporting this conclusion, we stained E16.5 epidermal whole mounts with both the a18 and a polyclonal α-E-catenin antibody to estimate the relative abundance of the open, “tensile” conformation of α-E-catenin in the same context. This quantification (performed similarly to the methodology for pMLC2) demonstrated that the a18 epitope stained with greater intensity in the basal endfoot compared to the apical cortex of the “correcting” daughter cell, while total a-Ecatenin levels were unchanged between these two regions (Figure 3F; Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). Furthermore, the a18: α-E-catenin fluorescence intensity ratio was highest in the basal endfoot when compared to other mitotic scenarios (Figure 3G). This suggests that the increased contractility in the endfoot changes the conformation of α-E-catenin, thereby justifying our pursuit of these molecules as candidate regulators of telophase correction.</p><p>Given the rarity of these oblique, anaphase/early telophase divisions in fixed tissue we are unable to make clear conclusions regarding the dynamics of these molecules through mitotic progression. Ultimately, elucidating these mechanisms will likely require live imaging of fluorescently labeled transgenes for α-E-catenin, afadin, vinculin, myosin, and/or actin. We attempted such an experiment utilizing a miRFP-670 conjugated LifeAct construct packaged in high-titer lentivirus, but were unable to complete imaging due to difficulty in either A) achieving a useable infection rate or B) inability to detect dim fluorescent signal from the construct on the available microscopes. We are unaware of anyone successfully performing live-imaging of lentivirally-expressed fluorescent transgenes, other than our own success with the extremely bright H2B-RFP reporter. We predict that many of these transgenes will be relatively lowly expressed, making fluorescence detection difficult in thick, stratified epidermis (E16.5). While this presents an exciting avenue of future research, approaching these experiments will require substantial technical optimization in terms of viral packaging, expression, and image collection which we consider beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is very little analysis of phenotypes resulting from loss of telophase rescue. Thus, the physiological significance of this process is questionable. Is the same precocious differentiation seen in vinculin mutant and acatenin mutants as well as afadin. Do they have later phenotypes that are consistent with spindle orientation functions? In addition, some of the work linking these proteins to junctional tension/organization comes only from cultured keratinocytes though the mutants are in hand. It would be ideal to see adherens junction/actin/tension markers in intact skin.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewers’ comment in several ways:</p><p>We have analyzed the precocious differentiation phenotype at E14.5 for <italic>Ctnna1</italic> knockdown samples (<italic>Ctnna1<sup>912</sup></italic>), which present with a nearly identical phenotype to the <italic>Afdn</italic> knockdown, suggesting the precocious differentiation observed in these mutants is more widely attributable to those mutants which fail to undergo telophase correction.</p><p>We have similarly analyzed the effects on differentiation at E16.5 for the following genotypes: <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup>, Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup> + lenti-Cre</italic> and <italic>Ctnna1<sup>912</sup></italic>. all of which display sustained hyperstratification. Similarly, the <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup>, Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup> + lenti-Cre</italic> increased thickness further persists through E18.5. These data suggest that failed telophase correction increases differentiation throughout epidermal stratification.</p><p>We have also investigated the potential impact of increased proliferation on the observed differentiation phenotypes. While previous reports from α-E-catenin knockout epidermis confirmed a hyperproliferative phenotype, the same study (Berojna and Fuchs, 2010; cited numerous times) concluded that <italic>Ctnna1</italic> knockout clones were at a net growth disadvantage due to increased apoptosis. Similarly, these analyses were restricted to BrdU incorporation assays, which, while frequently correlative with rates of cell division, do not directly address rates of mitosis and could possibly be due to lengthened S-phase. Here, we have quantified mitotic index by counting pHH3+ cells per mm of backskin and shown at E14.5 and E16.5, that neither loss of <italic>Afdn</italic> nor <italic>Ctnna1</italic> results in a significant increase in mitotic events.</p><p>Lastly, we have performed short-term genetic lineage tracing experiments for <italic>Afdn</italic> knockdown and WT littermates (Figure 8I-K; Figure 8—figure supplement 1D-G) to examine clonal growth during stratification (E14.5-E17.5). Using this assay we were able to conclude the following:</p><p>– Loss of afadin results in clones with a greater number of differentiated suprabasal cells with no significant change in overall clone size, suggesting a shift towards asymmetric cell divisions, likely due to failure of oblique divisions to undergo planar correction.</p><p>– Delamination – an alternative differentiation pathway to asymmetric cell divisions – is largely unaffected by <italic>Afdn</italic> loss. In our clonal analyses, we assumed that suprabasal clones lacking any basal cells were likely the result of differentiation by delamination (without cell division). Given this assumption, loss of afadin did not significantly alter the rate of delamination, further suggesting that the increased stratification in these mutants is due specifically to errors in telophase correction.</p><p>– As WT and afadin knockdown clones had a similar number of total labeled cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 1E) we were able to reaffirm that loss of afadin had no impact on net growth.</p><p>Ultimately, these data further support the conclusion that the precocious and sustained hyperstratification observed in both mutants is most likely due to failed telophase correction. These data form the centerpiece of a newly added Figure 8, which focuses on characterizating the consequences of failed telophase correction. Pertinent discussion of these results has been added to a subheader in the Results section titled “Telophase correction impacts cell fate decisions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This work seems somewhat at odds with other reports in the field, including those from the PI.

We realize we did not contextualize our findings as clearly as we could have, so we have expanded on this in the first paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“Our previous studies reported a bimodal distribution of division angles at late stages of mitosis and randomized division angles during metaphase (Williams et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2014), while other groups have reported that spindle rotation occurs during prometaphase and is fixed to a bimodal distribution by late metaphase/early anaphase (Poulson and Lechler, 2010; Seldin et al., 2016). While these studies agree that spindle rotation occurs, they come to different conclusions about when and how the spindle axis becomes fixed to a bimodal distribution.”</p><p>We further explain the rationale for our chosen method of using Survivin to label late-stage mitotic cells in the subsection “Randomized division orientation persists into anaphase”.</p><p>To improve the rigor and reproducibility of our studies of metaphase/anaphase/telophase spindle orientation in fixed tissue, we included three separate commonly-used strains of mice (CD1, C57 and 129), and separately analyze each strain (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Since each strain showed similar patterns, we rule out potential strain differences as an explanation for any reported differences in anaphase division orientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And what about divisions orientation quantitations from multiple other groups that have reported more clear spindle orientations during anaphase?</p></disp-quote><p>While there are examples of spindle or division orientation measurements made at metaphase or anaphase in the epidermis, each varies slightly in method from ours reported here. These are discussed in detail below:</p><p>Lechler and Fuchs, 2005 (cited numerous times): In Figure 1A-E the authors present data which first reported the presence of symmetric-planar and asymmetric-perpendicular divisions in the embryonic epidermis. These experiments utilized either DAPI and tubulin (Figure 2A,B, E) or DAPI with a Centrin-GFP allele (Figure 2C-E) to measure division angles. However, these data to not differentiate between anaphase and telophase.</p><p>Poulson et al., 2010 (cited numerous times): In Figure 2C-E the authors present data measuring spindle angles in vivo using Centrin-GFP or NuMA-GFP alleles. At prometaphase (Figure 2C-D) they demonstrate nearly random spindle orientation but show a dramatic shift towards bipolar angles at metaphase (Figure 2E). However, it is important to note that the measurements were made using an overexpressed spindle orientation effector, NuMA-GFP which possibly impacts division orientation behavior.</p><p>Seldin et al., 2016 (now cited): In Figure 3J the authors present data measuring spindle angles using IF staining for pHH3 to ID anaphase cells in E17.5 interfollicular epidermis. While the authors of this study state measurements were restricted specifically to anaphase, they do not present example images, making the discrepancy difficult to explore. The described methods suggest that anaphase cells were identified by pHH3 staining, which <italic>may</italic> persist into telophase (data delineating pHH3 antibody specificity through distinct stages of mitosis in epidermal progenitors does not exist, and in our hands has proven to be variable between distinct antibody). These measurements were also performed on thin sagittal sections, limiting the authors ability to observe both planar and oblique division angles, which may frequently occur out of the section plane. Lastly, these measurements were taken at E17.5, one day later than the data presented in this manuscript, which may alter the timing of division plane commitment.</p><p>We are unaware of other instances of metaphase or anaphase measurements of spindle/division orientation in the embryonic epidermis and would welcome more specific citations if we have missed a relevant data set. However, the above listed studies do not present data specifically measuring division orientation at anaphase in E16.5 or E14.5 interfollicular epidermis. The data evaluating metaphase/anaphase division angles were either collected in a mutant context overexpressing a key spindle orientation gene, or at a different timepoint (E17.5) using different methods of quantitation. Similarly, these data likely underestimate the proportion of oblique and planar divisions due to the fact that these measurements were made in sagittal sections, which impact the ability to observe divisions which occur out of the plane of the section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ultimately, one would like to know how to &quot;order&quot; the contributions of α-catenin, vinculin and afadin in this phenomenon. For example, at first glance it is slightly surprising that vinculin should decrease apparent tension across α-catenin, when the recruitment of vinculin to α-catenin is thought to be promoted by application of tension to the latter. This might reflect a contribution of vinculin to forces applied on integrin adhesion (which are secondarily transmitted to junctions) or simply the difficulty of parsing pathways that may not be linear. I mention this purely as a comment out of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct to highlight that initial tension across α-E-catenin (inducing the “open” conformation) would likely be required for vinculin and afadin binding (based on the findings of Buckley, Nelson and Dunn, 2014; Science as well as Pokutta and Weiss, 2002). However, this model is not exclusive to the possibility that vinculin binding may stabilize the open conformation of α-E-catenin, which would result in a larger proportion of α-E-catenin molecules receiving the a18 label in a fixed stain. The same may be true for afadin as well. Our data suggest that these two proteins (vinculin and afadin) cooperatively promote the stabilization of α-E-catenin’s open, “tensile” conformation, which in turn promotes the formation of the afadin/α-E-catenin and vinculin/α-E-catenin interactions. One interesting observation that we make is that it is not so much that a18 levels decrease, but rather that total α-E-catenin levels increase upon <italic>Vcl</italic> or <italic>Afdn</italic> loss (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, H). This suggests there may be compensatory upregulation of α-E-catenin (and perhaps other AJ components) to counter the weakened AJs. This is discussed in the subsection “Telophase corrective basal contacts are hyper-contractile”.</p><p>We agree that our data are far from conclusive, but should note that there is a decade of literature addressing mechanistically how vinculin binding regulates the tension sensing capabilities of α-E-catenin, and very little work has been done on afadin. Although we lack the capabilities to tease their “order” of incorporation into the complex apart, we have analyzed the spindle orientation phenotype in double mutants of <italic>Vcl</italic> and <italic>Afdn</italic>, which resemble single mutants: “Examination of division orientation in single and double mutants revealed that vinculin loss did not exacerbate the <italic>Afdn cKO</italic> phenotype, suggesting that these proteins do not act additively in the context of division orientation (Figure 5I).” Our in vitro nascent AJ formation experiments lack the temporal resolution to identify a sequential recruitment into AJs, and we believe the biochemical analyses required for fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these binding events are beyond the scope of this current project. We would be happy to discuss the implications of our data regarding a molecular model of vinculin/afadin binding to α-E-catenin but feel any discussion beyond what is already included in the text would be highly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Revised discussion of the role vinculin in integrins. The authors don't directly address whether vinculin function at integrin or cadherin adhesions are required for telophase rescue. This should be directly stated.</p><p>The authors don't comment on whether vinculin knockdown (and other mutants) have a significant effect on perpendicular spindle telophase rescue. It appears from the data that these might affect perpendicular as well as parallel spindles. If so, this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewers’ comments in several ways.</p><p>We have added relevant discussion of vinculin in integrin based adhesions to the text. At the end of the first paragraph in the Discussion we have added the following statement: “Importantly, while our data support a model wherein vinculin regulates dynamic assembly of AJ, we cannot exclude the possibility that vinculin may play similar roles in cell-matrix integrin adhesions, which may also impact telophase correction.” We believe this statement is justified due to the fact that loss of α-E-catenin or afadin, neither of which have been implicated in cell-matrix adhesion, produce errors in telophase correction. However, the reviewers are correct to point out that we cannot completely exclude the possibility that vinculin serves roles at both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions, due in part to the difficulties in adequately labeling/staining vinculin in epidermal basal cells.</p><p>We have added specific comments highlighting that vinculin, α-E-catenin, and afadin loss results in errors to telophase correction <italic>in both planar and perpendicular directions</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers thought that the conclusions on tension regulation are too strong and should be tuned down in the text and legend titles.

See specific examples in the response to reviewer #3, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I really wish that they would have included analysis of tissue thickness/premature differentiation of vinculin mutants, which would have strengthened the results (this data should be in hand).</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the addition of analysis of <italic>Vcl</italic> mutants would have made a nice addition to Figure 8, unfortunately these were not data that we had “in hand.” It would have been necessary for us to generate additional <italic>Vcl</italic> mutants at E14.5, which would have delayed resubmission by at least another month. We did perform a cursory examination of E16.5 <italic>Vcl</italic> mutants and did not observe obvious differentiation defects. However, these embryos were more mosaic (thus containing less mutant tissue) than either of the other mutants.

The Devenport lab does not see this with live imaging (and neither do we), although the Wickstrom group has. Since they performed imaging at E14.5, it would be great if they could state whether the rate of delamination they see in their videos validates their lineage tracing.</p></disp-quote><p>I believe the only inconsistency between our findings and other published work regarding α-E-catenin is related to the expression of LGN in <italic>Ctnna1</italic> mutants (Lechler and Fuchs, 2005). It is possible that this could be due to different antibodies that were used in these studies, the fact that different models of <italic>Ctnna1</italic> loss were used, or potentially different ages that were examined. For example, we focused on E16.5 while it is not stated which age was examined in the Lechler &amp; Fuchs study (Figure 4D).</p><p>Regarding delamination, in order to clarify this point, we have edited the Results section: “While we did not observe clear delamination events in our 3-6 hour live imaging experiments, genetic lineage tracing revealed that a similar and significant fraction of clones in both WT and <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> epidermis (48% vs. 40%) arose from delamination (Figure 8—figure supplement 1I).” However, we have not specifically searched for delamination events in our E14.5 videos since our focus was on mitotic cells, thus we do not feel comfortable concluding whether or not they occur, or at what frequency. To our knowledge, as acknowledged by this reviewer, the only lab that has reported observing delamination by live imaging is the Wickstrom lab (Miroshnikova et al., 2018), which used LifeAct-GFP in E15.5 embryos. It is possible this discrepancy between her lab and the others mentioned could be due to differences in imaging preparations, transgenic mouse lines, and/or age. However, we agree with the</p><p>Wickstrom lab with respect to the idea that delamination does occur, particularly in early stratification. Our lab has now utilized two different lineage tracing approaches – lentiviral Cre-RFP (Williams et al., 2014) and <italic>Krt14<sup>CreER</sup></italic> (this study) – which have identified a significant and consistent proportion of clones that arise from apparent delamination events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper is improved and has addressed some of my major concerns. The lineage tracing data have helped to show that there is a likely direct consequence in terms of cell density in the different layers, even though if I understand Figure 7G and H correctly, this seems to have no direct effect on epidermal thickness or differentiation (time point of analysis is not mentioned though in the legends of these panels).</p></disp-quote><p>We applaud the reviewer for recognizing that the <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup>; Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cKOs do not show increased stratification compared to <italic>Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>WT controls (Figure 7G, H), which is at apparent odds with our later conclusion that <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup></italic> and lentiviral Cre-RFP <italic>Afdn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>cKOs show hyper-stratification (Figure 8—figure supplement 1D, E).However, we think this is most likely due to differences in the timing of <italic>Afdn</italic> targeting in these different lines. We have previously shown that lentiviral Cre (targeted to the amniotic fluid at E9.5) acts 2-3 days earlier than <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (Beronja et al., 2010; Supplementary Figure 4). We have added a sentence to clarify this point in the Results section: “Moreover, in contrast to lentiviral-delivered <italic>Afdn<sup>2711</sup>, Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>Afdn</italic> did not cause obvious differentiation defects (compare Figure 7H to Figure 8—figure supplement 1E), likely because <italic>Afdn</italic> deletion occurs later with <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (Beronja et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do still feel that the authors conclusions on tension regulation are too strong as it is all based on staining (Figures 3 and 4) and should be tuned down in the text and legend titles as no experiment directly addresses the role of tension or hyper contractility. For example, the phosphomyosin staining is suggestive of increased contractility, but there is no direct evidence for this (laser ablation, etc.) and in addition the resolution in the images does not really allow one to make this very clear statement as in the legend title that a hyper contractile basal endfoot directs planar telophase correction. I realise that such experiments, especially in vivo are not trivial, but even in none of their in vitro experiments the authors directly test tension, but it is all based on staining. The authors should not misunderstand me, but the strength is the telophase correction pathway and the role of junctions in this pathway that is independent of LGN, but whether these are direct consequences of tension is beyond this manuscript and can be suggested and discussed but requires quite a bit more to show that convincingly.</p><p>Having said that, and if the authors are willing to tune those conclusions down, I think this is a very nice contribution to eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tempered our language regarding tension regulation throughout the text.
