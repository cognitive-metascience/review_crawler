interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptor CD8. Peptides are generally critical for the stable cell surface expression of HLA-I molecules. However, for HLA-I alleles such as HLA-B*35:01, peptide-deficient (empty) heterodimers are thermostable and detectable on the cell surface. Additionally, peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 tetramers preferentially bind CD8 and to a majority of blood-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via a CD8-dependent binding mode. Further functional studies reveal that peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01 do not directly activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but accumulate at the immunological synapse in antigen-induced responses, and enhance cognate peptide-induced cell adhesion and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Together, these findings indicate that HLA-I peptide occupancy influences CD8 binding affinity, and reveal a new set of regulators of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, mediated by the binding of empty HLA-I to CD8.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36341.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system keeps tabs on everything that happens in our body, looking for potential signs of threat. To alert it to any problems, almost every cell produces specific proteins on its surface called human leukocyte antigens class I, or HLA-I for short. These HLA-I molecules are bound to small protein fragments called peptides that have been exported from within the cell and are presented to the cells of the immune system for scanning. When cells are healthy, the peptides all stem from normal proteins. But, if the cell has become infected or cancerous, it contains foreign or abnormal peptides.</p><p>Some of the HLA-I molecules, however, are empty. These antigens are unstable, and their role is unclear. Now, Geng et al. investigated this further by studying blood samples from healthy donors. The experiments revealed that empty HLA-I molecules help specialized cells of the immune system, the killer T cells, to bind to the antigens, improving their killing ability.</p><p>It is known that these T cells recognize and bind to the antigens through two receptor proteins, one of which is called CD8. It was known that when HLA-I molecules carry a peptide, only a small fraction of T cells with a matching receptor can bind. However, Geng et al. found that when HLA-Is were empty, a much larger proportion of the T cells was able to bind to antigens. This indicates that CD8 ‘prefers’ to attach to empty HLA-Is, maybe because binding sites are more accessible. CD8 also enhances the binding between the T cells and the antigen. Empty HLA-Is did not directly activate the T cells but did enhance their immune response. When both full and empty HLA-I were present, the T cells were even more effective at killing their targets.</p><p>Understanding how killer T cells work is essential for the development of immunotherapies – treatments that help to boost the immune system to fight infections and cancer. Increasing the number of empty HLA-I molecules on cancer or infected cells could enhance T cell killing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HLA class I</kwd><kwd>CD8</kwd><kwd>empty HLA</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>HLA-B</kwd><kwd>HLA-B*35:01</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI044115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Malini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HLA-B*35:01 molecules that are peptide-deficient are thermostable, bind CD8 with higher affinity than their peptide-filled versions, accumulate at immunological synapses and enhance antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules play a crucial role in adaptive immune responses by presenting antigenic peptides to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which enables the immune system to detect transformed or infected cells that display peptides from foreign or mutated self-proteins. Peptides are an integral component of MHC-I molecules. In the MHC-I antigen presentation process, peptides are mainly produced in the cytosol by proteasome and then translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Peptides are loaded to MHC-I peptide binding groove with the assistance of several ER chaperones, ERp57, calreticulin and tapasin. There are several quality control components to ensure that most cell surface MHC-I molecules are filled with optimal peptide. However, under certain pathophysiological conditions, MHC-I peptide-deficient or open conformers are also detected on the cell surface. Prior evidence suggests that peptide-deficient conformers of MHC-I molecules appear on the cell surface of activated lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madrigal et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schnabl et al., 1990</xref>), TAP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ortiz-Navarrete and Hämmerling, 1991</xref>) or EBV transformed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madrigal et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Although the presence of peptide-deficient conformers of MHC-I molecules on the cell surface under certain conditions is established, their functions are poorly understood. In the past few years, peptide-deficient conformers of MHC-I molecules of some allotypes have been shown to be ligands for cell surface receptors such as KIR3DS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016</xref>), KIR3DL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodridge et al., 2013</xref>), KIR2DS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodridge et al., 2013</xref>) and LILRB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones et al., 2011</xref>). However, most of these studies involved a non-classical HLA-I, HLA-F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016</xref>), which has a higher propensity to be expressed in a peptide-deficient version compared to classical HLA-I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodridge et al., 2010</xref>). The paucity of functional studies of peptide-deficient conformers of classic HLA-I could partly be attributed to their general low stability on the cell surface. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>), we tested the refolding efficiencies of several HLA-B allotypes in the absence of peptide and found that peptide-deficient conformers of some allotypes such as B*35:01 are relatively more stable. Higher stability of peptide-deficient B*35:01 is also measurable in this study using a thermal unfolding assay with peptide-deficient HLA-B molecules that were engineered for enhanced stability via leucine zippered sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Peptide-receptive B*35:01 molecules are also detectable on the surface of activated T cells (this study) and TAP-deficient cells (Geng et al, submitted manuscript). Therefore, B*35:01 is a good representative HLA-B to investigate the function of peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-I molecules. In exploring potential binding partners for peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-I molecules, we found that tetramers of peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01, in stark contrast to their peptide-filled conformer, stain a majority of blood-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We hypothesized that the staining is largely CD8-mediated and also that peptide-deficient B*35:01 molecules can modulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Indeed, we show that CD8 prefers to bind peptide-deficient B*35:01 molecules and that peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 molecules on the cell surface enhance cell adhesion to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although they do not directly activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells enhance antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Together, these studies indicate key immune regulatory functions for peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-I molecules.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36341.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B molecules have different thermostabilities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peptide-deficient HLA-B can be prepared by cleavage of engineered HLA-B (LZ-ELBM) with a specific enzyme and peptide-loaded versions by subsequent incubation with specific peptide as described in the scheme.

Significant differences in folding efficiencies were noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, we assessed whether peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B allotypes also differ in their thermal unfolding characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The NIH tetramer core facility has developed HLA-I molecules with epitope-linked β2m (ELBM), wherein an HLA-I binding peptide is covalently linked to human β2m via a linker peptide that contains a protease cleavage site. HLA-I heavy chain and β2m are further tethered via leucine zippers (LZ) at their C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Treatment of the HLA-I molecules with protease is expected to release the linked peptides, which are all C-terminally elongated, and thus sub-optimal for binding. When the cleavage is done in the presence of another HLA-I binding peptide, exchange should occur. Cleavage in the absence of peptide can produce peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-I molecules.</p><p>Peptide-deficient conformers of four HLA-B molecules, B*18:01, B*35:01, B*44:02 and B*51:01, were prepared and verified first by SDS-PAGE. The mobility of β2m was increased for all allotypes, consistent with expected reduction in molecular weight after cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left panels). Formation and peptide loading of peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B molecules were further validated by native-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right panels). In general, the mobilities for the cleaved HLA-B molecules are clearly different from uncleaved proteins. The reduced intensities of complex bands and increased intensities of the free β2m bands, likely because of heterodimer dissociation during electrophoresis, indicate that these heterodimers are less stable than uncleaved proteins. The HLA-B heterodimers were further loaded with allotype-specific peptides. The observed downward mobility shifts of the complex-specific bands for HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*18:01 and HLA-B*44:02 in the native gels are indicative of peptide binding, and provide further evidence that the cleaved forms of those HLA-B molecules are in fact peptide-deficient. A downshift was not observed of the complex-specific bands for HLA-B*51:01, suggestive of low peptide-loading efficiency, also previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Thermostabilities of the peptide-deficient HLA-B molecules were assessed by comparing heat-induced unfolding with a thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A fluorescent dye (Sypro Orange) was used that displays enhanced binding to proteins following thermal unfolding. Clear cut transitions are observable for peptide-deficient B*18:01 and B*35:01, but not for B*44:02 or B*51:01. These findings indicate important thermostability hierarchies among peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B; allotypes such as B*35:01 and B*18:01 are more stable in their peptide-deficient conformers compared to allotypes such as B*44:02 and B*51:01, consistent with previously described refolding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>). As a representative peptide-deficient HLA-B with high thermostability, HLA-B*35:01 was used for further functional assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 tetramers preferentially bind CD8 and stain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in a CD8-dependent manner</title><p>To explore potential receptors that are responsive to peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01, tetramers were generated with peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 or their peptide-filled versions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) staining of tetramers of peptide-deficient conformers was compared with the peptide-filled HLA-B*35:01. PBMCs obtained from healthy donors were stained with a panel of lymphocyte markers before tetramer staining. As expected, antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations were rare or absent in PBMCs from healthy B*35:01<sup>+</sup> donors, as assessed by staining with uncleaved B*35:01 (carrying an epitope LPYPQPQPF from <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) tetramers (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 tetramers bound to most (over 70%) of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells present in the donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings suggested that observed tetramer binding was unlikely to be linked to specific TCR. Rather, staining was significantly blocked by anti-CD8 (Clone SK1, BioLegend) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that peptide-deficient B*35:01 tetramers are capable of binding to cell surface CD8 with higher potency compared to the peptide-filled version. In parallel analyses, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were poorly stained by the peptide-deficient B*35:01 tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and staining was not blocked by anti-CD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with the finding of CD8-dependent binding to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similar results were obtained with cells from a B*35:01-negative donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>), of enhanced CD8-dependent binding of peptide-deficient HLA-B*35:01 tetramers to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>), and comparatively poor CD8-independent binding to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>).

We examined the ability of peptide-deficient B*35:01 tetramers to bind to CD8 on the NK cell surface. B*35:01 belongs to Bw6 serotype of HLA-B alleles that lack a binding sequence for engagement of the HLA-B recognizing killer immunoglobulin-like receptor, KIR3DL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gumperz et al., 1997</xref>).

Furthermore, NK cells from different donors have different percentages of CD8 expressing NK cells, and the level of staining with peptide-deficient B*35:01 tetramers is directly proportional to the CD8 expressing fraction of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from a donor expressing both HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 were pre-activated to induce peptide-deficient conformers on the cell surface.

The CTL line specific to the HLA-A2-AL9 complex was first chosen as the effector cell. Primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing both A*02:01 and B*35:01 were used as target cells. After incubation at effector-to-target ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and 20:1, CTLs exhibited a strong increase in the ability to kill target cells pulsed with the cognate peptide AL9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, right panels) compared to target cells pulsed with control peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, left panels).

Peptide-deficient conformers could be partially blocked by B*35:01-specific peptides YPLHEQHGM (YPL), HPNIEEVAL (HPN), HPV and FPTKDVAL (FPT), but not control peptide (TSTLQEQIGW, TW10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–I</xref>), indicating that a subset of the HLA-B*35:01 molecules are peptide-deficient.

It was widely known that the interactions between MHC-I molecules with their receptors are both allotype and peptide dependent. Our studies indicate that peptide-deficient MHC-I molecules are also functional in the immune response. A given peptide-HLA-I complex is typically able to engage only a small percentage of blood-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, those that bear an appropriate TCR. In contrast, peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01 engaged a majority of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from multiple donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the pMHC-I/CD8 interaction is generally characterized by very low affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wyer et al., 1999</xref>), we find that peptide-free HLA-B*35:01 binds CD8 with significantly higher affinity than their peptide-filled versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, unlike peptide-occupied HLA-B that engage CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via a TCR–dependent binding mode, peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01 engage CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via a binding mode that is largely CD8-dependent.</p><p>The MHC-I-binding site for CD8 is spatially separated from the peptide-binding domains that are recognized by the TCR, and this spatial segregation allows both TCR and CD8 to bind a single MHC-I molecule simultaneously. In contrast to peptide-loaded MHC-I molecules, peptide-free MHC I molecules are suggested to possess properties similar to molten globules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvier and Wiley, 1998</xref>), and show more protein plasticity based on MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Hateren et al., 2013</xref>). The stronger binding to CD8 of peptide-deficient HLA-B compared to peptide-filled HLA-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is likely caused by conformational differences between peptide-occupied and peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B molecules that determine the accessibility or orientation of the CD8 binding site on HLA-I. Peptide-deficient HLA-I molecules are also preferred by ER chaperones tapasin and TAPBPR, which functions to facilitate peptide loading of MHC-I molecules. Crystal structures of tapasin-MHC-I and TAPBPR-MHC-I complexes highlight some common MHC-I binding sites by tapasin/TAPBPR and CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blees et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>). Residues at the C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of tapasin are positioned close to the CD8 recognition loop (especially residues 225 and 226) of the α3-domain of the MHC-I heavy chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the sites co-evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blees et al., 2017</xref>). A β hairpin of TAPBPR at the N-terminal domain, which reaches under the floor of the peptide-binding groove, is important for sensing the conformation changes of the peptide-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomas and Tampé, 2017</xref>). CD8 also interacts with MHC-I at a similar region (including residues 115, 122 and 128) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 1997</xref>). Peptide loading reduces binding affinity between MHC-I molecules from tapasin and TAPBPR resulting in release of MHC-I molecules from tapasin and TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rizvi and Raghavan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). CD8 might share a similar mechanism as tapasin and TAPBPR to distinguish MHC-I molecules with different conformations.</p><p>CD8 functions as an adhesion molecule and co-receptor to enhance the formation of TCR/pMHC complexes and the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although ligation of CD8 with non-cognate peptide-MHC-I complex was proposed to augment CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anikeeva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yachi et al., 2005</xref>), generally, cognate peptide loading of MHC-I molecules is indispensable for CD8 T cell activation. Although a previous study showed that MHC-I molecules with super-enhanced CD8 binding properties bypass the requirement for cognate TCR recognition and nonspecifically activate CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wooldridge et al., 2010</xref>), we did not see any direct activation of CTL by HLA-B*35:01 peptide-deficient conformers. Nonetheless, our data suggested that preferential engagement of CD8 by peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01 enhances cognate peptide-induced cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The enhancement of T cell activation appears to be caused by enhanced cell adhesion induced by the peptide-deficient conformer-CD8 interaction, or enhanced signaling induced by peptide-deficient conformer enriched within the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To escape immune surveillance by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, several pathogens and tumors block HLA-I antigen presentation pathways to prevent antigenic peptide presentation by HLA-I molecules. Interestingly, many pathogen evasion or tumor progression strategies involve the targeting of the TAP transporter, inducing the cell surface expression of partially peptide-deficient HLA-I, as illustrated for HLA-B*35:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-I are expected to enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responses against TAP-independent epitopes, and thus counter the pathogen evasion strategies that target the HLA-I antigen presentation pathway.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36341.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Peptide-deficient conformers of MHC-I molecules enhance CTL activation.</title><p>CTL activation is generally induced by the recognition of a specific peptide-MHC-I complex on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) by a T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptor CD8.

Peptide-deficient forms of different HLA-B allotypes were shown to have distinct thermostabilities and are therefore expected to be expressed at different levels on the cell surface. HLA alleles are known to differently associate with disease progression outcomes in major infectious diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrington and Walker, 2012</xref>) and with autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), but the general underlying mechanisms are incompletely characterized. AS has been linked to the expression of HLA-B*27:05-free heavy chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khare et al., 1996</xref>), which can readily be detected on the surface of TAP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1999</xref>). It would be of interest to test whether the interactions between peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*27:05 molecules and CD8 are involved in the onset and outcome of these diseases.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that, without interaction with TCR, the peptide-deficient conformers of HLA-B*35:01 are able to interact efficiently with CD8.

Finally, HLA-B peptide-deficient conformer-CD8 interactions may also have physiological regulatory functions in NK cell biology, which requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study approval</title><p>Blood was collected from consented healthy donors for HLA genotyping and functional studies in accordance with a University of Michigan IRB approved protocol (HUM00071750).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human melanoma cell line SK-mel-19 (SK19) (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_6025">CVCL_6025</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2003</xref>) and ecotropic virus packaging cell line BOSC (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_4401">CVCL_4401</ext-link>) were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Life Technologies) and 1 × Anti/Anti (Life Technologies) (D10).

The HLA typing was performed by Sirona Genomics (Mountain View, CA), an Immucor Company. The assay, based on a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) was performed using the MIA FORA NGS HLA typing assay for the class I loci. The full-length amplicons for the class I loci were amplified and pooled. These samples were then fragmented, and tagged with unique index adaptors. The samples were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq, and the HLA type was determined using the MIA FORA NGS HLA typing software. The Sirona Genomic HLA typing method has been validated by the Histocompatibility, Immunogenetics and Disease Profiling Laboratory of the Stanford University School of Medicine using 50 reference cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Thermal shift assay</title><p>LZ-ELBM HLA-B molecules were provided by the NIH tetramer core facility. Peptide-deficient conformers of molecules were prepared by incubation with PreScission protease or thrombin overnight at 25°C. Cleaved fragments were removed by centrifuging the sample in a 0.5 ml Amicon Ultra filter device for 30 min at 13,000 rpm, 4°C. Native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE gels were both run to verify that the cleavage was efficient and HLA-B molecules became peptide-deficient. Peptide exchanges were performed by incubating HLA-B molecules with high affinity peptides together with PreScission protease or thrombin overnight at 25°C. Thermal shift assays were undertaken as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Cid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huynh and Partch, 2015</xref>). HLA-B molecules (8 µM) were incubated in buffer (PBS, pH7.4) and 1 × Sypro Orange Stain (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 20 µl. Thermal scans were performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System with temperature increments of 1°C. Fluorescence emission was measured at ROX channel.

HLA-B*35:01 molecules were further dialyzed thoroughly with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) with a 10 kDa cutoff to remove unbound peptides. The peptide-deficient and peptide-exchanged monomers were verified by SDS or native-PAGE gels. The peptide epitope HPV was used in this study to reconstitute B*35:01. Tetrameric HLA-I reagents were constructed by the addition of streptavidin conjugated to PE (Prozyme, PJRS25) or APC (Prozyme, PJ27S) at 4:1 molar ratios following the tetramerization protocol from NIH core facility. PBS + 0.5% dialyzed BSA was used as staining buffer. For CD8 blocking, anti-CD8 (clone SK1; BioLegend) was incubated with PBMCs at 10 μg/ml for 15 min at room temperature. After washing once, freshly prepared tetramers were added typically at 20 μg/ml and anti-CD8-AF700 (clone HIT8a; BioLegend), anti-CD3-pacific blue (clone UCHT1; BioLegend) and anti-CD4-APC-Cy7 (clone RPA-T4; BioLegend) were added at concentrations indicated by the manufactures and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times and 7AAD was added as a live/dead marker and samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer.

The CD8αα concentration was calculated from the extinction coefficient, which was determined by amino acid analysis to be 37150 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> at 280 nm. CD8αα was labeled with FITC according to manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific, <bold>Rockford</bold>, <bold>IL</bold>, <bold>USA</bold>). Relevant biotinylated HLA-B monomers from the tetramer core were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated agarose resin. FITC-labeled soluble CD8αα was added at different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μM) to immobilized HLA-B in binding buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA). CD8αα was pulled down after co-incubation with the resin, and the beads were washed with binding buffer. SDS loading buffer was added and samples were denatured by heating for 10 min. Samples were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorimaging on a Typhoon scanner (at 520 nm). The binding at each concentration was obtained by subtraction of the control response (resin alone) from the B*35:01 response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Viruses and cell infections</title><p>HLA-B*35:01 in retroviral vector LIC pMSCVneo were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>).

The T-cell receptors of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can then recognize the novel peptide-MHC molecules as flags to initiate appropriate immune responses. Both the TCR and CD8 molecules act in concert to recognize and respond to the peptide loaded MHC molecules. However, under certain circumstances, for example, when the peptide supply is limited by inhibition of TAP, the peptide transporter, MHC class I molecules cannot be loaded with appropriate peptides. Nevertheless, some alleles of the MHC class I molecules (e.g. HLA-B*35:01) can be expressed on the cell surface despite the absence of peptides. What possible function could these empty MHC I molecules serve?</p><p>Here, Geng and colleagues describe an unexpected novel function for empty MHC class I molecules. They show that these empty B*35:01 molecules can bind CD8 molecules on a large fraction of all CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as NK cells. These interactions enhance cell adhesion and clustering within the immunological synapse. If expression of the empty MHC I molecules is reduced by peptide loading it also reduces the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to kill their cognate targets. Thus empty MHC I molecules are functionally capable of providing an additional boost to killer T cell function. The experiments are well designed and well controlled. The conclusions are compelling.</p><p>The authors have written an insightful discussion of their unexpected discovery of a function of empty MHC I molecules. For example, many autoimmune and infectious disease outcomes are linked to specific MHC I alleles such as HLA-B*27 in autoimmune ankylosing spondylitis. Because empty HLA-B*27 molecules are expressed on the cell surface, it is possible that these molecules could play a role in this autoimmune disease linked to this MHC I allele.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent manuscript with novel findings and interesting implications.</p><p>Minor comment: The legend for Figure 6 has an error in HLA- molecules expressed by the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. HLA-A*35:01 should be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p>In the submitted manuscript the authors establish that stable and empty MHC I conformers of HLA-B35:01, as present on the surface of TAP-deficient transfectant or activated CD4T cells, have a role in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activation. By clustering at the immunological synapse the empty conformers induce a more stable CD8-T cell interaction and favor antigen-specific CTL responses.</p><p>The experiments are well performed and controlled. The conclusions supported by the experimental data.</p><p>In the big picture, this paper indicates an important role for &quot;empty&quot; MHC I molecule in CD8 immune responses; by engaging CD8 molecules with high affinity the empty conformers further stabilize the MHC-I/peptide TCR interaction. Importantly this binding could promote the stability of low affinity MHC I/peptide ligand and enhance CD8-mediated T cell responses to low affinity MHC I/peptide complexes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
