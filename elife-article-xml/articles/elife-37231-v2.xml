Here, we analyze the purified LHC with modified peptide and reconstituted semisynthetic mononucleosome substrates. LHC demethylase activity toward methyl-Lys4 in histone H3 is strongly inhibited by H3 Lys14 acetylation, and this appears to be an intrinsic property of the LSD1 subunit. Moreover, the deacetylase selectivity of LHC unexpectedly shows a marked preference for H3 acetyl-Lys9 versus acetyl-Lys14 in nucleosome substrates but this selectivity is lost with isolated acetyl-Lys H3 protein. This diminished activity of LHC to Lys-14 deacetylation in nucleosomes is not merely due to steric accessibility based on the pattern of sensitivity of the LHC enzymatic complex to hydroxamic acid-mediated inhibition. Overall, these studies have revealed how a single Lys modification can confer a composite of resistance in chromatin to a key epigenetic enzyme complex involved in gene silencing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>enzymology</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>semisynthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM62437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005640</institution-id><institution>Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center of Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001368</institution-id><institution>V Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT100237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwabe</surname><given-names>John WR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001320</institution-id><institution>Wolfson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwabe</surname><given-names>John WR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwabe</surname><given-names>John WR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical approaches reveal that an epigenetic histone deacetylase complex called CoREST is slow to deacetylate histone H3 lysine-14 in nucleosomes, and this inhibits demethylation of histone H3 lysine-4 by the CoREST complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications contribute to epigenetic regulation of gene expression in physiologic and disease processes. Enzymes that reversibly modify Lys residues in histones and other proteins are emerging therapeutic targets in cancer and other diseases. Such enzymes include the 'writers', Lys acetyltransferases (KATs) and Lys methyltransferases (KMTs) and 'erasers' histone deacetylases (HDACs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Helin and Dhanak, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shortt et al., 2017</xref>). There are numerous members of each of these writer and eraser enzyme families and several of them have been studied intensively. Here, we investigate the catalytic activities of HDAC1 and LSD1.</p><p>HDAC1 is a Class I HDAC Zn hydrolase and has a broad range of targeted acetyl-lysine (Kac) sites in histones and non-histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taunton et al., 1996</xref>). HDAC1 and its closest paralog HDAC2 (sometimes the pair are called HDAC1/2) are typically found in multi-protein repressor complexes in the cell including the CoREST complex, the NuRD complex, the MiDAC complex and the Sin3a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bantscheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laugesen and Helin, 2014</xref>). The CoREST complex which is investigated here is special because it contains HDAC1/2, LSD1, and the CoREST scaffold protein as core subunits in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>). LSD1 is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase that demethylates mono- or di-methylated Lys4 in histone H3 (H3K4me1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). Because histone Kac and methyl H3K4 modifications are typically found in regions of transcriptionally active chromatin, the enzymatic activities of HDAC1 and LSD1 in the CoREST complex tend to synergistically result in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi and Wood, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Until recently, it has been challenging to make purified, active LHC although an effective method for this has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, enzymatic studies on LSD1 and HDAC1 have commonly been based on peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayward and Cole, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marabelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Millard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watson et al., 2016</xref>) rather than the physiologic nucleosome substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) which are still technically challenging to prepare in site-specifically modified forms. One relatively new method to make semisynthetic histone H3 in N-tail modified forms involves mutant sortase, a mutant transpeptidase enzyme that can produce traceless H3 with site-specific post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piotukh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ringel et al., 2015</xref>). However, the semisynthetic H3 ligation conversions are less than 50% which can complicate isolation and purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piotukh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ringel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use purified LHC along with various peptide and modified nucleosomal substrates to examine its deacetylase and demethylase properties. We introduce a technical improvement to the engineered sortase technique for generating semisynthetic histone H3s that allows for higher conversions. Using these tools, we have gleaned new insights into the substrate selectivity of the LHC's recognition and processing of chromatin substrates that enhance our understanding of histone code molecular recognition by a key multi-protein repressor complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the LHC demethylase activity with peptide substrates</title><p>We have employed the recently described method to obtain the purified core CoREST ternary protein complex (LHC) which contains HDAC1, LSD1, and CoREST1 as a heterotrimer in 1:1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>). This complex is stable for up to 2 weeks when stored at 4˚C at a concentration of about 5 μM and freeze-thaws were avoided. LHC demethylase activity was determined with histone H3 peptide (aa1-21) substrate possessing K4me2 using a previously described coupled assay that measures hydrogen peroxide product formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayward and Cole, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marabelli et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, using the unacetylated H3K4me2 tail peptide, we observed a bi-phasic demethylase activity with LHC that was not observed with purified GST-LSD1 as the catalyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The first phase is typically about 3–5 min in duration and after transition to the second phase, product formation is quite linear for at least 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Adjusting the concentration of the coupling enzyme or peroxide detection reagents did not eliminate the bi-phasic behavior (data not shown), suggesting it is an intrinsic property of the LHC-catalyzed reaction under these buffer conditions. By varying the peptide substrate concentration, we determined that the initial phase of the LHC-catalyzed reaction had lower apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values compared to the second linear phase and that the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of the second phase was similar to that of GST-LSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Varying ionic strength, glycerol content, or inositol hexaphosphate (InsP<sub>6</sub>), an HDAC complex stabilizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), was performed to see if the kinetic profile could be simplified by adjusting the reaction conditions. InsP<sub>6</sub> somewhat prolonged the initial phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) but altering the buffer conditions did not eliminate the bi-phasic nature of the reaction. We considered the possibility that the LHC complex might be falling apart over the course of our assays, but size exclusion chromatography of the reaction mixture after 20 min showed that the complex was still intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37231.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LHC purity and its demethylase activity with H3 tail peptide substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of the purified ternary CoREST complex LHC. (<bold>B</bold>) Demethylation of 100 μM H3K4me2 H3 tail peptide (aa1-21) peptide by LHC (130 nM) exhibits a bi-phasic activity.

Since the HDAC1 in LHC was in principle capable of deacetylating these substrates contemporaneously with demethylation, we examined the demethylation in the presence of 10 μM SAHA (Vorinostat), a broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richon et al., 1998</xref>).

These results indicate that deacetylation most likely precedes demethylation, consistent with the more rapid rate of deacetylase activity reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>). Steady-state kinetic analysis in the presence of SAHA revealed that the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> of LHC demethylase action on the H3K4me2K14ac substrate were dramatically decreased (~20 fold) relative to the non-acetylated substrate.

We believe this because the peptide substrate length requirement for efficient processing by isolated LSD1 is a minimum of 20 aa of the H3 tail starting from Ala1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Culhane and Cole, 2007</xref>). An X-ray crystal structure of LSD1 in complex with an H3 peptide substrate analog shows electron density for the tail peptide extending beyond Lys14 in the complex with LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forneris et al., 2007</xref>). This structure shows that the vicinity of LSD1 near the Lys14 sidechain is negatively charged, and this may account for the reduced activity of the Lys14 acetylation substrate.</p><p>The revelation here that Lys14 deacetylation by LHC in nucleosomes is sluggish compared with deacetylation from Lys9 and Lys18 was unanticipated. In fact, we show here that LHC's deacetylase selectivity with nucleosomes is not intrinsic for acetylated H3 tail peptides or even full length acetylated H3 protein. The potential biological implications of this chromatin selectivity are noteworthy since they suggest that the CoREST complex's gene silencing function will be limited against chromatin marked by H3K14ac but more impactful in chromatin lacking this mark. As LHC will be slow to demethylate H3K4me2 when an adjacent H3K14ac is present, and H3K14ac is particularly resistant to LHC catalyzed deacetylation, the CoREST complex is hypothesized to be a poorly effective corespressor to switch off genes with an abundance of H3K4me2/H3K14ac in promoter or enhancer regions.</p><p>Whether other corepressor complexes containing HDAC1 such as Sin3a or NuRD are more efficient at deacetylating H3K14ac in chromatin is uncertain. However, it is notable that global H3K14ac, relative to H3K9ac, is minimally changed after cells are treated with the HDAC1-3 inhibitor entinostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schölz et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the nucleosomal deacetylase selectivity of LHC may be a general property of class I HDAC complexes. It has been proposed that H3K14ac can modulate the structure of the nucleosomal H3 tail as suggested by a computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ikebe et al., 2016</xref>) which could render such nucleosomes resistant to LHC deacetylase action. Evidence against this possibility is that the triacetylated H3 tail nucleosomes studied here showed similar deacetylase rates compared with the mono-acetylated nucleosomes.</p><p>We applied the hydroxamic acid (Hd) substitutions as potential transition state analogs that would correlate with the catalytic efficiencies of deacetylation at the H3K9ac and H3K14ac positions. This correlation in affinity and catalytic efficiency was not observed experimentally. We have considered a few reasons for this: (1) the hydroxamic acid interaction with the Zn does not capture the positioning of the acetamide of the substrate (that is, Hd is not really binding as a transition state analog); (2) the Hd analog sidechain is somewhat longer than that of acetyl-Lys so that the histone H3 tail backbone is further removed from the HDAC substrate binding surface; (3) the conformation of the H3 tail is different with the hydroxamic acids versus the acetyl-Lys sidechains and thus makes different contacts with the HDAC substrate binding surface. At this stage, we do not have information that can distinguish among these possibilities. In future experiments, we plan to substitute specific residues proximal to K9 and K14 in the context of nucleosomes to see if there are specific tail residues that govern the LHC deacetylation selectivities.</p><p>These studies also clearly show that deacetylation, which is much more rapidly catalyzed than demethylation, is likely to be the first step in dynamic gene silencing by LHC. This was perhaps best exemplified by the difference in histone H3 peptide demethylation being only modestly affected by K14ac unless SAHA was present to block the deacetylase activity. The bi-phasic nature of the LHC demethylase activity remains incompletely understood. We believe it suggests that there are at least two different conformations of the LHC complex with altered rate-determining steps associated with the two states, but more detailed structural studies will be needed to clarify this possibility. How DNA and BHC influence these potential conformations will also be interesting to pursue in future work. We hypothesize that DNA may be an allosteric activator of LSD1 and may also play a role as a template to bring substrate and enzyme closer together. The hydroxamic acid nucleosomes introduced in this study to probe H3 tail accessibility may also prove useful in enhancing structural characterization of a nucleosome-LHC complex by increasing the stability of this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pilotto et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>From a technical standpoint, we have combined the use of F40 sortase and depsipeptide H3 tails to improve the production of semisynthetic H3. We believe that for generating N-terminally modified H3s, this approach offers advantages over native chemical ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holt and Muir, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seenaiah et al., 2015</xref>), nonsense suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neumann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), or other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chalker et al., 2012</xref>) in combining high yield and efficiency of incoprorating tails with multiple and diverse modifications without the need for Cys mutation/desulfurization.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we applied chemical and biochemical tools to study how LSD1 and HDAC1 in the context of the CoREST complex act on nucleosomes to modify histone marks.

The data in the initial linear phase and second linear phase were analyzed separately using linear regression and GraphPad Prism five software to determine reaction rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of demethylation of H3K4me2 nucleosomes</title><p>H3K4me2 nucleosomes (100 nM, 146 bp or 185 bp) were treated with LHC (400 nM) in a buffer with 50 mM HEPES 7.5 and 0.2 mg/mL BSA at 25°C. At each time point, 10 μL aliquots were mixed with 2 μL 80 mM EDTA and 4 μL 4x SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C, and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose, H3K4me2 and total H3 were detected by western blot with specific antibodies on separate gels. Western blot bands were visualized by ECL and quantified using ImageJ software, and the data were fit to a single phase exponential decay curve using GraphPad Prism five software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of deacetylation of acetylated nucleosomes and acetylated histone H3s</title><p>The H3Kac nucleosomes (100 nM) or histone H3s (1.0 μM) were treated with LHC (1–20 nM) or His-FLAG-HDAC1 (5 nM) in reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 100 μM InsP<sub>6</sub>, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA at 37°C. At each time point, 10 μL aliquots were mixed with 2 μL 80 mM EDTA and 4 μL 4x SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C, and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and total H3 were detected by western blot with specific antibodies on separate gels. Western blot bands were visualized by ECL and quantified using ImageJ software and the data was fit to a single phase exponential decay curve using GraphPad Prism five software. In general, these experiments were done with histone H3 or nucleosomes that also contained H3K4me2. As our earlier work suggested that demethylation of K4me2 is very slow compared with deacetylation, we hypothesized that the H3K4 modification would not perturb deacetylation by LHC. In fact, we prepared H3K9ac nucleosomes lacking H3K4me2 and these showed similar behavior to those that contained H3K4me2 (please compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fluorogenic HDAC1 deacetylation assay and inhibition</title><p>LHC (1 nM) was pretreated with hydroxamic acid (K9Hd or K14Hd) containing nucleosomes (50–400 nM), histone H3 (3–200 nM), or H3 peptide (3–800 nM) or control nucleosomes in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 100 μM InsP<sub>6</sub> and 0.2 mg/mL BSA) for 30 min in ice. Next, the HDAC fluorogenic peptide substrate (50 μM) was added and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The HDAC Developer (2x) was added to quench the deacetylation reactions and develop the fluorescence signal for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed in 96-well plates by a fluorescent plate reader with excitation at a wavelength of 365 nm and detection of emitted light in the range of 450 nm. The data was analyzed by non-linear curve fitting (log(inhibitor) vs response) using GraphPad Prism five software to determine the IC<sub>50</sub>. Ki was calculated from the equation Ki=IC<sub>50</sub>/([S]/Km +1) assuming a competitive inhibition model that was demonstrated by Dixon plot for K14Hd nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37231.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of the findings here of the enzymatic activities of the CoREST complex with a modified nucleosome substrate.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37231-fig8-v2"/></fig></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dirk Schwarzer (Tübingen) for helpful ideas and sharing the F-40 sortase and the globular histone H3 DNA constructs, Cynthia Wolberger (Johns Hopkins) for the core histone DNA constructs, Song Tan (Penn State) for the 146 bp 601 DNA construct, Robert Levendosky and Greg Bowman (Johns Hopkins) for the 601 DNA template and assistance with preparing the 185 bp 601 DNA.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Wilfred van der Donk and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Champak Chatterjee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors use semisynthetic methylated and acetylated nucleosomes as substrates to study the effect of H3 tail acetylation on H3K4me2 demethylation by the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 core complex (LHC). Using nucleosomes with well-defined tail modifications, the authors make several key observations that advance our understanding of LCH function. LSD1 demethylase activity on K4me2 was found to be strongly inhibited by H3 Lys14ac. Furthermore, the deacetylase selectivity of LHC shows a marked preference for H3K9ac. LHC displayed biphasic kinetics of demethylation, which is not seen with LSD1 alone, and a BHC80 protein fragment eliminates the second phase of LSD1 activity. In addition to reporting on the activity of LHC with defined substrates, the authors also report a sortase ligation strategy to generate site-specifically modified H3 protein in high yield that was used for preparation of semisynthetic mononucleosome. This technology is suggested to be complementary and sometimes superior to existing methods. Based on the observations a reasonable model is proposed for LCH function. This study furthers our understanding of histone modification in nucleosomes and provides a potentially powerful new method that may allow the community to more readily prepare these complex substrates.</p><p>Please revise the manuscript in response to the points made below. Note that no new experimental work is requested.</p><p>Important points to consider:</p><p>1) The authors mention that the sortagging strategy to provide site-specifically modified H3 is more facile than other existing methods. However, they do not report yields for the semisynthesis, nor the synthesis of the depsipeptide. This renders it hard to evaluate such a concrete conclusion.</p><p>2) The effects of DNA or BHC80 on LHC activity are interesting. Is the activation by DNA an allosteric effect? It seems that DNA facilitates the transition of a low-activity conformation of LHC to a high-activity conformation. On the other hand, BHC80 stabilizes LHC in the low-activity conformation state.</p><p>3) The presence of H3K14ac is shown to have an inhibitory effect on LSD1's K4me2 demethylase activity. Does this have to be an intramolecular mechanism, or is it possible that two substrates bind so that K14ac intermolecularly affects K4 demethylation? Does the deacetylated nucleosome dissociate from the LHC complex prior to the demethylation reaction?</p><p>4) Quantification of total H3 and H3 PTMs (methylation and acetylation) in each gel lane was undertaken with different sets of antibodies. It is unclear from the text how the blots were visualized as both antibodies presumably target the same H3 band and may occlude each other to varying degrees. Some more detail in the quantification of WB data relative to H3 would be useful.</p><p>5) Mononucleosome is a poor substrate for LHC compared to H3 peptide. Does the mononucleosome become a better substrate upon adding 146bp DNA to the reaction system, in a similar way as shown in Figure 2D?</p><p>6) The authors state that &quot;there was little effect of unmodified or acetylated mononuclesomes&quot;, but there are no data on unmodified mononucleosomes in Figure 7C.</p><p>7) Based on the data in Figure 7F, it appears that HDAC1 equally recognizes K9ac and K14ac. However, the authors also find that LHC prefers deacetylating K9ac over K14ac in nucleosomes (Figure 6). Can the authors add more discussion explaining these results?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37231.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important points to consider:</p><p>1) The authors mention that the sortagging strategy to provide site-specifically modified H3 is more facile than other existing methods.

We have now added these to the Materials and methods section and note that the purified semisynthetic histone H3 yield is 46% based on the limiting substrate (gH3). The standard purified depsipeptide yields are 16-21% on a 0.1 mmol scale whereas those containing the hydroxamic acid analog are 7-9% performed on the same scale. We also hope that we did not come across as denigrating existing methods to generate histone H3 which have their own strengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effects of DNA or BHC80 on LHC activity are interesting.

It seems likely to us that the activation of the LHC demethylase activity by DNA involves an allosteric effect but it may also involve a templating role of some kind. We have added these speculations to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presence of H3K14ac is shown to have an inhibitory effect on LSD1's K4me2 demethylase activity. Does this have to be an intramolecular mechanism, or is it possible that two substrates bind so that K14ac intermolecularly affects K4 demethylation? Does the deacetylated nucleosome dissociate from the LHC complex prior to the demethylation reaction?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the K14Ac inhibitory effect is likely through an intramolecular mechanism. We believe this because the peptide substrate length requirement for efficient processing by isolated LSD1 is a minimum of 20 aa of the H3 tail starting from Ala1. An X-ray crystal structure of LSD1 in complex with an H3 peptide substrate analog shows electron density for the tail peptide extending beyond Lys14 in the complex with LSD1. This structure shows that the vicinity of LSD1 near the Lys14 sidechain is negatively charged, and this may account for LSD1's reduced activity toward the Lys14 acetylation substrate. We have added this speculation to the Discussion. Although we have not measured the dissociation rate of the deacetylated nucleosome from LHC, we think that it is likely to dissociate fairly rapidly relative to the demethylase reaction, given how slow the latter is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Quantification of total H3 and H3 PTMs (methylation and acetylation) in each gel lane was undertaken with different sets of antibodies. It is unclear from the text how the blots were visualized as both antibodies presumably target the same H3 band and may occlude each other to varying degrees. Some more detail in the quantification of WB data relative to H3 would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis of methylation and acetylation by western blot shown in Figure 5 and 6 did indeed involve separate analysis with specific antibodies for the particular methylation or acetylation sites as well as total H3. There was no stripping of blots and reprobing in these experiments. Instead, each reaction mixture was run on sufficient scale and divided into portions that were analyzed to assess total H3 and PTM-modified H3 on separate blots. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section. Since these reactions involved purified nucleosomes from the same stock, the issue of equal loading from lane to lane is less of a concern then, for example, performing such experiments after isolation of proteins from crude extracts. However, inclusion of the total H3 controls supports the idea that even loading was achieved and that proteolytic breakdown over the time scale of the experiment is not a problem under these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mononucleosome is a poor substrate for LHC compared to H3 peptide. Does the mononucleosome become a better substrate upon adding 146bp DNA to the reaction system, in a similar way as shown in Figure 2D?</p></disp-quote><p>We did a pilot experiment along these lines and 146 bp DNA addition in trans had no effect on demethylase action of LHC on nucleosomes. However, we are reluctant to include this or pursue this experiment in depth because adding excess large DNA could theoretically cause instability of the nucleosomes rendering interpretation complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors state that &quot;there was little effect of unmodified or acetylated mononuclesomes&quot;, but there are no data on unmodified mononucleosomes in Figure 7C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for spotting this error. We have now added the data for the non-acetylated tail to this panel which was omitted inadvertently from the manuscript (it has also been included in the data deposition in Dryad).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Based on the data in Figure 7F, it appears that HDAC1 equally recognizes K9ac and K14ac. However, the authors also find that LHC prefers deacetylating K9ac over K14ac in nucleosomes (Figure 6). Can the authors add more discussion explaining these results?</p></disp-quote><p>We applied the hydroxamic acid (Hd) substitutions as potential transition state analogs that would correlate with the catalytic efficiencies of deacetylation at the H3K9ac and H3K14ac positions. This correlation in affinity and catalytic efficiency was not observed experimentally. We have considered a few reasons for this: 1) the hydroxamic acid interaction with the Zn does not capture the positioning of the acetamide of the substrate (that is, Hd is not really binding as a transition state analog); 2) the Hd analog sidechain is somewhat longer than that of acetyl-Lys so that the histone H3 tail backbone is further removed from the HDAC substrate binding surface; 3) the conformation of the H3 tail is different with the hydroxamic acids versus the acetyl-Lys sidechains and thus makes different contacts with the HDAC substrate binding surface. At this stage, we do not have information that can distinguish among these possibilities. In future experiments, we plan to substitute specific residues proximal to K9 and K14 in the context of nucleosomes to see if there are specific tail residues that govern the LHC deacetylation selectivities.</p></body></sub-article></article>
