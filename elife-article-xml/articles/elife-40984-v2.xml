Here, we reveal a third major effector involved in D2R modulation of dopaminergic neurons - the sodium leak channel, NALCN. We found that activation of D2 receptors robustly inhibits isolated sodium leak currents in wild-type mice but not in NALCN conditional knockout mice. Intracellular GDP-βS abolished the inhibition, indicating a G protein-dependent signaling mechanism. The application of dopamine reliably slowed pacemaking even when GIRK channels were pharmacologically blocked. Furthermore, while spontaneous activity was observed in nearly all dopaminergic neurons in wild-type mice, neurons from NALCN knockouts were mainly silent. Both observations demonstrate the critical importance of NALCN for pacemaking in dopaminergic neurons. Finally, we show that GABA-B receptor activation also produces inhibition of NALCN-mediated currents. Therefore, we identify NALCN as a core effector of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine neurons</kwd><kwd>sodium leak channel</kwd><kwd>Gi/o protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>GABA-B receptors</kwd><kwd>D2 receptors</kwd><kwd>substantia nigra</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS003135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khaliq</surname><given-names>Zayd M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sodium leak NALCN channel functions as a core effector of GABA-B and D2 receptors that is used along with GIRK channels to regulate action potential firing in dopamine neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (D2R) receptors are G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors that are expressed widely throughout the brain to control a range of behaviors including locomotion, motivation, action selection, and appetitive reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Drugs that target D2 receptors have been used for decades as therapies against schizophrenia, but also for bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. A critical step in improving therapeutic approaches that involve these and other G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors is to obtain a more complete knowledge of their primary effectors.</p><p>An extensive literature has been devoted to understanding D2 receptor modulation of midbrain dopamine neurons. D2-receptors provide feedback autoinhibition of dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ford, 2014</xref>). Drugs of abuse such as cocaine increase dopamine levels which then inhibits the activity of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Einhorn et al., 1988</xref>). Genetic ablation of D2-autoreceptors leads to hyperactivity and enhanced locomotor responses to cocaine in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bello et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>At the cellular level, most studies examining D2-autoreceptor modulation focus primarily on two ion channel effectors: voltage-gated calcium channels and G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011</xref>). In midbrain dopamine neurons, somatodendritic D2 receptors autoregulate excitability through inhibition of high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardozo and Bean, 1995</xref>). In addition, D2 receptors couple to GIRK channels to hyperpolarize cells and inhibit tonic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajanian and Bunney, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lacey et al., 1987</xref>). Genetic ablation of the GIRK2 subunit alone abolishes all GIRK-mediated currents in dopaminergic neurons, resulting in a substantial reduction in both D2 and GABA-B receptor-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, a non-GIRK component remains in GIRK2 knockout mice and has yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). A potential candidate may be Kv1 channels that are recruited by D2 receptors to inhibit dopamine release from axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fulton et al., 2011</xref>). However, examination of somatic firing in dopamine cells has shown that block of somatodendritic Kv1 channels has little effect on the rate of firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khaliq and Bean, 2008</xref>), suggesting that somatic Kv1 channels are unlikely to account for this current. Considering this evidence, the modulated current remaining in GIRK2 knockouts may be a protein class separate from potassium conductances. In this study, we investigate whether activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors results in modulation of the resting sodium leak conductance.</p><p>NALCN is a non-selective sodium leak channel that is expressed widely in neurons throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ren, 2011</xref>). Mutations in NALCN leads to dysfunction of brainstem respiratory systems in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>), disrupted circadian rhythms in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>), motor dysfunction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), and cognitive defects in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bend et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lozic et al., 2016</xref>). At the cellular level, NALCN-mediated currents depolarize the resting membrane potential in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2007</xref>) and drive spontaneous firing in GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to generating a sodium leak current, NALCN channels are activated by tachykinin- and neurotensin-receptors through a G protein-independent, tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, the calcium sensor receptor (CaSR) regulates NALCN in a G-protein dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, behavioral experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that the nematode dopamine receptor, Dop-3, modulates ortholog Na<sup>+</sup> leak channels, NCA-1 and NCA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Topalidou et al., 2017</xref>). However, direct electrophysiological evidence for modulation is lacking and results may differ in mammalian neurons. Therefore, whether NALCN-mediated currents are regulated by G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors such as the D2 receptor has yet to be examined.</p><p>Here, we show that NALCN-mediated sodium leak currents are strongly inhibited by activation of D2 receptors. Moreover, in the presence of GIRK channel blockers, the D2 receptor inhibition of NALCN alone decreases firing rate in dopamine neurons. In addition, this inhibition was observed following GABA-B activation. Thus, our data identify the NALCN channel as a core effector of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors that functions along with GIRK channels to modulate neuronal firing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determining the contribution of NALCN to sodium leak currents in SNc dopamine neurons</title><p>We set out to test the involvement of NALCN channels in G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptor modulation of midbrain dopamine neurons. Previous work has demonstrated the expression of NALCN channels in primary dopamine neuron cultures from postnatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). To test the role of NALCN channels in excitability of dopaminergic neurons from adult animals, we generated mice in which the NALCN allele was flanked by lox-P sites (<italic>Nalcn<sup>flox</sup></italic>). These mice were then bred to DAT-Cre mice, resulting in offspring (<italic>Nalcn<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Slc6a3<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) that lack expression of NALCN in dopaminergic neurons.</p><p>To determine the contribution of NALCN to background leak currents in dopamine neurons in coronal brain slices from adult mice, we first isolated sodium leak currents using a Cs<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular recording solution (CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>) to block potassium conductances. In addition, tetrodotoxin (1 µM), CsCl (3 mM), and apamin (300 nM) were included in the extracellular solution to block voltage-gated sodium channels, hyperpolarization-gated (I<sub>h</sub>) channels and small-conductance calcium-activated (SK) channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, to block resting sodium leak currents, we replaced Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the extracellular bath with a large impermeant ion, N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, sodium replacement with NMDG resulted in a reduction of the average holding current (V<sub>hold</sub> = −70 mV) from −40.7 ± 10.18 to −13.75 ± 7.39 pA (n = 8; p = 0.0078, Wilcoxon).

The molecular basis of the potentiation involves relief of tonic inhibition from the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) onto NALCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). In dopamine neurons, low external calcium results in faster spontaneous firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>), but whether the increase in spontaneous firing is caused by potentiation of resting sodium leak current in low extracellular calcium solutions has not been tested.</p><p>We tested the effect of lowering extracellular calcium from 2 mM to 0.1 mM on the isolated sodium leak current. Switching to low calcium solution, the resting sodium leak current increased dramatically over a time-course of 6–10 min from an amplitude of −50.69 ± 5.35 pA to −192 ± 20.07 pA (n = 22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; p &lt; 0.0001, RM one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test).

These recordings were made using Cs<sup>+</sup>-based internal solutions, but in separate experiments we tested the amplitude of NMDG-sensitive currents in low extracellular calcium measured using K<sup>+</sup>-based internal solutions. We observed no difference in the amplitude of NMDG-sensitive currents when recording with either Cs<sup>+</sup>-based or K<sup>+</sup>-based internal solutions (NMDG-sensitive current at −70 mV; Cs<sup>+</sup>-based, 138 ± 18 pA, n = 22; K<sup>+</sup>-based, 107.9 ± 17 pA, n = 8; p = 0.36).</p><p>To test directly for the involvement of NALCN channels in the low calcium potentiation of the resting leak, we recorded from dopaminergic neurons in NALCN conditional knockout mice.

Therefore, in agreement with the work of Ren and colleagues in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>), our experiments in dopaminergic neurons demonstrate that the low calcium potentiation of the sodium leak reflects potentiation of current flowing through NALCN channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dopamine D2 receptors robustly inhibit NALCN current</title><p>D2 receptors play a dominant role in shaping the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this, we substituted the GTP contained in our intracellular solutions for 1 mM GDP-βS, a nonhydrolyzable form of GDP which prevents G protein signaling. The first set of experiments were performed with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Upon breakthrough, cells that were recorded using GDP-βS internal solution showed a slow but steady increase in the inward leak current (1–2 min after breakthrough, −67.69 ± 12.75 pA;~15 min following breakthrough, −125.9 ± 20.73 pA; n = 8; p = 0.0027, RM one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The enhancement in leak current is likely due to GDP-βS dependent disruption in signaling from calcium sensing (CaSR) receptors, which produce an incomplete but constitutive inhibition of NALCN-mediated leak currents in the presence of extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Substitution of GTP with GDP-βS in the intracellular solution completely abolished the D2 receptor-mediated inhibition of the NALCN current.

In wild-type animals, we found that 135 out of 148 of dopaminergic neurons (91.21%, 33 mice) were spontaneously active with firing frequencies above 0.1 Hz. In NALCN conditional knockout mice, however, we were surprised to find that only a minor fraction of dopamine neurons, 18 out of 60 (30%, 18 mice) were spontaneously active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We confirmed that silent neurons were dopaminergic cells by breaking through and checking for the presence of a sag potential (I<sub>h</sub>). In these silent dopaminergic neurons, the resting membrane potential immediately following breakthrough was hyperpolarized at an average of −53.65 ± 0.71 mV (n = 15). However, small current injections of 10–20 pA in these cells was sufficient to restore a regular tonic firing activity at 0.5 to 5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that these cells were healthy and capable of firing action potentials.

To minimize non-specific effects due to leaky pipette seals, we first recorded in cell-attached configuration. Under control conditions, we found that puff application of dopamine (300 µM, 1 s) resulted in a long duration pause in firing (47.88 ± 10.28 s, n = 8) as expected. To isolate effects mainly due to inhibition of NALCN channels alone, we then applied dopamine in the presence of extracellular BaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1 mM) plus the high affinity peptide blocker tertiapin-Q (300 nM), which are both effective blockers of GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin and Lu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sodickson and Bean, 1996</xref>). In the presence of GIRK channel blockers, dopamine application resulted in a substantial reduction in firing from 2.56 ± 0.18 to 0.89 ± 0.26 Hz (n = 8; p = 0.0078, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). We obtained similar results using a high concentration (0.5 mM) of extracellular BaCl<sub>2</sub> alone which was shown to completely block GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sodickson and Bean, 1996</xref>). Under these conditions, puff application of dopamine resulted in a 73.81 ± 10.47% reduction in the firing (n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, dopamine puff in solutions containing 300 nM tertiapin-Q only without added barium resulted in similar inhibition as well (n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that low concentrations of barium present in the extracellular solution do not significantly contribute to the observed effects.</p><p>The lack of spontaneous activity in neurons from NALCN knockout mice precluded cell-attached experiments examining effects of dopamine on spontaneous firing. Therefore, we performed a parallel set of experiments in whole-cell configuration where we drove tonic firing with small current injections. Similar to our cell-attached recordings, dopamine reduced firing in wild-type mice even in the presence of GIRK channel blockers 3.71 ± 0.32 to 1.71 ± 0.32 Hz (n = 9; p = 0.0039, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). By contrast, dopamine neurons recorded in the NALCN conditional knockout showed no reduction in firing when dopamine was applied in the presence of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and tertiapin-Q. In fact, we observed a trend toward a small increase in the firing rate following puff application of dopamine (NALCN cKO mice; control, 3.024 ± 0.22 Hz; dopamine, 3.31 ± 0.25 Hz; n = 8; p = 0.078, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). This increase in firing rate is similar to the excitation seen following activation of dopamine transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingram et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, these results demonstrate that NALCN channels contribute significantly to pacemaking in dopamine neurons.

Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that the NALCN-mediated sodium leak conductance is negatively modulated by both dopamine D2 receptors and GABA-B receptors. We also show that modulation of NALCN leads to significant slowing of spontaneous activity, consistent with its role in driving pacemaking. Lastly, we show that baclofen exhibits a higher potency in inhibiting NALCN than for activating GIRK channels. Thus, we identify the NALCN channel as a core effector of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors that functions in concert with GIRK channels to inhibit neuronal firing in midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Contribution of NALCN to pacemaking in dopaminergic neurons</title><p>It has been long appreciated that sodium leak currents are present in a variety of spontaneously active neurons. Voltage-clamp experiments using ion substitution have identified prominent subthreshold sodium leak currents in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>), GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</xref>), neurons of the cerebellar nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raman et al., 2000</xref>) and suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>). However, the lack of specific blockers coupled with imprecise knowledge of the channels that generate leak currents have complicated efforts to study their role in pacemaking.</p><p>Using NALCN conditional knockout mice, we provide clear evidence that pacemaking in dopaminergic neurons is driven in part by sodium leak current flowing through NALCN channels. Specifically, we found that knockout of NALCN in dopaminergic neurons results in significantly smaller resting sodium leak currents measured at −70 mV. Second, direct inhibition of NALCN by D2 and GABA-B receptors slows pacemaking. Lastly, the majority of SNc neurons (70%) recorded in brain slices from NALCN conditional knockout mice lack spontaneous activity. Consistent with these findings, recent studies in SNr GABAergic neurons and chemosensory neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus have found that knockout of NALCN results in hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a ~ 50% reduction in spontaneous firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>). In circadian pacemaker neurons, knockout of NALCN leads to nearly complete abolishment of pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with these observations, therefore, our results in dopaminergic neurons suggest that NALCN plays a central role in pacemaking.</p><p>A previous study of the conductances that drive pacemaking reported that background sodium leak currents in VTA dopamine neurons are large in amplitude, while sodium leak currents in SNc neurons are relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>). Given this prior result, we were surprised to see that the majority of SNc neurons in NALCN knockout mice lack spontaneous firing, and that D2R and GABA-BR modulation of the NALCN current produces such a significant inhibition of pacemaking. Although we also observed small amplitude sodium leak currents with 2 mM external calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this study focuses on G protein receptor modulation of spontaneous firing which is highly sensitive to small conductance changes. In addition to the previously described differences in leak currents between VTA and SNc neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>), however, heterogeneity may also exist across subpopulations of SNc neurons either in NALCN expression and/or differences in the regulation of NALCN by external calcium through the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR). Therefore, it will be important for future studies to examine the expression and regulation of NALCN in midbrain dopamine neurons subpopulations.</p><p>The absence of spontaneous activity in dopamine neurons from the NALCN knockout mice was also surprising given the known robustness of firing. Action potential firing is generate by multiple subthreshold conductances with overlapping functions, an arrangement that favors compensatory adaptation when single conductances are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drion et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guzman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swensen and Bean, 2005</xref>). In addition, homeostatic mechanisms can compensate for genetic ablation of ion channels in knockout mice. As an example, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 L-type calcium channels are active during pacemaking in dopamine neurons, but knockout of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 has little effect on firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe et al., 2009</xref>) due to upregulation of T-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poetschke et al., 2015</xref>). In the NALCN knockout mice, by contrast, autonomously-generated spontaneous firing was absent in most dopaminergic neurons. It is possible that homeostatic compensation was not sufficient to restore firing, which may be evidence for the critical role of NALCN in pacemaking. Alternatively, compensation may have occurred at the level of synaptic drive onto the dopamine neurons. Therefore, future experiments should test whether compensatory adaptations have occurred in excitatory synaptic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptor modulation of NALCN</title><p>We provide the first direct evidence of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptor modulation of NALCN. However, G protein-coupled receptors are known to influence multiple effector targets which raises the question of whether other channels may contribute to the effects described here. For example, GABA-B receptors in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex have been shown to activate background leak tandem-pore potassium (K2P) channels, TREK1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breton and Stuart, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sandoz et al., 2012</xref>). In VTA dopamine neurons recorded in GIRK2 knockouts, activation of GABA-B receptors evokes a Ba<sup>2+</sup> insensitive, non-GIRK current that was hypothesized to be produced by K2P channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly in SNc neurons, we found the that Ba<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive effects of GABA-B and D2 receptors observed in wildtype mice were abolished in NALCN knockout mice. These observations suggest that differences may exist between GABA-B signaling in SNc and VTA dopamine neurons.</p><p>Our data show that the sensitivity of NALCN to baclofen is high, with an IC50 of 267 nM. By comparison, GIRK channels exhibit a much lower sensitivity to baclofen according to published EC50 values in dopamine neurons (9.2 and 14.8 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2004</xref>) and in other neurons such as midbrain GABAergic neurons and hippocampal neurons (range, 0.9–4.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sodickson and Bean, 1996</xref>). The functional importance of this difference is currently unknown. However, one possibility is that the proximity of GABA-B receptor to inhibitory synapses may determine the extent to which NALCN or GIRK channels are recruited. GABA-B receptors located close to synapses are exposed to high GABA concentrations which would favor GIRK activation. On the other hand, modulation through extrasynaptic GABA-B receptors, which are activated by lower concentrations of GABA, may primarily involve inhibition of NALCN.</p><p>The G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptor inhibition of NALCN may add new features to signal processing mechanisms in dopamine neurons. For instance, GIRK and NALCN could potentially play a synergistic role in membrane hyperpolarization. While both hyperpolarize the membrane potential, activation of GIRK channels decreases input resistance while inhibition of NALCN increases input resistance. As a result, simultaneous inhibition of NALCN may function to potentiate GIRK-mediated hyperpolarization. Moreover, the tightened membrane may allow synaptic inputs to drive rebound firing more effectively from hyperpolarized membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The spatial proximity of NALCN and GIRKs could also enable potential interactions between these channels. Indeed, we find that NALCN currents are inhibited nearly maximally by activation of either GABA-B and D2 receptors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). This suggests an interesting scenario where GABA-B and D2 receptors may be arranged spatially into overlapping microdomains in which both receptors have access to GIRK channels and the NALCN signaling complex. Likewise, it has been shown that GIRK channels are inhibited by intracellular calcium but enhanced by internal sodium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramer and Williams, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the question of whether NALCN and GIRK channels colocalize in a complex with G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors and whether Na<sup>+</sup> flowing through NALCN channels potentiates GIRK currents. Future studies should focus on determining the subcellular locations of NALCN, GIRKs and other effectors of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors.</p><p>As mentioned, existing evidence indicates that the mechanisms of GABA-B modulation may differ substantially between subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons and SNc neurons. Specifically, VTA dopamine neurons that project to medial and lateral nucleus accumbens differ markedly in their responses to baclofen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, past work has shown that the expression level of GIRK2 mRNA is 10 times lower in dopaminergic neurons of the medial VTA relative to laterally located mesostriatal dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, despite the low expression of GIRK expression in mesocortical cells, it was shown that bath application of both GABA and baclofen silenced the firing of mesocortical dopamine neurons completely. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of NALCN channels alone is sufficient to slow down the firing rate. Therefore, it will be important to determine the extent to which inhibition of NALCN contributes to the GIRK-independent GABA-B inhibition of medial VTA dopamine neurons.</p><p>Collectively, our findings provide evidence that NALCN is an effector of G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled receptors in dopamine neurons. Both GABA-B and D2 receptors modulate NALCN, raising the possibility that this may be a common feature to other G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptors across different neuronal cell types. These results may provide a novel avenue for drug development strategies and molecular therapeutics that target Gi/o protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use and generation of transgenic mice</title><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with guidelines set by the animal care and use committee for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke and the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Beckstead (Reviewer #1); Andrew Lutas (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were intrigued by the manuscript, but had a number of mostly non-overlapping concerns that would in some cases require additional data to address. The reviewers each made extensive comments, but in our post-review discussion we agreed that we thought you would be able to address these issues with additional comments and some additional experiments within a timeframe of 2 months. Because of the explanatory text in each review, I thought it was more helpful to you to provide the text of the original reviews rather than attempt to consolidate the comments into a single set of major and minor comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This interesting manuscript by Philippart and Khaliq identifies the sodium leak channel NALCN as a mediator of G<sub>i/o</sub> receptor inhibition in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In spite of the large body of literature describing D2 and GABAB receptor signaling in these neurons, the investigators (aided by a NALCN knockout mouse) have found a new effector of G<sub>i/o</sub> receptor signaling. The current amplitudes observed were small under physiological conditions, however the authors nonetheless showed that the channel has major effects on pacemaker firing in this cell type (consistent with previous work by the senior author showing that small sub-threshold currents can have large effects on firing). As midbrain dopaminergic neurons are involved in complex behavioral processes and the etiology of many neurological disorders, these findings could have far-reaching consequences. Furthermore, it is likely that these effects occur in at least some of the other neuron types throughout the CNS where G<sub>i/o</sub> receptor signaling is a prominent inhibitory mechanism. The experiments themselves range from voltage clamp to current clamp to cell-attached recordings, and consistent with this group's reputation are expertly performed. The manuscript itself is well-written. However, the final contribution to the literature could be enhanced with a few straightforward additions.</p><p>In the G<sub>i/o</sub> inhibition experiments, only single concentrations of drugs were used. Using GIRK channel activation in these neurons as a guide, 100 µM dopamine might be expected to be maximally effective while 10 µM baclofen might be expected to be somewhat less than maximal. Strikingly, 10 µM baclofen completely walloped the NALCN current (Figure 4A). This suggests that this effector may be more sensitive to GABAB receptor activation than GIRK channels, which would be extremely interesting and have implications for the physiological relevance of these findings. Full concentration-response curves with high n's are probably too much to ask. However, given that this manuscript is describing a new effector of G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling in these heavily studied neurons, a rough concentration-response with maybe ~2 more concentrations of baclofen and dopamine would allow for an estimate of the EC50s, and would be a valuable addition for the literature record.</p><p>The D2 receptor desensitization finding should be further clarified.

The current manuscript suggests a different result for NALCN inhibition, although the experiment may be a bit underpowered for high confidence (n=4 in the arrestin group). Oddly, the wild-type trace in Figure 2A shows zero dopamine-induced desensitization, but the summary data in panel 2D suggests that the smallest amount of desensitization observed in any single neuron in wild-type mice was around 15%. The authors should clarify why the trace doesn't match the summary data and maybe get a few more arrestin cells to enhance confidence in this conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study presents convincing evidence that NALCN-mediated currents are inhibited by G<sub>i/o</sub> GPCR activation in nigral dopamine neurons.

For the voltage clamp experiments, TTX was included which the authors should, at the very least, make a stronger point of arguing that it is unlikely that dopamine is increasing GABA spontaneous firing and thus releasing more GABA onto dopamine neurons in an action potential dependent manner.

We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p><p>We performed new experiments to test the concentration dependence of NALCN inhibition by dopamine and baclofen. Concentration-response curves for dopamine inhibition of NALCN yielded an IC50 of 725 nM (Figure 2C), which is roughly comparable to published EC50 values for dopamine activation of GIRK channels in dopamine neurons (published dopamine EC50 values, 155 nM and 233 nM; Uchida et al., 2000; Kim et al., 1995).</p><p>Concentration-response curves for baclofen inhibition of NALCN yielded an IC50 of 267 nM (Figure 6A), which is more than an order of magnitude lower than published EC50 values for baclofen activation of GIRK channels in dopamine neurons (published baclofen EC50 values, 9.2 and 14.8 μM; Chan et al., 1998; Cruz et al., 2004). As the reviewer predicted, therefore, we find that NALCN channels are substantially more sensitive than GIRK2 channels to G protein signaling by GABA-B receptors.</p><p>This observation suggests that the effects of low baclofen concentrations may be mediated almost exclusively by inhibition of NALCN. Consistent with this idea, we found that spontaneous firing (measured in 300 nM Tertiapin-Q) was significantly reduced even by 300 nM concentration of baclofen (Figure 6C-E).

According to this criterion, we excluded the example trace shown in the first version of Figure 2A. However, we have since concluded that the slow timing of agonist onset during our bath application experiments will lead to a mixture of activation and desensitization, which will complicate examination of kinetics of receptor responses.
