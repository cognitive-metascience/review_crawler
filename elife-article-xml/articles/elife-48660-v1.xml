The proliferation and fate controls of injury-reactivated glia are essential but remain largely unexplored. In zebrafish optic tectum, we found that stab injury drove a subset of radial glia (RG) into the cell cycle, and surprisingly, proliferative RG responding to sequential injuries of the same site were distinct but overlapping, which was in agreement with stochastic cell-cycle entry. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and functional assays further revealed the involvement of Notch/Delta lateral inhibition in this stochastic cell-cycle entry. Furthermore, the long-term clonal analysis showed that proliferative RG were largely gliogenic. Notch inhibition of reactive RG, not dormant and proliferative RG, resulted in an increased production of neurons, which were short-lived.

Gliosis defined as reactive changes of resident macroglia (<italic>e.g.</italic>, mammalian astrocytes) is a primary CNS response to TBI in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barres, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). In mammals, gliosis undergoes three significant stages: Glial cells initially become reactive, hypertrophic, and inflammatory, with characteristic upregulation of GFAP and vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>); subsequently, a subset of reactive glia re-enter the cell cycle and become proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallo and Deneen, 2014</xref>); finally, proliferative glia undergo gliogenesis, the process of glial cell production, and form structures known as glial scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). Earlier studies have demonstrated both protective and detrimental roles of the gliosis in the injured CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faulkner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wanner et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, the blockage of initial glia reactivation worsened the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faulkner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wanner et al., 2013</xref>), whereas glia scars hindered neuronal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>). In the process, the proliferation and fate controls of injury-reactivated RG are essential but remain elusive in vivo.</p><p>In contrast to the mammalian CNS, teleost fish exhibit a superior neural regeneration in response to TBI beyond embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grandel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reimer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Than-Trong and Bally-Cuif, 2015</xref>). Radial glia (RG), the primary form of macroglia in teleost fish, are the main cell source for injury-mediated regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Than-Trong and Bally-Cuif, 2015</xref>). For instance, RG of different brain regions in zebrafish, including the telencephalon, the hypothalamus, and the spinal cord can produce newborn neurons in response to the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldshmit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroehne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Than-Trong and Bally-Cuif, 2015</xref>). Also, retinal müller glia (MG) can be reactivated by the injury, giving rise to newborn retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorsuch and Hyde, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferation and fate controls of injury-reactivated RG have been examined in zebrafish for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman, 2014</xref>). As to the proliferation control, Notch signaling is involved but is somehow context-dependent. For instance, in the zebrafish spinal cord, glial cells have low levels of Notch activity when they are in the dormant state, and enter the cell cycle by increased Notch activity after the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, dormant RG of zebrafish telencephalon exhibit high Notch activity and become proliferative by a rapid decrease of Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapouton et al., 2010</xref>). Notch signaling has also been reported to regulate fate outputs of reactivated MG in the injured zebrafish retina, that is, Notch inhibition leads to gliogenesis, whereas Notch over-activation results in the production of photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish optic tectum, the higher sensory integration center, possesses a large population of RG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike other brain regions where RG present as both dormant and proliferative forms at physiological conditions, tectal RG has been reported to be dormant, and are reactivated by injury to give rise to newborn neurons via Wnt signaling as well as Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueda et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study showed that tectal RG produced a significant number of glial cells (~25%) but not neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lindsey et al., 2019</xref>). It is essential to resolve this inconsistency on the fate potentials of injury-reactivated tectal RG.</p><p>In this study, we set out to investigate the mechanism controlling injury responses of tectal RG in vivo. We found that stab injury drove a subset of tectal RG into the cell cycle. Surprisingly, proliferative tectal RG responding to the sequential injuries at the same injury site were distinct but overlapping. Quantitative analysis showed the probability of proliferative RG responding to both sequential stab injuries could be well explained by a model incorporating stochastic cell-cycle entry at the fixed probability of ~25%. Single-cell RNA-seq and functional analysis revealed this stochastic cell-cycle entry was dependent on Notch/Delta lateral inhibition. The clonal analysis showed that proliferative tectal RG underwent gliogenesis. Interestingly, post-injury notch inhibition drove reactive RG into the cell cycle and resulted in increased neurogenesis. Interestingly, the over-produced neurons mostly diminished by approximately 25 days post-injury (dpi).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stab injury induces the proliferation of dormant tectal RG</title><p>Consistent with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2012</xref>), our results showed that Tg(<italic>gfap</italic>:GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardos and Raymond, 2006</xref>), Tg(<italic>her4.1</italic>:dRFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeo et al., 2007</xref>), and the antibody against glutamine synthetase (GS) specifically labeled RG that line the tectal ventricle and extend their basal processes into the superficial neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B<sub>3</sub></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C<sub>2</sub></xref>).

It raised an immediate question as to whether the proliferation of a subset of RG was due to stochastic cell-cycle entry or the presence of distinct RG subpopulations that respond differentially to the stab injury. To test this, we designed a sequential stab injury experiment. We examined the responses of reactive tectal RG to two sequential stab injuries performed at the same physical site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). The first injury was introduced followed by BrdU pluses for six consecutive days to label proliferative RG responding to the first injury, and the second injury was introduced at 12 dpi followed by EdU pluses for six consecutive days to mark proliferative RG responding to the second injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>).

We found that although the number of proliferative RG induced by the first and the second injury showed no significant difference (the first injury: 84.4 ± 15.0 cells, n = 8; the second injury: 83 ± 9.4 cells, n = 8; mean ± SEM; p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>), two sets of proliferative RG were distinct with some degree of overlapping (23 ± 6, n = 8, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O–O<sub>5</sub></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). More importantly, the proportion of overlapping RG (those reactivated after both injuries) was statistically indistinguishable from the multiplication of the reactivation probabilities of either injury, which suggested that individual reactive RG entered the cell cycle in the stochastic manner (prediction: 7.1 ± 1.9%, n = 8; experiment: 6.8 ± 1.7%, n = 8; mean ± SEM; p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals cellular states representing RG reactivation and proliferation</title><p>To further examine the molecular mechanism underlying this stochastic cell-cycle entry of injury-reactivated RG, we carried out single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of tectal RG at 3 dpi, at which stage the number of proliferative tectal RG nearly reached the plateau in terms of cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Injury induces all RG underneath the injury site to become reactive. Only ~25% of reactive RG enter the cell cycle and become proliferative. The cell-cycle entry of reactive RG is regulated by Notch/Delta lateral inhibition. In the injury condition, proliferative RG largely undergo gliogenesis (~3–5% newborn neurons). The resulting newborn cells could survive up to 300 dpi. In the Notch inhibition condition, dormant RG can become proliferative but only generate ~1% of newborn neurons. However, Notch inhibition during 4–5 dpi drives reactive RG into the cell cycle, giving rise to significant more neurons (~12–20%).

The injury induces <italic>deltaA</italic> expression in some RG, leading to a decrease in Notch activity and subsequent cell-cycle entry. As a result of the lateral inhibition, an increased Notch activity keeps neighboring reactive RG in the non-proliferative state. 2. The injury directly blocks Notch activity in some RG that then enter the cell cycle, and leave neighboring cells non-proliferative. It is certainly essential to figure out which model is actually at work.</p><p>Can the optic tectum of adult zebrafish regenerate after the injury? Recent studies come to the contradictory answers. Ohshima’s lab showed that tectal RG were capable of producing some neurons after the stab injury (~25% of newborn cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>), whereas Kaslin’s lab reported the opposite result, in which tectal RG only produce glial cells but not neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lindsey et al., 2019</xref>). Using EdU pulse-and-stain assay and Cre-loxP-based clonal analysis of tectal RG, we unambiguously demonstrate at the single-cell resolution that RG give rise to newborn glial cells (~91% of total newborn cells) with only a few neurons (~3–5% of total newborn cells) after the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q</xref>), which is mostly consistent with the study of Kaslin’s lab. In fact, the average number of newborn neurons in the study from Ohshima’s lab (~4 BrdU<sup>+</sup>/HuC/D<sup>+</sup> neurons) was mostly similar to what we had (~4 EdU<sup>+</sup>/HuC/D<sup>+</sup> neurons), while the number of total newborn cells in their study (~17 BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) is much smaller than ours (~90 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells). Thus, the conclusion of a high proportion of newborn neurons from Ohshima’s lab is perhaps due to the underestimated number of total newborn cells. Our scRNA-seq data shows that <italic>hmgb2a</italic> and <italic>hmgb2b</italic> are highly expressed in RG of proliferative state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>). <italic>hmgb2</italic> is strongly associated with dormancy/activation transition of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2018</xref>), and loss of <italic>hmgb2</italic> compromises gliogenesis and promotes neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2013</xref>). In situ hybridization also confirm the expression of <italic>hmgb2a</italic> in the proliferating tectal RG as the result of stab injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L-M<sub>2</sub></xref>), suggesting proliferative tectal RG are likely to be gliogenic. Thus, unlike to RG of other CNS regions in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroehne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Than-Trong and Bally-Cuif, 2015</xref>), tectal RG resembles mammalian astrocytes in terms of injury response, undergoing the gliogenesis rather than the neurogenesis. Moreover, we also show that newborn glial cells can survive up to ~300 dpi and form a bulge structure of glial cells lining the tectal ventricle, while the wounds at the injury sites remain, which suggests that newborn glial cells are unable to migrate to the injury sites and the wounds are not restored. Notably, we observed the hypertrophic process of RG surrounding the injury sites forms a scar-like structure, which may block the restoration of the wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-B<sub>3</sub> and F-G<sub>3</sub></xref>).</p><p>What controls fate outputs of proliferative RG? Notch inhibition has been implicated in the production of neurons during embryonic development as well as in various injury contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). We thus investigated whether Notch inhibition at the proper timing after the injury can switch gliogenesis to neurogenesis. Indeed, we find that post-injury Notch inhibition during 4–5 dpi but not 1–3 dpi results in a significant increase in newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–G</xref>). Our further analysis shows that Notch inhibition (4–5 dpi) of injury-induced reactive RG labeled during 4–6 dpi results in a significant increase of neuron production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, L, M, O and P</xref>). No significant change of neuron production from injury-induced proliferative RG labeled during 1–3 dpi is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, J, K, O and P</xref>). <italic>Ueda et al.</italic> recently showed that Notch inhibition during 4–7 dpi decreases the number of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueda et al., 2018</xref>), which is in contrast to our findings. This inconsistency is likely to be because the time window of EdU or BrdU treatment is different. Ueda and colleagues treated the injured fish with BrdU during 2–3 dpi. Instead, we treated the injured fish with EdU during 4–6 dpi in this experiment. This means the RG analyzed from two studies are different. In Ueda’s study, BrdU treatment during 2–3 dpi is most likely to label proliferative RG as a result of the cell-cycle entry of dormant RG by stab injury, whereas EdU treatment during 4–6 dpi in our analysis is most likely to label proliferative RG as a result of the cell-cycle entry of injury-induced reactive RG by Notch inhibition instead. Our findings raised an interesting hypothesis, that is, cell states of tectal RG, such as dormant state, reactive state, or proliferative state, influence their fate outcomes in the context of Notch inhibition or injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q</xref>). Resolving the mechanistic link of cell state and fate potentials will undoubtedly deepen the understanding of the fate control of injury-reactivated RG. Besides, long-term experiments unexpectedly showed that over-produced neurons disappeared by 25 dpi. Earlier studies also showed that manipulation of Notch signaling could drive more RG into the cell cycle in the injury context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). However, none of them investigated the long-term survival of those newborn cells. Our observation of rapid loss of newborn cells might be due to their intrinsic property of short life or due to the lack of significant neuron loss in stab injured optic tectum. The underlying mechanisms that control the death of over-produced neurons are also appealing to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. If at some later stage you feel you can make these revisions, we would be open to receiving a new manuscript that addresses all of the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p>Specifically, the following revisions are required and described in further detail in the full reviews below:</p><p>• This paper needs to be rewritten.</p><p>• New Introduction should be provided with more focus on fish data.</p><p>• The Results section, figures and figure legends need to be reorganized and, in some case, extended.</p><p>• Stab wound Injuries need to be done at different geographical regions of the optic tectum.</p><p>• The capacity of the optic tectum to regenerate or not need to be investigated and discussed.</p><p>• They need to show to which structure or tissue the newly generated RG cells or neurons (late treatment of notch) are giving rise.</p><p>Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months.

They show that upon stab wound injury RG cells of the periventricular gray zone (PGZ), which are otherwise quiescent, enter the cell-cycle in a stochastic manner. Fate map studies demonstrate that the majority of activated tectal RG cells will undergo gliosis instead of neurogenesis. Using single-cell RNA-seq, the authors identified 4 distinct RG cell states: quiescent, activated, and 2 sub-proliferative phases. Their data suggest that downregulation of notch target genes, such as <italic>her4.1</italic>, controls the transition from the reactive to the proliferative state of the RG cells. Furthermore, gain-of-function (heat-shock induced activation) and loss-of-function (pharmacological inhibition) experiments targeting notch signaling confirmed the role of this pathway in controlling the cell cycle state of RG cells and their cell fate. Pharmacological inhibition of the notch pathway early post-injury leads to gliosis while late notch suppression (after 3 days post injury) leads to neurogenesis.</p><p>In principle, this is an interesting topic in a very important field of research.</p><p>However, in my opinion, the majority of the conclusions drawn from the presented work are not novel.</p><p>For example, the activation of RG cells upon injury and the role of notch in RG cell state and fate have been largely addressed in several earlier papers from the labs of Toshio Ohshima and Laure Bally-Cuif. I particularly invite the authors to refer to the publication by Ueda et al. from 2018, which deals with the role of notch signaling in regenerative neurogenesis in the adult zebrafish optic tectum (please cite this paper in your next submission).</p><p>Figures and figure legends are not well organized, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow and understand them, for example:</p><p>- Figure 1A consists of 4 panels which are not labelled (the same is true for other figures).</p><p>- There are 2 panels labelled 1B but no panel 1C.</p><p>- In Figure 1G: where is the cell count for RG cells?</p><p>- The figure legend of Figure 1 and in general all other figure legends in this work are very poor and cryptic. The authors need to better describe the figures. The reader needs to be guided through the results and the figures and should not have to guess what the authors want to show.</p><p>In Figure 2, at 5 dpi apparently there is an increase in GFP expression and a lot of proliferation close to the site of injury.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there remain some concerns about the grammar, use of arrows in figures, interpretation and novelty, plus one suggested experiment that needs repeating. I ask you to address these concerns in a revised version of the manuscript and refer you to the reviews below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) This version of the manuscript is much improved and more readable; however, there are still many grammatical errors throughout (e.g. &quot;low vertebrates&quot;) that should be addressed prior to publication. There are many professional editing services available.</p><p>2) I still do not see the mosaic pattern of expression of the mitotic cells after injury. For example, Figure 4F2 shows a large cluster of PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells. Same for Figure 2D. If only about 25% of the cells in an area re-enter the cell cycle, random chance would predict that sometimes they are adjacent and sometimes they are not. This is not the definition of a mosaic. A mosaic has a regular, alternating pattern. If the authors were to make a flatmount of the tectum and image in the plane orthogonal to their sectioning at the ventricular surface they could show regular spacing if this exists, but the data are presented in a way where it is not possible to determine rigorously whether there is a regular mosaic or just randomly distributed cells that enter the cell cycle within a population. I am not sure it really matters to their argument in any case, but it is a good idea to use these terms with precision. If they cannot show this more directly, they should just delete the terms like &quot;mosaic&quot; or &quot;salt and pepper&quot; from the manuscript.</p><p>3) In the previous version the authors used an excessive number of arrows on some of the figures to the extent that this obscured the image (e.g. Figure 5L and 5M. They have addressed this issue by making these arrows open instead of white, but not reduced their numbers. This does not help much, and they should remove most of these from the panels. If they did so, it would be apparent that in the example section they show in Figure 5L1, the number of PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells in the TS increases in the NICD over-expression. This raises the issue as to how the TS and PGZ are defined. The DAPI does not seem to help resolve this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper is a new submission of a previous manuscript entitled &quot;Notch-dependent stochastic cell-cycle entry of injury-reactivated tectal radial glia&quot;.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors investigate the cellular and molecular response to optic tectum injury in adult zebrafish. They show that upon stab injury radial glial cells (RGCs), which are otherwise quiescent, become highly proliferative. They found that injury activated RGCs enter the cell cycle in a mosaic manner which is dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. Their data also suggest that in contrast to the zebrafish adult telencephalon, where activated RGCs will form new neurons, in the optic tectum the majority of the proliferative RGCs will give rise to new RGCs by gliogenesis.</p><p>In my opinion, in this new version the authors greatly improved the presentation, description and also the scientific content of their results. I am mostly happy with the data shown in this paper, although there are still several discrepancies between the findings reported in this work and the data and conclusions from Ueda et al., 2018. For example, the authors show here that post-injury inhibition of Notch results in an important increase in neurogenesis, while Ueda et al. observed a reduction. This difference is explained by a difference in the time window of Notch inhibition, which is not a very convincing explanation in my opinion. I would suggest to repeat the Notch inhibition using both time windows (i.e. those described in this paper and Ueda et al.)</p><p>My biggest concern is about the novelty of the findings of this manuscript, I am not really sure that the role of Notch described in this paper is really new and of highest priority to be published in a journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript quality is improved but the scientific content and message of this work are still not of highest importance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I continue to feel that this a well-executed and documented study. The other reviewers raised questions about novelty and mechanistic depth, which I do acknowledge as legitimate concerns. However, as somewhat of an outsider to this field, I think this manuscript has considerable useful information, particularly with respect to the gene expression analysis performed by single cell RNA-seq.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48660.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following revisions are required and described in further detail in the full reviews below:</p><p>• This paper needs to be rewritten.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment.

The stab wounds could not be well restored.

Shimizu et al., 2018 and Ueda et al., 2018 showed RG generated some neurons in the injured optic tectum. The average number of newborn neurons in their study (~ 5 BrdU<sup>+</sup>/HuC/D<sup>+</sup> neurons) was largely similar to what we had (~ 4 EdU<sup>+</sup>/HuC/D<sup>+</sup> neurons), while the number of total newborn cells in their study (~ 15 BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) is much smaller than ours (~ 90 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells).

This is consistent with the findings reported by Galant et al.(Galant et al., 2016). The result indicated that cells in the TPZ were different from injury-reactivated RG in term of fate potentials. In the TPZ, progenitor cells continuously generate many newborn cells (many neurons and a few RG) to keep the growth of optic tectum, whereas RG only respond to injury and largely generate glial cells and few neurons.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Neurogenic potential of progenitor cells in TPZ of adult zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental time courses of long-term tracing of RG in TPZ (panel B-D3).
