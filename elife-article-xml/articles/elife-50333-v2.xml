transgenic AD mouse models manifest hyperexcitability. This aberrant electrical activity is caused by synaptic dysfunction that represents the major pathophysiological correlate of cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism for this excessive excitability remains incompletely understood. To investigate the basis for the hyperactivity, we performed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence studies on hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids bearing AD-related mutations in presenilin-1 or amyloid precursor protein vs. isogenic gene corrected controls. In the AD hiPSC-derived neurons/organoids, we found increased excitatory bursting activity, which could be explained in part by a decrease in neurite length. AD hiPSC-derived neurons also displayed increased sodium current density and increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory synaptic activity. Our findings establish hiPSC-derived AD neuronal cultures and organoids as a relevant model of early AD pathophysiology and provide mechanistic insight into the observed hyperexcitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>hyperexcitability</kwd><kwd>hiPSC derived neuronal cultures</kwd><kwd>cerebral organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HD29587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core grant P30 NS076411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 DA041722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS086890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG056259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG057409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased excitation and decreased inhibition associated with abnormal neuronal morphology, aberrant ion channel properties, and synaptic dysfunction contribute to hyperexcitability in Alzheimer’s disease hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Emerging evidence suggests that patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifest an increased incidence of neuronal hyperactivity, leading to non-convulsive epileptic discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vossel et al., 2013</xref>). These patients also display a faster rate of cognitive decline consistent with the notion that the aberrant activity is associated with disease progression. Moreover, both sporadic (S) and familial (F) AD patients show neuronal hyperactivity, with onset during the initial stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palop and Mucke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>). Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin (PSEN or PS) genes 1/2, which increase amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, cause dominantly inherited forms of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woodruff et al., 2013</xref>). These patients show increased activation in the right anterior hippocampus by functional MRI early in the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quiroz et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, both humans with AD and AD transgenic models, including hAPP-J20 and APP/PS1 mice, manifest non-convulsive seizure activity/spike-wave discharges on electroencephalograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nygaard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verret et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vossel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While AD transgenic animal models have been used extensively to study the mechanisms of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>) the electrophysiological basis of the observed hyperexcitability still remains incompletely understood. The recent advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons affords the unique opportunity for monitoring pathological electrical activity and underlying mechanisms in a ‘human context,’ and on a patient-specific genetic background. For example, recent studies have shown increased calcium transients in a cerebral organotypic hiPSC-derived culture system bearing FAD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2018</xref>). However, there remains a lack of electrophysiological characterization of disease phenotypes in neurons derived from hiPSCs carrying FAD mutations. It should be acknowledged that abnormal circuits related to aberrant electrical activity in AD brains might not be completely replicated in reductionist hiPSC-based preparations even though our 2D cultures contain both excitatory cerebrocortical neurons and inhibitory interneurons, and our 3D cerebral organoids show clear cortical layer formation. Importantly, however, abnormal neuronal morphology, disrupted ion channel properties, and synaptic dysfunction underlying aberrant electrical activity are all retained in these hiPSC-derived preparations compared to more intact systems, and are therefore studied in some detail here. In fact, evidence from both human AD brain and transgenic AD mouse models suggests that changes in channel properties and neurite length similar to that observed here may indeed be involved in the altered electrical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we examine the electrophysiological properties of cerebrocortical cultures derived from three separate AD-like hiPSC lines bearing PS1 or hAPP mutations (vs. their gene-corrected isogenic wild-type (WT) controls): (i) PS1 ΔE9, a point mutation in the splice acceptor consensus sequence of intron eight that impairs γ-secretase-dependent functions of PS1; (ii) PS1<sup>M146V</sup>, a mutation in transmembrane domain 2 of PS1 that occurs frequently in FAD patients; (iii) APP<sup>swe</sup>, double missense mutation in the APP gene leading to increased Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paquet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woodruff et al., 2013</xref>). We find abnormal electrical activity in both AD hiPSC-derived 2D cultures and 3D cerebral organoids compared to their respective isogenic controls. Moreover, our work provides mechanistic insight into atypical neuronal morphology, altered ion channel physiology, and disrupted synaptic function underlying the aberrant electrical activity observed in these AD hiPSC-derived cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AD hiPSC-derived neurons show enhanced excitability compared to isogenic WT neurons</title><p>Initially, we studied 2D cultures of AD hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons (‘AD neurons’) with one allele bearing the PS1 ΔE9 mutation (ΔE9/WT), PS1<sup>M146V</sup> mutation (M146V/WT), or APP<sup>swe</sup> mutation (APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT) vs. isogenic WT/WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This finding supports the notion that a more rapid recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in AD neurons would increase channel availability after the spike, thus reducing the refractory period and facilitating more rapid repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter and Bean, 2011</xref>). Potentially underlying these effects, previous studies found that Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers or APP result in an increase in surface expression of sodium channel Nav1.6 in AD models, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciccone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

Moreover, the AD neurons continued to demonstrate a dramatic increase in sodium current density and evoked action potential frequency compared to WT as they matured in culture, consistent with the notion that these events, reflecting increased electrical excitability, represent a true difference between the PS1 mutant AD and WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Developmental timeline of AD neurons compared to isogenic control neurons.</title><p>WT/WT hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neuron data in black, M146V/WT and APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT AD neurons in red.

Notably, similar to our observations, previous studies in vivo on APP/PS1 transgenic mice have shown at early stages of AD that neurite loss occurs without change in spine density in surviving dendritic branches compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, neurite loss and increased excitability occur early in the disease process, prior to the significant neuronal and synaptic loss that occurs subsequently in human AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeKosky and Scheff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Terry et al., 1991</xref>), and appear to be faithfully reproduced in our AD hiPSC models.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Increased excitatory synaptic transmission in AD neurons also contributes to hyperexcitability</title><p>Concerning synaptic function, although AD neurons compared to isogenic WT controls showed similar synaptic density by 5 weeks in culture, we observed an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in the AD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Based on prior in vivo work on AD transgenic mice with similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>), this increase in sEPSCs could result from improved synaptic efficacy associated with shorter neurites. Additionally, we found an increase in the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in AD neurons compared to gene-corrected isogenic WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,H</xref>). There was also a statistically significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs in ΔE9/WT neurons vs. isogenic WT/WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), but only a trend in M146V/WT and APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT neurons that did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). An increase in mEPSC frequency may reflect an increase in synapse number or a presynaptic mechanism, such as an increase in release probability. Along these lines, we found an increase in the level of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1) in AD cultures compared to WT by immunocytochemistry and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Since we had found no significant differences between AD and WT neurons with regard to synaptic density at this stage of the disease process, it is therefore likely that presynaptic release was affected in AD. Consistent with this explanation, prior work in rodent hippocampal neurons had shown that Aβ peptide enhances release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramov et al., 2009</xref>). To test this possibility more directly, we applied hypertonic sucrose solution to measure the readily releasable pool (RRP) size and found a decrease in RRP, which can be attributed to increased basal release of vesicles from AD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>AD neurons show disrupted excitatory synaptic transmission compared to isogenic control neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded at −70 mV from WT/WT, M146V/WT and APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons in culture for 5 weeks.

First, AD hiPSCs allow us to study aspects of the electrical properties of AD neurons in a human context in both 2D cultures and 3D cerebral organoids and compare them to known in vivo phenotypic studies in AD transgenic mouse models and in human AD brain. Indeed, we found that hiPSC-derived neurons in 2D culture differentiated for ≥5 weeks displayed stable phenotypes that resemble several aspects of the electrophysiological abnormalities, including hyperexcitability, previously observed in vivo in human AD brain and transgenic mouse models. Moreover, after &gt;2 months of maturation, cerebral organoids showed clear layer formation, allowing us to examine early neural network aspects of the disease in cells that bear familial AD-causing mutations. Second, given that similar electrical events are observed in the hiPSC system as in in vivo models, this reductionist approach allows us to begin to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) for the aberrant electrical activity in AD brains.</p><p>Since familial AD generally does not manifest symptoms until 40–50 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwart et al., 2019</xref>), it is somewhat surprising that our hiPSC-based models display electrophysiological features of the disease phenotype. This is especially perplexing because hiPSCs are reprogrammed to an earlier epigenetic state and hence would lack age-related changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mertens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the intact human brain there are homeostatic mechanisms that may play a role in delaying the onset of the disease, and these ‘brakes’ on the system are not present in our simplified culture systems. While no AD animal model or culture system can recapitulate factors contributing to human aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">LaFerla and Green, 2012</xref>), genetic factors contributing to AD, as studied here, may be reproduced in a hiPSC model. For example, our study and others have shown that hiPSC-derived neurons with early onset AD mutations manifest greater Aβ secretion and deposition early on in their development in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paquet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woodruff et al., 2013</xref>). These early changes indicate that early stages of AD pathophysiology do indeed occur in these in vitro systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Penney et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, 3D cerebral organoids derived from these hiPSCs display accumulation of Aβ over several months and can be maintained for over a year, which is still far from the timescale of human brain aging, but comparable to many AD animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, although hiPSC models of AD are far from perfect, they are reproducible, allow for rigorous investigation of underlying mechanisms for specific phenotypes found in human AD brains such as hyperexcitability, and thus afford the opportunity of elucidating novel insight into early stages of human AD pathophysiology.</p><p>In particular, we were interested in studying excitability/firing properties and synaptic dysfunction that might precede and predispose the synaptic loss that represents the hallmark of advanced stages of symptomatic AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeKosky and Scheff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Terry et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, our findings potentially yield insight into the origin of the observed hyperexcitable phenotype that occurs in human AD patient brains and AD transgenic mouse models as well as in our hiPSC model systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Aberrant activity in AD neurons associated with morphological changes and ion channel dysfunction</title><p>Hyperexcitability and ion channel dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD in prior studies in a variety of animal and cell-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Talantova et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying this hyperexcitability and its effect on network signaling has not been fully elucidated. While inhibitory neuron dysfunction may be essential for aberrant excitability in AD brain (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verret et al., 2012</xref>), we also found a contribution of aberrant excitatory neuronal activity in our AD hiPSC-derived neurons, as suggested previously in AD transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, comparing AD hiPSCs and isogenic WT controls, we found that AD neurons exhibited a decrease in neurite length. As shown previously in APP/PS1 AD transgenic mice, such loss of dendrites can contribute to abnormal postsynaptic integration of currents, leading to abnormal hypersynchronous network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>). Our results showing hyperactivity in AD hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids coupled with decreased neurite length are in close agreement with prior results in the AD transgenic mouse model, and thus validate our in vitro human model with in vivo findings.</p><p>Additionally, we found an increase in sodium current density and altered kinetics that may contribute to the increase in excitability observed in human AD brains, for example as recorded on EEG. While previous reports had shown a decrease in sodium current density in AD neurons in cell-based and transgenic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>), this decrease was observed in PV-positive inhibitory interneurons, rather than in excitatory neurons as found here. However, in support of our findings, enhanced Nav1.6 sodium channel expression was recently demonstrated in APP/PS1 bigenic AD mice, suggesting that Aβ may be responsible for the resulting increase in voltage-gated sodium current in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Accelerated maturation in PS1 mutant AD hiPSC-derived neurons compared to isogenic WT controls</title><p>Interestingly, we also observed developmental differences between PS1 (but not hAPP) mutant AD neurons and isogenic WT controls. For example, PS1 mutant AD hiPSC-derived neurons manifested action potentials and larger neuronal size at 2 weeks of culture. Based on prior evidence, the accelerated maturation of PS1 mutant neurons may occur because of decreased γ-secretase activity, leading to reduced Notch signaling, which would otherwise inhibit differentiation of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, APP mutant AD neurons, which display normal γ-secretase activity, did not exhibit more rapid maturation compared to isogenic WT controls. Moreover, by week four in culture, WT neurons had caught up with the PS1 mutant neurons with regard to the various neuronal parameters. Indeed, both PS1 and APP mutant AD neurons showed a decrease in cell capacitance at the later timepoints, reflecting neuritic/dendritic loss compared to WT. Nonetheless, both PS1 and mutant APP AD neurons maintained their hyperactivity throughout the culture period (≥7 weeks), suggesting that hyperactivity represents a true pathophysiological phenotype that begins to manifest early in the disease process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Synaptic dysfunction contributes to aberrant activity in AD neurons</title><p>In our AD neurons we also observed an increase in sEPSCs, which may represent more effective integration of synaptic inputs. This synaptic facilitation may arise in part from the observed decrease in neurite length and branching in the AD neurons. In a similar fashion, in an AD transgenic mouse model, Stefan Remy’s group has shown that dendritic degeneration resulted in enhanced synaptic efficacy and increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Šišková et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We also observed an increase in the frequency of mEPSCs in electrophysiological recordings and in VGLUT1 levels histologically in the AD hiPSC-derived excitatory neurons, consistent with the notion of increased presynaptic release probability. In accord with these findings, previous reports have shown that Aβ peptide increases release probability at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the increased levels of VGLUT1 found in our study are similar to those shown in human AD brain tissue and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sokolow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Timmer et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that both morphological changes in neurites and increased release probability may contribute to excitatory synaptic hyperactivity.</p><p>In addition to an increase in excitatory neurotransmission, we found a decrease in inhibitory activity, as reflected by decrements in sIPSC and mIPSC frequency in the AD neuronal cultures compared to WT. This could be in part due to a decrease in the number of GABAergic neurons and thus inhibitory endings. In fact, we found a decrease in VGAT levels, as observed previously in AD transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuhrer et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, prior reports have implicated a decrease in PV interneuron activity because of decreased sodium channel expression in AD transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>). In agreement with our finding of decreased inhibitory neuronal numbers in AD hiPSC-derived cultures, a decrease in the interneuron population has also been suggested as a contributory factor to neuronal hyperactivity based on AD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also observed that AD hiPSC-derived neuronal hyperactivity could be significantly ameliorated by γ-secretase or BACE1 inhibitors, suggesting that aberrant APP processing contributes to the observed pathophysiology. Along these lines, multiple pathological species formed from abnormal APP processing have been reported, including, for example, Aβ oligomers, APP intracellular domain (AICD), and the β-secretase-derived fragment, C99 (β-CTF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwart et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies including our own have suggested that Aβ dimers or oligomers may contribute to hyperexcitability in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Talantova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Selkoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zott et al., 2019</xref>). Our new findings yield mechanistic insight into these observations.</p><p>In conclusion, mechanisms affecting both excitatory and inhibitory neurons can contribute to the observed hyperactivity in AD neuronal networks. Here we have used AD hiPSC-derived neurons to show how dysfunction emanating from degenerating neurite morphology, ion current density, firing properties, and altered synaptic transmission can contribute to the aberrant hyperactivity of AD neuronal networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagents or<break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>Matrigel</td><td>Corning</td><td>Cat # 354230</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>mTeSR 1</td><td>STEMCELL <break/>Technologies</td><td>Cat # 85850</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>Dorsomorphin</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat # 3093</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>A83-01</td><td>Stemgent</td><td>Cat # 04–0014</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>PNU74654</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat # 3534</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>DMEM/F12</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 10565018</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>N2</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 17502048</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>B27</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 17504044</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>FGF</td><td>R and D</td><td>Cat # 4114-TC</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>p-ornithine</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat # 27378490</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>laminin</td><td>Trevigen</td><td>Cat # 340001001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td>Knockout Serum Replacement</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 10828028</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td valign="top">β-Mercaptoethanol</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 21985023</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td valign="top">BDNF</td><td>Peprotech</td><td>Cat # AF-450–02</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td valign="top">GDNF</td><td>Peprotech</td><td>Cat # AF-450–10</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell culture</td><td valign="top">ES-FBS</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 16141079</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Organoid culture</td><td valign="top">Cerebral Organoid Kit</td><td>STEMCELL Technologies</td><td>Cat # 08570</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Critical commercial <break/>assay</td><td valign="top">V-PLEX Plus Aβ <break/>Peptide Panel <break/>1 (6E10) Kit</td><td>Meso Scale <break/>Discovery</td><td>Cat # K15200</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">K-Gluconate</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat # P1847</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">Cs-Gluconate</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat # HB4822</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">KCl</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # 60128</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">CsCl</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # C4036</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">MgCl<sub>2</sub></td><td>Fluka</td><td>Cat # 63020</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">HEPES</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # H4034</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">EGTA</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # 3889</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">Mg-ATP</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # A9187</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">HBSS</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat # 14175079</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">CaCl<sub>2</sub></td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # C5080</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">Glycine</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # G2879</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">Tetrodotoxin <break/>citrate</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat # HB 1035</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">β-Secretase <break/>Inhibitor IV</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>Cat # 565788</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Electrophysiology</td><td valign="top">Compound E</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>Cat # 565790</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Immunocytochemistry (ICC)</td><td valign="top">PFA</td><td>Alfa Aesar</td><td>Cat # 43368</td><td/></tr><tr><td>ICC</td><td valign="top">BSA</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # A0336</td><td/></tr><tr><td>ICC</td><td valign="top">Triton X-100</td><td>Millipore <break/>Sigma</td><td>Cat # T8532</td><td/></tr><tr><td>ICC antibody</td><td valign="top">DAPI</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat # D1306;

These organoids were then transferred to maturation media for development of cortical-like layers and other more mature phenotypes. All plates used were low-attachment plates, as recommended by the manufacturer (StemCell Technologies). The age of the organoids was determined from the start of the maturation step of the protocol, that is the day they were placed in maturation medium. By 8 weeks of age, we observed the formation of cortical-like layers. Organoids were maintained on an orbital shaker until used in experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>After 6 weeks of terminal differentiation, the level of human Aβ peptides 1–38, 1–40 and 1–42 were measured in the culture medium of AD hiPSC-derived neurons by ELISA (V-PLEX Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit, Meso Scale Discovery). Culture medium was collected for one week after the prior media change and processed as recommended by the manufacturer. The ELISA plate was read in a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 reader (Meso Scale Discovery). Additionally, we determined the level of Aβ peptides secreted by 1–2 month-old cerebral organoids; for this purpose, culture medium was collected 3 days after the prior medium change and processed as above. All samples were taken from age-matched organoids and measured in duplicate for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology and pharmacology</title><p>Whole-cell recordings with a patch electrode were performed using 3- to 5 MΩ resistance pipettes filled with an internal solution composed of (in mM): K-gluconate, 120; KCl, 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; HEPES, 10; EGTA; 10; Mg-ATP, 4; pH 7.4 and mOsm 290. The external solution was composed of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD) to which we added CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM; HEPES, 10 mM; glycine, 20 μM; pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (G150F-3; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) using a micropipette puller (P97; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) at a data sampling rate of 10 kHz with a Digidata 1440A analog-to-digital convertor (Molecular Devices). Voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols were applied using Clampex v10.6 (Molecular Devices).</p><p>Preliminary analysis and offline filtering at 500 Hz were achieved using Clampfit v10.6 (Molecular Devices). Spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) were recorded in gap-free mode at a holding potential of −70 mV and 0 mV. The internal solution comprised of (in mM): K-gluconate, 120; KCl, 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; HEPES, 10; EGTA; 10; Mg-ATP, 4; pH 7.4 and mOsm 290. Under these conditions at 21 °C, the chloride ion reversal potential was approximately −70 mV; hence, synaptic currents recorded at −70 mV represented excitatory responses. Since the cation reversal potential was approximately 0 mV, synaptic currents recorded at 0 mV were predominantly inhibitory in nature. To assess the effect of γ-secretase and BACE1 inhibitors, we performed recordings of spontaneous action potentials, voltage gated sodium channel currents, and sEPSCs with the aforementioned external and internal solutions after incubating hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures for 2 days in the γ-secretase inhibitor compound E (EMD Millipore) or 4 days in BACE inhibitor IV (EMD Millipore), respectively, each at 1 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwart et al., 2019</xref>). Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded at −70 mV and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded at 0 mV at 21 °C after equilibrium in tetrodotoxin (TTX) for at least 20 min. Internal solution used for recording mEPSCs and mIPSCs comprised of (in mM): Cs-gluconate 130; CsCl 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; HEPES, 10; EGTA; 1; Mg-ATP, 4; pH 7.4 and mOsm 290. The external solution used was the same as that listed above with the addition of 1 µM TTX. To calculate the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic events, Mini Analysis software (Synapstosoft, Fort Lee, NJ) was used.</p><p>To determine the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, we used a hypertonic sucrose solution containing 500 mM sucrose and 1 µM TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho and Askwith, 2008</xref>). The internal solution used for the RRP experiments was same as that used for recording miniature postsynaptic currents. Sucrose evoked responses were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV. For estimating the size of the RRP, total charge transferred during the transient phase of the sucrose-mediated response was quantified by calculating the area under the curve.</p><p>For measurements of the slope of action potential decay, we quantified the first evoked action potential elicited by a series of current-clamp steps. To measure sodium current rise time and decay time constants, 10–90% of the slope of the first sodium current trace elicited by a voltage-clamp step protocol was used for analysis. All quantifications were performed using Clampfit v10.6 (Molecular devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunocytochemistry of 2D neuronal cultures</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody overnight, and the appropriate Alexa Fluor (488, 555, 647) conjugated secondary antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: Tuj1 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), FOXG1 (1:250; Abcam), Synapsin 1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany), Homer (1:200; Synaptic Systems), VGAT (1:200, Synaptic Systems), VGLUT1 (1:500, EMD Millipore), GABA (1:100, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), Parvalbumin (1:100, EMD Millipore). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (1:500; Invitrogen).</p><p>Images were collected by laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy (Nikon A1) by an observer blinded to experimental group. The area covered by Tuj1 immunostaining (imaged using a 20X objective) was analyzed with ImageJ 1.52 p. Somal area was determined manually by marking the Tuj1-positive area around DAPI-stained nuclei using the freehand selection tool in ImageJ. Neurite area was determined by subtracting the somal area from the total Tuj1-immunostained area. For synapse quantification, colocalized presynaptic (Synapsin 1) and postsynaptic (Homer) puncta within Tuj1-expressing neuronal cells (imaged using a 60X objective) were counted using ImageJ. The number of synaptic puncta were scored per µm of neurite length. For VGLUT1 and VGAT immunofluorescence images (also collected using a 60X objective), total VGLUT1 and VGAT intensity was quantified using ImageJ and normalized to total Tuj1 intensity. All analyses were performed by an observer masked to experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunocytochemistry of cerebral organoids</title><p>After 2 months of development, cerebral organoids were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight followed by serial incubation in 15% and 30% sucrose in PBS overnight. Fixed organoids were then placed in a cryomold and embedded in tissue freezing medium (General Data, Cincinnati, OH). Thereafter, they were flash frozen with isopentane and liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Frozen organoids were mounted on sample stubs of a cryostat using optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and then sectioned at 20 µm thickness. The sections were collected on glass slides and stained with antibodies to CTIP2 (1:200; Abcam), Tbr2 (1:300; Abcam), Nestin (1:200; Abcam), Tuj1 (1:200; Abcam), VGAT (1:200, Synaptic Systems), VGLUT1 (1:500, EMD Millipore), or Aβ peptide (1:2000; Biolegend).

An observer masked to the experimental group traced the neurites for subsequent quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoblots</title><p>Western blots were performed to assess and quantify VGLUT1 and VGAT levels. For this purpose, 4–5 week-old neuronal cultures were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer to which Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail was added (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysates diluted in SDS sample buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol were separated on blot 4–12% Bis Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore). Primary antibodies used included anti-VGAT antibody (1:500 dilution, Synaptic Systems) and anti-VGLUT1 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Synaptic Systems). Secondary antibodies were purchased from LI-COR Biosciences. Labeled proteins were detected using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometry of protein band was analyzed with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Golgi staining</title><p>Golgi staining was performed using a sliceGolgi Kit (Cat#003760, Bioenno Tech, LLC). Organoids were fixed in the aldehyde fixative provided by the manufacturer overnight at 4 °C. The organoids were then embedded in 4% low melting agarose in high sucrose cutting solution and left to solidify. The organoids were sectioned at 200 µm thickness using a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica Biosystems). The sections were collected in 6-well plates and immersed in impregnation solution for 7 days. The sections were further processed as recommended by the manufacturer. After mounting with permount (Fisher Chemicals), the sections were imaged in bright-field mode. Neurons were then traced using ImageJ and analyzed for neurite length by an observer masked to experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MEA recordings</title><p>For MEA recordings, 6-week-old cerebral organoids were plated on CytoView 12-well plates (Axion Biosystems) coated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine (PEI) and laminin (10 µg/ml).

The authors further explored the underlying mechanisms, some or all of which may contribute to hyperexcitability in AD neurons. These include decreased neurite length, increased sodium current density, and excitatory and inhibitory network imbalances at both synaptic and neuronal levels.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lisa M Ellerby (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors generate 2D and 3D organoid cultures of IPSC-derived neurons harboring APP and PS1 familial AD mutations for electrophysiological studies. Compared with isogenic control neuron, the AD neurons showed hyperexcitability, and the authors showed evidence for cellular mechanisms underlying these excitability changes including decreased neurite length, increased sodium current density current density and excitatory and inhibitory network imbalances at synaptic and neuronal levels. Major strengths of the manuscript include the use of multiple human AD iPSC neurons with different familial AD mutation as well as previously validated isogenic control neurons, the use of organoid models to confirm the hyperexcitability of AD neurons in a brain-like environment, and the careful electrophysiological analyses. However, all three reviewers felt the study required mechanistic testing of the link between the hyperexcitability and dysregulation of APP processing by determining the effects of treating the cultures with BACE and/or γ-secretase inhibitors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to discuss caveats of using iPSC-derived, developing neurons as a model to study a degenerative disorder of aging brains.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear in the literature that iPSC-derived neuron cultures and cerebral organoids represent very early stages of fetal brain development. Hence the degree that phenotypes reported in these neurons represent mechanisms relevant to the pathophysiology of diseases of brain aging are unclear. Specifically, whether the hyperactivity measured in the cultures in this study are caused by similar pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to hyperexcitability in aged AD brains is unknown and, at the current time, unknowable. Despite this caveat, the reviewers all agree that iPSC-derived neuron studies like the one in this manuscript are still significant and will be of broad interest to the AD field because this is one major new approach to discovering cellular consequences of AD-associated genetic mutations. However, the authors must discuss the impact of using this reductionist experimental system on the strength of their conclusions for AD in much greater detail in the manuscript. Specifically, they should more directly address the alternative that there are developmental explanations for the hyperexcitability data shown here that could be different from the causes of hyperexcitability in the degenerating AD brain. As one reviewer stated, &quot;Although it is interesting that familial AD mutations in two different AD genes, APP and PS1, commonly induce the hyperexcitability in human embryonic neurons it is not clear if the embryonic hyperexcitability will trigger AD pathogenies after 40-60 years. There is no report that FAD patients harboring these mutations develop seizures or other hyperexcitability symptoms at the very early ages (like 1-2 years).&quot;.</p><p>– This issue should be directly addressed in the Discussion section to help the readers understand the caveats as well as the power of the iPSC approach.</p><p>– The authors should also be careful with their statement of conclusions (abstracting from embryonic neurons to aged brains) throughout the manuscript with this concern in mind.</p><p>2) Further validation data must be presented in this manuscript to demonstrate that the cells used in the study are what they are described to be.</p><p>– The authors must provide validation of mutations and their correction in the isogenic control lines even though they are using previously published lines.

Hence the degree that phenotypes reported in these neurons represent mechanisms relevant to the pathophysiology of diseases of brain aging are unclear. Specifically, whether the hyperactivity measured in the cultures in this study are caused by similar pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to hyperexcitability in aged AD brains is unknown and, at the current time, unknowable. Despite this caveat, the reviewers all agree that iPSC-derived neuron studies like the one in this manuscript are still significant and will be of broad interest to the AD field because this is one major new approach to discovering cellular consequences of AD-associated genetic mutations. However, the authors must discuss the impact of using this reductionist experimental system on the strength of their conclusions for AD in much greater detail in the manuscript. Specifically, they should more directly address the alternative that there are developmental explanations for the hyperexcitability data shown here that could be different from the causes of hyperexcitability in the degenerating AD brain. As one reviewer stated, &quot;Although it is interesting that familial AD mutations in two different AD genes, APP and PS1, commonly induce the hyperexcitability in human embryonic neurons it is not clear if the embryonic hyperexcitability will trigger AD pathogenies after 40-60 years. There is no report that FAD patients harboring these mutations develop seizures or other hyperexcitability symptoms at the very early ages (like 1-2 years).&quot;.</p><p>– This issue should be directly addressed in the Discussion section to help the readers understand the caveats as well as the power of the iPSC approach.</p><p>– The authors should also be careful with their statement of conclusions (abstracting from embryonic neurons to aged brains) throughout the manuscript with this concern in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestion. We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion section to address the caveats of using iPSC-derived neurons to study degenerative disorders of aging brains and have also highlighted how it can be useful for studying certain aspects of the disease (Discussion paragraph two). For example, the fact that the hyperexcitability of the AD hiPSC-derived neurons is similar to that seen in adult human AD brains, as cited in the manuscript does suggest that this feature of the pathology can be studied under our conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further validation data must be presented in this manuscript to demonstrate that the cells used in the study are what they are described to be.</p><p>– The authors must provide validation of mutations and their correction in the isogenic control lines even though they are using previously published lines. It is imperative to know that the authors validated in their own hands the key genetic mutations in the cells they were actually using.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we have validated the genetic mutations in the neural progenitor cells we are using by genome sequencing. We show these results in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Further, one reviewer questioned why AD neurons with APP Swedish mutation showed a dramatic increase in Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio.

We now have used a similar ELISA kit as that employed by the authors of Kwart et al., 2019. In agreement with those authors, we find that total Aβ (Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub> and Aβ<sub>38</sub>) is increased in the APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT lines, while the ratio does not change significantly. We show these new results in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E.</p><p>The results we had reported in the original version of the manuscript may have been different because we used two different kits to analyze Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub>. The kit for detecting Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels was an ultrasensitive ELISA kit while that for detecting Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels was an ELISA kit of normal sensitivity. This could have resulted in underestimation of the differences in Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels in the various samples. In the Meso Scale Discovery kit used in the revised version of the manuscript, the samples were loaded in a well that has four separate spots for detecting Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub> and Aβ<sub>38</sub> levels. This decreases handling errors and also kit-to-kit variability. Additionally, we now normalize Aβ levels to the total protein content of the lysate, and have used this approach to estimate total Aβ levels in the various samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to determine whether AD-mutation associated changes in APP processing contribute to the mechanism of the cellular changes that underlie hyperexcitability.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>The premise of the study is that the genetic mutations of APP or PS1 in these lines are the cause of the cellular phenotypes.

Using this approach, we found that the γ-secretase inhibitor (CE) decreases hyperexcitability in PS1 mutant (M146V/WT) hiPSC-derived neurons. Similarly, we found that a BACE1 inhibitor decreases hyperexcitability in APP Swedish mutant (APP<sup>swe</sup>/WT) hiPSC-derived neurons. We observed decreases in spontaneous action potentials, sodium current density, and EPSC frequency. We have added these results to the main manuscript as a new figure (Results subsection “γ-Secretase or BACE1 inhibition reverses the hyperexcitability of AD neurons” and Figure 6). Our results suggest that APP processing plays a role in the hyperexcitability observed in hiPSC-derived neurons bearing the FAD mutations used in this study. Again, we thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should also elaborate on their hypotheses of what mechanisms might link the genetic mutations to cellular hyperexcitability.
