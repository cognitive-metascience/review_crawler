invertebrates. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of GABAergic modulation are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that a GABAergic signal in <italic>C. elegans</italic> modulates the amplitude of undulatory head bending through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and conserved metabotropic receptors. We show that the GABAergic RME head motor neurons generate undulatory activity patterns that correlate with head bending and the activity of RME causally links with head bending amplitude. The undulatory activity of RME is regulated by a pair of cholinergic head motor neurons SMD, which facilitate head bending, and inhibits SMD to limit head bending. The extrasynaptic neurotransmission between SMD and RME provides a gain control system to set head bending amplitude to a value correlated with optimal efficiency of forward movement.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In both vertebrates and invertebrates, neuromodulators profoundly shape the activity of neural circuits, giving rise to organized and yet flexible patterns of output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>). Neuromodulation of circuit activity is widespread in the neural circuits that generate structured locomotory patterns, such as walking, running, swimming, as well as feeding. Among a large number of neuromodulators, GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter found in all nervous systems, plays a critical role in modulating locomotory patterns by regulating the underlying neural circuits at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cazalets et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reith and Sillar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A great deal is known about the modulatory role of GABA in regulating locomotory patterns. In the crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>, GABA is identified in a few neuromodulatory neurons that project to the stomatogastric nervous system, which generates a pyloric rhythmic pattern. All the stomatogastric neurons respond to GABA with either an excitatory or inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swensen et al., 2000</xref>), which are likely to contribute to the diverse motor patterns that can be generated by the stomatogastric system. The modulatory role of GABA has also been characterized in the spinal motor networks, where reciprocal glycinergic inhibition between contralateral and antagonist neuronal pools gives rise to rhythmic motor activities in different vertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford and Williams, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchanan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohen and Harris-Warrick, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dale, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friesen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soffe, 1987</xref>). For example, in isolated lamprey spinal cord electrophysiological and pharmacological data showed that an internally released GABA signal regulated spinal burst rate and modulated intersegmental coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegner et al., 1993</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles, pharmacologically manipulating the activity of spinal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor(s) alters the duration and rate of swimming episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reith and Sillar, 1999</xref>). In zebrafish larva, the activity of a set of GABA-producing sensory neurons in the spinal cord inhibits the slow fictive swimming events during either resting or active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>). In the in vitro spinal cord preparation isolated from neonatal rats, GABA modulates the locomotory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cazalets et al., 1998</xref>) and in the neonatal mouse spinal cord, GABAergic transmission is shown to play an integrated role in generating motor activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</xref>).</p><p>While the role of GABA in shaping the activity patterns of motor networks is extensively studied, important questions remain to be addressed. For example, GABAergic neurons are often widely distributed in nervous systems to regulate diverse neuronal types. GABAergic neurotransmission can act either synaptically through the ionic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors or extrasynaptically through metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dittman and Regehr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isaacson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the high level of heterogeneity in the properties of GABA signals precludes a complete understanding of how GABA modulates the operation of a given neural circuit. In addition, while a large body of electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence revealed the compelling role of GABAergic modulation in motor activities, the causal link between the modulatory activity of GABA and the behavioral consequence in locomotion has not been established in behaving animals.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provides an opportunity to address these questions. The connectivity of the 302 neurons in a hermaphrodite adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> is well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>), allowing identification of individual neurons and their connectivity with the rest of the nervous system. The nervous system of the nematode is easily accessed by genetic tools, making it feasible to monitor and manipulate the activity of specific neurons in behaving animals in order to address the causal role of neural activity in movements. In addition, the small and fully sequenced genome encodes homologues of many known molecules that function in the mammalian brains, allowing characterization of these conserved factors in a genetically tractable organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bargmann, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Under the standard condition on a solid agar surface <italic>C. elegans</italic> generates forward undulatory movement that occurs at around 1 Hz bending oscillation on the dorsal-ventral plane. The undulatory locomotory wave travels posteriorly from head to tail through contraction of body muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). In an adult hermaphrodite, two major motor networks mediate forward movement, the head motor circuit and the ventral nerve cord motor circuit that innervate 95 muscle cells arranged in parallel rows along its dorsal and ventral sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>). The head motor circuit that innervates the anterior muscle cells in the head and neck consists of several groups of excitatory cholinergic motor neurons, including four SMD (sublateral motor neurons class D) neurons, and one group of inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons, the four RME (ring motor neuron class E) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>). The ventral nerve cord motor circuit that innervates the rest of the body wall muscles consists of excitatory cholinergic A-type and B-type motor neurons, which are required for backward and forward movement, respectively, as well as D-type GABAergic inhibitory motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1986</xref>). All ventral nerve cord motor neurons are subdivided into dorsal and ventral groups that innervate dorsal and ventral muscles, respectively; and both A- and B-type cholinergic neurons activate D-type GABAergic neurons that innervate the antagonistic muscles on the opposing side. This network connectivity allows alternating contraction and relaxation of the dorsal and ventral muscles that propagates the undulatory body wave from the head region to the rest of the body during forward movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1986</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14197.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The GABAergic motor neurons RME restrict head bending amplitude and exhibit intracellular calcium signals that are correlated with head bending.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics showing the innervation of anterior muscles by RME and SMD motor neurons.

In this study, we characterize the mechanism whereby GABA modulates the amplitude of head bending during forward movement. We show that the GABAergic head motor neurons RME and the cholinergic motor neurons SMD functionally interact through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and conserved metabotropic receptors. The inhibitory feedback between RME and SMD provides a gain control mechanism to regulate the extent of head bending.

The anterior groups of muscle cells in the head and neck are innervated by several groups of cholinergic excitatory motor neurons, including four SMD neurons with two SMDD neurons innervating dorsal muscles and two SMDV neurons innervating ventral muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>). Similar groups of anterior muscle cells are also innervated by four GABAergic RME motor neurons, RMED (Dorsal), RMEV (Ventral), RMEL (Left), and RMER (Right) that innervate the contralateral muscles in the ventral, dorsal, right, and left quadrants, respectively (note that different from excitatory motor neurons, RMED innervates <italic>ventral</italic> muscles and RMEV innervate <italic>dorsal</italic> muscles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>). To characterize the role of GABAergic neurotransmission in undulatory head bending, we focused on the RME GABAergic neurons. We first killed the four RME neurons with a laser beam with the aid of a fluorescent reporter transgene that was expressed in RME and other GABAergic neurons. We found that the operated animals still made undulatory head bending and forward movement, suggesting that the RME GABAergic neurons are not required for the generation of the movements. However, killing RME increased the amplitude of the undulatory head bending during forward movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

We showed that ablating SMD completely removed the rescuing effect of <italic>Pglr-1::cha-1</italic> on the undulatory activity of RME in the <italic>cha-1(p1152)</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). We found that among all the neurons that consistently express the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter, only the cholinergic head neurons RMDD and RMDV are postsynaptic of SMD or connect with SMD via gap junction. However, neither RMDD nor RMDV neurons synapse onto RME. Overall, our results in combination with the connectome reveal that the head-bending correlated activity of RME is generated by extrasynaptic cholinergic neurotransmission that originates from the head motor neurons SMD.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14197.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SMD regulate the activity of RME via the metabotropic acetylcholine receptor GAR-2. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) The <italic>gar-2(ok520)</italic> mutants are defective in cross-correlation (<bold>A</bold>) and peak correlation (<bold>B</bold>) between RME calcium activity and head bending, and the expression of <italic>Pgar-2::gar-2</italic> rescues the defects. Transgenic animals and mutants are compared with wild type with ANONA with Dunnett’s post-test.

To address the question more specifically, we also performed laser ablation of SMD. We found that ablating SMD disrupted head bending-correlated calcium activities in RME while the RME neurons in the SMD-ablated animals remained active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). In contrast, ablating the IL2 sensory neurons had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>).

RME generates a modulatory signal that limits head bending amplitude. The oscillatory activity of RME provides a mechanism through which the GABAergic modulatory signal mediates head bending with a temporal pattern that matches that of head undulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor GBB-1/2 functions in SMD neurons to restrain head bending</title><p>Next, to understand how RME regulate the amplitude of head undulation, we sought the downstream GABAergic receptors.

To address this question, we analyzed the relationship between head bending amplitude and the speed and efficiency of forward movement. In the case of slender organisms undulating in Newtonian fluids, the classical resistance force theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gray and Hancock, 1955</xref>) predicts quantitatively that the propulsion efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the actual speed (<italic>V<sub>a</sub></italic>) to the wave speed of body undulation (<italic>V<sub>w</sub></italic>) in the reference frame of a worm, grows with the angle of attack (θ<sub>a</sub>), which is defined as the mean angle of a body segment with respect to the direction of forward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>). In the small angle limit, the relationship is given by the red curve and the equation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gray and Hancock, 1955</xref>). Using wild-type animals we measured both variables during bouts of (~10–15 s) forward locomotion (The data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and found that experimental data closely fit the theoretical curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We measured the amplitude of head bending and found that angle of attack was also positively correlated with the amplitude of head bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore, increasing head bending correlates with greater locomotion efficiency and faster actual speed of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, when the head bending amplitude continued to increase, the wave speed of body undulation decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), possibly due to limiting biomechanical factors, such as speed of muscle contraction. As a result, within the physiological range of head bending amplitude, the speed of forward movement approached its maximum when the angle of attack was at around 45 degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These findings suggest that an optimal range of head bending amplitude might correlate with efficient forward movement. Consistently, we found that either optogenetically inhibiting or activating RME, which caused increased or decreased head bending amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), significantly reduced the actual speed of locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and the propulsion efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our results reveal that the RME GABAergic modulatory neurotransmission plays an important role in setting the amplitude of head bending near the optimal value for forward movement.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14197.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Head bending amplitude correlates with speed and efficiency of forward locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The angle of attack, measured as the average angle of a body segment with respect to the direction of forward movement, is plotted with the propulsion efficiency, defined as the ratio of the actual speed <italic>V<sub>a </sub></italic>to the propagation speed of undulation in the reference frame of a worm <italic>V<sub>w</sub></italic>.

Neuromodulation, mediated by a large number of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, plays a critical role in this regulation. Here, we characterized a modulatory role of the GABAergic motor neurons RME in regulating the undulatory head bending during forward movement. We identified the extrasynaptic mechanism through which RME inhibited the cholinergic excitatory motor neurons SMD via the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor GBB-1/GBB-2 to limit the amplitude of head bending. Interestingly, we also found that the activity of RME depended on the excitatory cholinergic inputs from SMD that also innervated the anterior muscles, providing a circuit mechanism whereby the activity of the GABAergic RME neurons temporally matches the activity of SMD and head bending undulation. We demonstrated that activating or inhibiting the activity of RME led to decreased or increased head bending amplitude during undulatory movement, causally linking the modulatory role of RME GABAergic signal with the amplitude of head undulation in moving animals.</p><p>While the undulatory forward movement in <italic>C. elegans</italic> generates a recurring locomotory pattern, the underlying rhythmogenic circuit or neurons have not been identified.

Killing RME does not eliminate the undulatory forward movement, indicating that RME are not required to generate forward movement and revealing a modulatory role of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission in mediating the pattern of forward locomotion. It has been shown that GABA modulates locomotory circuits either extrinsically or intrinsically as part of the motor circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cazalets et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reith and Sillar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fidelin et al, 2015</xref>). Here, we characterized a signaling mechanism whereby the RME GABAergic neurotransmission modulated the pattern of head undulation during forward movements. We also demonstrated the causal role of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission in setting the amplitude of head bending in moving animals and showed that an optimal range of head bending amplitude correlated with the speed and efficiency of forward movement. We propose that the inhibitory feedback between SMD and RME provides a gain control mechanism to dynamically regulate head bending. When SMD activity is high and the head bending amplitude is large, RME inhibition is strong; when SMD activity is low and the head bending amplitude is small, RME inhibition is weak. This regulatory mechanism together with the phase-lock of RME activity to the head bending allows RME to continuously adjust its strength of inhibition based on the strength of SMD activity to set the head bending amplitude within an optimal range. Gain control mechanisms are commonly observed in motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Heckman, 2014</xref>). Here, we characterize the extrasynaptic neurotransmission of GABA, a common transmitter, that regulates a motor gain control through a conserved metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor.</p><p>Both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are implicated in modulating locomotory networks. Pharmacologically manipulating the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> versus GABA<sub>B</sub> often generates different effects on locomotory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cazalets et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reith and Sillar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</xref>). While GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors act as chloride channels; metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors signal through G-protein pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olsen, 1991</xref>). Here, we characterize the extrasynaptic GABAergic neurotransmission through which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor modulates locomotion. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two subunits of GABA<sub>B</sub> that are encoded by <italic>gbb-1</italic> and <italic>gbb-2</italic> and act as heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</xref>). We showed that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunit GBB-1 mediated the causal behavioral effect of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission on head bending undulation. In contrast, we found that mutating <italic>unc-49,</italic> which encoded a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of GABA<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamber et al., 1999</xref>), in the wild-type background did not significantly reduce the effect of activating RME with ChR2 on the amplitude of head bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It was previously shown that the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor UNC-49 was expressed in the body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamber et al., 1999</xref>) and mutating <italic>unc-49</italic> eliminated GABA-induced hyperpolarization in the body muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>), resulting in a 'shrinker' phenotype that phenocopied the locomotory defect of killing D-type GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons, but not the defect of killing RME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McIntire et al., 1993a</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that both the identity of the GABAergic neurons and the target cells that express either GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors contribute to the behavioral effects of GABAergic neurotransmission. We speculate that the slow kinetics of the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and the downstream signaling match the temporal dynamics of head undulation, which operates at around 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the cholinergic neurotransmission from SMD that regulates the undulatory activity of RME is also mediated by a G-protein coupled receptor, GAR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The protein sequence of GAR-2 is similar to the mammalian M2/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled with G<sub>i/o,</sub> and the mammalian M1/M3/M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled with G<sub>q</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lanzafame et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2000</xref>).

Here, we showed that GAR-2 mediated the undulatory activity of RME in response to the cholinergic neurotransmission of SMD. We speculate that GAR-2 might be coupled with an excitatory G<sub>α</sub> subunit or might inhibit an inhibitory signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of RME. Alternatively, GAR-2 may regulate the head-bending correlated temporal dynamics of RME activity and loss of GAR-2 would result in the reduced correlation of RME activity and head undulation, altering the modulatory effect of RME on head bending.</p><p>There are 26 GABAergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> including 4 RME, 19 D-type ventral nerve cord motor neurons and interneurons AVL, DVB and RIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>). While our study addresses the modulatory role of RME in regulating the amplitude of head undulation and how changing head bending amplitude correlates with propulsion efficiency, it does not exclude other mechanisms whereby GABA regulates locomotory patterns. For example, it was previously shown that the D-type GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons directly synapsed onto the cholinergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons and inhibited these excitatory motor neurons through the GBB-1/GBB-2 receptor to mediate the speed of forward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</xref>). Our results together with these previous findings highlight the importance of the underlying circuit connectivity in shaping the behavioral effects of neuromodulation.</p><p>Among the RME neurons, there are RMED (dorsal), RMEV (ventral), RMEL (left) and RMER (right). Here, we showed that it was the GABAergic neurotransmission from RMED and RMEV, but not RMEL or RMER, that modulated head undulation. What accounts for the functional difference between the dorsal-ventral pair and the left-right pair of RME neurons? Previous studies in the stomatogastric nervous system suggested that difference in the diffusion patterns of the neuropeptide proctolin that was released from different modulatory neurons contributed to different modulatory effects of proctolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wood et al., 2002</xref>). There is only one synapse between RMED/V neurons and four SMD motor neurons, two SMDD (dorsal) and two SMDV (ventral), consistent with the involvement of extrasynaptic neurotransmission. The somata of RMED and RMEV are located next to the somata of SMDD and SMDV on the dorsal and ventral sides; while the somata of RMEL and REMR are mainly on the lateral sides, away from SMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that the anatomical features of these motor neurons allow the GABA signal released from RMED/V to regulate SMD more efficiently than the GABA released from RMEL/R, highlighting the importance of the spatial property of neuromodulators in their modulatory effects on neural circuits and behavior. It is also possible that GABA in RMED/V versus RMEL/R is co-released with different neurotransmitters or peptides, a mechanism which also partially accounts for different modulatory effects of proctolin released from different modulatory neurons in the stomatogastric nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nusbaum et al., 2001</xref>). A complete profile of the neurotransmitters and peptides expressed in the four RME neurons is not available yet; therefore, the potential difference in the co-release of neurotransmitters from different RME neurons remains to be further investigated.</p><p>Our study reveals that the SMD and RME motor neurons signal to each other through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and metabotropic receptors to modulate a locomotory pattern. This neuromodulatory signal forms a functional circuit that cannot be predicted by using the anatomical connections described by the wiring diagram. Therefore, our results highlight the critical role of neuromodulation in shaping the information flow of the nervous system. All nervous systems express a large number of neuromodulators that can substantially regulate the functional organization of neural circuits. Our study points to the importance of functional studies in combination with wiring diagrams in order to better understand how the nervous systems operate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were raised under the standard conditions at 20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Laser ablation was performed on L1-L2 larvae. Animals that underwent laser ablation or mock procedures were recovered and raised at 20°C under standard conditions for 2 days till they reached adulthood. After behavioral assays, each ablated animal was recovered and the expression of the fluorescent reporter was examined under a 40× objective on a Nikon TE2000-U microscope. Animals with remaining fluorescent signals in target neurons were excluded from analysis. The n numbers in the relevant figure legends denote the numbers of different animals for the experiments and represent independent biological replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Calcium imaging was performed in a microfluidic device as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chronis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>) with modifications. A SU-8 master was used to cast Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Dow Corning Sylgard 184, Ellsworth Adhesives, Germantown, WI) chips and inlet holes were drilled manually. Chips were bonded to glass coverslips with a handheld corona treater and connected to a perfusion system (Automate Scientific Valvebank, Berkeley, CA). Fluorescence time-lapse imaging (100–200 ms exposure, 5 Hz) was performed on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective and a Photometrics CoolSnap EZ camera. To image neurons on different focal planes, an image stack was collected on a confocal spinning disk microscope. Animals were washed by NGM buffer (1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> pH6.0) briefly before being loaded in the worm channel, and were presented with slow streams of NGM buffer throughout the recording of up to 5 min. All image analysis was performed with ImageJ (NIH) unless otherwise specified. Frames were aligned using the StackReg plugin where necessary. For RME imaging, total fluorescence intensity was measured by subtracting background from the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the cell body of RMED or RMEV neuron during head bending. For cross-correlation analysis, the fluorescence intensity data were normalized for each individual to a linear scale by the formula (<italic>F - F</italic><sub>min</sub>)/(<italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> - <italic>F</italic><sub>min</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>). For simultaneous imaging of SMD and RME, image stacks were composed and processed by a customized program (uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Wenlab/worm-imaging-analysis">https://github.com/Wenlab/worm-imaging-analysis</ext-link>) written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick). Imaging on immobilized animals were performed on a 10% agarose pad with 0.3–0.5 µl of 0.1 µm diameter polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences 00876–15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The n numbers in the relevant figure legends denote the numbers of different animals for the experiments and represent independent biological replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Head movement analysis</title><p>Head bending of animals during calcium imaging in the microfluidic chip was quantified with ImageJ (NIH, MD) essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>). Images were binarized with all background pixels converted to 0 and all pixels representing the animal converted to 1. An ROI comprising the moving part of the animal’s head was selected and fit into an ellipse in ImageJ, where the orientation of the ellipse was measured for each frame. The difference in orientation between individual frames and the reference frame (minimum head bending) was calculated, generating either positive or negative values that represented head deflection along the ventral-dorsal axis. For cross-correlation analysis, the head bending was then normalized to the maximum deflection, generating an index between −1 and 1. Ventral bending was defined as positive. The n numbers in the relevant figure legends denote the numbers of different animals for the experiments and represent independent biological replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cross-correlation analysis</title><p>Cross-correlation between calcium signals and head bending was analyzed in JMP10 software (SAS) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>) with modifications. Time series data of fluorescence intensity and head position were normalized within each individual and taken for cross-correlation with a time lag of 20 s (100 frames). Head position was used as input. Comparison between peak correlations of different genotypes was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the peak of the mean wild-type control correlation was identified at time <italic>T<sub>p </sub></italic>and the maximum correlation, positive or negative, was taken from strains of interest in a 1 s time window centered on <italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic>. Unless otherwise specified, cross-correlation between RMEV calcium activity and head bending amplitude was analyzed, mutants were compared with wild-type controls and transgenic animals were compared with non-transgenic siblings by Student’s t-test or Analysis of variance (ANOVA). The n numbers for cross-correlation and peak correlation in the relevant figure legends denote the numbers of different animals for the experiments and represent independent biological replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tracking and analysis of head bending amplitude</title><p>Tracking of freely-moving animals were performed on a custom-built single-worm tracker. Well-fed adult hermaphrodites were washed briefly in NGM buffer and placed onto a 9 cm NGM agar plate without food. Animals were allowed to move freely on the plate for 2 min before being recorded for at least 1 min. The plate was placed on a moving stage under a DMK 21AU04 monochrome scan camera (Imaging Source, 30 Hz) and was illuminated by infrared light from a LED ring. Images were captured with a customized program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>) written in LabVIEW8.5 (National Instrument) and saved every 6 frames. The video recorded was processed by a customized program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Source code 2</xref>) written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). Frames in which animals were making reversals or turns were excluded and at least 150 frames (30 s) per trial were used for analysis. In brief, the head and tail of an animal were identified as the points of maximum convex curvature along the animal’s boundary and confirmed manually. The centerline of the animal’s body was extracted and smoothened, and divided into 100 segments. The first 18 segments, or the first 18% of the whole body-length from the nose tip, were counted as the head region, and the head curvature of an animal was computed as the average head curvature of the 18 segments. The head bending amplitude was computed as the standard deviation of the head curvature during the period of measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The n numbers in the relevant figure legends denote the numbers of different animals for the experiments and represent independent biological replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Fluorescent images were collected with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective.

Animals used in all the optogenetics experiments were raised in the dark at 20°C on NGM plates with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal. The OP50-retinal plates were prepared 1–2 days in advance by seeding a 6 cm NGM-agar plate with 250 µl of OP50 culture and 1 µl of 100 mM retinal dissolved in ethanol. Adult animals were washed briefly in NGM buffer and transferred into a layer of 25% or 30% dextran (w/v) sandwiched between two glass slides separated by a 75 µm spacer. The animal was slightly compressed to reduce head movement in the z direction. During the assay, an individual animal was imaged under infrared light with dark field illumination, and the first 10% of the body-length from nose tip was targeted by a laser beam reflected by the digital micromirror device. For RME inhibition by Arch, the green laser (532 nm) was switched on for seconds in each trial. For RME activation by ChR2, the blue laser (473 nm) was switched on for seconds in each trial, and the RIS interneuron was removed by laser surgery in larvae at the L1-L2 stage. In the relevant figure legends, the n numbers denote the numbers of different trials on indicated numbers of different animals for the experiments, and represent both independent biological replication and technical replication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs P40 OD010440) and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Gene Knockout Consortium for strains, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute for cosmids, Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Ronald L. Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very thorough, methodical determination of connectivity between two neurons involved in locomotion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SMD and RME. The study demonstrates that SMD uses cholinergic signaling to activate RME which in turn inhibits SMD through primarily GABAB receptor-dependent signaling. Further the role of either increasing or decreasing activity in these cells, including the consequences of ablating neurons or disrupting chemical messenger pathways is nicely demonstrated in behaving animals using optogenetic techniques. Most conclusions of the study are very well supported by the data. The use of every imaginable advantage of the worm system to manipulate and assess neuronal circuit activity and behavior, all in live animals, is clearly the major strength of this paper. The paper is yet another demonstration of the limits of connectomics since extrasynaptic signals such as those described here follow no anatomical rules.</p><p>The figures presented are detailed and convincing and supported by ample supplemental data (these could be better integrated into the main text). Writing is in general clear.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement about the thoroughness of the work, but were concerned about two issues which must be addressed before this paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors have to indicate for each figure panel in which they used transgenic lines whether these results were observed with more than one transgenic line, as is standard in the field and is required for publication.</p><p>2) Discussion is too inwardly focused on issues of concern to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community and misses an opportunity to reach out to a larger audience. Two issues should be addressed directly:</p><p>A) Quoting from the review discussion: &quot;…the aspect that I would like to see discussed is what their data means in terms of interpreting connectome data. People seem so obsessed with connectomes these days that they tend to forget that even a connectome as well mapped as that of the worm will not predict who talks to whom. That may not come as a surprise, but this manuscript is terrific in the way it shows this.&quot;</p><p>B) Quoting from the review discussion: &quot;…enthusiasm and the broader interest of this manuscript would be increased by at least speculation about the functional implications of the circuitry…&quot;. To guide this revision see the review comments below:</p><p>&quot;This small circuit involves a neuron which elicits head bending, activating another neuron which decreases head bending. If this is a static component of the system, it is a convoluted way to elicit the correct amount of head bending. The Discussion would benefit from some discussion of this circuit and potential utility of this arrangement. I would favor discussion of functional implications of the circuitry over discussion of details such as hypothesizing about roles of other individual neurons in the system (Ex. Discussion, fifth and sixth paragraphs).&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why isn't there just 1 cell that elicits the appropriate level of head bending? Why is the GABAergic modulation time-locked to the head bending; would a tonic inhibitory modulatory tone have different consequences?&quot;</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) In the subsection “Optogenetic analysis of the RME GABAergic modulatory signal“. If the dual mutant without GABAA or GABAB &quot;completely abolishes&quot; the effects of RME, but GABAB mutant only significantly decreases the effects, doesn't that suggest that there is a contribution of GABAA receptors? How does eliminating a GABAA receptor in muscles test its central role in modulation of the motor circuit?</p><p>2) In the subsection “The amplitude of head bending mediates locomotory speed and efficiency”. The data presented here are correlations between head bending and locomotor speed. How has the &quot;effect&quot; of head bending amplitude been determined? By altering RME activity, could there be other parallel effects on locomotion? Is the only effect of RME to alter head bending amplitude? It seems this sections needs to be re-written to indicate that correlations exist which are suggestive or it needs to be better explained why there is a definitive causal link between head bending amplitude and the speed of locomotion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14197.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>The reviewers were in agreement about the thoroughness of the work, but were concerned about two issues which must be addressed before this paper can be published in eLife.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The authors have to indicate for each figure panel in which they used transgenic lines whether these results were observed with more than one transgenic line, as is standard in the field and is required for publication.</italic> </p><p>While similar effects were observed in more than one transgenic lines, we reported the results from one line for each transgene in this manuscript.

We have now added discussion (Discussion section, last paragraph) on the limitation of connectomes in predicting functional connectivity.</p><p><italic>B) Quoting from the review discussion: &quot;…enthusiasm and the broader interest of this manuscript would be increased by at least speculation about the functional implications of the circuitry…&quot;. To guide this revision see the review comments below:</italic></p><p> <italic>&quot;This small circuit involves a neuron which elicits head bending, activating another neuron which decreases head bending. If this is a static component of the system, it is a convoluted way to elicit the correct amount of head bending. The Discussion would benefit from some discussion of this circuit and potential utility of this arrangement. I would favor discussion of functional implications of the circuitry over discussion of details such as hypothesizing about roles of other individual neurons in the system (Ex. Discussion, fifth and sixth paragraphs).&quot;</italic> </p><p> <italic>&quot;Why isn't there just 1 cell that elicits the appropriate level of head bending? Why is the GABAergic modulation time-locked to the head bending; would a tonic inhibitory modulatory tone have different consequences?&quot;</italic>We appreciate the suggestion. We show that SMD facilitate head bending as well as activate RME, and RME subsequently inhibit SMD to limit head bending. We propose that this convoluted way of regulating head bending provides a gain control mechanism. When SMD activity is high and the head bending amplitude is large, RME inhibition is strong; when SMD activity is low and the head bending amplitude is small, RME inhibition is weak. This regulatory mechanism together with the phase-lock of RME activity to the head bending allows RME to dynamically adjust its strength of inhibition based on the strength of SMD activity to set the head bending amplitude within an optimal range. Gain control mechanisms are commonly observed in motor systems. In this paper, we have identified the role of a conserved B-type GABAergic receptor in mediating motor gain control. We propose that the circuit organization and the regulatory mechanisms revealed in our study would be of a general appeal. We have included the discussion in the second paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Other concerns:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) In the subsection “Optogenetic analysis of the RME GABAergic modulatory signal“. If the dual mutant without GABAA or GABAB &quot;completely abolishes&quot; the effects of RME, but GABAB mutant only significantly decreases the effects, doesn't that suggest that there is a contribution of GABAA receptors? How does eliminating a GABAA receptor in muscles test its central role in modulation of the motor circuit?</italic> </p><p>We agree that in the <italic>gbb-1(tm1406)</italic> mutant background there was a residual effect of ChR2 activation of RME, while the <italic>unc-49(e407);gbb-1(tm1406)</italic> double mutations completely abolished the effect, which suggests some potential role of the UNC-49 GABAA receptor in regulating head bending amplitude. However, on the other hand, the <italic>unc-49(e407)</italic> mutation alone did not seem to reduce the effect of activating RME with ChR2. We speculate that the role of UNC-49 GABAA receptor in regulating the behavioral effects of activating RME with ChR2 may only become detectable when the GBB-1 GABAB receptor is removed. However, the potential mechanism is currently unknown. We have further discussed these results in the last paragraph of the subsection “Optogenetic analysis of the RME GABAergic modulatory signal”.</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection “The amplitude of head bending mediates locomotory speed and efficiency”. The data presented here are correlations between head bending and locomotor speed. How has the &quot;effect&quot; of head bending amplitude been determined? By altering RME activity, could there be other parallel effects on locomotion? Is the only effect of RME to alter head bending amplitude? It seems this sections needs to be re-written to indicate that correlations exist which are suggestive or it needs to be better explained why there is a definitive causal link between head bending amplitude and the speed of locomotion.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the thoughts and comments. Our optogenetics experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in combination with molecular genetics, calcium imaging and behavioral analysis indicate that the activity of RME modulates head bending amplitude through an extrasynaptic signal of GABA. Meanwhile, we also found that when we changed RME activity with optogenetics, we could also change the speed and propulsion efficiency of forward movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In Newtonian fluid, the propulsion efficiency as a function of angle of attack can be derived from resistive force theory; this theoretical description fits well with our measurement on head bending and propulsion efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Therefore, the amplitude of head bending strongly correlates with speed and propulsion efficiency, although we agree that we do not yet understand the mechanism underlying the correlation. We have now re-written the section to emphasize the correlation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
