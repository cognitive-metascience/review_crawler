All adaptational or gain control mechanisms face the challenge of obtaining a reliable estimate of the property of the input to be adapted to and obtaining this estimate sufficiently rapidly to be useful. Here, we explore how the primate retina balances the need to change gain rapidly and reliably when photons arrive rarely at individual rod photoreceptors. We find that the weakest backgrounds that decrease the gain of the retinal output signals are similar to those that increase human behavioral threshold, and identify a novel site of gain control in the retinal circuitry. Thus, surprisingly, the gain of retinal signals begins to decrease essentially as soon as background lights are detectable; under these conditions, gain control does not rely on a highly averaged estimate of the photon count, but instead signals from individual photon absorptions trigger changes in gain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00467.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00467.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00467.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To process the sights and sounds around us, our senses must be attuned to a huge range of signals: from barely audible whispers to deafening rock concerts, and from dim glimmers of light to bright spotlights. Sensory neurons face the challenge of encoding this huge range of inputs within their much more restricted response range. Thus, neurons in our eyes and ears must continually adjust their gain or sensitivity to match changes in the light and sound inputs. These gain control processes must operate rapidly to keep up with the ever-changing input signals, but must also operate accurately so as not to distort the inputs.</p><p>The trade-off between rapid and accurate gain control can be illustrated by considering how the retina processes information at low light levels. There are two main types of light-sensitive cells in the retina: rods and cones. Vision at night relies on the ability of the rods to detect single photons—the smallest unit of light. In starlight, an individual rod will register photons only rarely, and most of the time, the majority of the rods will not register any photons. Neurons in the retinal circuits that read out the rod signals receive input from hundreds or thousands of rods, and those rod inputs are highly amplified to allow detection of the responses produced when a tiny fraction of the rods absorbs a photon. But this amplification is dangerous, as it could easily saturate retinal signals when light levels increase. Gain control mechanisms are needed to avoid such saturation.</p><p>Schwartz and Rieke now add to our understanding of this process by examining how the retinas of non-human primates behave in low light. They reveal that levels of background light that can only just be detected behaviorally trigger retinal gain controls; these gain controls operate when less than 1% of rods absorb a photon. Under these conditions, the physics of light itself will cause considerable variability in the stream of photons arriving at the retina, leading to high variability in the gain of retinal responses. Nonetheless, changes in gain occurred rapidly following changes in background, indicating that the underlying mechanisms spend little time averaging incident photons. Taken together, these findings will require revisiting our ideas about how adaptational mechanisms balance the competing demands of speed and reliability to help us see the world around us.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00467.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00467.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>macaque</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>retinal signal processing</kwd><kwd>neural computation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY11850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Gregory W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single absorbed photons trigger adaptational mechanisms that help the retina maintain sensitivity across a wide range of background illumination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory systems encode an enormous range of input signals—for example, a rock concert is ∼10<sup>12</sup> times louder than a just detectable whisper. Maintaining sensitivity as inputs change requires adaptational mechanisms that adjust the gain or amplification of neural signals to match their limited dynamic range to the range of the input signals a cell receives. Such gain control mechanisms operate under challenging conditions as the inputs they encounter can vary rapidly in time and locally in the space of possible stimuli. For example, visual neurons can experience &gt;1000-fold changes in input a few times a second as the eyes move to explore a typical scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frazor and Geisler, 2006</xref>). Standard cameras fail to capture the full structure of such scenes because they employ a single global gain control in the form of an exposure setting, which is often poorly matched to the brightest and dimmest regions of a scene. Sensory gain controls are clearly more sophisticated.</p><p>Effective gain control requires balancing the need to be rapid and local with the need to be accurate (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rieke and Rudd, 2009</xref>). This is an example of the classic change detection problem: how many samples from a signal distribution are needed to determine whether or not the distribution has changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buracas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deneve, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wark et al., 2009</xref>)? Gain control mechanisms operating near absolute visual threshold exemplify this problem. Human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds producing ∼0.01 isomerized rhodopsin molecules per rod per second (R*/rod/s) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donner, 1992</xref>). Under these conditions, the number of photons absorbed in a small time window fluctuates widely due to the Poisson statistics that govern photon absorption. In principle, increases in behavioral threshold could solely reflect this increased noise without gain changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlow, 1965</xref>). However, several studies suggest that weak backgrounds decrease the gain of retinal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Rudd, 1998</xref>). Retinal gain control mechanisms operating at these low light levels must work in the presence of the irreducible noise associated with random photon arrivals.</p><p>At low light levels, rod-mediated signals traverse the retina through the specialized rod bipolar pathway: rods → rod bipolar cells → AII amacrine cells → cone bipolar cells → ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Field et al., 2005</xref>). The total number of rods that convey the signal increases at each stage of this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This convergence, together with amplification of signals by cellular and synaptic mechanisms, permits fully dark-adapted ganglion cells to generate one or more spikes to flashes producing photon absorptions in only ∼0.1% of the rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mastronarde, 1983</xref>; P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, unpublished). Left unchecked, this high gain would cause just detectable backgrounds to produce ganglion cell firing rates in excess of 100 spikes per second. Gain control mechanisms are needed to prevent such excessive firing.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00467.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gain control in the rod pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified diagram of the excitatory circuits that relay rod and cone signals to On ganglion cells.

But the greater convergence at downstream locations in the rod bipolar pathway could provide a more reliable signal to control gain. Hence, we explored how the gain of retinal signals is controlled in dim backgrounds, with three main goals: (1) to determine if the gain of retinal signals is altered by backgrounds near the onset of changes in human behavioral threshold, (2) to determine how the retinal circuit averages over space and time to detect changes in the photon flux, and (3) to identify novel sites of gain control in the rod bipolar pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We focus on responses of primate On parasol (magnocellular projecting) ganglion cells. On parasol ganglion cells provide information to cortical circuits about subtle changes in contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaplan and Shapley, 1982</xref>) and receive abundant rod-mediated input at low light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purpura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Field et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, these cells are likely to contribute critically to vision at low light levels. On parasol cells also provide a sensitive measure of the output of the rod bipolar pathway. This pathway dominates rod-mediated signaling across ganglion cell types at low light levels, and hence should provide shared steps in processing of rod signals. Indeed, as described below, we find that the gain of retinal signals at low light levels is controlled at a site located within the rod bipolar pathway.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gain controls in the retinal circuitry operate near the onset of behavioral threshold changes</title><p>We measured spike responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and excitatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) of On parasol ganglion cells in response to brief flashes superimposed on a range of backgrounds (see also ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figures 10 and 11</xref>). We focused specifically on backgrounds near the onset of changes in human behavioral threshold (0.01–0.2 isomerizations/rod/s or R*/rod/s). Flash strengths (0.001–0.006 R*/rod) were chosen to elicit responses well below saturation. Both individual responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) had a clear dependence on background. Furthermore, a cell’s excitatory synaptic input and its spike response changed similarly with changes in background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To quantify the effect of background on a cell’s response, we determined the response gain by dividing the response amplitude (spike count or integrated current) by the flash strength; the gain measures the response per R*/rod.

To further test this conclusion, we defined a detection threshold as the strength of the flash (in R*/rod) eliciting a response with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 (see ‘Materials and methods’). Noise was measured from sections of recording prior to the flash. Detection thresholds for spike responses and excitatory synaptic inputs measured in the same cell were near identical across a range of backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with the similarity of the spike responses and excitatory inputs, inhibitory synaptic inputs to the same stimuli were three to four times smaller than the excitatory inputs, and hence unlikely to contribute strongly to spike output (data not shown).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicates the changes in the gain of an On parasol cell's spike output are dominated by changes in the cell's excitatory synaptic inputs.

Since threshold depends on both signal and noise, the relationship between these behavioral measurements and gain control is unclear. Hence, the experiments below characterize gain, noise, and threshold of the On parasol responses across a range of background intensities spanning these behaviorally defined regions.</p><p>We extended experiments like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to span a wide range of backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this and all subsequent experiments, we adjusted the flash strength to elicit similar responses across backgrounds because the change in gain exceeded the cell’s linear response range (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figures 10 and 11</xref>). Adjusting flash strength (and dividing the response by the flash strength to measure gain) allowed us to probe a ∼10,000-fold range of backgrounds.

For the cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, I<sub>0</sub> was 0.076 R*/rod/s (marked by the arrowhead); across cells, I<sub>0</sub> was 0.08 ± 0.03 R*/rod/s (mean ± SD, n = 6). We observed a small but consistent reduction in gain in darkness relative to its maximal value at backgrounds ∼0.01 R*/rod/s. The reduced gain in darkness was highly dependent on the history of light exposure, and hence is only partially captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> because we returned to the dark condition after exposure to several backgrounds (see ‘Recordings and light stimulation’). The low dark gain reflects a nonlinear processing step that is engaged in the dark but relieved for backgrounds producing 0.005–0.01 R*/rod/s; this nonlinearity and its impact on visual sensitivity is the subject of another study (P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, unpublished).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00467.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Changes in gain, noise, and threshold with background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)–(<bold>C</bold>) Example data from a single cell showing gain of the dim flash response (<bold>A</bold>), noise (<bold>B</bold>), and threshold (<bold>C</bold>) as a function of background (see ‘Materials and methods’).

First, over a ∼1000-fold range of backgrounds gain closely followed Weber law behavior, even though multiple mechanisms contribute to gain control across this range. This indicates an orderly coordination of gain control mechanisms (see ‘Discussion’). Second, gain began to decrease for backgrounds near 0.01 or 0.02 R*/rod/s—close to the onset of changes in human behavioral threshold. We summarized the onset of gain changes across cells by choosing three regions spanning equal ranges of background intensities centered below, on, or above I<sub>0</sub> (horizontal colored lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> plots the exponent describing the dependence of gain on background (i.e., the slope on a log–log scale as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in each region. Gain scaled inversely with background above 0.3 R*/rod/s, and more gradually at lower background intensities. Consistent with the ability of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> to describe the data, we did not see evidence for an extended region where gain scaled inversely with the square root of the background (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>We quantified noise at each background by projecting the current prior to the flash along the same template used to measure signal (see ‘Analysis’). Noise also changed with background, but such changes were modest across those backgrounds near the onset of changes in behavioral threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>); specifically, noise changed &lt;10-fold over a range of backgrounds that produced an ∼10,000-fold change in gain. These changes in noise with background were much less than expected from Poisson fluctuations in photon absorption and no changes in gain. If Poisson fluctuations dominated noise and gain remained constant, the standard deviation of the current should increase as the square root of the background—that is, with slope 0.5—since the variance of a Poisson process is proportional to the mean. Noise changed much less with background than this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>). The largest increases in noise occurred between darkness and backgrounds &lt;0.01 R*/rod/s. These changes are produced by a nonlinear processing step that reduces gain in the dark (see above; P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, unpublished). The reduction in noise at backgrounds higher than 0.1 R*/rod/s likely reflects the stronger decrease in gain at these backgrounds, which more than compensates the increase in Poisson fluctuations.</p><p>Changes in noise, although modest, had a noticeable effect on detection threshold—defined as the strength of the flash eliciting a response with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>; see ‘Analysis’). This measure of threshold assumes a linear scaling of response with flash strength, which fails in the dark but holds for backgrounds exceeding 0.01 R*/rod/s (P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, preprint). The threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref> corresponds to the threshold of an ideal observer of the ganglion cell's output, assuming that signal and noise are independent and additive. Thus, the threshold defined here provides a point of comparison to human behavioral threshold vs intensity curves. The threshold for On parasol responses increased for backgrounds as low as 0.02 R*/rod/s, in close correspondence with backgrounds that produce changes in behavioral threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donner, 1992</xref>).

Gain control under these conditions is challenging because photons arrive rarely at individual rod photoreceptors; retinal responses at these backgrounds are noisy, and hence changes in background will be difficult to discern without a large degree of spatial and/or temporal averaging. At the same time, left unabated, the high gain associated with fully dark-adapted vision would cause a parasol ganglion cell to generate hundreds of spikes per second for backgrounds producing ∼0.02 R*/rod/s. The experiments described in this section characterize several key properties of how gain is controlled—particularly the statistical feature of the input that sets gain and how the mechanism integrates over space and time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Gain is controlled by mean not fluctuations</title><p>Changes in the mean background necessarily also change the magnitude of the fluctuations about the mean because of the division of light into discrete photons and the resulting statistical fluctuations in photon arrival. Such Poisson fluctuations in photon absorption are particularly large relative to the mean absorption rate at low backgrounds. Because these statistical fluctuations increase with the square root of the background, a gain control that directly depends on the magnitude of the noise would cause gain to scale inversely with the square root of the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Rudd, 1998</xref>).

A Rose–deVries gain control mechanism based on the fluctuations about the mean predicts that gain should decrease linearly with standard deviation (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Instead, contrast stimuli that substantially increased the variance of a ganglion cell’s excitatory synaptic inputs tended to increase, rather than decrease, the gain of the flash response. In nine cells, stimuli that increased the standard deviation of the baseline excitatory synaptic inputs by 43 ± 17% (mean ± SD) produced a 18 ± 11% increase in gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Here, we have explored the properties of retinal gain controls operating near visual threshold. Below, we relate our findings to the dependence of human behavioral threshold on background and to the general speed/accuracy trade-off associated with detecting a change in the statistics of a noisy signal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Connection to behaviorally measured threshold</title><p>How do the properties of gain controls at low backgrounds in primate retina relate to human behavioral threshold verses intensity (TVI) measurements in humans?

Threshold is increased only by backgrounds that produce a sufficient rate of photon absorption to exceed intrinsic noise. Human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds near 0.01 R*/rod/s, similar to the backgrounds (∼0.02 R*/rod/s) at which primate ganglion cell thresholds began to increase. Both of these are considerably higher than the rate at which spontaneous activation of rhodopsin generates photon-like noise events in primate rods (0.003–0.004 R*/rod/s) (GD Field and F Rieke, unpublished). They are, however, consistent with measures of the total noise (i.e., both discrete and continuous) generated by macaque rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The Rose–deVries region of the TVI curve has long been assumed to reflect an increase in noise without a reduction in gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow, 1957</xref>). Consistent with this view, the gain of retinal signals measured via electroretinograms begins to decline only at backgrounds ∼fivefold higher than those that increase behavioral threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frishman et al., 1996</xref>). Several other previous experiments, however, suggest that gain is reduced in the Rose–deVries range. First, behavioral brightness matching experiments, which should be sensitive to changes in neural gain but not noise, show a robust Rose–deVries region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Rudd, 1998</xref>). Second, the spike responses of toad ganglion cells exhibit an ∼10-fold range of backgrounds over which the threshold required to reach a criterion spike rate increases in proportion to the square root of the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donner et al., 1990</xref>).

The region of the ganglion cell TVI curve with slope 0.5 was limited to a narrow range of backgrounds.

Previously described gain control mechanisms are sensitive to variance (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demb, 2008</xref>), act at locations with insufficient rod convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</xref>), or affect cone signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>). The constraints above suggest a novel mechanism located in the AII amacrine cell or the synaptic connections it makes with cone bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Consistent with this prediction, On midget ganglion cells adapted very similarly to On parasol ganglion cells (data not shown).</p><p>The mechanism we identify here adds to a long list of gain controls in the retinal circuitry. Considering luminance alone, retinal ganglion cells encode stimuli over 10 log units of background, far exceeding the dynamic range of any single mechanism. In the rod pathway, there are at least three gain control mechanisms engaged across backgrounds, each matched to the rod convergence at the adapting location. Backgrounds producing approximately 10–20 R*/rod/s halve the gain of the phototransduction cascade in primate rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</xref>). Backgrounds producing ∼0.4 R*/rod/s halve the gain of the rod bipolar to AII synapse by reducing the number of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>). And, as shown here, backgrounds ∼0.08 R*/rod/s engage a mechanism located downstream of the rod bipolar–AII synapse; the light levels at which this mechanism is engaged are consistent with backgrounds that are just detectable given the total noise generated by macaque rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</xref>). Impressively, these mechanisms act in concert to create a smooth dependence of gain on background in the ganglion cell (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), even extending to backgrounds at which signaling begins to switch from rods to cones and gain control mechanisms in the cone pathway become active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>). At least five separate gain control mechanisms that contribute to a single smooth function relating background to gain over &gt;5 log units on each axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggest that this particular functional form for adaptation was a target of selective pressure in primate evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adapting to a noisy signal</title><p>Adapting at low backgrounds is inherently dangerous as statistical fluctuations in photon absorption introduce substantial noise into the neural signals accessible to a gain control mechanism; such noise would be expected to cause gain to vary widely. The impact of noise in the signals controlling gain could be mitigated by not adapting until backgrounds increase enough to make more photons available, or by integrating over time and/or rods to reduce noise. Surprisingly, retinal gain controls appear to operate at the lowest backgrounds physically possible—that is, each absorbed photon within the pool of rods providing input to an adaptational mechanism lowers gain.</p><p>Adaptation at the rod bipolar to AII synapse approaches the sensitivity limit imposed by convergence and integration time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). That is, a single absorbed photon reduces the gain of the next single photon response. Rod convergence onto AII amacrine cells is not known precisely in primate, but the onset of adaptation is consistent with a single photon absorption in the AII receptive field reducing gain. Assuming a 0.1 s integration time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), a mechanism operating on a pool of 200 rods would have to reduce gain by 40% for each photon absorbed for the gain to be halved at 0.08 R*/rod/s; a pool of 800 rods could achieve this level of gain control with a 11% gain reduction per photon (see ‘Modeling’).</p><p>Vision in the dark requires high gain of the retinal circuitry conveying rod-mediated signals to ganglion cells. This high gain could easily lead to saturation of retinal signals as backgrounds increase. Indeed, the onset of retinal gain control coincides with the dimmest detectable backgrounds given the intrinsic noise of the rods. These considerations help explain why retinal gain controls are engaged by each absorbed photon, even when adaptation under these conditions is necessarily noisy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recordings and light stimulation</title><p>All recordings were from On parasol ganglion cells in peripheral (eccentricity typically &gt;30°; ∼15° to 20° for the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) primate retina (<italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>, <italic>fascicularis</italic>, and <italic>mulatta</italic>). Retina was obtained through the Tissue Distribution Program of the Regional Primate Center at the University of Washington. The retina was dark adapted for 1 hr while attached to the pigment epithelium and stored for up to 24 hr in a light-tight container at 32°C in Ames solution equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All subsequent procedures were performed under infrared light (&gt;900 nm) using infrared-visible converters.</p><p>For recording, a roughly 4 × 4-mm piece of retina was removed from the pigment epithelium and mounted photoreceptor side down on a polylysine-coated glass coverslip forming the bottom of the recording chamber. The retina was secured by nylon wires stretched across a platinum ring. The retina was continuously superfused (8–10 ml/min) with warmed (32–34°C) Ames solution equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Calibrated light stimuli were delivered from LEDs focused on the retina by the microscope condenser. Spatial stimuli for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref> were delivered using an OLED array (eMagin, Bellevue, WA).

Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made using patch pipettes filled with 105 mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Tris-GTP, and 2 mM QX-314 (pH ∼7.3 with CsOH, ∼280 mOsm). Reported holding voltages have been corrected for the ∼10 mV junction potential associated with this internal solution.

Recordings followed previous procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trong and Rieke, 2008</xref>). We first used cell-attached recordings to test the spike response to a brief flash producing 0.001–0.002 R*/rod, and collected data only from cells that responded to these flashes with an average of 4–5 spikes. During experiments monitoring adaptation across a range of light levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig9">Figures 2, 3 and 9</xref>), we periodically returned to a ‘reference’ background near 0.05 R*/rod/s to check for slow changes in sensitivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figures 10 and 11</xref> illustrate the basic timeline of such experiments for cell-attached recordings of spike responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref>) and whole-cell recordings of excitatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figures 10B and 11B</xref> show the changes in flash strength (gray line and right axes) used to generate near-equal responses across backgrounds.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Eve Marder, Senior editor; Ronald L. Calabrese, Reviewing editor; Marla Feller, peer reviewer.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors describe electrophysiological experiments designed to determine if and how adaptation occurs at the level of ganglion cells at the lowest background light levels in macaque monkeys by recording spike output and EPSCs from parasol ganglion cells in isolated retinae. They show by systematic experiments that retinal adaptation begins at the dimmest detectable backgrounds given the intrinsic noise of the rods. Adaptation occurs rapidly at the level of AII Amacrine cells when as few as 1 or 2 photons are absorbed within a collection of several hundred rods. They successfully compare their experiments to human psychophysical experiments: human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds near 0.01 R*/rod/s, similar to the backgrounds (∼0.02 R*/rod/s) at which macaque ganglion cell thresholds began to increase.</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about your work, found it exciting, and deemed its potential significance for the field quite high. Nonetheless, they felt that the manuscript itself did not do justice to the work, and that it made difficult reading. Therefore, as outlined below, it will require substantial editorial work before potential publication.</p><p>1) A general reader interested in how we see and adapt at low light levels could use a lot more guidance by the authors. For example, Figure 5A could be more colorful and used as a guide in the Introduction. We could be given a succinct summary of relevant retinal circuitry in Introduction. What is provided may not be enough especially without reference to a figure and some explanation of how the signals are transmitted (e.g., excitation inhibition, electrical coupling). Similarly the choice of the On parasol ganglion cell could be better rationalized at the beginning of Results.</p><p>2) The authors should provide clear definitions and use consistent language for describing “gain”, “noise”, and “background” throughout the manuscript.</p><p>* Background: the authors use “background”, “background lights”, or “stimulus” to describe changes in the background illumination. In the text describing Figure 6, this was particularly confusing, using terms like “test patterns”, “probe patterns”, and “adapting stimulus”. The authors should be explicit that changes in background illumination are what they are using for inducing adaptation.</p><p>* Gain: Is it really necessary to use so many measures of gain? Is the “signal gain” plotted in Figure 2A the same as the “gain” in Figure 4? Is the y-axis of Figure 4—figure supplement 1A the same as Figure 4—figure supplement 1B (where the units of the Gain are different, one using /flash and the other rods/sec). How does it differ from “gain factor” in Figure 4B? Why is gain sometimes computed as “Gain slope”? We realize that different definitions are more appropriate for comparing to different models, but it is tough on the reader. In addition, the authors need to make clear that the gain changes in the circuit affect both signal and noise.</p><p>3) The list of “qualitative features of adaptation” was particularly lacking in precise language. “Inhibitory synaptic inputs were small” (how small?), “…did not show obvious structure” (what is meant by “obvious structure”?). We would strongly recommend the author forgo this format for the text and give a clear, quantitative description of the results, and clear definitions of the quantities signal, noise, and gain for both cell attached and whole cell recordings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00467.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We certainly want our work to be broadly accessible, and we appreciate the feedback that the previous version of the paper did not do that. As detailed below we have made major changes to the text and figures. This includes a new Figure 1, reordering several of the other figures, and rewriting substantial parts of the text, including the Introduction.</p><p><italic>1) A general reader interested in how we see and adapt at low light levels could use a lot more guidance by the authors. For example, Figure 5A could be more colorful and used as a guide in the Introduction. We could be given a succinct summary of relevant retinal circuitry in Introduction. What is provided may not be enough especially without reference to a figure and some explanation of how the signals are transmitted (e.g., excitation inhibition, electrical coupling)</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have rewritten the Introduction to be more specific about the circuitry operating under the conditions of our experiments, and what is known from past work about gain control mechanisms operating in this circuitry. As part of that revision we created a new Figure 1 with a more detailed diagram of the retinal circuitry. The diagram and caption include details about the type of synapses and the rod convergence at each location, as well as the location of previously described sites of gain control. We feel that this figure, along with supporting changes in the Introduction, provides a nice graphical introduction to the retinal circuitry and the problem of gain control.</p><p><italic>Similarly the choice of the On parasol ganglion cell could be better rationalized at the beginning of Results</italic>.</p><p>We revised this paragraph to emphasize that the On parasol cells provide a good readout of activity in the rod bipolar pathway. We now specifically make the point that this pathway is shared across ganglion cell types at low light levels, and hence gain control mechanisms located in shared components of the circuit should be conserved across ganglion cell types (as we observed in Midget ganglion cells, as noted in the Discussion). We also now anticipate in the text that the gain control mechanism we identify and characterize is indeed located at a shared location in the rod bipolar pathway. We believe this revised paragraph does a better job at emphasizing the key reasons that we chose to study On parasol cells.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should provide clear definitions and use consistent language for describing “gain”, “noise”, and “background” throughout the manuscript</italic>.</p><p><italic>* Background: the authors use “background”, “background lights”, or “stimulus” to describe changes in the background illumination</italic>.</p><p>Indeed in the original paper we used these terms inconsistently. We have fixed this in the revised version. “Background” is now used consistently and terms such as “mean light level”, “mean luminance”, and “mean stimulus” have been removed in favor of “background”. Similarly, we have consistently used “gain control” in place of adaptation, since it more directly relates to the measures of response gain shown throughout the results.</p><p><italic>In the text describing Figure 6, this was particularly confusing, using terms like “test patterns”, “probe patterns”, and “adapting stimulus”. The authors should be explicit that changes in background illumination are what they are using for inducing adaptation</italic>.</p><p>Figure 7 (previous Figure 6) has been substantially revised (new panels A and B) along with the text describing the logic behind the experiment. Terminology in the text now directly references elements of Figure 7A and B. We have also made the terminology used to describe this experiment more consistent with the rest of the Results section. We hope these changes clarify the logic behind the experiment and interpretation of the results.</p><p><italic>* Gain: Is it really necessary to use so many measures of gain? Is the “signal gain” plotted in Figure 2A the same as the “gain” in Figure 4? Is the y-axis of Figure 4—figure supplement 1A the same as Figure 4—figure supplement 1B (where the units of the Gain are different, one using /flash and the other rods/sec). How does it differ from “gain factor” in Figure 4B? Why is gain sometimes computed as “Gain slope”? We realize that different definitions are more appropriate for comparing to different models, but it is tough on the reader. In addition, the authors need to make clear that the gain changes in the circuit affect both signal and noise</italic>.</p><p>Thanks very much for this suggestion. Many of the inconsistencies were oversights on our part rather than different analyses or measures. All figures now use either gain in appropriate units (nC/R*/rod for excitatory input currents or spikes/R*/rod for spike signals), or a normalized value, “gain (norm.),” if comparing across conditions where relative gain values are more appropriate than absolute values. Gain is clearly defined when it first comes up in the Results. We have replaced “gain slope” with “slope,” and we explain that this slope on a log-log plot is equivalent to “the exponent describing the dependence of gain on background” in the third paragraph of the section, “Dependence of gain and noise on background”. Also, the term “signal gain” has been removed as it was indeed confusing since signal and noise are both affected.</p><p><italic>3) The list of “qualitative features of adaptation” was particularly lacking in precise language. “Inhibitory synaptic inputs were small” (how small?), “…did not show obvious structure” (what is meant by “obvious structure”?). We would strongly recommend the author forgo this format for the text and give a clear, quantitative description of the results, and clear definitions of the quantities signal, noise, and gain for both cell attached and whole cell recordings</italic>.</p><p>Obviously our original approach to introducing the results did not work well. As suggested, we removed the “qualitative features” section and replaced it with a quantitative description of the results. In making this change, we moved Figure 1 from the previous draft into the Methods section and replaced it with a simpler figure (new Figure 2) showing raw data for excitatory input currents and spikes in the same cell, and quantifying the similarity of the spike response and excitatory input. This enabled us to introduce “noise” with a precise definition in the next figure (Figure 3) after an initial characterization of the change in gain.</p></body></sub-article></article>
