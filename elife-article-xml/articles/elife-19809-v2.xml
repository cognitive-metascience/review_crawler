proteins within the brain. Elevated levels of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) appear to drive neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease (PD); neuronal accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); and their increased levels cause neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms. Despite the clinical differences between AD and PD, several lines of evidence suggest that α-Syn and tau overlap pathologically. The connections between α-Syn and tau led us to ask whether these proteins might be regulated through a shared pathway. We therefore screened for genes that affect post-translational levels of α-Syn and tau. We found that TRIM28 regulates α-Syn and tau levels and that its reduction rescues toxicity in animal models of tau- and α-Syn-mediated degeneration. TRIM28 stabilizes and promotes the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both proteins. Intersecting screens across comorbid proteinopathies thus reveal shared mechanisms and therapeutic entry points.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19809.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19809.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19809.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Behind many neurodegenerative diseases are specific proteins that abnormally accumulate inside neurons and damage the cells. In Parkinson’s disease, the protein alpha-synuclein accumulates; in Alzheimer’s disease, the protein tau is one of the toxic culprits; and in other neurodegenerative diseases, alpha-synuclein and tau both accumulate. Genetic studies suggest that accumulation of the two proteins may be linked, but little is known about the factors that regulate the levels of these proteins inside neurons.</p><p>Rousseaux et al. set out to identify how these proteins are regulated in the hope of finding new ways of targeting them and reducing their toxicity. Screening a subset of human genes led to one that encodes a protein called TRIM28, which regulates the levels of both alpha-synuclein and tau. When the TRIM28 protein was depleted in human and mouse cells, the levels of alpha-synuclein and tau also went down. This effect was specific because the levels of other proteins with the potential to cause neurodegeneration remained unaffected.</p><p>Models of neurodegenerative disease in fruit flies and mice were then used to explore how TRIM28 affects the levels of tau and alpha-synuclein in animals. In each case, the proteins’ levels dropped when TRIM28 was suppressed and this in turn protected the neurons from damage. Rousseaux et al. went on to show that TRIM28 affected how alpha-synuclein and tau were cleared in cells. Overexpressing TRIM28 revealed that it could encourage both alpha-synuclein and tau to accumulate in the nucleus of cells over time.</p><p>Finally, Rousseaux et al. compared post-mortem brain tissue from people who had neurodegenerative conditions that are driven by or associated with tau and alpha-synuclein with tissue from those who did not. The cell nuclei in the diseased tissue had much more TRIM28 associated with alpha-synuclein and tau than those in the healthy tissues.</p><p>Overall, the findings show that TRIM28 promotes the accumulation and damaging effects of both alpha-synuclein and tau. The next steps will be to understand how TRIM28 does this. It will also be important to determine if this effect can be targeted, whilst leaving others roles of TRIM28 intact, in order to explore it as a potential target to treat or prevent neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19809.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19809.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>synucleinopathies</kwd><kwd>tauopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201210MFE-290072-173743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rousseaux</surname><given-names>Maxime WC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K22NS092688-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lasagna-Reeves</surname><given-names>Cristian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R01 NS027699-25S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lasagna-Reeves</surname><given-names>Cristian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 NS38377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Troncoso</surname><given-names>Juan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 AG05146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Troncoso</surname><given-names>Juan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

As research on these ‘proteinopathies’ has progressed, certain unexpected commonalities have arisen. For example, alpha-synuclein (α-Syn, <italic>SNCA</italic>) is now thought to mediate neurotoxicity not only in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but also in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) where it accumulates in Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, the microtubule associated protein tau (<italic>MAPT</italic>) accumulates not only in neurons affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but in PD and PDD, while mutations that increase the stability of tau result in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FTDP-17 (or FTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spillantini and Goedert, 2013</xref>]). Coding region mutations in <italic>SNCA</italic> are by no means necessary for PD to develop given that duplication or triplication of the <italic>SNCA</italic> locus is sufficient to result in forms of PD whose onset and severity correlate with gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ibanez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singleton, 2003</xref>). Supporting these clinical findings are studies that show that overexpression of wild-type forms of either <italic>SNCA</italic> or <italic>MAPT</italic> elicit neurodegeneration in model organisms, whereas suppressing their levels appears to be neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishihara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rapoport et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rockenstein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wittmann, 2001</xref>). Given the brain’s sensitivity to the dosage of either of these proteins, one would expect elevated levels of multiple proteins to be even more problematic, and this proves to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pathogenic proteins involved in different proteionopathies often interact with each other and cause cellular toxicity, either due to their additive effects on downstream activities or further compromise of protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clinton et al., 2010</xref>). Abnormally aggregated α-Syn and tau are often found together in postmortem cases of PD and LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colom-Cadena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iseki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishizawa et al., 2003</xref>), and genetic interaction studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrate that α-Syn and tau synergize in promoting toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy and Jackson, 2014</xref>). Biochemical evidence even suggests that α-Syn may act as an amyloidogenic ‘seed’ for the accumulation of tau, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sengupta et al., 2015</xref>). Even more, several genome-wide association studies have reported genetic interaction between tau and alpha-synuclein in PD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simón-Sánchez et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the interaction between tau and α-synuclein is gaining increased attention for its possible pathogenic role in synucleinopathies and tauopathies. The mechanisms governing the dual accumulation of α-Syn and tau remain elusive, but it seems plausible that decreasing levels of either or both of these proteins could prove an effective therapeutic strategy for this family of diseases.</p><p>Inspired by the extensive overlap between α-Syn and tau pathology and their corresponding clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galpern and Lang, 2006</xref>), we reasoned that they may be regulated through shared pathways and that dysfunction of these regulatory pathways may lead to their pathogenic accumulation. Therefore, convergent screens to find common modulators for α-Syn and tau levels would yield the most insight into these disease processes and possibly open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, targeting the root cause of the disease – protein accumulation – in an unbiased manner makes neither assumption about the mechanism of toxicity nor which cellular process is affected. Through convergent RNAi screens targeting the steady-state levels of α-Syn and tau, we found that TRIM28 regulates their levels and toxicity through their toxic nuclear accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRIM28 is a key regulator of α-Syn and tau levels</title><p>We employed a screening strategy similar to one recently used to identify key modulators of ATXN1 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westbrook et al., 2008</xref>), using high-throughput flow cytometry to monitor the steady-state levels of α-Syn and tau in a fluorescent bicistronic reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We ran parallel screens interrogating 2607 siRNAs targeting 869 potentially druggable – i.e. potentially can be targeted pharmacologically – genes to identify genes that modify the levels of both α-Syn and tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Applying stringent criteria and validation steps to narrow down the list of putative modifiers of α-Syn and tau levels, we uncovered Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) as the most robust common modulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

We were particularly intrigued to find pathological, phosphorylated, forms of α-Syn (S129) and tau (S396) accumulating at this earlier stage. Given the efficacy of TRIM28 at tightly regulating the levels of α-Syn and tau in a post-translational manner, we reasoned that TRIM28 was likely stabilizing these proteins therefore promoting their toxic accumulation. To test this, we generated doxycycline-inducible cell lines where we could carefully assess the half-lives of α-Syn and tau without altering global protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meerbrey et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, we cloned wild-type α-Syn and tau into doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vectors (pINDUCER system), infected SH-SY5Y cells and selected for clones that stably express either α-Syn or tau upon induction. We found that the half-lives of α-Syn and tau (measured following a 48 hr pulse of doxycycline) in this system resembled those previously observed by others (23.3 hr for α-Syn and 28.1 hr for tau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Min et al., 2010</xref>]).

We asked whether TRIM28 modulates α-Syn and tau by forming a complex with them and found that they did indeed interact, albeit weakly, in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also used an alternative approach to confirm our findings: Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We generated stable cell lines expressing N-terminal YFP tagged versions of α-Syn and tau (nYFP-α-Syn and nYFP-tau). By themselves, the cell lines did not generate any fluorescence (data not shown) but when a known interactor of each (in this case, tau) was co-transfected as a prey, we could elicit a strong fluorescent signal (tested by flow cytometry). We found that using TRIM28 as a prey could elicit a signal roughly eight times lower than that of tau thus confirming the transiency of the interaction. Intriguingly, TRIM28:α-Syn and TRIM28:tau complexes accumulated in nuclei after some time. To confirm that this effect was not an artifact of the BiFC approach, we overexpressed a mCherry-fused TRIM28 lentiviral construct in primary cerebellar granule neurons and looked at the endogenous localization of α-Syn and tau. Again, both by immunofluorescence and by biochemical fractionation, we found that viral expression of TRIM28 dramatically promoted the nuclear accumulation of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given our previous data suggesting that the effects of TRIM28 on α-Syn and tau are posttranslational, we explored whether the RING domain of TRIM28 might play a role in its modulatory effect. To this end, we focused on the known E3-ligase catalytic activity of TRIM28. We overexpressed an inactive TRIM28 E3 ligase mutant ([C65A/C68A], ‘<italic>TRIM28-Mut</italic>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 2010</xref>) and found that this mutant could no longer promote the toxic nuclear accumulation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found that the TRIM28 E3 ligase mutant, while less stable, could still bind α-Syn and tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that its effect on α-Syn and tau nuclear accumulation is functionally, rather than structurally, driven. Taken together, TRIM28 governs the nuclear accumulation of α-Syn and tau through its E3-ligase domain, and its persistent expression aggravates the neuropathology of both proteins.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19809.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TRIM28 binds to and drives the nuclear localization of α-Syn and tau.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoprecipitation for endogenous α-Syn (top panel) and tau (bottom panel) from HEK293T cells showing the interaction between the former proteins and TRIM28.

Although accumulating evidence suggests that α-Syn and tau pathology propagate from cell to cell, the exact mechanism driving their initial accumulation and toxicity remains unclear. Given that both α-Syn and tau accumulate in Parkinson Disease Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sengupta et al., 2015</xref>), we rationalized that there must be some proteins that regulate both of them. Thus, when screening for posttranslational regulators that modulate the levels of each protein, we were most interested in regulators that can modify the levels of both α-Syn and tau. Through such convergent screens, we found that TRIM28 regulates the levels of both disease-driving proteins. Our finding that TRIM28 regulates α-Syn and tau by promoting their nuclear localization and accumulation dovetails nicely with studies indicating that altered cellular distribution of α-Syn and tau contributes to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that mislocalization or missorting of α-Syn and tau as a result of mutations, post-translational modification or overexpression, rather than their respective aggregation in the form of Lewy bodies and NFTs, are what promotes neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frandemiche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, α-Syn is much more toxic in a fly model of synucleinopathy when it is tagged with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</xref>). Further, PD-causing mutations in α-Syn increase its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, postmortem studies of tissue from AD and Huntington disease patients indicate that misfolded tau accumulates in the nucleus of neurons in the form of rod-like deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vuono et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that TRIM28 drives the nuclear accumulation of α-Syn and tau provides new mechanistic insight into the steps that lead to the pathogenicity of these proteins and highlights a shared pathway for therapeutic targeting.</p><p>The molecular mechanism through which TRIM28 stabilizes and mediates the nuclear localization of α-Syn and tau is not elucidated at this point. Indeed, it is possible that TRIM28 mediates its effects on α-Syn and tau indirectly through a yet undiscovered mediator, through epigenetic remodeling or indirect binding and/or modification of an intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng, 2014</xref>). However, the evidence we present suggests that this less likely of a mechanism. For instance, we show that TRIM28 does not affect the RNA of α-Syn and tau but rather their protein stability. Moreover, we show that TRIM28 can form a complex with the two proteins and that its effect on nuclear accumulation is mediated via its E3-ligase domain. This would therefore suggest that TRIM28 may mediate this effect through SUMOylation or ubiquitination. Since SUMOylation has previously been suggested to mediate the nuclear localization of certain proteins, we hypothesize that TRIM28 acting as a SUMO ligase for α-Syn and tau. Future studies will dissect such a mechanism through the use of genetically engineered mice that permit monitoring of either modification in vivo.</p><p>In the present study, we found that TRIM28 has important post-transcriptional functions in the brain. While the <italic>Trim28</italic> null mice are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cammas et al., 2000</xref>), we found that the <italic>Trim28<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice looked and behaved normally and that 50% loss of Trim28 was sufficient to reduce α-Syn and tau and ameliorate toxicity. This finding is particularly encouraging when it comes to therapeutics as it suggests that only partially inhibiting TRIM28 function may be effective at blocking neurotoxicity. Moreover, having discovered that mutating the E3 ligase catalytic activity of TRIM28 effectively is sufficient to regulate α-Syn and tau levels and for this specific effect behaves like a null allele, narrows down a target domain within TRIM28 for inhibition. This finding sets the stage for future studies to dissect the native function of the E3 ligase domain of TRIM28 versus its other essential domains and provides a potential opportunity for targeting TRIM28 as a source of therapy for these debilitating disorders.</p><p>The unusual accumulation of TRIM28 in cases of synucleinopathy and tauopathy was a curious finding, though it remains solely an observation of correlative nature at this point. While we found that both α-Syn and tau co-localized with TRIM28 in the nucleus in cases of PD and AD, respectively, it was also interesting to find that TRIM28 accumulated in the insoluble biochemical fractions from post-mortem tissue. Moreover, though TRIM28 accumulation occurs in both diseases, irrespective of the driving pathological protein, α-Syn and tau appeared to more selectively accumulate in the nucleus in the context of their respective disease. Teasing out the precise mechanisms that affect TRIM28 accumulation as well as α-Syn and tau nuclear localization in human tissue will provide additional context for the understanding of disease pathogenesis.</p><p>We posit two potential mechanisms through which deregulated TRIM28 activity could promote neurodegeneration. By driving α-Syn and tau to the nucleus, TRIM28 could: (1) prevent their degradation by native quality control mechanisms, thereby enhancing their overall bioavailability and toxicity (a passive mechanism); or (2) allow for a toxic gain of function in the nucleus (an active mechanism) (model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Though some studies have suggested various roles for α-Syn and tau in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Nogales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sultan et al., 2011</xref>), careful studies testing the kinetics and the outcome of this nuclear build-up will surely shed light on disease pathogenesis.</p><p>As the sensitivity of the brain to protein levels becomes clearer, and more neurodegenerative diseases are found to involve elevated levels of more than one protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramanan and Saykin, 2013</xref>), it will become more important to identify shared modifiers and regulatory mechanisms of the steady-state levels of disease proteins, both to understand pathogenesis and to find the best candidate targets for therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>α-Syn, alpha-synuclein; AD, Alzheimer disease; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; CA1, Cornu Ammonis 1; ‘C’ or CONTRA, contralateral; cDNA, complementary DNA; DsRed, Discosoma red fluorescent protein; DMEM, dulbecco’s modified eagle medium; DOX, Doxycycline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescent activated cell sorting; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FTD, Frontal Temporal Dementia; GFAP, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HTS, high throughput sampler; ‘I’ or IPSI, ipsilateral; IP, immunoprecipitation; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; LBD, Lewy Body Demetia; LV, Lentivirus; Mut, mutant; PD, Parkinson disease; PDD, Parkinson disease with dementia; PFA, paraformaldehyde; RNAi, ribonucleic acid interference; PSP, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; RIPA, Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (buffer); RRE, Rev response element; siRNA, small interfering ribonucleic acid; shRNA, short hairpin ribonucleic acid; SNc, substantia nigra <italic>pars compacta</italic>; SUMO, Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TU, Transducing units; TRIM28, Tripartite Motif Containing 28; UBC9, Ubiquitin carrier protein 9; and VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus-G.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Antibodies, shRNAs, plasmids and primers</title><p>The collection of antibodies (and their concentrations), shRNAs (and their sequences), Plasmids (and their construction) as well as qRT-PCR primers used are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virus generation, concentration and infection</title><p>Lentiviral vectors (pHAGE, L302, LV-mCherry, pGIPz or pZip) and their respective packaging vectors (VSVG, Rev and RRE for L302; psPAX2 and pMD2G for LV-mCherry, pGIPz and pZip) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells in a 1:1:1:1 or 4:3:1 molar ratio, respectively.

Briefly, each construct was cloned into a pHAGE vector, packaged into lentiviruses and infected into Daoy cells at low multiplicity of infection (0.3) to promote single copy integration. Cells were then selected by puromycin (1 µg/mL) and single clonal populations were obtained using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using an Aria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and sorting a single double-positive (DsRed and EGFP) cell per well.

Gates for analysis were set using single-positive and double-positive cells as well as negative cells. For the RNAi Screens, DsRed-IRES-α-Syn:GFP or DsRed-IRES-tau:EGFP cells were plated onto 96-well round bottom plates. For each RNAi plate, cells were plated in triplicate to assay for technical variance. The following day, individual siRNAs were transfected as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>) and incubated for 72 hr for downstream flow cytometry analysis. For each plate tested, <italic>Z</italic>-Scores were calculated by comparing each sample to the plate mean. A cut-off <italic>Z</italic>-Score of 1.5 was set in either direction for a first pass of hits. Next, individual t-tests were performed on hits by comparing them to the average of three scrambled siRNA sequences (with Low-, Medium-, and High GC content) to control for variability between triplicates. Hits meeting a p-value cut-off of &lt;0.05 were kept for downstream analysis.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TRIM28 regulates the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both α-synuclein and tau&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a shRNA screen, Rousseaux et al. identify TRIM28 as a regulator of α-synuclein and tau, two proteins involved in neurodegeneration. The authors' data suggests that deceasing levels of TRIM28 decreases levels of these two proteins and their toxicity, and conversely increasing levels has the opposite consequences. The authors go on to further investigate the role of TRIM28 on the intracellular localization of synuclein and tau, potential physical interactions, and potential effects of TRIM28 on the half-lives of these proteins. Overall the manuscript presents interesting and novel data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In several places the addition of experimental details would greatly enhance the readability of the manuscript. Several places where details would help are listed in individual reviews.</p><p>2) The authors show data that TRIM28 acts on synuclein and tau stabilization. However, there is much literature on other functions of TRIM28 in gene regulation and epigenetic control. Data from experiments described in this manuscript could be consistent with an indirect function of TRIM28 on synuclein and tau. This should be acknowledged and commented on.</p><p>3) The half-life experiment examining TRIM28's effect on synuclein and tau should examine transcript levels of these genes in this experiment (and in experiments utilizing primary neurons or transgenic mouse brains). Since vinculin is used as a control, it's half-life should also be described. Also how do the author's rule out that translational changes (that do not have to do with protein half-life) are not affected by TRIM28.</p><p>4) In terms of determining whether the ligase activity of TRIM28 is necessary for nuclear localization of tau and synuclein the authors examine mutant TRIM28. These results need to be interpreted in light of whether the mutant protein still interacts with tau and synuclein.</p><p>5) Finally, the authors suggest that changes in TRIM28 levels and localization may be a &quot;driving force&quot; in nuclear accumulation of synuclein and tau. However, the reviewers suggest that this data does not suggest causality. Additional important questions regarding this experiments (see Reviewer 2 comments) should be addressed and the conclusions from TRIM28 localization changes in diseased human brain need to be reinterpreted in light of reviewer's comments.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In a shRNA screen Rousseaux et al. found that TRIM28 regulate the localization of α-synuclein and tau. Further, the authors demonstrated that TRIM28 regulates the toxicity of these proteins in both the fly eye and mouse brain. Although the manuscript fails to elucidate mechanism, given that α-synuclein and tau are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, these findings are of interest to the neurodegeneration field. However additional data would strengthen the authors' findings. For example, the authors have obtained a conditional allele of Trim 28, what is the effect of complete deletion on the pathology associated with α-synuclein or tau expression.

Using a number of in vitro and in vivo models the authors convincingly show that knock-down of TRIM28 is sufficient to reduce α-Synuclein and Tau levels and their associated neurotoxicity. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM28 increases α-Synuclein and Tau half-lives, and accordingly further exacerbates their neurotoxicity in vivo. Overall the authors are commended for very nicely executed, elegant experiments particularly in vitro and in the animal models and this work is of sufficient novelty and interest for a broad audience in the neurodegenerative disease field.</p><p>That being said, we have reservations regarding the interpretation of the patient data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>, where the authors conclude that aberrant TRIM28 underlie disease pathologies. Overall, looking at the biochemical data we do not see a clear increase in overall TRIM28 levels under disease conditions. The authors indeed find a statistically significant shift of TRIM28 to the insoluble form in these conditions, but we wonder how TRIM28 could participate in actively bringing α-Synuclein/Tau into the nucleus if it's bound up in aggregates, presumable inactive. By staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the nuclear localization of TRIM28 in both control and disease patient brain also makes us wonder how TRIM28 would access these cytosolic proteins to bring them into the nucleus. Moreover, when looking at individual human samples in the biochemistry provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, there is no clear correlation between TRIM28 levels and α-Synuclein/Tau levels; For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, Panel C, right, the up/down levels of TRIM28 in the insoluble fraction does not correlate with the increase/decrease of phospho-Tau levels of the same patient. Perhaps in an earlier disease stage the data would make more sense. Overall it seems the human data is not as black-and-white as the more conclusive animal model data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and the manuscript should be modified to make the conclusions more modest.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors report the results of a focused genetic screen looking for genes that co-regulate levels of tau and synuclein, proteins that contribute to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and the identification of TRIM28. Decreasing levels of TRIM28 decreases tau and synuclein levels and toxicity, while overexpression has the opposite effect. The focus is on possible direct physical interactions that might mediate localization of tau and synuclein to the nucleus. Overall the findings are interesting and novel.</p><p>1) The authors tested changes in levels of other degeneration-causing proteins and did not see any change. They conclude that TRIM28 is likely to be a key postranslational regulator of tau and synuclein. However, the list of proteins tested is small. There is a rather large literature on TRIM28 and its roles in multiple cellular processes. TRIM28 has also been shown to be a global regulator of many aspects of gene regulation and epigenitic control. I would encourage the authors to consider and comment on these activities and the possibility that effects on tau and synuclein might have an indirect component.</p><p>2) The authors may want to define the term &quot;druggable&quot;, as the definition may be different depending on the investigator.</p><p>3) For the fly experiments involving tau overexpression in the eye, it would be useful to know that there are no effects on other GMR promoter-dependent phenotypes. This would act as a stand in for changes in transcriptional regulation. The climbing assay has similar issues in that a specific promoter is being used and TRIM28 is known to have effects on transcriptional regulation.</p><p>4) Next, they moved to mice overexpressing synuclein in dopaminergic neurons. This experiment has a nice control in that there is a GFP included as an IRES element. This figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) shows that while GFP levels remain constant, synuclein levels decrease. Importantly, the number of TH positive neurons decreases in the presence of synuclein, and this is reversed following RNAi of TRIM28. These observations also are consistent with a direct mode of action, but probably do not exclude indirect modes of action through intermediate proteins. Again, I think the authors should acknowledge this possibility.</p><p>5) Finally, the authors used a TRIM28 heterozygote to look for dose-dependent effects on phosphorylated synuclein. Can they comment on why this assay was used as opposed to that in the above panels? Is this simply more sensitive? Does it reflect a particular pathology? If so, can they provide a reference for this biology?</p><p>6) The authors did a half-life experiment suggesting that TRIM28 expression stabilizes synuclein and tau. It would be important to show that other proteins are not stabilized, and to know what Vinculin's half-life is in order for it to be a useful control. For example, if its half-life is very long, its levels would not change much even if it was being affected. Can the authors rule out effects on translation from existing transcripts? I just point this out because if translation is not inhibited (there is no evidence that cyclohexamide was used to block translation in the half life experiments), there could be effects on protein abundance over time that are translational, and would otherwise be scored as alterations in protein half-life.</p><p>7) The authors asked if TRIM28's ligase activity is required for nuclear localization of tau and synuclein. They did this by expressing a mutant version of TRIM28 that has two cysteine mutations in the ring domain. As these cysteines play a structural role in the ring domain, these mutations could disrupt the overall folding/conformation of this domain. It is important to determine if mutant versions of TRIM28 still interacts with tau and synuclein. This would be an important experiment to distinguish between ligase-dependent mechanisms of regulation versus physical binding and recruitment to the nuclear compartment. If binding is lost it would be difficult to conclude more than that interactions are important.</p><p>8) The authors saw increased levels of TRIM28 in an insoluble fraction in human disease brains and that tau and synuclein were enriched in nuclei. From this they suggested that &quot;The aberrant change in TRIM28 levels and distribution could therefore be a driving force in the nuclear accumulation of α-Syn and tau. &quot; To test this they look for colocalization of TRIM28 in nuclei of disease brains and see significantly more cells that have colocalization of synuclein, tau and TRIM28 than in controls. This result is interesting. But could it just be that TRIM28 becomes trapped in insoluble nuclear complexes with synuclein and tau in disease brains? I am not sure I see a link that is necessarily causal. Can the authors discuss why an increase in number of nuclei with TRIM28, synuclein and tau should be taken to indicate that TRIM28 is driving the process rather than being carried along for the ride as an interacting protein?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19809.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In several places the addition of experimental details would greatly enhance the readability of the manuscript.

However, there is much literature on other functions of TRIM28 in gene regulation and epigenetic control. Data from experiments described in this manuscript could be consistent with an indirect function of TRIM28 on synuclein and tau. This should be acknowledged and commented on.</italic></p><p>We now acknowledge and comment on a putative indirect mechanism in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) The half-life experiment examining TRIM28's effect on synuclein and tau should examine transcript levels of these genes in this experiment (and in experiments utilizing primary neurons or transgenic mouse brains). Since vinculin is used as a control, it's half-life should also be described. Also how do the author's rule out that translational changes (that do not have to do with protein half-life) are not affected by TRIM28.</italic> </p><p>We repeated the stability assay and monitored levels of <italic>SNCA</italic> and <italic>MAPT</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that TRIM28 overexpression does not alter RNA decay kinetics thus suggesting that TRIM28 acts post-translationally on protein stability. While we did not test the effect of TRIM28 overexpression on <italic>Snca</italic> and <italic>Mapt</italic> in primary neurons, we have looked at their transcripts in mice lacking a copy of Trim28 and do not see any changes in their transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>, lower panel) suggesting again that TRIM28 acts on the protein levels of α-Syn and tau, not their DNA or RNA. Moreover, we wish to clarify that, since this is a doxycycline-inducible system (and not a cycloheximide assay) we only affect the expression of α-Syn and tau under the control of a doxycycline-inducible element, therefore vinculin levels (and total protein levels for that matter) do not change during the time course.</p><p><italic>4) In terms of determining whether the ligase activity of TRIM28 is necessary for nuclear localization of tau and synuclein the authors examine mutant TRIM28. These results need to be interpreted in light of whether the mutant protein still interacts with tau and synuclein.</italic> </p><p>We tested the binding affinity of α-Syn and tau for TRIM28 in the context of this E3-ligase mutant and found that, while TRIM28 E3-ligase mutant was itself less stable (as previously noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), its binding to α-Syn and tau was not abolished. This suggests that the loss of nuclear localization seen when comparing TRIM28-WT to TRIM28-Mut is at least partly due to a loss of function in addition to this structure disruption. These results are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Finally, the authors suggest that changes in TRIM28 levels and localization may be a &quot;driving force&quot; in nuclear accumulation of synuclein and tau. However, the reviewers suggest that this data does not suggest causality. Additional important questions regarding this experiments (see Reviewer 2 comments) should be addressed and the conclusions from TRIM28 localization changes in diseased human brain need to be reinterpreted in light of reviewer's comments.</italic> </p><p>We agree that human data from post mortem tissue rarely suggests causality (as it is just a snapshot of time, little can be definitively concluded) and have thus toned down the interpretation in the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In a shRNA screen Rousseaux et al. found that TRIM28 regulate the localization of α-synuclein and tau. Further, the authors demonstrated that TRIM28 regulates the toxicity of these proteins in both the fly eye and mouse brain. Although the manuscript fails to elucidate mechanism, given that α-synuclein and tau are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, these findings are of interest to the neurodegeneration field. However additional data would strengthen the authors' findings. For example, the authors have obtained a conditional allele of Trim 28, what is the effect of complete deletion on the pathology associated with α-synuclein or tau expression. Does deletion of Trim28 have additional actions on the transcriptional profile that could secondarily affect stability of α-synuclein and tau?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive feedback. Given that complete deletion of TRIM28 is embryonic lethal, we employed Trim28 heterozygous mice as a model to genetically control for TRIM28 levels. Although conditional null mice have transcriptional changes (Jakobsson et al., 2008), we suspect that a heterozygous mouse should have much less effects on global transcriptional changes, though we cannot rule this out without performing a large scale profiling experiment on the brain which is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Using a Dox inducible cell line of α-synuclein and tau, the authors suggest that Trim 28 changes the stability of these proteins.
