The centriolar protein Cp110 is a regulator of this process and cilia inhibitor, but its positive roles in ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> we show that Cp110 inhibits cilia formation at high levels, while optimal levels promote ciliogenesis. Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and rootlets, and is required for ciliary adhesion complexes that facilitate Actin interactions. The opposing roles of Cp110 in ciliation are generated in part by coiled-coil domains that mediate preferential binding to centrioles over rootlets. Because of its dual role in ciliogenesis, Cp110 levels must be precisely controlled. In multiciliated cells, this is achieved by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation through ciliary transcription factors and microRNAs, which activate and repress <italic>cp110</italic> to produce optimal Cp110 levels during ciliogenesis. Our data provide novel insights into how Cp110 and its regulation contribute to development and cell function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17557.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17557.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>mucociliary epithelia</kwd><kwd>miR-34</kwd><kwd>miR-449</kwd><kwd>Foxj1</kwd><kwd>RFX2</kwd><kwd>MCIDAS</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wa 3365/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walentek</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HL127275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walentek</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM42341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harland</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM076507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kintner</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>At optimal concentrations, the ciliary inhibitor Cp110 promotes ciliogenesis by localization to previously uncharacterized sites at the basal body, where it recruits ciliary adhesion complexes that mediate basal body interaction with F-actin networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia are membrane-covered cell protrusions containing an axoneme of microtubules. Modified centrioles, called basal bodies, dock to the cell membrane, serve as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) during cilia formation and anchor cilia to the membrane as well as to the Actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall, 2008</xref>). Because centrioles also act as MTOCs during spindle formation, cell division and cilia formation are mutually exclusive events. Thus, switching from cell division to cilia formation needs precise molecular regulation at the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avidor-Reiss and Gopalakrishnan, 2013</xref>). One key event during this process is the removal of the Centriolar Coiled Coil Protein 110kDa (Cp110) from the distal end of the mother centriole, which then matures into a basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Failure of distal end removal or excess cellular levels of Cp110 prevent cilia formation in various cell types. Conversely, loss of Cp110 was suggested to initiate aberrant cilia formation during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>). Of note, some studies indicate that <italic>Cp110</italic> knockdown initiates elongation of cytoplasmic centrioles, rather than <italic>bona fide</italic> cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work, we demonstrated that Cp110 also inhibits cilia formation in multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) of mucociliary epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2014</xref>). MCCs can form &gt;100 basal bodies, and their biogenesis occurs through an alternative, MCC-specific deuterosome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang and Mitchell, 2015</xref>). MCC cilia are motile and account for the generation of directional extracellular fluid flow along epithelia, such as that required for mucus clearance from the conducting airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mall, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, while Cp110 levels are mainly regulated via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Angiolella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>), Cp110 levels in differentiated MCCs are also subject to post-transcriptional repression by microRNAs (miRs) from the <italic>miR-34/449</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found that loss of Cp110 inhibits cilia formation in MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a more complex, and supportive role for Cp110 in ciliogenesis than previously anticipated. A recent report further supports this view, as deletion of <italic>Cp110</italic> exon 5 impairs primary cilia formation in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, whose epidermis provides a readily accessible model to study MCCs of mucociliary epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Werner and Mitchell, 2012</xref>), as well as other mono-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schweickert and Feistel, 2015</xref>). We show that Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and is required for the formation and function of all principal types of cilia (i.e. primary sensory cilia, motile mono-cilia and motile cilia of MCCs). In MCCs, Cp110 is specifically needed for ciliary adhesion complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>) formation and basal body interactions with the Actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cp110's opposing roles in ciliogenesis are determined by its multi-domain protein structure. Due to its dual role, optimal Cp110 levels need to be produced to facilitate multi-ciliogenesis. We provide evidence, that optimal regulation of cellular Cp110 levels in MCCs is achieved through a transcriptional/post-transcriptional gene regulatory module, consisting of ciliary transcription factors and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marcet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chevalier et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cp110 is required for ciliogenesis at the level of basal body function</title><p>To elucidate the effects of <italic>cp110</italic> knockdown on MCC ciliogenesis in detail, we investigated mucociliary clearance and motile cilia function in vivo. Extracellular fluid flow was analyzed by high-speed microscopy and particle tracking of fluorescent beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">WalentekÂ etÂ al., 2014</xref>).

While control MCCs showed basal bodies interspersed into a dense Actin network at the apical membrane, apical Actin formation was disrupted in Cp110-deficient MCCs and a large portion of basal bodies remained deep in the cytoplasm, indicating deficient apical transport of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâD</xref>). Loss of basal body transport is predicted to prevent basal body apical docking, alignment, as well as cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall, 2008</xref>).

GRP cells were more sensitive to <italic>gfp-cp110</italic> overexpression, possibly because of the limited number of centrioles/basal bodies as compared to MCCs. This led to another interesting observation: GFP-Cp110 basal body levels inversely correlated with GRP cilia length, i.e. high expression levels inhibited cilia, intermediate levels caused shorter cilia, and low levels permitted normal cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). This implies that, in contrast to previous reports, Cp110 might play a role in ciliary length control. Our hypothesis was further supported by the observation that Cp110 can localize to ciliary tips in some GRP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).

Furthermore, GFP-Cep97 was not able to suppress cilia formation in MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D</xref>).

The same types of localization patterns were reported for ciliary adhesion complex components, Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), Vinculin and Paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>). In MCCs, these are required for basal body binding to F-actin. Furthermore, loss of Cp110 phenocopied loss of FAK in <italic>Xenopus</italic> MCCs. We therefore explored whether Cp110 might be required for ciliary adhesion complex formation or function.</p><p>First, we analyzed localization of Cp110 and FAK in <italic>Xenopus</italic> MCCs.

In control MCCs, FAK-GFP normally accumulated at basal bodies and rootlets, and this localization was strongly reduced in Cp110-deficient MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Higher magnification revealed residual FAK-GFP levels at basal bodies in <italic>cp110</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which was further confirmed by analyzing the ratio of fluorescent intensity of FAK-GFP/Centrin4-CFP: on average, FAK-GFP levels were reduced to about 30% in Cp110-deficient MCCs as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We also addressed whether other ciliary adhesion components were affected by Cp110 depletion. As with FAK-GFP, both Vinculin-GFP and Paxillin-GFP levels were strongly reduced in <italic>cp110</italic> morphant basal bodies and rootlets, and Vinculin-GFP was also reduced at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2AâDs</xref>). Ciliary adhesion components appeared to be more dramatically reduced at rootlets than at basal bodies. To confirm that loss of ciliary adhesions was not primarily caused by a loss of the rootlet, we analyzed FAK-GFP localization in <italic>cp110</italic> morphants which were triple-injected with <italic>centrin4-cfp</italic>, the rootlet marker <italic>clamp-rfp</italic> and <italic>FAK-gfp</italic>. These experiments confirmed strong reduction of FAK-GFP from basal bodies and rootlets, while Centrin4-CFP and Clamp-RFP were still present, at least in basal bodies residing close to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These results are further supported by published mouse data, which demonstrated that Rootletin localizes to Cp110-deficient basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>), and that Rootlet-deficient basal bodies still form cilia in mono- and multi-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">YangÂ etÂ al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we also tested if Cp110 was not only required for ciliary adhesion complex formation, but if <italic>cp110</italic> overexpression could be sufficient to enhance recruitment of FAK-GFP to basal bodies and rootlets. Indeed, our results indicate that exogenous Cp110 can recruit additional FAK-GFP in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>).</p><p>We conclude from these experiments that Cp110 is required for theÂ normal formation of ciliary adhesion complexes in MCCs, and suggest that loss of FAK from basal bodies and rootlets causes the observed defects in basal body apical transport, docking and alignment, as well as theÂ loss of apical Actin network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinct protein domains promote centriolar versus ciliary functions of Cp110</title><p>Cp110 is a multi-domain protein regulating multiple processes during the cell cycle via interaction with distinct partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Indeed, the two opposing roles of Cp110 in cilia formation might be promoted by specific protein domains, interacting with different protein complexes. We first analyzed the <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (Xt) Cp110 sequence and found that the deposited reference sequence (matching BC167469) predicted a shorter product than in other species. Compared to the Xt7.1 genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hellsten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">KarpinkaÂ etÂ al., 2014</xref>), the clone has a frameshift producing a premature stop codon and a truncated Cp110 (Cp110-FS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Restoration of the missing Adenine generated a full-length Cp110 version of 962 amino acids, which contains theÂ domains described for human Cp110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) at similar positions, including two coiled-coil domains (CCDs), CDK phosphorylation sites, Cyclin binding domains (RXL) and CaM-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the KEN box motif, which is required for proteasomal targeting of Cp110, is positioned more towards the N-terminus in Xt Cp110 than in human Cp110, which instead contains an additional destruction-box (D box) with the same function at a similar position. Judging from our functional experiments employing <italic>cp110-fs</italic> and <italic>cp110-fs</italic>Î<italic>miR34/449</italic> and correction of the sequence, we conclude that (a) Cp110-FS is still largely functional, (b) the <italic>miR-34/449</italic> target site is located within the wild-type coding sequence, and (c) the domain structure of Cp110 is highly conserved among vertebrates.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17557.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cp110 coiled-coil domains are required for cilia inhibition and centriolar functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cp110 coiled-coil domains are required for MCC cilia inhibition and formation of supernumerary centrioles.

Most deletion constructs inhibited cilia formation at similar rates to full-length GFP-Cp110, but not a construct missing both CCDs (GFP-Cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2), which had very mild effects on cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). CCDs can facilitate intramolecular interactions as well as intermolecular interactions during complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn etÂ al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Salisbury, 2003</xref>). We therefore deleted Cp110 CCDs separately and tested these constructs for cilia inhibition. Deletion of the first CCD alone (GFP-Cp110ÎCCD1) did not affect cilia inhibition, while deletion of the second CCD (GFP-Cp110ÎCCD2) only weakly affected cilia suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggested that CCDs overlap in activity. For all constructs, effects were cell-autonomous, and non-targeted MCCs formed cilia comparable to uninjected controls. We conclude from this data, that (a) expression of all deletion constructs results in theÂ production of functional protein, which we have confirmed by immunoblotting for GFP-Cp110 constructs at relevant stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), (b) the CCDs of Cp110 inhibit ciliation in a redundant manner, and (c) Cp110 CCDs likely mediate binding to protein complexes at the basal body which support cilia inhibition.</p><p>In addition to effects on ciliogenesis, we observed effects in non-MCC epidermal cells upon overexpression of <italic>gfp-cp110</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2AâD</xref>): Most constructs frequently induced multiple GFP-Cp110 foci per cell and enlargement of cells, while both effects were absent upon <italic>gfp-cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2</italic> overexpression. GFP-Cp110 constructs also strongly localized to centrioles, but centriolar localization of GFP-Cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2 was relatively weak. Formation of supernumerary centrioles and resulting defects in cytokinesis and chromosome separation were previously described upon Cp110 overexpression in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>); therefore our findings suggest that Cp110 CCDs are required for centriolar functions, including suppression of ciliogenesis.</p><p>Next, we overexpressed <italic>gfp-cp110</italic> deletion constructs with <italic>centrin-cfp</italic> and <italic>clamp-rfp</italic> to investigate MCC basal body behavior. Basal bodies in control MCCs were uniformly aligned and spaced appropriately, while overexpression of full-length <italic>gfp-cp110</italic> caused mild alignment defects as well as aggregation of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The same defects were observed with most deletion constructs, but not in <italic>gfp-cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2</italic> overexpressing MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the negative effects on basal bodies and cell size were variable among cilia-inhibiting constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E</xref>): Most prominently, deletion of a central domain (GFP-Cp110ÎCentral) containing most phosphorylation sites, RXL and KEN domains (proteasome targeting motifs), induced much stronger effects than full-length Cp110 and protein levels were elevated in comparison to other constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Collectively, the data suggested that theÂ central domain deletion generated a hypermorphic protein, which was released from negative regulation by the proteasomal machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>gfp-cp110ÎCentral</italic> also caused theÂ formation of extremely enlarged MCCs and other epithelial cells, which were frequently polynucleated, indicating severe cytokinesis defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Abnormal nuclei were associated with multiple GFP-Cp110 foci, which also contained Centrin4-CFP, indicating presence of supernumerary centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). In MCCs, <italic>gfp-cp110ÎCentral</italic> induced strong aggregation and an increased number of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2CâD</xref>), likely due to the presence of supernumerary centrioles at the onset of deuterosome-mediated centriole amplification.</p><p>Finally, we investigated GFP-Cp110 localization to basal bodies and rootlets. All constructs were able to localize to basal bodies, although we detected differences in relative binding to different parts, especially when comparing full-length GFP-Cp110 to GFP-Cp110ÎCentral and GFP-Cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). GFP-Cp110 overlapped mainly with the distal and posterior basal body and localized at much lower levels to the tip of the rootlet, while GFP-Cp110ÎCentral preferentially localized to the basal body with reduced levels at the rootlet. Conversely, GFP-Cp110ÎCCD1&amp;2 localization was stronger at the rootlet as compared to the basal body. Interestingly, overexpression of each construct negatively affected apical Actin formation, while theÂ apical transport of basal bodies occurred largely normally unless aggregation of basal bodies was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results support the conclusion that at centrioles and basal bodies Cp110 CCDs promote binding to centriolar-type protein complexes to mediate cilia inhibition, while other domains allow Cp110 interaction with cilia-promoting or cell-cycle regulatory complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Optimal Cp110 levels are achieved by a transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulatory module in MCCs</title><p>Since the dual function of Cp110 in promoting and limiting ciliogenesis is determined by its protein structure and concentration, Cp110 levels need to be tightly controlled to generate optimal cellular quantities for cilia formation.

This suggested that <italic>miR-34/449</italic> expression might also be activated by ciliary transcription factors. We therefore analyzed expression of <italic>miR-34/449</italic> after manipulation of the MCC cascade at stage 25 by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Expression of <italic>miR-34/449s</italic> in MCCs then represses <italic>cp110</italic> at the post-transcriptional level preventing excess buildup of Cp110 at ciliogenesis stages. Therefore, optimal Cp110 levels in MCC ciliogenesis are generated by a gene regulatory module consisting of ciliary transcription factors and MCC-specific miRNAs from the <italic>miR-34/449</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that Cp110 localizes posteriorly to cilia-forming basal bodies as well as to rootlets in MCCs, in addition to its well-described localization to distal ends of centrioles. A similar low-level localization of endogenous Cp110 can be also observed in primary cilia of RPE-1 cells (see also Figure 4C in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanos et al. 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimal cellular levels of Cp110 are required for cilia formation. The general conclusion that Cp110 is required for ciliogenesis is in line with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2014</xref>) as well as a recent study in mice, in which <italic>Cp110</italic> was knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cp110's role in cilia suppression was proposed to be mediated by distal end capping of the basal body/centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>). In this work, we provide evidence that, additionally, loss of Cp110 prevents formation of ciliary adhesion complexes, which in turn mediate interactions of basal bodies and rootlets with F-actin in MCCs and thereby promote cilia formation. As previously described for knockdown of <italic>FAK</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>), knockdown of <italic>cp110</italic> exerts dose-dependent effects on basal bodies and cilia in MCCs: At low concentrations, these effects include loss of sub-apical Actin-dependent basal body alignment and mild defects in apical Actin formation, but nonetheless successful ciliogenesis. At high concentrations, basal bodies fail to migrate to the apical membrane, which prevents apical docking, apical Actin formation and ciliogenesis. Conversely, overexpression of <italic>cp110</italic> leads to increased basal body/rootlet levels of FAK. This indicates that Cp110 is required for ciliary adhesion complex recruitment. It remains to be seen if Cp110 is able to directly interact with FAK or if it requires additional intermediate protein complexes, as seems to be the case for Cp110 interactions with Centrins.</p><p>Importantly, neither Cp110 localization to basal bodies nor interactions of basal bodies with F-actin are strict requirements for cilia formation. Disruption of F-actin in quail oviduct MCCs prevents apical transport of basal bodies, but eventually basal bodies dock to cytoplasmic membranes and form aberrant intracellular cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisvieux-Ulrich et al., 1990</xref>). Furthermore, ciliary vesicles (CVs) seem to localize apically even in theÂ absence of basal body docking in MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we propose that apical basal body transport promotes efficient basal body fusion with CVs by facilitating spatial proximity. This interpretation is supported by the finding that about 10% of embryonic fibroblasts were capable of CV fusion and cilia formation in <italic>Cp110</italic> knockout mice, which should lack Cp110 altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, Cp110 might promote basal body fusion with CVs through independent interactions.</p><p>We further propose that Cp110 could contribute to ciliary length control and coordinated cilia resorption. On the one hand, increased Cp110 levels at the base of cilia are correlated with shorter GRP cilia. On the other hand, we observe ciliary tip localization of Cp110 in a subset of GRP cilia. GRP cilia have to be resorbed after LR-asymmetric gene expression is induced, to allow these cells to re-enter the cell cycle and to contribute to other embryonic structures like the somites or the notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shook et al., 2004</xref>). At the GRP, cells ingress from lateral to medial, and cilia with Cp110 at their tips were more frequently found on lateral GRP cells. At ciliary tips, Cp110 may promote axoneme depolymerization via recruitment of Kif24, which was previously shown to interact with Cp110 and to specifically depolymerize centriolar-derived microtubules, but not cytoplasmic microtubule populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interaction of Cp110 with distinct protein complexes was previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>) and our data support this idea. CCD-containing proteins are commonly found among centriolar/basal body components, and are thought to regulate pericentriolar material as well as centrioles by acting as a structural lattice and by mediating protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn etÂ al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Salisbury, 2003</xref>). Deletion of Cp110's CCDs prevents efficient cilia inhibition, and decreases binding to centrioles as well as to the distal basal body, but not to rootlets. Therefore, it will be interesting to further dissect Cp110-binding to basal body-associated protein complexes in the future. Our Cp110 deletion constructs might facilitate such dissection using a proteomics approach, as some of them display opposing functions and localization patterns.</p><p>Our study also reveals that Cp110 levels need to be precisely controlled for efficient ciliogenesis. In MCCs, <italic>cp110</italic> expression is induced by ciliary transcription factors, and these also regulate theÂ expression of inhibitory miRNAs from the <italic>miR-34/449</italic> family. This co-regulation establishes a geneÂ regulatory module that confers robust <italic>cp110</italic> expression, while preventing excess Cp110 buildup by post-transcriptional regulation. Such regulatory modules might also exist in other ciliated cell types, which express distinct sets of cell type-specific miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walentek et al., 2014</xref>). In the zebrafish embryonic LR-organizer, motile mono-cilia require <italic>miR-129-3p</italic>, which also controls Cp110 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, RFX2 and Foxj1 could form a similar module with <italic>cp110</italic> and <italic>miR-129-3p</italic> in the vertebrate embryonic left-right organizer.</p><p>Given the importance of Cp110 in ciliogenesis, cell division and pathogenesis, our study contributes important mechanistic insights into the roles of Cp110 during cilia formation and function, which will facilitate further understanding of complex protein networks in cilia-dependent development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Manipulation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and constructs used</title><p>X. <italic>laevis</italic> eggs were collected and in vitro-fertilized, then cultured and microinjected by standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sater, 2011</xref>).

Next, we used the 3D Objects Counter plugin in ImageJ to quantify basal bodies that remained deep in the cytoplasm.

Brightness for depicted images was further adjusted to match maximum intensity levels at lateral membrane foci to account for variation in expression levels. For quantification of FAK-GFP/Centrin4-CFP ratio all z-planes were used, and the same adjustment of brightness/contrast was performed in ImageJ for samples from the same experiment. Maximum intensity projections were generated and the basal body-containing central region (without lateral membranes) was chosen as theÂ region of interest (ROI) to analyze gray values for each channel separately using ImageJ.

In addition, analysis of Cp110 mutants revealed distinct functions for different Cp110 domains. The ciliation defects in <italic>cp110</italic> morphants were initially reported by the authors in (Song et al., 2014), and this study extends these observations to examine the mechanism of Cp110 in promoting ciliogenesis, as compared to its well-studied role in limiting cilium assembly. These studies also confirm certain recent findings in knock-out mice. The most novel data pertain to a role for Cp110 in regulating actin pathways and the ciliary adhesion complex. However, the latter data need substantial corroboration as described below.</p><p>1) The authors conclude that Cp110 could promote cilia assembly by facilitating formation of the ciliary adhesion (CA) complex, which was previously shown to link basal bodies and ciliary rootlets to the apical actin network. Because Cp110 localizes to both the basal body and tip of rootlets, does Cp110 MO also affect rootlet structure (e.g., length)? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref>, the localization of ciliary adhesion complex around the basal bodies (possibly the rootlet region) seems to be more dramatically affected than at the basal bodies. Does Cp110 loss lead to overall reduction of CA proteins or preferential disappearance of CA proteins at the tip of rootlet? Triple staining of CA proteins, basal bodies and rootlets may help.</p><p>2) Related to the above point: A major conclusion is that Cp110 needs to be kept at optimal levels. In normal embryos, Cp110 and ciliary adhesion complex levels differ among basal bodies at anterior and posterior aspects. How does this asymmetric distribution correlate with the role of Cp110 in ciliogenesis? Basal bodies with lower Cp110 levels are also likely to have lower levels of ciliary adhesion proteins that contribute to basal body docking to actin, so does docking of these basal bodies with lower Cp110 differ as compared to those with higher Cp110 levels? Also, do cilia that emanate from basal bodies with higher and lower Cp110 levels differ? Does overexpression of Cp110 recruit excess CA proteins to the basal bodies/rootlets?</p><p>3) Most importantly, data are currently not sufficiently convincing to support a major conclusion, namely, the existence of the Cp110-FAK interaction. In particular, biochemical support for the observation regarding Cp110 interactions with FAK and the actin cytoskeleton is lacking. For example, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> are not of sufficient quality, as only data from over-expression are shown, and adequate negative controls are lacking. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, ideally using both antibodies, and/or validation of the interaction between Cp110 and another component of the ciliary adhesion complex (vinculin, paxillin) is essential.</p><p>4) The authors state (subsection âCp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodiesâ) that Cp110 plays a role in cilia length control because intermediate levels result in short cilia. Without additional ciliary markers (besides ac-tubulin) and/or ultra-structural studies, this conclusion is not well-supported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The Walentek manuscript details the function of CP110 in regulating cilia formation in MCCs in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. They find that CP110 levels are elaborately regulated by the MCC regulatory network. Depletion of CP110 causes a range of phenotypes including loss of cilia, loss of cilia organization, loss of basal body docking and loss of adhesion complex localization. Overexpression of CP110 has previously been reported to cause ciliogenesis defects, but they further these studies by perform domain mapping to determine the functional domains of CP110 responsible for localization and function at the basal body. Additionally, they perform detailed localization studies and find GFP-CP110 localized adjacent to basal bodies towards the rootlet and weakly at the tip of the rootlet. These results are consistent with a potential role in adhesion complex formation which is disrupted in morphants. CP110 is a very interesting protein and this paper suggests novel previously unappreciated functions for it during ciliogenesis. The manuscript contains a large amount of high quality imaging data and is well written. Clearly the loss of CP110 is detrimental to the function of MCCs. The challenge is determining the primary vs. secondary defects associated with CP110 which I think requires a bit more effort. My main concern is that many of the phenotypes might not be directly attributable to CP110 but to any basal body that has failed to dock.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>With the rate of videos presented I am not sure one can make too strong a claim about directionality (I don't doubt the overall claim but the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> seems a bit subjective to me). While this claim is consistent with the rootlet polarity (1C) it is a bit concerning as one does not know which rootlets actually contain a cilium, as most probably do not give the observed ciliogenesis phenotype. Since rootlets without cilia or with immotile cilia will likely not be polarized, I suspect that any polarity defect is secondary to ciliogenesis and should be presented as such.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>. I could not find a description of what constitutes a mild vs. severe defect in docking and I worry that this data is also a bit subjective. As this phenotype is likely contributing to many (or all) of the other phenotypes it seems critically important.</p><p>The claim that Cp110 localizes to &quot;cilia forming basal bodies&quot; seems a bit restrictive, as S3G clearly shows CP110 at non-cilia forming centrioles. Also, the main claim of this manuscript is that CP110 levels are critical, so the overexpression (and therefore localization) of CP110 might not reflect the endogenous situation in regards to localization. This data, while reasonable should be qualified and more clearly stated.</p><p>&quot;At the apical membrane, GFP-Cp110 localized between Centrin4-CFP and F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), supporting the idea that Cp110 might facilitate F-actin binding.&quot; I have several concerns with this figure. First off, from my reading of the EM literature there is a complex 3D architecture of actin in MCCs. This analysis appears to be done at the level of the lower basal body / upper rootlet and I am unclear what pool of actin is being analyzed. Second the quality of the image together with the somewhat diffuse actin staining does not seem to me to reflex any consistent relationship between CP110 localization and actin.</p><p>&quot;We conclude from these experiments that Cp110 is required for normal formation of ciliary adhesion complexes in MCCs, and suggest that loss of FAK, Vinculin and Paxillin from basal bodies and the apical membrane causes the observed defects in basal body transport, docking and alignment, as well as loss of apical actin.&quot; The claim that CP110 somehow regulates the adhesion complex seems concerning. If basal bodies have failed to dock then I am not sure what one would expect to find in regards to the adhesion complex. I am concerned that these adhesion complex phenotypes are completely secondary to docking failure and not that FAK is regulating docking.</p><p>&quot;In MCCs, gfp-cp110DCentral induced strong aggregation and an increased number of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C-D</xref>), implicating Cp110 in regulation of basal body biogenesis and separation via the MCC-specific deuterosome pathway.&quot; This is most certainly an overstatement. Multinucleated cells have more &quot;stuff&quot; and therefore make more cilia, independent of what is causing the cytokinesis defect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>Most of the data is solid. A better description of some of the &quot;subjective&quot; quantifications should be provided.

(2014) Nature 510: 115-120) and the dual roles of Cp110 in ciliogenesis have been demonstrated in the mouse (Yadav et al. (2016) Development 143:1491-1501). To make the current submission a significant advance on this previous work, there are some important control experiments needed.</p><p>1) The localizations shown for GFP-Cp110 are inconsistent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows GFP-CP110 away from the distal end of the basal body, in contrast to its localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>' at the distal end and possibly at the rootlet, and apparently at both centrioles in the mono-ciliated cells. As the main topic of the MS. is the importance of CP110 levels, the concern about promiscuous localization of over-expressed CP110 should be addressed. Where is the endogenous protein?</p><p>2) Better controls should be shown for the IP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The co-IPs with FAK-GFP and Centrin4-GFP are effectively the negative controls for each other, so they should be included on the same membrane.</p><p>3) It is not clear whether Cp110-FS is actually expressed, or whether this was an error in the deposited sequence. The <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> CP110 sequence should be verified by RT-PCR and the correct sequence deposited. The section on the Xt sequence should be rewritten accordingly.</p><p>4) The expression levels of the various Cp110 deletion constructs appear different by GFP fluorescence. An immunoblot should be included to show that the different effects are not due to different expression levels or altered protein stability.</p><p>5) Arising from point 4., are post-translational regulation of Cp110 levels important in MCCs? Given the published work on the cell cycle regulation of Cp110, some discussion/ clarification of this point for the differentiated cells would be relevant.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Ciliary transcription factors and miRNAs precisely regulate Cp110 levels required for ciliary adhesions and ciliogenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

A significant amount of additional data is required for us to reconsider the paper, including controls for the main experiments presented in terms of localisation and CP110 interaction with the ciliary adhesion complex, FAK and the actin cytoskeleton. The reviewers felt that you might be able to address these issues within the eLife two month window for revisions, but only if you have immediate access to appropriate antibodies to carry out the analysis requested. After reading the reviews, please let us know if you feel you can address the comments with new data in a timely manner â direct email discussion with Dr Rossant is simplest.</italic> </p><p><italic>The full reviews are provided below to help you consider whether the revisions requested can be achieved.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their thoughtful suggestions and critical assessment of our manuscript. We have addressed all of the reviewersâ concerns through clarification and experiments. Most importantly, we now provide additional evidence for the regulation of ciliary adhesion complexes by Cp110. We present new conventional and super-resolution immunofluorescence imaging data on endogenous Cp110 localization at basal bodies in human airway multiciliated cells, which confirms our findings from GFP-Cp110 overexpression.</p><p>Furthermore, we show co-localization of Cp110 and FAK at posterior basal bodies, and dosedependent recruitment of FAK to basal bodies and rootlets upon Cp110 overexpression in Xenopus, which supports the idea that different doses of Cp110 have different effects on the cilia. We now also show that defects in basal body alignment and ciliary adhesion localization are not secondary to defects in basal body docking, since we have identified conditions where basal body docking and cilia formation are normal, but alignment is affected. Finally, we show that the differential effects of Cp110 deletion constructs are not primarily caused by differences in expression levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Using Xenopus embryos, the authors show that optimal Cp110 levels are required for cilia formation and that Cp110 is needed for ciliary adhesion complex formation. In addition, analysis of Cp110 mutants revealed distinct functions for different Cp110 domains. The ciliation defects in cp110 morphants were initially reported by the authors in (Song et al., 2014), and this study extends these observations to examine the mechanism of Cp110 in promoting ciliogenesis, as compared to its well-studied role in limiting cilium assembly. These studies also confirm certain recent findings in knock-out mice. The most novel data pertain to a role for Cp110 in regulating actin pathways and the ciliary adhesion complex. However, the latter data need substantial corroboration as described below.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors conclude that Cp110 could promote cilia assembly by facilitating formation of the ciliary adhesion (CA) complex, which was previously shown to link basal bodies and ciliary rootlets to the apical actin network. Because Cp110 localizes to both the basal body and tip of rootlets, does Cp110 MO also affect rootlet structure (e.g., length)? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref>, the localization of ciliary adhesion complex around the basal bodies (possibly the rootlet region) seems to be more dramatically affected than at the basal bodies. Does Cp110 loss lead to overall reduction of CA proteins or preferential disappearance of CA proteins at the tip of rootlet? Triple staining of CA proteins, basal bodies and rootlets may help.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that loss of ciliary adhesion complex proteins appears more dramatic at the rootlet than at the basal body, although clearly both populations are affected. So, to address this we provide additional experiments in the revised manuscript, in which we demonstrate the dose-dependent effects of <italic>cp110</italic> knockdown on MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D</xref>). At low concentrations, <italic>cp110</italic> MO caused disruption of basal body alignment and mild apical actin defects, but without major impact on ciliation or apical basal body transport/docking or rootlet formation. These data support the conclusion that the rootlet complex of ciliary adhesion proteins is most sensitive to Cp110 deficiency, possibly because Cp110 levels are relatively low at the rootlet tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>â).</p><p>We also provide a triple staining in controls and <italic>cp110</italic> morphants using Centrin-CFP to mark the basal body, Clamp-RFP as rootlet marker, and FAK-GFP for ciliary adhesions, as suggested by the reviewer. We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref> that Clamp and Centrin4 localize to rootlets/basal bodies in both controls and <italic>cp110</italic> morphant MCCs, while FAK is selectively and strongly reduced in <italic>cp110</italic> morphants. These results indicate that loss of the rootlet is unlikely the primary cause for loss of ciliary adhesion complexes and failure of ciliogenesis in Cp110-deficient MCCs. Further analysis of apical versus deep basal bodies in <italic>cp110</italic> morphant MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>â) revealed that Clamp staining in apically localized basal bodies was similar to controls, while Clamp concentrations at basal bodies that remained deep in the cytoplasm were reduced, indicating possible defects in the most significantly affected basal bodies.</p><p>Our results are in line with Yadav et al. (Development, 2016, 143, 1491-1501), who show that Rootletin still localizes to basal bodies/rootlets in Cp110-/- mice. Furthermore, Yang et al. (2005, Mol Cell Biol. 25(10):4129-37) previously reported that rootlets are not required for basal body docking and ciliogenesis in the mouse. We refer to these observations in the third paragraph of the subsection âCp110 is required for ciliary adhesion complex formationâ.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that loss of ciliary adhesion complexes and cilia formation is not primarily caused by a loss of the rootlet, and that ciliary adhesion complexes are strongly reduced in Cp110-deficient basal bodies even when the rootlet marker Clamp is still present.</p><p><italic>2) Related to the above point: A major conclusion is that Cp110 needs to be kept at optimal levels. In normal embryos, Cp110 and ciliary adhesion complex levels differ among basal bodies at anterior and posterior aspects. How does this asymmetric distribution correlate with the role of Cp110 in ciliogenesis?</italic> </p><p>Our data suggest that <italic>cellular</italic> Cp110 levels need to be optimal to allow for successful ciliogenesis. The finding that levels of ciliary adhesion complexes and Cp110 also vary along the axis of polarization is an interesting observation, but at this point we can only speculate about the mechanism of asymmetric distribution as well as about the functional consequences of this asymmetry. It could be related to the mechanism by which tissue-level planar cell polarity signaling (e.g. via Frizzled6 and Vangl1) is transduced to the polarity of basal bodies in MCCs. Vladar and colleagues (2015, Methods in Cell Biology, 127, 37-54) have proposed that in the trachea â where cilia beat along the proximal-distal axis â proximally localized Frizzled connects to the âfirst rowâ of basal bodies via microtubules. This is thought to polarize these basal bodies, which pass this polarity on to the remaining basal bodies within the cell via the apical and sub-apical actin networks. Therefore, the differences in levels of ciliary adhesion complex proteins and Cp110 along this axis might reflect the strength of polarization and mechanical coupling. Such a reasoning is also discussed by Antoniades et al. (2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80).</p><p>In fact, we do observe this polarity more frequently in earlier stages, possibly during initial polarization, than in later stages. This suggests that additional ciliary adhesion proteins and Cp110 could be recruited during later steps of polarization to further stabilize basal body orientation, possibly in a similar manner as suggested for Bbof1 (Chien et al. 2013, Development Aug, 140(16):3468-77).</p><p><italic>Basal bodies with lower Cp110 levels are also likely to have lower levels of ciliary adhesion proteins that contribute to basal body docking to actin, so does docking of these basal bodies with lower Cp110 differ as compared to those with higher Cp110 levels?</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript we present data on <italic>cp110</italic> MO-dose dependent phenotypes in MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Low <italic>cp110</italic> MO concentrations lead to largely normal docking of basal bodies and successful ciliogenesis, while interfering selectively with proper basal body alignment. With increasing concentrations, <italic>cp110</italic> MO causes increasingly severe basal body transport and docking defects with the result that cilia are not formed and basal bodies remain deep in the cytoplasm. All these processes require ciliary adhesion complexes, and a similar dose-dependency was reported for FAK knockdown in MCCs (Antoniades et al. 2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80). Therefore, this data supports our hypothesis that a fairly specific (low) dose of Cp110 is required for normal ciliary adhesion complex formation and function, while excess levels of Cp110 recruit more ciliary adhesions to basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-F</xref>), but simultaneously prevent cilia formation, likely by distal end capping(Kobayashi et al. Centriolar Kinesin Kif24 Interacts with CP110 to Remodel Microtubules and Regulate Ciliogenesis. Cell 145, 914â925 [2011]; Spektoret al. Cep97 and CP110 suppress a cilia assembly program. Cell 130, 678â90 [2007]).</p><p><italic>Also, do cilia that emanate from basal bodies with higher and lower Cp110 levels differ?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we do observe a reduction in length of GRP cilia with more Cp110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B, B</xref>â). We address this in the Results subsection âCp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodiesâ as well as in the discussion on Cp110âs possible role in cilia length control and resorption (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Does overexpression of Cp110 recruit excess CA proteins to the basal bodies/rootlets?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We performed the experiments and we do see a dose-dependent increase in FAK-GFP localization upon <italic>cp110</italic> overexpression. The results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-F</xref>, and mentioned in the Results subsection âCp110 is required for ciliary adhesion complex formationâ as well as in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Most importantly, data are currently not sufficiently convincing to support a major conclusion, namely, the existence of the Cp110-FAK interaction. In particular, biochemical support for the observation regarding Cp110 interactions with FAK and the actin cytoskeleton is lacking. For example, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> are not of sufficient quality, as only data from over-expression are shown, and adequate negative controls are lacking. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, ideally using both antibodies, and/or validation of the interaction between Cp110 and another component of the ciliary adhesion complex (vinculin, paxillin) is essential.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that Co-IP of endogenous protein would strongly support our experimental findings and the Co-IP data from overexpressed Flag-tagged Cp110. We have tried two commercially available anti-human-Cp110 antibodies and used human airway epithelial cell cultures as our target for immunoprecipitation. Unfortunately, despite obtaining effective ciliation in these cultures over the four week period required, we were limited in the amount of material and could not convincingly Co-IP associated proteins, including endogenous FAK. Nevertheless, our other observations show that the proteins are associated in a functional complex, even though we cannot make a statement that they are in direct contact. The finding that they do participate in the functional regulation of ciliary adhesions as well as basal body interactions with Actin is one of the significant insights coming from the work.</p><p>As suggested by reviewers two and three, we now show the full membranes for the Co-IP of overexpressed Cp110 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we also show the uninjected control lane. In the revised manuscript, we clearly point out the differences between Co-IPs on endogenous and overexpressed Cp110.</p><p>Importantly, however, we provide additional conventional and super-resolution immunofluorescence data of endogenous Cp110 in human airway multiciliated cells, which confirms Cp110 localization at cilia-forming basal bodies in the same way as observed with overexpressed GFP-Cp110 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Furthermore, we show co-localization of GFP-Cp110 and FAK-mKate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and that FAK-GFP localization to basal bodies correlates with Cp110 levels in loss- and gain-of-function experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-F</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data support our main conclusion that Cp110 is required for ciliary adhesion complex formation/recruitment to basal bodies. Nevertheless, it remains to be demonstrated if the influence of Cp110 on ciliary adhesion complex proteins is via direct interaction or if it involves additional protein complexes, which we will address in future unbiased proteomics studies.</p><p><italic>4) The authors state (subsection âCp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodiesâ) that Cp110 plays a role in cilia length control because intermediate levels result in short cilia. Without additional ciliary markers (besides ac-tubulin) and/or ultra-structural studies, this conclusion is not well-supported.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the comment and agree with the reviewer that our rather short statement in the initial manuscript might have led to the impression we are overstating this correlative finding.</p><p>We provide additional data in the revised manuscript that support our hypothesis that Cp110 might be involved in ciliary length control/cilia resorption. In a subset of embryos, we observe frequent ciliary tip localization of Cp110 in monociliated Gastrocoel Roof Plate cells (GRP cells of the left-right organizer/node equivalent), which is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>. This observation suggests that Cp110 could be directly involved in cilia length regulation. We think that Cp110 at the ciliary tip could mediate axoneme depolymerization and cilia resorption for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Ciliated cells at the left-right organizer are a transient phenomenon during development. After the left-right axis is induced by cilia-driven leftward flow, cells retract their cilia in a coordinated manner which allows re-entry into the cell cycle (Komatsu et al. Development, 2011, Sep;138(18):3915-20) and ingression into the somites, notochord and hypochord in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Shook et al. Developmental Biology, 2004, 270:163-185). The observation that we find more abundant ciliary tip localization of Cp110 in older embryos is consistent with the idea that Cp110 accumulates in tips of cilia that are actively shortening. Furthermore, we see Cp110 more frequently at ciliary tips at the lateral edges of the GRP, which is in line with the finding that GRP cells ingress from lateral to medial in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (Shook et al. Developmental Biology, 2004, 270:163-185).</p><p>2) Cp110 was reported to be part of a cilia suppression complex, which acts via recruitment of negative regulators of tubulin polymerization, i.e. Kif24 (which was shown to specifically depolymerize centriolar microtubules, but not cytoplasmic microtubules; please see Kobayashi et al. Cell, 2011, 145(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>):914-25). Therefore, Cp110 could be translocated to the ciliary tip together with Kif24 in order to promote active axoneme depolymerization necessary for cilia resorption.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now discuss these findings and our hypothesis in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>With the rate of videos presented I am not sure one can make too strong a claim about directionality (I don't doubt the overall claim but the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> seems a bit subjective to me). While this claim is consistent with the rootlet polarity (1C) it is a bit concerning as one does not know which rootlets actually contain a cilium, as most probably do not give the observed ciliogenesis phenotype. Since rootlets without cilia or with immotile cilia will likely not be polarized, I suspect that any polarity defect is secondary to ciliogenesis and should be presented as such.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and this is certainly true for <italic>cp110</italic> morphants injected with high doses of <italic>cp110</italic> MO. Our additional data argue that polarity defects can occur in the absence of severe ciliogenesis defects in <italic>cp110</italic> morphants injected with low doses of <italic>cp110</italic> MO. In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref> and D we now show the dose-dependent effects on ciliation, basal body polarization, basal body localization and apical actin formation.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>. I could not find a description of what constitutes a mild vs. severe defect in docking and I worry that this data is also a bit subjective. As this phenotype is likely contributing to many (or all) of the other phenotypes it seems critically important.</italic> </p><p>Representative examples as used for classification into âfully dockedâ, âmild docking defectâ and âsevere docking defectâ are shown in the figures and color coded (white, grey and black boxes shown on lateral projections) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>. In the revised manuscript, we have added a description to the figure legend to clarify that. Additionally, we have taken one of the data sets and re-analyzed it in a more quantitative fashion: Confocal z-stacks from controls, <italic>cp110</italic> morphants, and rescued <italic>cp110</italic> morphants were analyzed for presence of apically localized basal bodies and basal bodies that remained deep in the cytoplasm. Apically localized basal bodies were defined as present in the first (apical) 4 z-sections containing Centrin4-CFP signal (=1.82Âµm), deep localized basal bodies were defined as Centrin4-CFP signals located below 1.82Âµm. Next, we used the 3D Objects Counter plugin in ImageJ to quantify basal bodies that remained deep in the cytoplasm. These automatic quantifications were then inspected and corrected in cases where objects other than basal bodies were detected (assigned object count = 0), and where two or more basal bodies were counted as one (assigned object count =2 or more). This analysis confirmed our previous conclusions and the results are depicted in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-D</xref>.</p><p><italic>The claim that Cp110 localizes to &quot;cilia forming basal bodies&quot; seems a bit restrictive, as S3G clearly shows CP110 at non-cilia forming centrioles.</italic> </p><p>We do not mean our wording in a restrictive sense. In this manuscript we use âCp110 localizes to cilia forming basal bodies (and rootlets)â to emphasize our focus on Cp110âs role in cilia formation and function. In the revised manuscript we now mention Cp110âs centriolar role more prominently.</p><p><italic>Also, the main claim of this manuscript is that CP110 levels are critical, so the overexpression (and therefore localization) of CP110 might not reflect the endogenous situation in regards to localization. This data, while reasonable should be qualified and more clearly stated.</italic> </p><p>In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D-F</xref> we now show endogenous Cp110 localization data from human airway epithelial cells generated by confocal as well as super-resolution imaging. As in the case of the overexpression data, endogenous Cp110 localizes to the base of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>), adjacent to the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and at the rootlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This adds to our previous data on endogenous Cp110 localization to cilia-forming basal bodies in human and mouse airway MCCs, which we in part moved to revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D-E</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, although the authors made no comment, careful re-examination of previously published work by Tanos et al. (Genes Dev. 2013, 27:163-168) revealed essentially the same Cp110 localization pattern (medium levels adjacent to the distal end of the cilia-forming mother centriole â low levels at the tip of the rootlet) in primary cilia of human RPE-1 cells using antibody staining of endogenous protein in combination with super-resolution imaging (we provided a figure for the reviewersâ consideration).</p><p><italic>&quot;At the apical membrane, GFP-Cp110 localized between Centrin4-CFP and F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), supporting the idea that Cp110 might facilitate F-actin binding.&quot; I have several concerns with this figure. First off, from my reading of the EM literature there is a complex 3D architecture of actin in MCCs. This analysis appears to be done at the level of the lower basal body / upper rootlet and I am unclear what pool of actin is being analyzed. Second the quality of the image together with the somewhat diffuse actin staining does not seem to me to reflex any consistent relationship between CP110 localization and actin.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer in that the figure was difficult to assess. Therefore, we have removed it from the revised manuscript, and instead provide additional triple staining of Centrin4-CFP, GFP-Cp110 and FAK-mKate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This triple staining revealed that Cp110 overlaps posteriorly with Centrin, while FAK mainly overlaps with and extends Cp110 at the posterior domain. These data thus further support a role for Cp110 in linking ciliary adhesions to the basal body. Ciliary adhesions, in turn, were shown to directly interact with the actin cytoskeleton in MCCs by FRET analysis (Antoniades et al. 2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80).</p><p><italic>&quot;We conclude from these experiments that Cp110 is required for normal formation of ciliary adhesion complexes in MCCs, and suggest that loss of FAK, Vinculin and Paxillin from basal bodies and the apical membrane causes the observed defects in basal body transport, docking and alignment, as well as loss of apical actin.&quot; The claim that CP110 somehow regulates the adhesion complex seems concerning. If basal bodies have failed to dock then I am not sure what one would expect to find in regards to the adhesion complex. I am concerned that these adhesion complex phenotypes are completely secondary to docking failure and not that FAK is regulating docking.</italic> </p><p>Antoniades et al. (2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80) have shown that ciliary adhesion complexes in MCCs are first required for apical basal body transport and docking. Therefore, ciliary adhesions act upstream of basal body docking to the apical membrane, in addition to their later role in basal body alignment, which takes place after docking and cilia formation. In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref> we now show that Cp110 localizes to newly formed basal bodies already during stages when apical basal body transport and docking takes place, which supports our conclusion.</p><p>Additionally, we present new data on <italic>cp110</italic> MO-dose dependent phenotypes in MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Low <italic>cp110</italic> MO concentrations lead to normal apical transport and docking of basal bodies and successful ciliogenesis, while interfering selectively with proper basal body alignment, which depends on ciliary adhesions at the rootlet tip. Lower Cp110 concentrations are found at the rootlet tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>â) and loss of ciliary adhesion complexes is more pronounced at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C-D</xref>). We further provide evidence that gain of Cp110 increases FAK levels at basal bodies and rootlets â again, in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these data strongly support a specific and dose-dependent effect of Cp110 loss on ciliary adhesion formation, independent of basal body docking.</p><p>Our conclusions are also in line with the observations by Yadav et al. (Development, 2016, 143, 1491-1501) that in Cp110-/- mice, 5-10% of primary cilia were still formed, and basal bodies docked to ciliary vesicles were found in about the same frequency. These mice should lack Cp110 protein altogether; therefore, presence of Cp110 at the basal body does not seem to be a strict requirement for ciliary vesicle docking (which also takes place at the distal end and not adjacent to the basal body where Cp110 is found in cilia-forming basal bodies) and cilia formation, but rather promote it at the optimal concentrations and sites. For clarification, we extended our discussion on this point in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>&quot;In MCCs, gfp-cp110DCentral induced strong aggregation and an increased number of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C-D</xref>), implicating Cp110 in regulation of basal body biogenesis and separation via the MCC-specific deuterosome pathway.&quot; This is most certainly an overstatement. Multinucleated cells have more &quot;stuff&quot; and therefore make more cilia, independent of what is causing the cytokinesis defect.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer in that the increase in basal body numbers is likely a secondary effect due to the presence of supernumerary centrioles. The sentence now reads as follows: âIn MCCs, <italic>gfp-cp110â³Central</italic> induced strong aggregation and an increased number of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C-D</xref>), likely due to the presence of supernumerary centrioles at the onset of deuterosome-mediated centriole amplification.â</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p><italic>Most of the data is solid.

An immunoblot should be included to show that the different effects are not due to different expression levels or altered protein stability.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are some differences in effective expression levels between the constructs. We have indicated that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2F</xref> (last column) of our manuscript. As requested, we now show an immunoblot of GFP-tagged Cp110 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), which shows that all constructs are expressed in relevant stages (stage 20) at similar levels, with GFP-Cp110â³Central (which lacks the RXL and KEN motifs) and GFP-Cp110â³C (which lacks the <italic>miR-34/449</italic> target sites in its mRNA) showing the highest expression. Most importantly, GFP-Cp110â³CCD1&amp;2 (which shows low cilia inhibition potential) is not significantly less expressed than constructs that inhibit cilia efficiently.</p><p><italic>5) Arising from point 4., are post-translational regulation of Cp110 levels important in MCCs? Given the published work on the cell cycle regulation of Cp110, some discussion/ clarification of this point for the differentiated cells would be relevant.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that post-translational mechanisms likely contribute to the regulation of Cp110 levels in all cells, including MCCs to some extent. We indicate that by stating: âInterestingly, the negative effects on basal bodies and cell size were variable among cilia-inhibiting constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>): Most prominently, deletion of a central domain (GFP-Cp110ÎCentral) containing most phosphorylation sites, RXL and KEN domains (proteasome targeting motifs), induced much stronger effects than full-length Cp110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). This suggests that central domain deletion generated a hypermorphic protein which was released from negative regulation by the proteasomal machinery.â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The main concern remains that the conclusions on the localization of Cp110 are largely based on expression of GFP-CP110, which may be over-expressed relative to endogenous protein, and that they lack quantitation. The authors should present evidence that the unconventional localization is not background and that it is a statistically significant occurrence. It was recognized that the findings of the paper are novel and interesting and should not be held hostage to the lack of all the necessary reagents to confirm native localization and interactions. However, the reviewers felt that the claims of the paper on these issues should be modified and the caveats made clearer.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for the constructive criticism on our manuscript, which helped to improve it. However, we are puzzled about the above comment, that âThe main concern remains that the conclusions on the localization of Cp110 are largely based on expression of GFP-CP110, which may be over-expressed relative to endogenous protein, and that they lack quantitation. The authors should present evidence that the unconventional localization is not background and that it is a statistically significant occurrence.â</p><p>Indeed, we added further immunostaining (conventional and super-resolution) of endogenous proteins to the paper, which addressed this point directly. The staining is reproducible, and we provide the number of experiments/donors and cells in the figure legends to figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B (n</xref> donors = 1, n MCCs =4), 3D (n donors =1, n MCCs = 12), 3E-F (n donors = 1, n MCCs = 3 each for confocal and 3D-SIM), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D-E</xref> (mice, n=4; and including a control staining with only secondary antibody). In all species and cases, Cp110 was found at cilia-forming basal bodies. Furthermore, with respect to the possibility that GFP might cause background, other papers have demonstrated that expression of GFP alone does not result in profound basal body localization (including Antoniades, I., Stylianou, P. &amp; Skourides, P. A. Making the connection: ciliary adhesion complexes anchor Basal bodies to the actin cytoskeleton. Dev. Cell28,70â80 (2014).).</p><p>We have however, further addressed the reviewerâs concern in our re-revised manuscript by including additional data on the localization of an overexpressed, GFP-tagged Cep97 construct in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis and present these findings in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref> as well as in the third paragraph of the subsection âCp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodiesâ. Cep97 cooperates with Cp110 in cilia suppression at centrosomes (Spektor, A., Tsang, W. Y., Khoo, D. &amp; Dynlacht, B. D. Cep97 and CP110 suppress a cilia assembly program. Cell130, 678â90 (2007)). We now show that while GFP- Cep97 localizes robustly to centrosomes, it does not localize to MCC basal bodies and does not suppress cilia formation, which further supports our conclusion that GFP-Cp110 localization adjacent to basal bodies and to rootlet tips are specific. We hope that this addresses the reviewerâs remaining concerns.</p><p>We are unsure what kind of âstatistical significanceâ the reviewer(s) expect from us since all our staining experiments reliably detected Cp110 at basal bodies?</p></body></sub-article></article>
