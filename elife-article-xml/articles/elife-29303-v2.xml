stability. Previously, we demonstrated that Cyclin A/Cdk1 destabilizes k-MT attachments to promote faithful chromosome segregation. Here, we use quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify 156 Cyclin A/Cdk1 substrates in prometaphase. One Cyclin A/Cdk1 substrate is myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), and we show that MYPT1 localization to kinetochores depends on Cyclin A/Cdk1 activity and that MYPT1 destabilizes k-MT attachments by negatively regulating Plk1 at kinetochores. Thus, Cyclin A/Cdk1 phosphorylation primes MYPT1 for Plk1 binding. Interestingly, priming of PBIP1 by Plk1 itself (self-priming) increased in MYPT1-depleted cells showing that MYPT1 provides a molecular link between the processes of Cdk1-dependent priming and self-priming of Plk1 substrates. These data demonstrate cross-regulation between Cyclin A/Cdk1-dependent and Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of substrates during mitosis to ensure efficient correction of k-MT attachment errors necessary for high mitotic fidelity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>Plk1</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>cyclin dependent kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM119455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kettenbach</surname><given-names>Arminja N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM051542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Compton</surname><given-names>Duane A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funding agency had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative phosphoproteomics defines the substrates for Cyclin A/Cdk1 kinase during early mitosis and follow up studies validate that one identified substrate, MYPT1, influences the stability of k-MT attachments by regulating Plk1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic cells rely on the precise regulation of the stability of microtubule attachments to kinetochores (k-MT attachments) on chromosomes to ensure genetic fidelity during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakhoum et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walczak et al., 2010</xref>). Kinetochore-MT attachments must be sufficiently stable to achieve microtubule occupancy at kinetochores to move chromosomes and to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakhoum and Compton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McEwen and Dong, 2009</xref>). At the same time, microtubules must rapidly detach from kinetochores to promote efficient correction of erroneously oriented k-MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maiato et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, hyperstable k-MTs are an underlying cause of the elevated frequency of chromosome mis-segregation associated with chromosomal instability (CIN) observed in a majority of aneuploid tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cimini and Degrassi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weaver and Cleveland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakhoum et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>). Systematically destabilizing k-MT attachments was shown to be sufficient to restore faithful chromosome segregation to tumor cells that otherwise exhibited exceptionally high chromosome mis-segregation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabeche and Compton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stolz et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, there is a causal relationship between the stability of k-MT attachments and the propensity for chromosome mis-segregation.</p><p>Kinetochores rely on several molecular complexes to bind microtubules, and reversible protein phosphorylation is often used as a mechanism to regulate the MT binding affinity of those complexes to ensure that k-MT attachment stability falls within an acceptable range needed for genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakhoum and Compton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>)(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godek et al., 2015</xref>]). For example, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential mitotic kinase that regulates many aspects of mitosis (extensively reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmucker and Sumara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Petronczki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Vugt and Medema, 2005</xref>]), including the stabilization of k-MT attachments in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LÃ©nÃ¡rt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moutinho-Santos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hood et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, Aurora B kinase serves an evolutionarily conserved role for the correction of k-MT attachment errors by destabilizing k-MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Welburn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salimian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cimini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Cdk1 acts in conjunction with either Cyclin A or Cyclin B to drive cell cycle progression into and through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">VÃ¡zquez-Novelle et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that Cyclin A/Cdk1 plays a role in destabilizing k-MT attachments to promote faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabeche and Compton, 2013</xref>). Similarly, Cyclin A2 has been recently shown to promote microtubule dynamics during meiosis II in mouse oocytes to decrease the frequency of merotelic attachments and the incidence of lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). These data revealed a catalytic role for Cyclin A/Cdk1 during prometaphase, but the substrates being specifically phosphorylated during prometaphase remain unknown. To address this deficiency, we have devised a strategy using mass spectrometry to identify substrates of Cyclin A/Cdk1 in mitotic human cells arrested in prometaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitotic Cyclin A/Cdk1 phosphoproteome</title><p>To identify Cyclin A/Cdk1-specific mitotic targets in prometaphase, we utilized Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ong et al., 2002</xref>) to conduct a bioinformatics-assisted phosphoproteomic screen comparing phosphorylation of protein peptides from cells arrested in mitosis with high versus low levels of Cyclin A.

For example, histone H3-like centromere protein A (CENP-A) has closely spaced Cdk1 consensus motifs at Ser17 and Ser19 that were unchanged between the high and low Cyclin A conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kunitoku et al., 2003</xref>). Another example is Lamin B2, a component of the nuclear lamina which has been shown to be phosphorylated by Cyclin B/Cdk1 in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LÃ¼scher et al., 1991</xref>). Lamin B2 has two closely spaced Cdk1 consensus motifs at Thr14 and Ser17 that are sensitive to Cdk1 activity in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrone et al., 2016</xref>), but they did not significantly change under our conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, tyrosine residue 15 on Cdk1, was 6-to-8-fold more phosphorylated in the high Cyclin A condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Phosphorylation of Tyr15 inhibits Cdk1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker and Piwnica-Worms, 1992</xref>), although this negative influence is stronger on Cdk1 (aka cdc2 in those articles) when it is associated with Cyclin B compared to Cyclin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 1992</xref>). Despite any inhibitory influence of Tyr15 phosphorylation, the cells had sufficient Cdk1 activity to have entered and to maintain mitosis under these experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swaffer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To further elucidate specific Cyclin A/Cdk1 substrates, we performed a bioinformatics approach using the STRING database to interrogate the sorted mitotic proteins that were more than two-fold more phosphorylated at a Cdk1 consensus motif in the high Cyclin A condition for known protein-protein interactions. This revealed several clusters of proteins with previously documented interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that Cyclin A/Cdk1 selectively regulates the proteins in these groups to regulate mitotic functions such as chromatid cohesion and mitotic spindle organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intersection of mitotic signaling networks</title><p>This phosphoproteome showed evidence for cross-regulation between Cyclin A/Cdk1 and other regulators of mitosis including Aurora B kinase, and Plk1, and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). With regard to cross-regulation of Aurora B kinase, we identified several Cyclin A/Cdk1 substrates with established roles in the targeting and/or activation of Aurora B kinase at centromeres. For example, the level of phosphorylation of protein kinase GSG2 (Haspin kinase) was five-fold higher in mitotic cells with high Cyclin A at the Cdk1 consensus site Thr112, and more than two-fold higher at Cdk1 consensus sites Thr97 and Ser147 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, Bub1 kinase has adjacent Cdk1 sites at Ser661 and Ser665 and the phosphorylation of these sites was more than two-fold higher in our high Cyclin A condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>).

The functional significance of these specific Cdk1 phosphorylation events remains to be determined, but a net effect of these events could be to increase Aurora B kinase localization and/or activity in prometaphase because the extent of autophosphorylation at Thr232 on Aurora B kinase was more than four-fold higher in the high Cyclin A condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The overall abundance of Aurora B kinase was not affected by changes in levels of Cyclin A during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) indicating that Cyclin A/Cdk1 activity appears to selectively enhance Aurora B kinase activity in mitosis consistent with parallel roles of Cyclin A/Cdk1 and Aurora B kinase in destabilizing k-MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Welburn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salimian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cimini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabeche and Compton, 2013</xref>).</p><p>With regard to cross-regulation of Plk1, we note extensive evidence that INCENP, Bub1 and Haspin regulate Plk1 localization and activity in addition to their regulatory role on Aurora B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goto et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, the Cdk1 consensus motif containing the dipeptide Ser472:473 on Myosin Phosphatase-Targeting Subunit 1 (MYPT1) was approximately three-fold more phosphorylated in the high Cyclin A condition (p=0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The Ser473 site has previously been shown to be phosphorylated by cdc2 in vitro and to be necessary as a priming phosphorylation for Plk1 interaction. MYPT1 functions to link the catalytic subunit of PP1 to Plk1 to locally dampen Plk1 kinase activity by dephosphorylating the activating Thr210 (T-loop) on Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Totsukawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yamashiro et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>With regard to cross-regulation of PP1, the Cyclin A/Cdk1 substrates in this phosphoproteome included the PP1-regulatory subunit PP1-3F and the PP1-catalytic subunit 12C. On PP1-3F, the peptide containing Ser14:Ser18 was seventeen-fold more phosphorylated in the high Cyclin A condition, and on PP1-12C peptides containing Ser399:Ser404, Ser407, Ser509, and Ser604 were each more than two-fold phosphorylated in the high Cyclin A condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This finding predicts that this prometaphase phoshoproteome should display not only changes in the phosphorylation status of substrates of Cdk1, but also changes in the extent of phosphorylation of substrates of Aurora B kinase and Plk1 as a consequence of changes in the Cdk1-dependent activity of the aforementioned regulators of Aurora B kinase, Plk1, and PP1. Thus, we interrogated the dataset for phosphopeptides containing the minimal consensus motifs for Aurora B kinase (R/K â X â pS/pT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and Plk1 (D/E-X-pS/pT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakajima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosstessner-Hain et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The majority of phosphorylation sites with consensus Aurora kinase motif did not change between the high and low Cyclin A condition.

To demonstrate that the Cdk1 motif on MYPT1 containing Ser473 is selectively phosphorylated by Cyclin A/Cdk1, we used a phosphosite-specific antibody to quantify the levels of pMYPT1 Ser473 on mitotic chromosomes in the presence and absence of Cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The overall abundance of MYPT1 does not change substantially in cells lacking Cyclin A, but the level of pMYPT1 Ser473 decreases dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and there is a significant reduction in pMYPT1 at centromeres of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Additionally, the k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells lacking MYPT1 were significantly more stable than those of metaphase counterparts.

Importantly, the observed changes in the stability of k-MT attachments were reversed by treatment with low-dose Plk1 inhibitor BI-2536 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This demonstrates that MYPT1 acts to dampen Plk1 activity at kinetochores during prometaphase to ensure the rapid detachment of k-MTs.</p><p>To determine the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser472:473 on MYPT1, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant versions of MYPT1 where Ser473 was changed to either aspartic acid or alanine and where both Ser472 and Ser473 were changed to aspartic acid. Immunoblot confirms the expression of these mutants and wild type MYPT1 in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). As previously reported, depletion of Cyclin A prematurely stabilized k-MT attachments in prometaphase and eliminated the step-wise increase in k-MT stability between prometaphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Expression of wild type MYPT1 did not alter the step-wise increase in k-MT stability between prometaphase and metaphase, although k-MT attachments were slightly less stable in both phases of mitosis in the presence of excess MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Expression of MYPT1-473A reversed the step-wise change in k-MT attachment stability between prometaphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) akin to the loss of MYPT1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This indicates that alanine mutation at this site acts in a dominant negative fashion to disrupt endogenous MYPT1 function. Expression of either MYPT1-473D or MYPT1-472:473DD abolished the step-wise stabilization of k-MT attachments between prometaphase and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Cells expressing the aspartic acid mutants of MYPT1 displayed k-MT attachment stability equivalent to control cells, but did not appropriately stabilize k-MT attachments in metaphase. These data suggest that these mutants of MYPT1 are acting appropriately during prometaphase (as a phospho-mimic) and remain persistently active in metaphase to inappropriately destabilize k-MT attachments.</p><p>We previously demonstrated a causal relationship between the stability of k-MT attachments and the frequency of chromosome segregation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabeche and Compton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhoum et al., 2009b</xref>). Therefore, we tested if the changes in k-MT attachment stability in cells depleted of MYPT1 affected the fidelity of chromosome segregation. The frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase was not significantly different between control cells and cells lacking MYPT1 using either U2OS or RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that in cells lacking MYPT1, the destabilization of k-MT attachments in metaphase can compensate for the hyperstabilization of k-MT attachments in prometaphase to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. However, if we increased the frequency of k-MT attachment errors using the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol, then we observed a significant increase in the frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase in cells lacking MYPT1 relative to control cells following the release from the monastrol-induced mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, MYPT1-deficient cells are compromised in correcting k-MT attachment errors under conditions where the frequency of errors is elevated.</p><p>The association of Plk1 with substrates is dependent on priming phosphorylation on the substrate, which is frequently carried out by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmucker and Sumara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elia et al., 2003</xref>). The association of MYPT1 with Plk1 was previously shown to be mediated by priming phosphorylation at Ser473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yamashiro et al., 2008</xref>), and our data indicate that Cyclin A/Cdk1 catalyzes that priming phosphorylation.</p><p>Interestingly, we also observed an increase in the quantity of pPlk1 at kinetochores in the absence of MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and a similar increase in Plk1 and pPlk1 localization to kinetochores in the absence of Cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). While Plk1 substrate recognition depends on priming phosphorylation commonly by Cdk1, Plk1 localization to kinetochores is regulated by self-priming phosphorylation of PBIP1 (CENP-U) by Plk1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, inhibition of Plk1 activity results in its delocalization from kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation of Thr78 on PBIP1. We used a phosphosite specific antibody to measure the levels of pPBIP1 Thr78 in the presence and absence of Cyclin A and MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Cells depleted of either Cyclin A or MYPT1 displayed an approximate two-fold increase in the level of phosphorylation at Thr78 compared to control cells as judged by immunoblotting of mitotic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). There was also a significant increase in the localization of pPBIP1 Thr78 to kinetochores in cells lacking either Cyclin A or MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These data indicate that Cyclin A/Cdk1 promotes MYPT1 targeting to kinetochores where it reduces the level of Plk1 phosphorylation at Thr210 and reduces the level of Plk1 self-priming of PBIP1.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29303.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Plk1 self-priming of PBIP1 is influenced by Cyclin A/Cdk1 and MYPT1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots using whole cell lysates from U2OS before (CT) and after si-RNA-mediated Cyclin A-knockdown (CycA KD) of MYPT1 knockdown (MYPT1 KD) for the indicated protein targets.

Here, we use a phosphoproteomic approach to identify a large number of substrates of Cyclin A/Cdk1. We provide biochemical validation that one of these substrates, MYPT1, actively participates in destabilizing k-MT attachments in prometaphase by modulating the activity of Plk1 at kinetochores.</p><p>These data provide evidence in mammalian cells that the identity of the specific activating cyclin subunit can confer selectivity onto Cdk1 for some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pagliuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loog and Morgan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Errico et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri and Pryciak, 2011</xref>).

Ongoing phosphatase activity diminishes the level of phosphorylation of these substrates in Cyclin A-deficient mitotic cells, despite the continued presence of Cyclin B/Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). By extension, we would predict that a subset of Cdk1 substrates would also be sensitive to the continued presence of Cyclin B although our phosphoproteomics experiment was not designed to identify that class of substrates should it exist. Thus, we envisage three subsets of mitotic Cdk1 substrates in mammalian cells that are defined by whether they are selectively phosphorylated by Cyclin A/Cdk1, Cyclin B/Cdk1, or non-selectively phosphorylated by either Cyclin A/Cdk1 or Cyclin B/Cdk1; these substrates would display temporal differences in phosphorylation because Cyclin A and Cyclin B are degraded asynchronously during mitosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">den Elzen and Pines, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Fiore and Pines, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brito and Rieder, 2006</xref>).</p><p>These data also demonstrate that Cyclin A/Cdk1 catalyzes substrate priming necessary for Plk1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Our finding that the priming of MYPT1 for Plk1 interaction is sensitive to Cyclin A/Cdk1 reveals a new, and unexpected level of temporal control in the process of Plk1 substrate priming. Cyclin A/Cdk1-catalyzed priming of MYPT1 provides an inherent bias favoring the interaction of MYPT1 and Plk1 during early mitosis. This priming would be expected to diminish once Cyclin A is degraded as cells reach metaphase, which fits a need in prometaphase to titrate the k-MT stabilizing effect of Plk1 activity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29303.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MYPT1 cross-regulates Cyclin A/Cdk1-dependent priming and self-priming of Plk1 substrates during mitosis.</title><p>Cyclin/Cdk1 has an established role in catalyzing the priming phosphorylation of substrates to promote Plk1 binding as depicted for hypothetical substrate âAâ.

Our data shows that MYPT1 provides a molecular link between these two Plk1 substrate priming pathways. MYPT1 is primed for Plk1 interactions by Cyclin A/Cdk1 and subsequently acts to dampen Plk1 activity at kinetochores by regulating the extent of Plk1 self-priming of PBIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding implies that the autonomous, feed-forward mechanism of self-priming of Plk1 substrates can be constrained by the Cdk1-dependent priming of substrates. With respect to pools of Plk1 acting at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lera et al., 2016</xref>), this constraint is important to prevent excessive activation of Plk1 which could hyper-stabilize k-MT attachments and impair the efficient correction of k-MT attachment errors.</p><p>Finally, our data indicate extensive cross-regulation between the Cdk1-, Aurora B kinase-, and Plk1-dependent mitotic signaling networks in early mitosis.

Quantified intensities were background-corrected and corrected for photobleaching and then normalized to the first timepoint after photoactivation for each individual cell.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All three of them were troubled by several issues that we would insist be addressed to more firmly allow the primary conclusions concerning cyclin A regulation of the MYPT1 phosphatase as a means to control the Plk1 kinase at kinetochores and its influence on kinetochore microtubule stabilization. You may be able to easily deal with some of the points where they are confused. Others will require further experimentation â and they make specific suggestions below. We would be glad to consider a revision if you are able to add these.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Now to the specifics. Your manuscript identifies cyclin A targets in prometaphase and then demonstrates that the phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 regulates Plk1 function to alter kinetochore-microtubule attachments in mitosis. This adds to your previous work describing a global switch in kinetochore-microtubule stability between prometaphase and metaphase. That earlier work attributed this switch to the destruction of Cyclin A, and the subsequent inactivation of CyclinA/CDK1 complexes, but did not identify the key Cyclin A/CDK substrates. You do this here using quantitative MS approaches to identify specific cyclin A targets during prometaphase. Many cyclin A phospho-sites are identified that cluster into groups regulating key mitotic kinases, such as Plk1 and Aurora B. Because MYPT1 has a known function regulating Plk1, its role in kinetochore-microtubule attachments is specifically tested. Reduction in MYPT1 or cyclin A is found to increase Plk1 at kinetochores and this suggest an altered interaction between MYPT1 and Plk1. identifying mitotic proteins/peptides whose phosphorylation is increased in the presence of high levels of Cyclin A. One of these proteins is Mypt1, a PP1 regulatory subunit that negatively regulates Plk1. You confirm that Mypt1 phosphorylation leads to decreased PLK1 activity, and further demonstrate that depletion of Mypt1 leads to defects in kinetochore-microtubule turnover in both prometaphase and metaphase. This leads to a major conclusion that Cyclin A/CDK1 regulation of Mypt1, through Mypt1's regulation of PLK1, is largely responsible for the switch in K-MT stability from prometaphase to metaphase.</p><p>We agree that identifying the key targets of CyclinA/Cdk1 is of interest. Our feeling, however, is that the conclusions are generally overstated as they rely on the use of knockdowns of cyclin A and MYPT1 and many targets are affected when these genes are knocked down, limiting the conclusiveness of any potentially direct interactions.in regard to identifying the phosphorylation event responsible. We are not convinced that Cyclin A/CDK1 phosphorylation of MYPT1 is the causative event.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To make the conclusion that the MYPT1 phosphorylation at S473 regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachments via PLk1 and that it is required to maintain Plk1 kinetochore levels, experiments on the cyclin A phosphorylation site mutant in MYPT1 are essential.</p><p>2) You report that depletion of MYPT1 leads to increased kinetochore-MT stability in prometaphase (compared to normal PM values) and decreased kinetochore-MT stability in metaphase â all the way down to control PM values. We have a couple of questions:</p><p>-Why are the kMTs unstable in metaphase after Mypt1 depletion? You argue that increased PLK1 activity leads to prematurely stabilized kMTs, but what is the explanation for significantly decreased kMT stability in metaphase?</p><p>â If these changes are due to decreased MYPT1 phosphorylation, and subsequent increased PLK1 activity, then why isn't this same trend (namely altered turnover in metaphase) also observed in response to Cyclin A inhibition (Kabeche 2013)?</p><p>â Given the very high turnover of metaphase kinetochore-MTs after MYPT1 knockdown (down to PM levels), how are chromosomes properly aligning? Are there delays in alignment? Even more puzzling -- how are these cells silencing the checkpoint in the presence of globally unstable kMT attachments?</p><p>3) The phenotypic outcome resulting from inhibition of Cyclin A in the Kabeche paper (2013) was an increase in chromosome segregation errors due to hyper-stabilization of k-MTs (in otherwise unperturbed cells). If the major target of CyclinA/CDK1 for regulation of k-MTs is MYPT1 (which, when phosphorylated, decreases PLK1 activity to destabilize k-MTs), the expectation is that depletion of MYPT1 should mimic the phenotype observed after Cyclin A depletion. However, this is not the case.</p><p>4) A major conclusion is that priming phosphorylation of Mypt1 by CycA/CDK promotes Plk1 binding in early mitosis to promote high kMT turnover. You state, &quot;Cyclin A/Cdk1-catalyzed priming of MYPT1 provides an inherent bias favoring the interaction of MYPT1 and Plk1 to early mitosis. This priming would be expected to diminish once Cyclin A is degraded as cells reach metaphase, which fits a need in prometaphase to titrate the k-MT stabilizing effect of Plk1 activity.&quot; A test is needed to see if this is the case using the MYPT1 phospho-specific antibody to determine when MYPT1 is normally phosphorylated during mitosis. Are the temporal phosphorylation dynamics consistent with their conclusion?</p><p>5) In regard to the turnover data, you use U2OS cells. The Compton group has demonstrated that such CIN cell lines exhibit significantly deviant kMT turnover/dynamics, thus it doesn't seem to make sense why this particular cell line has been chosen for the analyses. Are similar results found in RPE1 cells, which have been used extensively in the Compton lab for such analyses?</p><p>6) A new finding here is that CyclinA/CDK (vs. CycB/CDK or a combination of CycA/CDK CycB/CDK) phosphorylates Mypt1 to promote Plk1 binding and inactivation. The rationale for this conclusion is that in cells depleted of Cyclin A, Cyclin B levels do not change but Mypt1 phosphorylation is decreased. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, it looks by eye as though Cyclin B levels are decreased after Cyclin A knockdown. Quantification here would help substantiate the claim.</p><p>7) In Cyclin A &quot;high&quot; cells, the prediction would be that PLK1 phosphorylation at Thr210 would decrease (high Cyclin A â high Mypt1 phosphorylation â decreased PLK1 phosphorylation).

We have generated three different mutant versions of MYPT1: MYPT1473SerâAla, MYPT1473SerâAsp, and MYPT1472:473-SerSerâAspAsp. We show that the alanine mutant prematurely stabilizes k-MT attachments in prometaphase and destabilizes k-MT attachments in metaphase. This resembles the effects observed in MYPT1-depleted cells indicating that the alanine mutant acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt MYPT1 function and its role in regulating k-MT attachment stability. We created both the single (473) and double (472 &amp; 473) aspartic acid mutants to account for the possibility of phosphorylation at one or both of the adjacent serine residues. In contrast to the alanine mutant, both aspartic acid mutants prevent the stabilization of k-MT attachments that ordinarily occurs at metaphase. This is the expected outcome for an irreversible phosphor-mimic at this residue that continues to exert a destabilizing effect on k-MT attachments into metaphase. The new data generated using these mutant forms of MYPT1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>Overall, we believe that these results support our conclusion that the Cyclin A/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 Serine 473 is directly involved in regulating the attachment stability of k-MT attachments during mitosis. We believe that these new data strengthen our conclusion and thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You report that depletion of MYPT1 leads to increased kinetochore-MT stability in prometaphase (compared to normal PM values) and decreased kinetochore-MT stability in metaphase â all the way down to control PM values. We have a couple of questions:</p><p>-Why are the kMTs unstable in metaphase after Mypt1 depletion? You argue that increased PLK1 activity leads to prematurely stabilized kMTs, but what is the explanation for significantly decreased kMT stability in metaphase?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful question. We agree that this is an intriguing result, but we feel that it is difficult to provide a satisfactory answer given the current understanding for how all the various molecules work together to generate the desired stability of k-MT attachments in different phases of mitosis. It is possible that the biochemical âstateâ of metaphase cells lacking MYPT1 reflects on the overall stability of k-MT attachments differently than in prometaphase. As such, we suggest that the metaphase destabilizing effect is likely the result of skewing the balance between Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of k-MT stabilizers and destabilizers, possibly secondary to the localization effects of Cyclin A phosphorylation on MYPT1 kinetochore recruitment, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. For emphasis, we cite the evidence in the literature for somewhat paradoxical Plk1-mediated activation of both k-MT stabilizers and destabilizers at kinetochores (listed below). Ultimately, understanding this issue will take substantial additional experimentation that would go well beyond the scope of this manuscript which already includes substantial phosphoproteomic screening data and validation of that screen through the targeted analysis of a specific substrate.</p><p>Lenart P, et al.

Indeed, we identified over 100 phosphopeptides which were sensitive to differential Cyclin A expression in our experimental conditions. As such, it stands to reason that the observed effects reported in the Kabeche 2013 are the global effect of Cyclin A inhibition, rather than the isolated effect of one branch of regulation of k-MT stability, which we think we provide strong evidence for in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Given the very high turnover of metaphase kinetochore-MTs after MYPT1 knockdown (down to PM levels), how are chromosomes properly aligning? Are there delays in alignment? Even more puzzling -- how are these cells silencing the checkpoint in the presence of globally unstable kMT attachments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their keen observations and insightful questions. First, chromosome alignment defects and delays have been previously reported in Hela cells depleted of MYPT1.</p><p>Yamashiro, S., Yamakita, Y., Totsukawa, G., Goto, H., Kaibuchi, K., Ito, M.,...

The values for k-MT attachment stability reported here are well within a range that would be sufficient to support both chromosome alignment (in U2OS cells) and eventual satisfaction of the SAC. We trust the reviewers not to confuse âreduced attachment stabilityâ with âloss of attachmentsâ â those are quite different. We draw the reviewerâs attention to our measurements in U251 cells (Bakhoum et al. Curr Biol 2009) that demonstrated reversed k-MT stability (more stable prometaphase and less stable metaphase k-MT attachments). It is possible to have reduced k-MT attachment stability, yet to be able to congress chromosomes and satisfy the checkpoint and proceed into anaphase. In a separate line of inquiry, we are conducting experiments to determine the threshold for k-MT attachment stability, below which, the cells fail to satisfy the checkpoint. That line of inquiry is well beyond the scope of this current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The phenotypic outcome resulting from inhibition of Cyclin A in the Kabeche paper (2013) was an increase in chromosome segregation errors due to hyper-stabilization of k-MTs (in otherwise unperturbed cells). If the major target of CyclinA/CDK1 for regulation of k-MTs is MYPT1 (which, when phosphorylated, decreases PLK1 activity to destabilize k-MTs), the expectation is that depletion of MYPT1 should mimic the phenotype observed after Cyclin A depletion. However, this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the same as comment #2, second bullet. Because Cyclin A/Cdk1 is a protein kinase with multiple mitotic substrates, it stands to reason that the loss of Cyclin A/Cdk1 would have different effects on mitotic cells than the loss of only one substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A major conclusion is that priming phosphorylation of Mypt1 by CycA/CDK promotes Plk1 binding in early mitosis to promote high kMT turnover. You state, &quot;Cyclin A/Cdk1-catalyzed priming of MYPT1 provides an inherent bias favoring the interaction of MYPT1 and Plk1 to early mitosis. This priming would be expected to diminish once Cyclin A is degraded as cells reach metaphase, which fits a need in prometaphase to titrate the k-MT stabilizing effect of Plk1 activity.&quot; A test is needed to see if this is the case using the MYPT1 phospho-specific antibody to determine when MYPT1 is normally phosphorylated during mitosis. Are the temporal phosphorylation dynamics consistent with their conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. Unfortunately, we were only provided with a few microliters of the pMYPT1 Ab which we exhausted with the currently described experiments. Thus, we are unable to perform the requested experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In regard to the turnover data, you use U2OS cells. The Compton group has demonstrated that such CIN cell lines exhibit significantly deviant kMT turnover/dynamics, thus it doesn't seem to make sense why this particular cell line has been chosen for the analyses. Are similar results found in RPE1 cells, which have been used extensively in the Compton lab for such analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added new data generated using RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As the reviewers might be aware, RPE1 cells can often display somewhat different responses relative to U2OS (or other cancer cell lines), and we observed enhanced chromosome congression defects in the RPE1 cells depleted of MYPT1. We provide data showing that k-MT attachments are hyperstabilized in prometaphase, but we had difficulty assessing sufficient numbers of metaphase cells to make clear conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A new finding here is that CyclinA/CDK (vs. CycB/CDK or a combination of CycA/CDK CycB/CDK) phosphorylates Mypt1 to promote Plk1 binding and inactivation. The rationale for this conclusion is that in cells depleted of Cyclin A, Cyclin B levels do not change but Mypt1 phosphorylation is decreased. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, it looks by eye as though Cyclin B levels are decreased after Cyclin A knockdown. Quantification here would help substantiate the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures to show the relative quantities of each protein on the blots compared to the loading controls. We feel the data supports the conclusion that Cyclin A/Cdk1 is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating Ser473 on MYPT1. Nevertheless, we attempted to be clear in the Discussion section of the text that there may be substrates that are preferentially phosphorylated by one or the other Cyclin-associated Cdk1s or that some substrates may be equivalently phosphorylated by both.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Cyclin A &quot;high&quot; cells, the prediction would be that PLK1 phosphorylation at Thr210 would decrease (high Cyclin A â high Mypt1 phosphorylation â decreased PLK1 phosphorylation). Is this the case? From the statement in subsection âIntersection of mitotic signaling networksâ, it seems to be the contrary: you report that most PLK1 sites either did not exhibit altered phosphorylation or exhibited increased phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful question. By convention due to the way in which the isotopes correlate to the two conditions, the mass spectrometry more faithfully reports substrates that were more phosphorylated in the âhigh kinase activityâ condition. Technical artifacts will impair conclusions drawn if one attempts to define substrates that were more phosphorylated in the low kinase activity condition without switching the isotope labeling strategy. Time and cost constraints precluded us from repeating all the necessary replicate experiments with a switched isotope labeling scheme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) You demonstrate that turnover of K-MTs is altered in MYPT1 depleted cells. Do these changes in turnover reflect defects in kinetochore-MT polymerization/depolymerization dynamics (e.g. are kinetochore oscillatory movements perturbed?) or defects in kinetochore-MT attachment strength (e.g. are pulling forces changed? Do cells exhibit altered cold-resistant kMTs?). Is this consistent with previously described roles for Plk1 in k-MT stabilization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data showing calcium-stable MT densities, inter-kinetochore distances, and spindle lengths. All of these assays are consistent with our reported data showing changes in k-MT attachment stability upon depletion of MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Again, these assays are measuring different features of mitotic spindles and we have purposefully focused our attention on the rate of MT detachment from kinetochores (measured using the photoactivation assay) because of the importance of MT detachment to the correction of k-MT attachment errors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
