in the same environment. Prior work has shown that expression noise is heritable and can be shaped by selection, but the impact of variation in expression noise on organismal fitness has proven difficult to measure. Here, we quantify the fitness effects of altering expression noise for the <italic>TDH3</italic> gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that increases in expression noise can be deleterious or beneficial depending on the difference between the average expression level of a genotype and the expression level maximizing fitness. We also show that a simple model relating single-cell expression levels to population growth produces patterns consistent with our empirical data. We use this model to explore a broad range of average expression levels and expression noise, providing additional insight into the fitness effects of variation in expression noise.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37272.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Single-celled organisms that reproduce by dividing, like yeast, can create whole populations of genetically identical cells. However, some differences will exist among such cells, even when they have all experienced the same environment. These differences are known as “noise”. By definition, noise is not caused by differences in DNA sequence, but some DNA sequences are noisier than others (i.e. they cause more differences among cells). Because the amount of noise can be under genetic control, noise could evolve due to natural selection.</p><p>Scientists often study noise at the level of gene expression – in other words, how many RNA or protein molecules are produced from each gene within each cell. Prior work has suggested that this type of noise can affect how often individual cells divide in a population, which is a component of that population’s fitness. Yet directly measuring these effects has proven challenging. Different studies have in the past reached opposite conclusions about whether a change in gene expression noise would increase or decrease fitness.</p><p>One major reason for the lack of clear results is that most mutations that alter gene expression noise also alter the average level of expression of that gene. To find DNA sequences that produced the same average amount of protein but different levels of expression noise, Duveau et al. compared the effects of hundreds of mutations in the DNA sequence regulating the expression of a gene in baker’s yeast. Experiments focused on 43 DNA sequences then showed that increased expression noise could either speed up or slow down the growth of the population by affecting how long it took each cell to divide. More specifically, the effects of increasing expression noise depended on the average amount of protein produced among the cells in the population. If the average expression level was close to the optimum amount at which cells divided as fast as possible, increasing expression noise reduced the growth of the whole population. If, however, the average protein level caused cells to divide slower than their maximum rate, increasing expression noise resulted in faster growth of the population as a whole.</p><p>Duveau et al. explain their results as follows: more expression noise in a population that is already making the optimal amount of protein can reduce fitness because it increases the fraction of that population making a suboptimal amount of the protein. However, when the average expression level is not optimal, more expression noise would mean more cells producing an amount of protein that is closer to the optimum and thus having higher fitness.</p><p>These findings provide conceptual tools needed to understand how genetic variation affecting expression noise evolves. They could also help understand how expression noise might contribute to biological processes that depend upon cell division, such as diseases like cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>promoter</kwd><kwd>TDH3</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>competitive growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 1114-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duveau</surname><given-names>Fabien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32GM115198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hodgins-Davis</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HG000040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Metzger</surname><given-names>Brian PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittkopp</surname><given-names>Patricia J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1021398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittkopp</surname><given-names>Patricia J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittkopp</surname><given-names>Patricia J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The impact of changing gene expression noise on fitness reveals beneficial or deleterious effects in a stable environment depending how close the average expression level is to the fitness optimum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression is a dynamic process that results from a succession of stochastic biochemical events, including availability of transcription factors, binding of transcription factors to promoter sequences, recruitment of transcriptional machinery, transcriptional elongation, mRNA degradation, protein synthesis, and proteolysis. These events cause the expression level of a gene product to differ even among genetically identical cells grown in the same environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2015</xref>). This variability in gene expression is known as ‘expression noise’ and is under genetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>), with heritable variation causing differences in noise among genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman et al., 2006</xref>) and genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because gene expression noise is heritable and variable within populations, it can evolve in response to natural selection if it affects fitness. Indeed, prior studies have suggested that expression noise can be either beneficial or deleterious depending on the context (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viney and Reece, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richard and Yvert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al. (2015)</xref> provides evidence that increased expression noise can be selected against in natural populations, presumably because elevated noise increases the probability that a given cell produces a suboptimal level of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duveau et al., 2017a</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, a negative correlation exists at the genomic scale between the expression noise of genes and their dosage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batada and Hurst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keren et al., 2016</xref>). However, because the optimal level of gene expression can vary among environments, high gene expression noise has been suggested to be beneficial if it can produce individuals with phenotypes that are better adapted to a new environment than individuals produced with low gene expression noise. For instance, noise in gene expression can allow a small fraction of cells to survive when confronted with stressful environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraser and Kaern, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viney and Reece, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this idea, a genomic screen in yeast found that plasma-membrane transporters involved in cell-environment interactions displayed elevated expression noise in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Theoretical work also suggests the existence of cost-benefit tradeoffs that can make expression noise either beneficial or deleterious under different circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite a growing body of evidence that selection has acted on expression noise for many genes, direct measurements of how changes in expression noise impact fitness remain scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). A major reason for this scarcity is that most mutations that alter gene expression noise also alter average expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>), making it difficult to disentangle the fitness effects of changing expression noise and average expression level. Here, we directly estimate the effects of changing expression noise on fitness independently from changes in average expression level for the <italic>TDH3</italic> gene of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p><italic>TDH3</italic> encodes an isozyme of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McAlister and Holland, 1985</xref>) as well as transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringel et al., 2013</xref>), RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) and possibly antimicrobial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branco et al., 2014</xref>). Variation in this gene’s promoter affecting expression noise has previously been shown to be a target of selection in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>). To assess the impact of changes in expression noise on fitness at different expression levels, we generated mutant alleles of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter that covered a broad range of average expression levels and expression noise. We find that increases in expression noise are detrimental when the average expression level of a genotype is close to the fitness optimum, but beneficial when the average expression level of a genotype is further from this optimum. This pattern was reproduced by a simple computational model that links expression in single cells to their doubling time​ to predict population fitness. We used this ​individual-based ​model to explore the fitness effects of a broader ​combination of average expression levels and expression noise than were explored empirically, showing that not only do the fitness effects of changing expression noise depend on the average expression level, but that the​ fitness effects of changing average expression level also depend upon the amount of expression noise.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generating variation in expression noise independent of average expression level</title><p>To disentangle the effects of changes in average expression level and expression noise on fitness, we examined a set of <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter (<italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic>) alleles with a broad range of activities. For each allele, we measured the average expression level and expression noise by cloning the allele upstream of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) coding sequence, integrating this reporter gene (<italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP</italic>) into the <italic>HO</italic> locus, and quantifying fluorescence in living cells using flow cytometry in six replicate populations per genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fluorescence value of each cell was transformed into an estimated mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) based on the relationship between fluorescence and YFP mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The average expression level of a genotype was then calculated by averaging the median values from the six replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and expressing this value as a percent change from the wild type allele. Expression noise was calculated for each replicate as the variance divided by the median expression among cells, a measure of noise strength similar to the Fano factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>). The expression noise of each genotype was then calculated by averaging the noise strength from the six replicate populations, and this value was expressed as a percent change from the wild type allele.

But average expression level and expression noise strongly co-vary among these alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>), making them insufficient for separating the effects of changes in average expression level and expression noise on fitness. We therefore sought to construct additional promoter alleles that showed a different relationship between average expression level and expression noise. First, we inserted a recognition motif for the GCN4 transcription factor at ten different positions in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter because this TFBS was previously found to affect the relationship between expression level and expression noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>). However, the insertion of GCN4 binding sites into <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> did not show the expected departure from the relationship between expression level and expression noise observed for mutations in GCR1 and RAP1 TFBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next mutated the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> TATA box because previous studies showed that TATA box mutations confer lower expression noise for a given expression level when compared to other types of promoter alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mogno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>). We generated 112 alleles of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter that had between one and five random mutations in the TATA box sequence, which caused the expected lower levels of expression noise than TFBS mutant alleles with similar average expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then combined mutations in the TATA box, GCR1 TFBS and/or RAP1 TFBS to further increase the range of expression phenotypes. Finally, we constructed alleles containing two tandem copies of the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP</italic> reporter gene with or without mutations in the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> sequence to sample expression levels closer to and above the wild-type allele. These mutant alleles captured a much greater range of mean expression and expression noise than <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles segregating in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duveau et al., 2017a</xref>) and allowed us to more fully explore the relationship between mean, noise and fitness than would be possible using naturally occurring variation alone.</p><p>From this collection of 171 <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), we selected 43 alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) to study the fitness effects of changes in average expression level and expression noise of the native <italic>TDH3</italic> gene.

We also included a strain with a deletion of the promoter and coding sequence of <italic>TDH3</italic> to sample a <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level of 0%.

Competitive fitness was determined from the rate of change in genotype frequencies over time and averaged across at least six replicate populations for each genotype tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The relative fitness of each strain was then calculated by dividing the competitive fitness of that strain by the competitive fitness of the strain with the wild type allele of <italic>TDH3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). This protocol provided a measure of fitness with an average 95% confidence interval of 0.2%.

Deletion of <italic>TDH3</italic> (expression level of 0% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) caused a statistically significant decrease in fitness of 6.1% relative to the wild type allele (t-test, p=6.4×10<sup>−10</sup>).

Overexpressing <italic>TDH3</italic> up to 175% did not significantly impact growth rate, but the 207% expression level of the strain carrying a duplication of the wild type <italic>TDH3</italic> gene caused a 0.92% reduction in fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <italic>t</italic>-test, p=1.4×10<sup>−7</sup>). Notably, none of the 42 mutant alleles of <italic>TDH3</italic> conferred a significantly higher fitness than the wild type allele (one-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests, p&gt;0.05), indicating that the wild type expression level of <italic>TDH3</italic> is near an optimum for growth in the environment assayed. We expect these differences in fitness among genotypes with different <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles to arise primarily from differences in <italic>TDH3</italic> expression; however, differences in pleiotropy among promoter alleles might also contribute to differences in fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Disentangling the effects of <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level and expression noise on fitness</title><p>Residual variation was observed around the LOESS fitted line relating expression level to fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that we hypothesized might be explained by differences in noise among genotypes. To examine the effects of differences in expression noise on fitness independent of differences in average expression level, we used the residuals from a local regression of expression noise on expression level for the alleles with average expression levels between 0% and 125% of the wild type allele to define a metric called ΔNoise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This metric was not significantly correlated with expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>TDH3</italic> alleles with positive ΔNoise values had a higher level of noise than expected based on their expression level and were classified as ‘high noise’, whereas <italic>TDH3</italic> alleles with negative ΔNoise values had lower levels of noise than expected given their expression level and were classified as ‘low noise’.</p><p>We then compared the relationship between expression level and fitness for genotypes in the high noise and low noise classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found that promoter alleles with positive ΔNoise tended to show a higher fitness than strains with negative ΔNoise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). This beneficial effect of noise on fitness was surprising given prior evidence that selection favored alleles of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> with low expression noise in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>). We noticed, however, that the fitness benefit of increasing expression noise was limited to a particular range of average expression levels. Specifically, positive ΔNoise was associated with higher fitness only for average expression levels between 2% and 80% of the wild type expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Above 80% of expression, no clear difference in fitness was detected between strains with positive and negative ΔNoise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These same trends were also observed for the other metrics of noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations and prior theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that the distance between the average expression level of a <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> allele and the optimal level of <italic>TDH3</italic> expression influenced how a change in expression noise impacted fitness. To test this hypothesis, the 43 promoter alleles were split into two groups depending on the distance of their average expression level from the optimal expression level of <italic>TDH3</italic>. Using a local regression of fitness on average expression level, we inferred the value of average expression that would confer a fitness reduction of 0.5% from maximal fitness. Promoter alleles for which the median activity was below this threshold were considered to be ‘far from optimum’ and promoter alleles with median activity above the threshold were considered to be ‘close to optimum’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A metric called ΔFitness, corresponding to the residuals of a local regression of fitness on average expression, was calculated to remove the confounding effect of average expression levels on fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that changes in noise (ΔNoise) and changes in fitness (ΔFitness) were positively correlated for genotypes classified as far from the optimum (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.74, p=9.36×10<sup>−7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>), but not for genotypes classified as close to the optimum (r = −0.08, p=0.84, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E–H</xref>). This result was robust to variation in the choice of the smoothing parameter used for the local regression of noise on average expression, the choice of the smoothing parameter used for the local regression of fitness on average expression, and the fitness threshold used to separate strains with expression levels close and far from optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplements 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref>). We note, however, that the smaller number of genotypes with mean expression close to the optimum provided less power to detect a significant relationship than genotypes with mean expression far from the optimum.</p><p>As an alternative way to test for the impact of expression noise on fitness, we compared ΔFitness for genotypes with positive and negative values of ΔNoise. Permutation tests were used to assess the significance of differences in ΔFitness by randomly shuffling values of ΔNoise among genotypes.

In addition, we used pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neve et al., 2002</xref>) instead of flow cytometry to determine the relative frequency of the two genotypes at each time point because the two strains competed against each other could not be distinguished based on fluorescence. Relative fitness of the high and low noise genotypes in each pair was calculated based on the changes in relative allele frequency during competitive growth.</p><p>For the three pairs of genotypes with an average expression level far from optimum (12%, 19%, and 59% average expression relative to wild type), fitness of the high noise genotype relative to the low noise genotype was significantly greater than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the high noise genotype grew faster than the low noise genotype. This result was consistent with the differences in fitness measured from the indirect competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, both pairs of strains with an average expression level closer to the fitness optimum (93% and 102% relative to wild type expression levels) showed slightly but significantly lower fitness of the high noise genotype than the low noise genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In these cases, higher expression noise resulted in a ~ 0.1% decrease in fitness relative to lower noise.

An intuitive explanation of this phenomenon is that when the average expression level is close to the optimum, increasing expression noise can result in enough cells with suboptimal expression to decrease fitness of the population. Conversely, when the average expression level is far from the optimum, increasing expression noise can result in enough cells with expression closer to the optimum to increase fitness of the population. These effects of expression noise on population fitness can result from differences in expression level among cells causing differences in the cell division rate (a.k.a. doubling time) among cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiviet et al., 2014</xref>). To better understand the interplay among average expression level, expression noise, and fitness, we developed a simple computational model that allowed us to (1) vary the expression mean and noise independently while holding all other parameters constant, (2) track the resulting single cell growth dynamics, and (3) evaluate the consequences for population fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Simulating population growth reveals fitness effects of noise</title><p>To further investigate how the distribution of expression levels among genetically identical cells influences population fitness, we modeled the growth of clonal cell populations that differed in the mean expression level and expression noise for a single gene. In this model, we specified a function defining the relationship between the expression level of a cell and the doubling time of that cell. Following each cell division, the expression levels of mother and daughter cells were sampled independently from an expression distribution characterized by its mean and noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This independent sampling ignores any inheritance of expression noise, which is a conservative choice for detecting differences in fitness among genotypes due to differences in noise. The doubling time of each cell was then calculated from its expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and each clonal population was allowed to expand for the same amount of time, increasing in size at a rate determined by the doubling times of the cells sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Empirical measures of single-cell division rates were consistent with these elements of the model, showing more variable cell division times in genotypes with greater <italic>TDH3</italic> expression noise and shorter cell division times in genotypes with mean <italic>TDH3</italic> expression closer to the fitness optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

With this relationship, higher levels of expression noise conferred higher population fitness for a given mean expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), a pattern more pronounced for high values of mean expression and observed for all metrics of noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This finding is consistent with prior work demonstrating that an increased variability of doubling time among individual cells is sufficient to increase fitness at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerulus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nozoe et al., 2017</xref>). This is because the doubling time of a population tends to be dominated by the doubling time of the fastest dividing cells in the population, <italic>i.e.</italic> population doubling time is higher than the mean doubling time among all cells in the population.</p><p>Next, we used a Gaussian function akin to stabilizing selection in which an intermediate expression level produced the shortest doubling time (faster growth), while lower or higher expression than this optimum would increase doubling time (slower growth) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). With this function, we found that the fitness effects of increasing expression noise depended on the mean expression level. Specifically, increasing expression noise increased fitness when the average expression level was far from the optimal expression level and it decreased fitness when the average expression level was close to the optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), similar to the pattern we observed with our empirical fitness data and in agreement with theoretical work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde (2008)</xref>. This result was observed for all three metrics of noise, suggesting it is robust to the different scaling relationships between the mean expression level and variability around the mean captured by different metrics of noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>These in silico analyses not only provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for our empirical finding that increasing noise can be both beneficial and deleterious in a single environment but they also show that increasing expression noise can alter the effects of changes in mean expression level on fitness. Specifically, when expression noise is high (red lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), changes in mean expression level are predicted to have much smaller impacts on fitness than equivalent changes when expression noise is low (blue lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This pattern is also readily apparent when changes in expression noise, instead of changes in mean expression level, are plotted as a function of population fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations are consistent with a previously published population genetic model showing that increasing expression noise can reduce the efficacy of natural selection acting on mean expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Zhang, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite many studies providing evidence that natural selection can (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barroso et al., 2018</xref>) and has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>) acted on expression noise, the precise effects of expression noise on fitness have proven difficult to measure empirically. This difficulty arises from the facts that (1) most mutations that alter expression noise also alter mean expression in a correlated fashion, making it difficult to isolate the effects of changes in expression noise on fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), and (2) the magnitude of fitness effects resulting from changes in expression noise is expected to be smaller than that resulting from changes in mean expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we overcame these challenges by surveying a broad range of mutant promoter alleles for their effects on mean expression level and expression noise, measuring the fitness effects of a subset of these alleles with reduced dependency between effects on mean expression level and expression noise, and using an assay for fitness with power to detect changes as small as 0.1%. We found that the fitness effects of changes in expression noise are indeed generally much smaller than changes in expression level, although they are large enough to be acted on by natural selection in wild populations of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also show that changes in expression noise can be beneficial or deleterious depending on the distance between the mean expression level and the expression level conferring optimal fitness in the environment examined, with increases in expression noise deleterious near the optimal expression level, consistent with data for <italic>TDH3</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al. (2015)</xref>. Although our empirical work focused solely on the <italic>TDH3</italic> gene, the small number of parameters in our simulation model producing the same pattern as these empirical data suggests that the observed relationship among fitness, average expression level and expression noise are likely generalizable to other genes. That said, the precise relationship between expression noise and fitness at the population level is expected to be shaped by the relationship between average expression level and doubling time of single cells as well as the temporal dynamics of expression in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>). We provide some experimental measures of single-cell division rates here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but studies that more directly compare expression levels and division times in individual cells are needed to fully address this issue.</p><p>Assuming that the average expression level of a population is near the fitness optimum in a stable environment, but further from the optimum following a change in the environment, our results unify studies showing that increasing expression noise tends to be deleterious in a constant environment but beneficial in a fluctuating one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batada and Hurst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tănase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraser and Kaern, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keren et al., 2016</xref>). Expression noise may be particularly important in the early phase of adaptation to a fluctuating environment, when a new expression optimum makes an increase in noise beneficial and before expression plasticity evolves as a more optimal strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Such plasticity in expression level seems to have already evolved for <italic>TDH3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duveau et al., 2017b</xref>). Our data suggest that high levels of expression noise can also be beneficial in a stable environment when the mean expression level is far from optimal. For example, if an allele driving suboptimally low expression were to be fixed in a population, selection should initially favor alleles that increase mean expression and/or expression noise. After alleles driving mean expression close to the optimum are fixed, selection should then favor alleles with lower levels of expression noise. The relative frequency by which evolution proceeds through these two paths will depend on both the relative frequency of alleles that increase mean expression and expression noise, as well as the fitness differences between these alleles. We note, however, that the often correlated effects of promoter mutations on mean expression level and expression noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vallania et al., 2014</xref>) may limit the ability of natural selection to optimize both mean expression level and expression noise. Future work investigating the effects of other types of mutations on mean expression level, expression noise, and fitness in multiple environments is needed to more fully define the range of variation affecting gene expression upon which natural selection can act.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast strains: genetic backgrounds</title><p>All strains used in this work were haploids with similar genetic backgrounds that were derived from crosses between BY4724, BY4722, BY4730 and BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>) and carry the alleles <italic>RME1(ins-308A); TAO3(1493Q)</italic> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deutschbauer and Davis (2005)</xref> and <italic>SAL1; CAT5(91M); MIP1(661T)</italic> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitrov et al.

We used a random mutagenesis approach to create a large number of alleles with one or several mutations in the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> TATA box. Variants were obtained using PCR SOEing as described above, except that one of the internal overlapping oligonucleotides (primer 2478, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) used to amplify the downstream fragment of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> contained a degenerate version of the wild type TATA box (TATATAAA at position −141 upstream of start codon). This oligonucleotide was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies using hand-mixed nucleotides at the eight bases of the TATA box with a proportion of 73% of the wild type nucleotide and 9% of each of the three alternative nucleotides. At this level of degeneracy,~10% of the DNA molecules should carry no mutation,~25% should carry a single mutation in the TATA box,~35% two mutations,~20% three mutations and ~10% four mutations or more. The degenerate primer was used with oligonucleotide 104 to amplify the right fragment of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic>, and the overlapping primer 2479 was used with oligo 2425 to amplify the left fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Then, these fragments were fused and amplified as described above for the TFBS mutants. Six independent transformations of the fragments containing random mutations in the TATA box were performed in strain YPW1784 to obtain a large number of colonies. After growth on selective medium (Synthetic Complete medium with 0.9 g/L 5-FluoroOrotic Acid), 244 colonies selected regardless of their fluorescence level were streaked on fresh plates (again SC +5 FOA medium) and then replica plated on YPD +Hygromycin B (10 g/L Yeast extract, 20 g/L Peptone, 20 g/L Dextrose and 300 mg/L Hygromycin B) for negative screening. 106 of the resulting strains turned out not to be fluorescent, among which the vast majority were resistant to Hygromycin B, suggesting they were false positive transformants. The remaining 138 strains were all fluorescent and sensitive to Hygromycin B, as expected from true positive transformants. We then tried to amplify <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> in all 244 strains using oligonucleotides 1891 and 1208 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and we only observed a band of correct size after electrophoresis for the 138 fluorescent strains. After Sanger sequencing of the PCR products for the 138 positive strains, the type and frequency of mutations observed in the TATA box were found to be very close to expectation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1—source data 1</xref>). Average expression level and expression noise were measured for all 138 strains as described below. This set of alleles showed broad variation in average expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and had a lower expression noise than TFBS mutations with comparable average expression levels.

Two TATA box variants with 25% and 50% median fluorescence levels were each combined with six different TFBS variants for which median expression ranged from 4% to 45% relative to wild type. The 12 variants were created by PCR SOEing as described above for the double TFBS mutants, except in this case oligonucleotides 2425 and 2788 were used to amplify the upstream <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> fragments and oligonucleotides 2787 and 104 were used to amplify the downstream fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

One of these constructs carried two copies of the wild type <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter, while the others carried mutated versions of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic>. We reasoned that the presence of a second copy of the construct would lead to overexpression of YFP, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>), while differences in noise between the different alleles should be conserved. To construct these alleles, we first fused the selectable marker <italic>URA3</italic> upstream of the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> allele located at the right end of each of the final constructs (‘<italic>CONSTRUCT.2</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) using PCR SOEing. <italic>URA3</italic> was amplified from the <italic>pCORE-UH</italic> plasmid using oligonucleotides 2688 and 2686 and the 13 <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> constructs were amplified from the strains carrying the corresponding <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles using oligonucleotides 2687 and 1893 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> were then fused by overlap extension and the resulting fragments were amplified with oligonucleotides 2684 and 2683 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Finally, each of the 13 different <italic>URA3-P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> PCR products was transformed in the strain carrying the desired allele of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> (strain carrying ‘<italic>CONSTRUCT.1</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). During these transformations, the <italic>KanMX4</italic> drug resistance cassette was replaced with <italic>URA3-P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> by homologous recombination so that the final constructs were <italic>ho::P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub>-URA3-P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic>. To control for the impact of the URA3 marker on the activity of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter, we constructed strain YPW2675 (<italic>ho::P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub>-URA3</italic>) by replacing the <italic>KanMX4</italic> cassette with <italic>URA3</italic> amplified using primers 2684 and 2685 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). YPW2675 was used as the reference when reporting the expression phenotypes (median and noise) of the alleles with two copies of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic>. To validate the sequence of the full (5.2 kb) constructs, we performed two overlapping PCRs using oligonucleotides 2480 and 1499, and 1872 and 2635 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). PCR products were sequenced using primers 2480, 1499, 1204, 1872, 2635, 2686, 1305 and 601 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) to confirm they contained the correct <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles. However, using this PCR approach, insertion of more than two tandem copies of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> would remain undetected. Therefore, we used quantitative pyrosequencing to determine the exact number of copies inserted in the 13 strains. We took advantage of the fact that all <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles inserted at <italic>HO</italic> carried the mutation A293g upstream of the start codon, while the endogenous <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter did not. This allowed us to determine the total number of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> copies at the <italic>HO</italic> locus by quantifying the relative frequency of A and G nucleotides at position −293 across all copies of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter in the genome. For instance, if only one copy of <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> is present at <italic>HO</italic>, then the frequency of G at position −293 is expected to be 0.5, since there is one copy of the G allele at the <italic>HO</italic> locus and one copy of the A allele at the endogenous <italic>TDH3</italic> locus. If two copies are present at HO, a frequency of 2/3 is expected for G, and if three copies are present, a frequency of 0.75 is expected. To determine these allele frequencies, we amplified <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> in five replicates from all strains carrying two copies of the construct as well as from YPW2675 carrying a single copy using oligonucleotides 2268 and 3094 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). PCR products were denatured and purified using a PyroMark Q96 Vacuum Workstation (Qiagen) and pyrosequencing was performed on a PyroMark Q96 ID instrument using oligonucleotide 2270 for sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Allele frequencies were determined from the relative heights of the peaks corresponding to the A and G alleles on the pyrograms, with the typical correction factor of 0.86 applied to A peaks. Using this method, a small but significant bias toward the G allele was detected, as the observed frequency of G in strain YPW2675 was 0.55 instead of 0.5. This could be caused by PCR bias due to the fact that the A and G alleles are located at different genomic positions. We applied the linear correction y = x * (0.5/0.45)–0.111 to remove the effect of this PCR bias when calculating the frequency of G alleles. Overall, we found that six strains had a frequency of G significantly higher than 2/3 (<italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.05). This suggested that these strains carried more than two copies of the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> construct and they were therefore removed from all subsequent analyses (except Var42 for reasons explained below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Extra mutations</title><p>Sanger sequencing revealed that a substantial fraction of all <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles constructed (~25% of sequenced strains) carried an indel of one nucleotide in one of the homopolymer runs present in the promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). These mutations probably result from polymerase slippage during PCR amplification. For some <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles, we were able to isolate independent clones that differed only by the presence or absence of these homopolymer mutations, giving us the opportunity to test the impact of homopolymer length variation on transcriptional activity. Using the fluorescence assay described below, we found that <italic>del431A</italic>, <italic>del54T</italic> and <italic>ins432A</italic> had no detectable effect on median expression level or expression noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

In these strains, the endogenous promoter driving expression of the native TDH3 protein was left unaltered. To measure how variation in TDH3 protein levels induced by mutations in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter could impact cell growth, we inserted the final set of 43 <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles described above upstream of the endogenous <italic>TDH3</italic> coding sequence. <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> variants were integrated in the genetic background of strain YPW1001, which is almost identical to the reference strain YPW1002 used for the expression assays, except that the mating type of YPW1001 is <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> and it carries a <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub>-NatMX4</italic> construct at <italic>HO</italic> conferring resistance to Nourseothricin.

After three days of incubation at 30°C, colony-forming units were counted on all SC +5 FOA plates, allowing the estimation of the frequency of Ura- cells every ~17 generations for a total of ~50 generations. The frequency of Ura- cells was found to increase during the first 34 generations of growth before reaching a plateau representing a state of mutation-selection balance. At this stage, the average frequency of Ura- cells was about 5.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. Therefore, even if spontaneous loss of one <italic>TDH3</italic> copy occurred in a fraction of cells, these events were found to be too rare to have a significant impact on fitness estimates.

Oligonucleotide 1962 is composed of a 5’ sequence of 22 nucleotides priming directly upstream of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter fused to a 3’ sequence of 38 nucleotides homologous to the 3’UTR sequence immediately downstream of <italic>TDH3</italic> coding sequence. Therefore, transformation of the PCR product in strain YPW1121 (<italic>tdh3::URA3-KanMX4-TDH3</italic>) led to the deletion of the <italic>URA3-KanMX4</italic> cassette and of the <italic>TDH3</italic> coding sequence. In this strain, both the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter and the <italic>TDH3</italic> coding sequence are deleted, and the coding sequence of the upstream gene <italic>PDX1</italic> is fused to the terminator sequence of <italic>TDH3</italic>, so that <italic>PDX1</italic> would remain functional.

The expression of Green Fluorescent Protein in YPW1160 cells allowed for highly efficient discrimination from cells expressing the Yellow Fluorescent Protein using flow cytometry.

All strains were revived from −80°C glycerol stocks on YPG plates (10 g Yeast extract, 20 g Peptone, 30 ml Glycerol, 20 g agar per liter) and, after 2 days of growth, arrayed in 96-well plates containing 0.5 ml of YPD medium per well. In addition to the tested strains, the reference strain YPW1002 was inoculated in 24 positions, which were used to correct for plate and position effects on fluorescence. Strain YPW978, which does not contain the <italic>YFP</italic> reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>), was inoculated in one well per plate and used to correct for autofluorescence. Cells were maintained in suspension at 250 rpm by the presence of a 3 mm glass bead in each well. After 20 hr of growth at 30°C, cells were transferred on YPG omnitrays using a V and P Scientific pin tool and grown for 2 days. Next, samples from each omnitray were inoculated in six replicate 96-well plates in 0.5 ml of YPD and grown for 22 hr at 30°C until they reached saturation. At this point, 15 μl of each culture was diluted into 0.5 ml of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) in 96-well plates. Fluorescence was recorded for ~20,000 events per well using a BD Accuri C6 instrument coupled with a HyperCyt autosampler (IntelliCyt Corp). A 488 nm laser was used for excitation and a 530/30 optical filter for acquisition of the YFP signal. A modified version of this protocol was used to measure the fluorescence of the final set of 43 <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> variants with experimental conditions more similar to those experienced during the competition growth assays. After the 22 hr of growth in YPD, samples were not immediately run on the flow cytometer, but instead they were diluted to fresh medium every 12 hr for 36 hr to reach steady exponential phase of growth. Prior to each dilution, cell density was measured for all samples using a Sunrise absorbance reader (Tecan) and one dilution factor was calculated for each 96-well plate so that the average cell density would reach 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml after 12 hr of growth. This procedure ensured that all samples were maintained in constant exponential growth since no sample reached a density above 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml, while limiting the strength of genetic drift since the number of cells transferred during dilution was larger than 10,000. Another difference with the protocol mentioned above is that no glass bead was added to the plates. Instead, cells were maintained in suspension by fitting the culture plates on a rotating wheel. After 36 hr of growth, samples were diluted to 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in PBS and the fluorescence of 20,000 events per well was acquired by flow cytometry. Flow data (FCS files) used to quantify fluorescence levels produced by the 43 <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles are available in the FlowRepository (flowrepository.org) under experiment ID FR-FCM-ZY8Y.</p></sec><sec id="s3-15-2"><title>Relationship between mRNA levels and fluorescence</title><p>The relationship between fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and fluorophore concentration in a cell is expected to be positive and monotonic, but this relationship is not necessarily linear (Wang and Gaigalas 2011). For most flow cytometers, the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages can be calibrated to approach a linear relationship for the range of fluorescence intensities covered by the samples, but this cannot be done on the Accuri C6 because PMT voltages are fixed. Instead, we empirically determined the function relating fluorescence intensities to <italic>YFP</italic> mRNA levels using eight strains with different fluorescence levels and then we applied this function to transform fluorescence intensities for each cell of every sample. The function between fluorophore concentration (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and fluorescence intensity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) was previously determined to be of the form <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (Wang and Gaigalas 2011). In our case, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> represents mRNA level instead of fluorophore concentration, but this should not affect the shape of the function since previous studies found a linear relationship between mRNA levels and fluorophore concentration (Wolf <italic>et al.</italic> 2015; Kafri <italic>et al.</italic> 2016). To determine the constants <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>, we measured fluorescence intensity and <italic>YFP mRNA</italic> levels in eight strains covering the whole range of fluorescence levels expressed by the strains included in this study. First, three replicates of YPW978 (non-fluorescent strain), YPW2683 (<italic>ho::P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic>/<italic>ho::P<sub>TDH3</sub>-GFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> diploid) and seven strains carrying variants of the <italic>ho::P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub></italic> construct with different <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) were grown for 24 hours at 30°C in 5 ml of YPD, along with 24 replicates of strain YPW1182 expressing GFP (same genetic background as YPW1160, except with <italic>MATα</italic> mating type). All samples were then diluted to a density of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in fresh YPD medium and grown for another 4 hours. Next, 0.1 ml of each culture was transferred to 0.4 ml of PBS and fluorescence intensity was immediately scored for ~20,000 events per sample on the BD Accuri C6 instrument.</p><p>In parallel, for each replicate of the tested strains, 0.5 ml of culture was mixed with 0.5 ml of one of the 24 cultures of YPW1182 strain in a microcentrifuge tube. Genomic DNA and RNA were co-extracted from the 24 mixed populations using a modified version of Promega SV Total RNA Isolation System and cDNA was synthesized from RNA samples as previously described (Metzger <italic>et al.</italic> 2015). Then, pyrosequencing was performed to quantify the relative frequency of <italic>YFP</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> sequences in gDNA and cDNA samples (Wittkopp 2011). The pyrosequencing assay was designed to quantify allele frequency at a position located 607 bp downstream of the <italic>YFP</italic> start codon, for which a GT/TA difference exists between <italic>YFP</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> coding sequences. A region that encompassed this polymorphism was amplified in all gDNA and cDNA samples using oligonucleotides 2723 and 2725 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These oligonucleotides were designed to anneal both to <italic>YFP</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> coding sequences, which are 98% identical. Pyrosequencing was performed on a PyroMark Q96 ID instrument using oligonucleotide 2726 for sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Because the sequenced region contained two variable positions (G/T and T/A), we determined allele frequencies separately for each position and used the average as the relative frequency of <italic>YFP</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> alleles. For each sample, we then calculated <italic>YFP</italic> mRNA level relative to the reference strain YPW1002 using the measured frequency of <italic>YFP</italic> allele in gDNA and cDNA. First, we corrected for small biases in allele frequencies that could be caused by PCR bias. To do this, we took advantage of the fact that true allele frequencies were known for gDNA samples of YPW1002 (100% <italic>YFP</italic>), YPW2683 (50% <italic>YFP</italic>) and YPW1182 (0% <italic>YFP</italic>). We regressed the measured allele frequencies on the true allele frequencies for all gDNA replicates of these three samples using R <italic>smooth.spline</italic> function. The fitted model was then used to correct allele frequencies for all other gDNA and cDNA samples. Our next goal was to calculate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, defined as the abundance of <italic>YFP</italic> mRNA expressed by each tested strain relative to the abundance of <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA expressed by YPW1182.

First, the clustering functions of <italic>flowClust</italic> were used to filter out all events that did not correspond to single cells based on the height and the area of the forward scatter signal. Then, the intensity of the fluorescence signal was scaled by cell size in several steps. We first performed a principal component analysis on the logarithm of forward scatter (FSC.A) and logarithm of fluorescence (FL1.A) for all filtered events. Next, we defined the vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> between the origin and the intersection of the two eigenvectors.

For this reason, we decided to use head-to-head competition assays between strains expressing different levels of TDH3 protein and a common reference strain (YPW1160) to measure relative growth rate, which is a more sensitive method than directly measuring the absolute growth rate of each isolated strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallet et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the additive effect of micro-environmental variation on growth estimates is nullified during competitive growth, because the two competitors are grown in the same microenvironment. Relative growth rate during log-phase was used as a proxy for fitness in this study, although this is not the only component of fitness.</p><p>To identify experimental conditions that would allow accurate estimates of fitness (precision of at least 10<sup>−3</sup>) while keeping cost and labor reasonable, we first performed a power analysis based on simulations to determine how experimental parameters affected accuracy. We decided that during the competition assays cells would be maintained in the logarithmic phase of growth by repeated dilutions in small volume of medium in 96-well plates to handle large number of samples in parallel. Six different parameters associated with this experimental design were varied in the simulations: (1) The number of biological replicates for each sample; (2) The starting frequency of the two strains competed against each other; (3) The difference in fitness between the two competitors; (4) The number of generations after dilution to fresh medium, a parameter that determined the number of cells transferred (or the bottleneck size) after each dilution; (5) The number of dilution cycles, which also determined the number of times the relative frequency of the competed strains was assessed; (6) The number of cells counted each time the relative frequency of the competed strains was assessed. For each of 20,160 combinations of parameter values, the competition assay was simulated 5000 times to estimate the standard deviation of the selection coefficient. Then, given this standard deviation and the tested number of replicates, R function <italic>power.t.test</italic> was used to determine the minimum difference in selection coefficient that could be detected with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.95. All six parameters were found to have an impact on the precision of the selection coefficient, but to different degrees. Interestingly, precision was maximized for intermediate values of the number of generations between two consecutive dilutions and for intermediate values of the total number of dilution cycles, because of the impact of these parameters on genetic drift. To achieve a precision close to 10<sup>−3</sup> in the actual competition experiment, we decided to use eight replicates per sample, to mix the two competing strains in equal proportion, to use a common competitor strain (YPW1160) that had a similar fitness as the wild-type strain (YPW1189), to grow cells for about eight generations of the common competitor after each dilution, to use a total of four phases of growth followed by dilutions and to score genotype frequencies at four time points by screening at least 50,000 cells per sample on the flow cytometer.</p><p>The tested strains carrying different alleles of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter at the native locus and expressing YFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) were arrayed on four 96-well plates in 0.5 ml of YPD, with two replicates of each strain on each plate. In parallel, the common competitor YPW1160 expressing GFP was also arrayed on four 96-well plates in 0.5 ml of YPD. All plates were incubated for 24 hr at 30°C on a rotating wheel. After measuring cell densities using a Sunrise plate reader, an equal volume of YFP and GFP cell cultures were mixed together and diluted in 0.5 ml of YPD in four 96-well plates. The dilution factor was calculated for each plate based on the doubling time of the GFP strain (YPW1160) so that the average cell density would reach ~5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml after 12 hr of growth. This procedure of cell density measurement and dilution followed by 12 hr of growth was repeated three times and constituted the acclimation phase of the experiment, during which the relative frequency of YFP and GFP strains was not recorded. After this acclimation phase, samples were diluted every 10 hr in fresh YPD for a total of 30 hr of exponential growth. Cell density was measured for all samples prior to each dilution. Immediately after dilution to fresh medium, samples were diluted in 0.3 ml of PBS to a final density of 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in four 96-well plates and placed on ice to stop growth. ~75,000 events were recorded for each sample on a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer, using a 488 nm laser for excitation and two different optical filters (510/10 and 585/40) to acquire fluorescence. These filters allowed separation of the GFP and YFP signals. With this protocol, the relative frequency of YFP and GFP cells was measured at four time points during the competition assays.

After log<sub>10</sub> transformation of the raw data, artifacts were removed by excluding events with extreme values of forward scatter (FSC.A and FSC.H) or fluorescence intensity (FL1.H and FL2.H). FL1.H corresponds to the height of the fluorescence signal acquired through the 510/10 filter, which is more sensitive to GFP emission, and FL2.H corresponds to the height of the fluorescence signal acquired through the 585/40 filter, which is more sensitive to YFP emission. Next, a principal component analysis was performed on the logarithm of FL1.H and FL2.H. The first principal component captured differences in fluorescence caused by variation in cell size, while the second component captured differences in fluorescence between cells expressing YFP and GFP. We then computed the Kernel density estimate of the second component, which allowed the separation of three populations of cells: (1) GFP cells with high scores on the second component, (2) YFP cells with low scores and (3) a smaller population with intermediate scores considered as doublets, <italic>i.e.</italic> events corresponding to two cells scored simultaneously, one expressing YFP and the other GFP.

The median number of generations for all samples grown on a same 96-well plate was used as a rough estimate of the number of generations for the samples of the plate.

For each tested strain, samples for which fitness departed from the median fitness among all eight replicate populations by more than five times the median absolute deviation were considered outliers and were excluded from further analysis. Outliers could occur for several reasons, one of them being the random appearance of a beneficial (or compensatory) de novo mutation during competitive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallet et al., 2012</xref>). For each sample, the fitness relative to the GFP strain was then divided by the mean fitness obtained for all replicate populations of the reference strain YPW1189 (for single-copy <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> variants) or YPW2682 (for double-copy <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> variants). We then calculated the mean relative fitness and standard deviation over the eight replicate populations of each tested strain. This measure of fitness expressed relative to a strain with the reference <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter sequence was used in all subsequent analyses.

This experimental design allowed differences in fitness caused by variation in noise to be directly observed without the assumption of transitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallet et al., 2012</xref>) and without the need to correct for the correlation between median expression and noise. In these experiments, we doubled the number of replicate populations (16) and the number of generations of growth (~42) to achieve greater precision in the fitness estimates for each pair of strains. We also measured the relative frequency of the two competitors using quantitative pyrosequencing instead of flow cytometry. This method did not require the expression of different fluorescent markers to distinguish cells from the two strains, allowing us to compete strains that only differed genetically by the mutations in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter affecting expression noise.</p><p>The competition assays were performed as described above, with the following differences in the protocol. First, strains with low noise and strains with high noise were arrayed each on two 96-well plates, with 16 replicates per genotype. After incubation on YPG omnitrays and growth to saturation in YPD, equal volumes of cultures of strains with low noise and high noise were mixed together and diluted in 0.5 ml of YPD. Following 36 hours of acclimation (as described above), six cycles of dilution followed by 12 hours of growth were performed. Dilution factors were calculated so that the average cell density on each plate would reach ~5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml at the next dilution time point. Once every two cycles, the remaining cell cultures were centrifuged immediately after dilution and the pellets were stored in 30 μl of water at -80°C for later PCR amplification and pyrosequencing, so that genotype frequencies were quantified at four time points during the experiment. Cell pellets were thawed in the week after freezing and 15 μl of each sample was transferred in 30 μl of Zymolyase 20T (3 mg/ml) in 0.1M Sorbitol. After 15 minutes of incubation at 37°C, plates were vortexed vigorously for 15 seconds to disrupt cell wall and centrifuged at 3220 rcf for four minutes in an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge. 5 μl of supernatant were used as PCR template in 50 μl reactions that also included 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mM of each dNTP), 2.5 μl of forward and reverse primers (10 μM each), 10 μl of 5x KAPA2G Buffer B, 0.4 μl of KAPA2G Robust HotStart DNA polymerase (5U/μl) and 28.6 μl of water. The oligonucleotides used for each sample were specific to the target mutation in <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). After 42 cycles of amplification, PCR products were denatured and purified using a PyroMark Q96 Vacuum Workstation (Qiagen) and pyrosequencing was performed on a PyroMark Q96 ID instrument using sequencing primers specific to the target mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The frequency of the two genotypes was determined for each sample from the relative heights of the peaks corresponding to the two alternative nucleotides on the pyrograms. Samples with an average peak height below 5 were excluded, as this could result from weak PCR and cause biases in measured allele frequency. The number of generations between each time point was estimated using the cell densities before each dilution and the dilution factors as described above.

Therefore, a fitness value above 1 meant that the strain with high noise grew faster than the strains with low noise, while a fitness value below 1 meant that the strain with low noise grew faster than the strain with high noise. For each pair of strains, replicates for which fitness departed from the median fitness across all 16 replicates by more than five times the median absolute deviation were considered outliers and were excluded.

Therefore, we used LOESS regression to describe the relationship between median expression and fitness from the data collected with the set of 43 <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles, using the R function <italic>loess</italic> with a span of 2/3. Next, we tested the impact of expression noise on fitness, which was complicated by the fact that expression noise is correlated with median expression and by the fact that median expression is expected to have a larger impact on fitness than expression noise. To disentangle the effects of median expression and noise on fitness, we first calculated the residuals (ΔNoise) from a LOESS regression (span = 2/3) of expression noise on median expression. Next, we used a similar approach to calculate the residuals (ΔFitness) from a LOESS regression (span = 2/3) of fitness on median expression. ΔFitness is the variation in fitness that cannot be explained by a difference in median expression in our dataset. To test whether ΔFitness could be at least partially explained by variation in expression noise, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between ΔNoise and ΔFitness and used the R function <italic>cor.test</italic> to test for significance of this correlation. We excluded the two strains that showed a median expression level above 125%, because the number of samples with high expression was too low for meaningful interpretation of ΔNoise and ΔFitness in this range of expression levels. In addition, we compared the correlations between ΔNoise and ΔFitness for two different classes of promoter variants determined based on their expression levels. First, we determined the maximum fitness from the LOESS regression of fitness on median expression. Next, we estimated the median expression value that would lead to a 0.005 reduction in fitness relative to the maximum. This expression value was used as a threshold to determine which strains had an expression close to the optimum or far from it. Three quantitative parameters were determined arbitrarily in these analyses: the span of the two LOESS regressions and the reduction in fitness used to determine the expression threshold. To test the robustness of the results to variation in these parameters, we calculated the correlations between ΔNoise and ΔFitness for 100 combinations of parameters where the span of the LOESS regressions took one of five values (2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6 and 1) and the reduction in fitness took one of four values (0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075 and 0.01). In addition, we used permutation tests to compare median expression, ΔNoise values and ΔFitness values between two groups of genotypes: those with ΔNoise values below −1 (low noise) and those with ΔNoise values above 1 (high noise). For each parameter considered (median expression, ΔNoise and ΔFitness), the observed values were randomly shuffled between the two groups 100,000 times. P-values were then calculated as the proportion of shuffled groups for which the absolute difference of median was greater than the observed difference of median between the groups before shuffling. All analyses were repeated for the four different metrics of noise mentioned above (Noise strength, SD, CV* and log(CV*)).</p></sec><sec id="s3-18"><title>Expression and fitness measured using TDH3-YFP fusion proteins</title><p>One important assumption in our analyses of the relationship between <italic>TDH3</italic> expression and fitness is that the median and noise of expression measured using the fluorescent reporter constructs inserted at <italic>HO</italic> are representative of the expression level of the TDH3 protein when the promoter variants are introduced at the native <italic>TDH3</italic> locus. To test whether the effects of mutations in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter were the same when introduced at <italic>HO</italic> or at the native <italic>TDH3</italic> locus, we constructed a <italic>TDH3-YFP</italic> fusion gene at the <italic>TDH3</italic> locus and then introduced 20 different <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles upstream of this reporter gene, including eight TFBS and four TATA box variants that were present in the competition assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1—source data 1</xref>). To fuse the coding sequences of <italic>TDH3</italic> and <italic>YFP</italic>, we amplified the <italic>YFP-T<sub>CYC1</sub>-KanMX4</italic> construct from strain YPW1002 using primers 3415 and 3416 and transformed the PCR product in the non-fluorescent strain YPW978. Primer 3415 was designed to remove the stop codon of <italic>TDH3</italic> and the start codon of <italic>YFP</italic> and to insert a 30 bp linker between the coding sequences of the two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). Then, the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter was replaced with a <italic>CORE-UH</italic> cassette (<italic>URA3-HphMX4</italic>) amplified with oligonucleotides 1909 and 1910 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) to create strain YPW1618. The 20 <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles were amplified from the native locus in the strains previously constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1—source data 1</xref>) using oligonucleotides 1344 and 1342 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and transformed into YPW1618 to replace the <italic>CORE-UH</italic> cassette. The presence of the expected mutations was confirmed by sequencing PCR products obtained with primers 1345 and 1952 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The fluorescence level of the strains expressing the fusion proteins was measured in parallel to the fluorescence of strains carrying the same <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic> alleles at the <italic>HO</italic> locus. Four replicate samples of each strain were analyzed by flow cytometry after growth in YPD medium as described above. The expression of the reporter gene at the <italic>HO</italic> locus was found to be a strong predictor of the expression of the gene fusion at the native <italic>TDH3</italic> locus, both for median expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) and for expression noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76).

In addition, the impact of fusing YFP to TDH3 on fitness was quantified by comparing the competitive growth rate of strain YPW1002 expressing YFP from the <italic>HO</italic> locus to the growth rate of strain YPW1964 expressing the TDH3-YFP protein fusion. The expression of the fusion protein was found to cause a 2.5% reduction in fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which could be caused by altered function and/or stability of the TDH3 protein when fused with YFP. For this reason, we decided not to use protein fusions to measure the fitness associated with different levels of TDH3 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-19"><title>Modeling the relationship between single cell expression level and population fitness</title><p>To understand how cell-to-cell variability in gene expression level could contribute to population fitness, we performed individual-based stochastic simulations of the growth of clonal populations of cells covering a wide range of mean expression and expression noise values of a single gene.

In the body of the simulation, each single cell was evaluated to determine if the current <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf112"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was greater than the remaining time in the experiment assessed for that cell, and if so, the cell divided, at which point new expression levels were drawn randomly from the normal distribution <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf113"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒩</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and independently for the mother and daughter cells.

Experiment duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was set at 1000 minutes for ease of computation. 100 replicates of each stochastic simulation were run to estimate 95% confidence intervals on fitness estimates. Simulations were coded in MATLAB R2015 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-20"><title>Measuring single-cell division rates</title><p>We performed time-lapse imaging of cells grown in microfluidic devices to compare the distributions of doubling time among four strains chosen for their differences in <italic>TDH3</italic> mean expression level and expression noise (strains YPW2879, YPW2868, YPW3064 and YPW3047 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The four strains were assayed on four consecutive days using the same procedure. First, cells were grown to saturation in liquid YPD medium at 30°C for ~16 hr. Then, 100 μl of culture was transferred in 5 ml of fresh YPD and grown for another 4 hr at 30°C until it reached an optical density at 660 nm comprised between 0.2 and 0.3 (~3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). At this point, ~100 μl of cell culture was injected in a microfluidic chip using a 1 ml syringe. Microfluidic devices consisted of a PDMS (Polydymethylsiloxane) chip mounted on a 24 mm x 60 mm coverslip, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llamosi et al., 2016</xref>. Each device contained five imaging chambers of 200 × 200×3.7 μm where a monolayer of cells could be grown. These chambers were connected on two sides to wide flow channels of 100 μm height where YPD medium was allowed to flow at 120 ul/min using an Ismatec IPC tubing pump. Cells were imaged using an inverted microscope (Olympus IX83) equipped with a CoolLED pE-300 illumination system, a Zyla sCMOS camera (Andor) and an IX3-ZDC2 system for autofocus. The temperature of the entire microfluidic system was maintained at 30°C in a Plexiglass chamber covering the microscope (Life Imaging Services). After 60 min of acclimation to growth in the microfluidic device, one bright field image and one fluorescence image were recorded once every six minutes for twenty hours at five positions centered on each of the five imaging chambers using a 60x oil immersion objective (Olympus PlanApo N 60x). Only images obtained during the first eight hours (80 frames) were analyzed, because tracking was not reliable after this time because of high cell densities. Fluorescence images captured expression from the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP</italic> reporter gene in each strain with a wild-type TDH3 promoter that was used for cell counting in the fitness assays. We were unable to reliably track individual cells and to correctly assign buds to their mother cells with a software for automated image analysis (ilastik v1.3.0) using this cytoplasmic YFP expression, thus we measured doubling times by analyzing the bright field images manually with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Raw bright field and fluorescence images, as well as bright field images where cell division events were annotated, are available on Zenodo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</ext-link>) with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.1327545. For each movie, we randomly selected eight cells on the first frame and determined the doubling times of all cells produced by these eight starting cells. The doubling time of a cell was defined as the time separating the appearance of two consecutive buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following this procedure, we quantified the doubling time of at least 362 cells for each of the four genotypes. We then compared the mean doubling time and the standard deviation of doubling time for pairs of genotypes using permutation tests in R: doubling time values of the two genotypes were pooled and resampled 10<sup>5</sup> times without replacement in two groups of same size as the number of cells analyzed for the two genotypes. P-values were calculated as the proportion of permutations for which the absolute difference of mean doubling time (or standard deviation) between the two groups was greater than the observed absolute difference between the two genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-21"><title>Computational analyses</title><p>Custom R scripts containing the code used to process and analyze data as described above are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kevin J Verstrepen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see below, both reviewers liked the work. They appreciated the concept and recommended the experiments. Regarding the conclusions, the reviewers felt that they were rather expected, somewhat reducing enthusiasm.</p><p>The most important shared concern is whether the mutants used in this study offer a fair comparison to natural variants with different noise levels. The potential discrepancy between artificial and natural variants seems difficult to avoid, but at the very least, it should be acknowledged and critically discussed. We do recommend that you will perform the experiments suggested which relate to this point (in particular, measuring single-cell growth). Both reviewers felt that they will significantly upgrade the work, although they did not consider it as a must for publication. Critical discussion of this point was considered to be essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Duveau et al. examines the impact of expression levels and noise in synthetic mutants of <italic>TDH3</italic>. This group has previously demonstrated that noise in <italic>TDH3</italic> expression is under purifying selection in wild yeast (Metzger et al., 2015), and this paper follows up on this finding by showing that, at least for synthetic mutants in a stable environment, the fitness effect of expression noise depends on the mean expression level and vice versa. Higher noise is generally beneficial when <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level is far from the optimum, but deleterious when near the optimum. The study is technically rigorous and carefully performed, and the results, although expected from previous theoretical and experimental work in expression noise and bet hedging, do experimentally demonstrate the important interdependence between mean expression level and noise on fitness in a stable environment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors select 43 of 171 constructs generated to study further based on the expression level and expression noise profiles. However, the reader never sees the data for the full set and it is difficult to determine if the chosen set is representative. This should be included in a supplemental figure.</p><p>2) Naturally occurring variants of in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter were not studied here because the authors report that they strongly co-vary, making it difficult to separate the fitness effects of mean expression level and noise. Shouldn't the relationship of covariance of these variants, which have seen natural selection, be different from the designed mutations used here? Based on the results presented here, one would predict that the LOESS curves of the relationship between median expression and noise would have different patterns, with few naturally occurring variants displaying both low expression and low noise. Along similar lines, it appears from previous work (Metzger et al., 2015) that naturally occurring variation appears to only increase expression noise. Is this only happening when <italic>TDH3</italic> expression is far from the optimum?</p><p>3) More generally, I am having trouble connecting the results presented here to naturally occurring expression noise. The authors have convincingly demonstrated that higher noise is favored in a stable environment when the mean expression is far from the optimum. Based on previous theoretical and experimental work, this was expected. However, does this have anything to do with why expression noise varies across genotypes or genes? At least two other possibilities exist: (1) the fitness effects of changes in noise are not strong enough to be subject to selection (Metzger et al., 2015, shows this is likely not to be true for <italic>TDH3</italic>), or (2) higher noise is more fit in fluctuating environments. A reasonable hypothesis is that optimal expression levels of <italic>TDH3</italic> (involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) would be highly dependent on nutrient availability of the environment, and that nutrient availability could change quickly, making high noise in expression adaptive. This hypothesis is supported by a number of studies that find bet-hedging-like mechanisms are playing out during nutrient shifts. Yet, this possibility is not directly addressed in this manuscript, rather the entire manuscript assumes that a stable environment with respect to <italic>TDH3</italic> expression can be reached. Thus, beyond careful experimental validation of an expected result, I am unsure what I have learned from this work. Comparisons between synthetic mutants and naturally occurring variation or across environmental fluctuations may be needed to increase impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This study measures the fitness effect of a set of 236 mutant alleles of the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. YFP fusions were used to estimate <italic>TDH3</italic> transcriptional activity and expression noise. Some of the mutants showed a different average expression of <italic>TDH3</italic>, some showed a different noise level, and most showed a combination of these effects. Comparing the fitness effects and transcription phenotype of different mutants indicates that high expression noise is detrimental when the average expression is close to the optimum/wild-type level, whereas increased noise has a positive fitness effect when the average expression levels deviate from the optimal/wild-type levels. Together, these results further confirm earlier studies that suggest that noise can help to diminish the negative fitness effects associated with a suboptimal (average) expression level because a fraction of the population will have a more optimal expression level (and this faster-growing fraction drives the average growth rate up), while on the other hand, noise may be selected against in populations where average expression is near-optimal.</p><p>Despite a few issues that merit a response from the authors (indicated below), I really like this study because its elegant and simple design provides leads to a clear conclusion that helps to answers an important question. Specifically, I appreciate the efforts to provide solid experimental data and the fair discussion of the results. Moreover, the text is particularly well-written.</p><p>I see four issues that perhaps should be addressed or at least acknowledged in the Discussion section.</p><p>Firstly, one can never be completely sure that the promoter variants that are generated offer a good and fair comparison to naturally-occurring variation in expression noise. For example, in theory, it is possible that some promoter/TATA box mutations might have pleiotropic fitness effects. I understand that this is difficult to avoid, and that the use of many different mutants at least partly mitigates this worry, but perhaps it should be acknowledged in the Discussion section.</p><p>Second, whereas widely accepted as a good method to measure expression noise, using promoter-YFP fusions as a proxy for expression/mRNA abundance inevitably has some shortcomings. I don't think it necessary to directly measure RNA levels in single cells across all the mutants, but perhaps a few mutants could be assayed to confirm that expression is accurately estimated? Moreover, the YFP fusions may also not perfectly align with Tdh3 protein levels (for example if Tdh3 levels would also be controlled post-transcriptionally). Making Tdh3-YFP fusions would only partly resolve this issue, as the YFP tag may influence Tdh3 stability. While these effects are again difficult to avoid and are unlikely to cause serious artefacts, it would be good to mention the issue in the discussion.</p><p>Third, it is a pity that the authors do not directly link single-cell expression levels with fitness. Instead, they use a model that tried to link a cell's <italic>TDH3</italic> expression to its replicative fitness. Using Tdh3-YFP protein fusions combined with single-cell monitoring technologies (e.g. simply using time-lapse microscopy to evaluate the growth rate a few single cells as they grow into microcolonies or using flow cells such as the commercially available CellAsic system), it should be relatively easy to directly measure the replication rate of cells and correlate this with the individual <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level (as estimated by YFP fluorescence). This would really tie the study together and allow linking noise to individual fitness to population-level fitness (as also suggested by the authors in the Conclusions section).</p><p>Fourth, is the number of cells with average (population-level) expression close to the optimum large enough to draw reliable conclusions? Given the considerable variation in the relation between fitness and mean expression level observed in the (much larger) set of mutants where average expression is not optimal, my gut feeling dictates some caution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37272.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see below, both reviewers liked the work. They appreciated the concept and recommended the experiments. Regarding the conclusions, the reviewers felt that they were rather expected, somewhat reducing enthusiasm.</p><p>The most important shared concern is whether the mutants used in this study offer a fair comparison to natural variants with different noise levels. The potential discrepancy between artificial and natural variants seems difficult to avoid, but at the very least, it should be acknowledged and critically discussed. We do recommend that you will perform the experiments suggested which relate to this point (in particular, measuring single-cell growth). Both reviewers felt that they will significantly upgrade the work, although they did not consider it as a must for publication. Critical discussion of this point was considered to be essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments, which we address below in turn.</p><p>1) We agree that our findings are consistent with the benefits of noise in changing environments discussed in the bet hedging literature (and say so in the Conclusions section), but we think there is novelty in describing beneficial effects of noise in the absence of environmental fluctuations. To the best of our knowledge, such effects have not previously been observed or predicted outside of the theoretical papers we cite. (If you can point us to studies we missed, we’d be happy to cite them.) Perhaps more importantly, we think that even if variability in the fitness effects of noise caused by differences in mean expression were anticipated in a constant environment, empirically demonstrating these effects – and quantifying the fitness effects of noise more generally – still provides a significant advance for the field.</p><p>2) We agree that the mutant alleles used to disentangle fitness effects of mean and noise have different properties than natural variants: selection has limited variation in noise among naturally occurring alleles (Metzger et al., 2015) and mean expression in all natural variants tested is close to the expression optimum (Duveau et al., 2017). Although most of the mutants analyzed in the current study differ from naturally occurring alleles by only a few base-pairs or one duplication event, we do not expect most of these alleles to survive in natural populations because of their effects on mean expression and/or expression noise. Using these mutants was necessary, however, to quantify the effects of noise on fitness.</p><p>To make these differences between natural variants and mutant alleles clearer to readers, we have added the following sentences to subsection “Generating cariation in expression noise independent of average expression level” describing the construction of alleles in the revised version:</p><p>“These mutant alleles captured a much greater range of mean expression and expression noise than <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles segregating in natural populations (Metzger et al., 2015; Duveau et al., 2017a) and allowed us to more fully explore the relationship between mean, noise and fitness than would be possible using naturally occurring variation alone.”</p><p>We have also added the following text to the Conclusions section to give a more concrete example of how we see our observations potentially affecting evolution of gene expression in natural populations:</p><p>“Our data suggest that high levels of expression noise can also be beneficial in a stable environment when the mean expression level is far from optimal. […] The relative frequency by which evolution proceeds through these two paths will depend on both the relative frequency of alleles that increase mean expression and expression noise, as well as the fitness differences between these alleles.”</p><p>3) We agree with the reviewers that directly relating single-cell expression and single-cell growth rates is a critical next step for the field. In fact, the first author has spent most of the last year in another lab developing microfluidic and microscopy tools to perform this experiment properly. As described below in response to reviewer 2, we were unable to perform this experiment exactly as suggested; however, we were able to trace single-cell lineages using time-lapse microscopy and compare the distributions of single-cell division times between genotypes with different levels of <italic>TDH3</italic> expression noise. We observed a significantly greater standard deviation for single-cell division times in genotypes with higher expression noise. We were also able to detect the expected faster cell division rate for genotypes with mean expression closer to the optimum. These data are consistent with assumptions used in the computational model and are presented as a supplemental figure referenced in subsection “Simulating population growth reveals fitness effects of noise” as follows:</p><p>“Empirical measures of single-cell division rates were consistent with these elements of the model, showing more variable cell division times in genotypes with greater <italic>TDH3</italic> expression noise and shorter cell division times in genotypes with mean <italic>TDH3</italic> expression closer to the fitness optimum (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors select 43 of 171 constructs generated to study further based on the expression level and expression noise profiles.

(2015) in the initial submission. Perhaps the reviewer was thinking of the 236 point mutations in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter that tended to increase expression noise (Metzger et al., 2015)? We mentioned that the strong covariance between mean and noise for these genotypes made them insufficient for measuring the fitness effects of noise.</p><p>The naturally occurring alleles were not used in the current study because of their low levels of variation in expression noise and mean expression. Converting fluorescence based measures of expression reported for naturally occurring alleles in Metzger et al. (2015) and Duveau et al. (2017) to the estimated mRNA expression levels used in the current study, showed that the 27 naturally occurring haplotypes studied all had mean expression levels between 80% and 140% of the wild-type allele and would thus be classified as “close to the optimum”. Because of this limited variation in mean and noise, it is not possible to assess the fitness effects of expression noise or the relationship between median expression and noise resulting from naturally occurring alleles with mean expression far from the optimum. Given their range of effects on median expression and expression noise, no significant fitness differences are expected to exist among natural <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles, consistent with the hypothesis that these variants are well adapted for growth in the environment assayed and that they are not useful to investigate how variation in median expression and noise affects fitness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More generally, I am having trouble connecting the results presented here to naturally occurring expression noise. The authors have convincingly demonstrated that higher noise is favored in a stable environment when the mean expression is far from the optimum.

At least two other possibilities exist: (1) the fitness effects of changes in noise are not strong enough to be subject to selection (Metzger et al., 2015, shows this is likely not to be true for TDH3), or (2) higher noise is more fit in fluctuating environments.

Yet, this possibility is not directly addressed in this manuscript, rather the entire manuscript assumes that a stable environment with respect to TDH3 expression can be reached. Thus, beyond careful experimental validation of an expected result, I am unsure what I have learned from this work. Comparisons between synthetic mutants and naturally occurring variation or across environmental fluctuations may be needed to increase impact.</p></disp-quote><p>The goal for this study was not to explain observed levels of variation in expression noise for one or all genes in natural populations, but rather to understand how expression noise impacts fitness under different scenarios. By doing so, we identified scenarios under which higher levels of noise are beneficial even without the environmental shifts required for bet-hedging. We believe this result is important for several reasons. First, the beneficial effect of noise has been mostly studied in the context of bet-hedging when the optimal expression level changes over time due to environmental fluctuations. To our knowledge, few theoretical studies described how expression noise impacted fitness when the expression optimum remained unchanged (Zhang et al., 2009; Tǎnase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008) and our study is the first one providing experimental demonstration of the beneficial effect of noise far from the optimum. Second, we expect the beneficial (or detrimental) effect of increased noise to hold as long as the median expression level remains far from (or close to) optimum, which is a condition less restrictive and more realistic than a completely stable environment. For instance, the expression of several yeast genes was shown to remain close to optimal despite environmental change (Keren et al., 2016). A shift away from the optimal expression level may occur either through fixation of a deleterious allele by genetic drift or more likely by exposure to a novel environment that was rarely or never experienced in the past. Under such conditions, our results show that a change in median expression level is not the only beneficial option (as generally expected), but an increase in expression noise can also provide a selective advantage. Whether evolution proceeds through changes in median expression, expression noise or both depends not only on the fitness consequences of variation in median expression and expression noise, but also on the effects of new mutations on these two properties.</p><p>Determining to what extent differences in expression noise among genes is explained by selection in constant or fluctuating environments is difficult without knowing the past ecological history of natural populations. For <italic>TDH3</italic> specifically, as described above, comparing the effects of synthetic mutants and naturally occurring variation showed that selection has acted to minimize variation in expression noise (Metzger et al., 2015). This observation does not support the hypothesis proposed by the reviewer for which high noise in expression would be adaptive. However, our results are consistent with a scenario where median <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level is close to optimum for natural populations in their natural environments and therefore increased noise is counter-selected.</p><p>To try to make the implications of our findings for naturally occurring variation more concrete, we added this scenario to the Conclusions section:</p><p>“Our data suggest that high levels of expression noise can also be beneficial in a stable environment when the mean expression level is far from optimal. For example, if an allele driving suboptimally low expression were to be fixed in a population, selection should initially favor alleles that increase mean expression and/or expression noise. After alleles driving mean expression close to the optimum are fixed, selection should then favor alleles with lower levels of expression noise. The relative frequency by which evolution proceeds through these two paths will depend on both the relative frequency of alleles that increase mean expression and expression noise, as well as the fitness differences between these alleles.”</p><p>We also previously found evidence that the differences in median <italic>TDH3</italic> expression level observed after growth in different carbon sources was maintained by stabilizing selection, further suggesting that median expression was near the optimum despite changes in nutrient availability. This observation is now pointed out explicitly in the revised Conclusions section:</p><p>“Such plasticity in expression level seems to have already evolved for <italic>TDH3</italic> (Duveau et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I see four issues that perhaps should be addressed or at least acknowledged in the Discussion section.</p><p>Firstly, one can never be completely sure that the promoter variants that are generated offer a good and fair comparison to naturally-occurring variation in expression noise.

Although we did not perform single-cell RNA sequencing to compare to single-cell fluorescence, we did compare mean levels of YFP fluorescence to mean YFP mRNA abundance for populations of cells, as described in the methods section titled “Relationship between mRNA levels and fluorescence”. We found a non-linear relationship between fluorescence and mRNA abundance (shown in Figure 1C) and used this relationship to translate YFP fluorescence observed in each cell into estimated mRNA abundance for that cell. We believe that this is an important step toward capturing biological reality that we did not take in prior work.</p><p>We also used Tdh3-YFP fusion proteins to compare the effects of 20 <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles at the native locus to the effects of these same alleles in the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP</italic> reporter gene at the <italic>HO</italic> locus. These experiments are described in the “Expression and fitness measured using TDH3-YFP fusion proteins” section of the Materials and methods section. We found a near perfect correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.99) between fluorescence of the fusion and reporter genes, although the slope of this relationship was 0.83 rather than 1 (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). The strain carrying a Tdh3-YFP fusion protein under control of the wild-type <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter showed a 2.5% reduction in fitness (described in subsection “Expression and fitness measured using TDH3-YFP fusion proteins”), suggesting that the fusion might indeed have affected <italic>TDH3</italic> protein function or stability.</p><p>We have made the references in the main text to these key control experiments more explicit in the revised version of the manuscript by modifying text in subsection “Fitness effects of changing average TDH3 expression level” to read as follows:</p><p>“Expression of this reporter gene provided a reliable readout of average expression level and expression noise driven by the same <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub></italic>promoters at the native <italic>TDH3</italic> locus, as measured using Tdh3-YFP fusion proteins (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B).

We did not perform this experiment with Tdh3-YFP fusion proteins as suggested because (1) the 24 hour half-life of Venus YFP is expected to mask the types of fluctuations in expression that occur on the time-scales of cell division (1-3 hours) that we would want to measure, and (2) the fusion of YFP to Tdh3 caused a 2.5% reduction in fitness, suggesting that it interferes with <italic>TDH3</italic> function or stability. In addition, the set of 20 <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter alleles driving expression of a Tdh3-YFP fusion protein we previously constructed did not include pairs of alleles with similar mean expression but differences in expression noise. Our other strains were also not suitable for this experiment because they have mutations in the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter upstream of only YFP (suitable for measuring effects on expression but not fitness) or only the native <italic>TDH3</italic> gene (suitable for measuring effects on fitness but not expression).</p><p>As an alternative to the proposed experiment, we used time-lapse microscopy to measure single-cell division rates in four genotypes grown in custom microfluidic devices. These four genotypes contained two pairs of genotypes with similar mean expression levels but different levels of expression noise. One of these pairs of genotypes had mean expression close to the optimum, whereas the other had mean expression far from the optimum. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, we found the genotype in each pair showing higher expression noise with the <italic>P<sub>TDH3</sub>-YFP</italic> reporter gene had significantly greater variation in single-cell division rates. We also observed significantly faster mean cell division rates for the pair of genotypes with mean expression closer to the fitness optimum, as expected.

We are encouraged, however, that additional support for our inference that selection disfavors higher noise when mean expression is near the optimum comes from the head-to-head comparisons shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the modeling results shown in Figure 6D, prior theoretical work by Tǎnase-Nicola and ten Wolde (2008), and empirical data showing evidence of selection reducing noise among naturally occurring alleles (Metzger et al., 2015) that appear to drive mean expression close to the optimum (Duveau et al., 2017a, 2017b).
