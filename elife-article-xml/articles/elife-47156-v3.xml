Meiotic differentiation naturally eliminates age-induced cellular damage by an unknown mechanism. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in budding yeast, we found that nuclear senescence factors – including protein aggregates, extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, and abnormal nucleolar material – are sequestered away from chromosomes during meiosis II and subsequently eliminated. A similar sequestration and elimination process occurs for the core subunits of the nuclear pore complex in both young and aged cells. Nuclear envelope remodeling drives the formation of a membranous compartment containing the sequestered material. Importantly, de novo generation of plasma membrane is required for the sequestration event, preventing the inheritance of long-lived nucleoporins and senescence factors into the newly formed gametes. Our study uncovers a new mechanism of nuclear quality control and provides insight into its function in meiotic cellular rejuvenation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47156.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of living organisms accumulate damage as they age. Some of this age-associated damage is found around the organism’s DNA. However, when genetic material is passed on during sexual reproduction, newly born offspring avoid inheriting this age-induced damage. This ensures that the progeny are ‘re-set’ with a fresh lifespan that is independent from their parents’ age.</p><p>A lot of what is known about aging has come from studying budding yeast. Yeast cells can undergo a process called meiosis and divide into four cells known as gametes, which are the equivalents of human sperm and egg. During meiosis, the structure that surrounds the cell’s genetic material – known as the nuclear membrane – remains intact, surrounding the DNA as it separates into four distinct parts. As the cell divides, age-associated factors that were originally present in the parent are not inherited by the gametes, but it remains unclear how this occurs.</p><p>Now, King, Goodman et al. have investigated this process by attaching fluorescent labels to specific aging factors and tracking how they are distributed inside yeast cells undergoing meiosis. This revealed that age-associated factors were physically sequestered away from the inherited genetic material during meiosis. King, Goodman et al. found that as the nuclear membrane remodeled itself around the genetic material of the four gametes, the damage became confined to a fifth previously unknown membrane-bound compartment. Once outside of the gametes, the aging factors were then selectively destroyed by enzymes released from the parent cell.</p><p>All cells age, and many of the mechanisms underlying these processes are similar across species and cell types. A better understanding of how cells age, and of the process by which gametes are able to sequester and eliminate age-induced damage, may help guide efforts to combat aging in other cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>nucleolus</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>quality control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 AG055946-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00027344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>35-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1752814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Grant A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Grant A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AG060656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007127-40S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A meiotic nuclear remodeling event mediates cellular rejuvenation through elimination of senescence factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging occurs as an organism loses its ability to maintain homeostasis over time.

In contrast, meiotic cells reset aging symmetrically such that all of the meiotic products are born young, independent of their progenitor’s age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Unal et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, senescence factors originally present in the aged precursor cells, including protein aggregates, nucleolar damage, and rDNA circles, are no longer present in the newly formed gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ünal and Amon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Unal et al., 2011</xref>). How gametes avoid inheriting age-associated damage and how this event is coupled to the meiotic differentiation program remains unknown.</p><p>Meiotic differentiation, also known as gametogenesis, is a tightly regulated developmental program whereby a progenitor cell undergoes two consecutive nuclear divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, to form haploid gametes. Meiotic differentiation requires extensive cellular remodeling to ensure that gametes inherit the necessary nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. In yeast gametogenesis, the nucleus undergoes a closed division, with the nuclear envelope remaining continuous until karyokinesis forms four new nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moens, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moens and Rapport, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Neiman, 2011</xref>). Mitochondria and cortical endoplasmic reticulum also undergo regulated morphological changes, separating from the cellular cortex and localizing near the nuclear envelope at the transition between meiosis I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gorsich and Shaw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miyakawa et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sawyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stevens, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suda et al., 2007</xref>). Around the same time, new plasma membranes, also known as prospore membranes, grow from the centrosome-like spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope. This directed growth of plasma membrane ensures that nascent nuclei and a fraction of the cytoplasmic contents are encapsulated to form gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brewer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byers, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knop and Strasser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moens, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neiman, 1998</xref>). Subsequently, the uninherited cellular contents are destroyed by proteases released upon permeabilization of the progenitor cell’s vacuole, the yeast equivalent of the mammalian lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eastwood et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eastwood and Meneghini, 2015</xref>). Whether these cellular remodeling events are integral to the removal of age-induced damage has not been characterized.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the mechanism by which nuclear senescence factors are eliminated during budding yeast meiosis. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we found that protein aggregates, rDNA circles, and a subset of nucleolar proteins are sequestered away from chromosomes during meiosis II. Importantly, we show that the core subunits of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) also undergo a similar sequestration process in both young and aged cells. The damaged material localizes to a nuclear envelope-bound compartment containing the excluded NPCs that is eliminated upon vacuolar lysis. Finally, we found that the proper development of plasma membranes is required for the sequestration of core NPCs and senescence factors away from the newly forming gametes. Our study defines a key nuclear remodeling event and demonstrates its involvement in the elimination of age-induced cellular damage during meiotic differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Senescence factors are sequestered away from chromosomes in meiosis II and subsequently eliminated</title><p>To gain a deeper understanding of gametogenesis-induced rejuvenation, we first sought to characterize the meiotic dynamics of age-induced protein aggregates, rDNA circles, and nucleolar damage using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy.

To visualize ribosomal DNA in single cells, we used a strain carrying five tandem copies of the tetracycline operator sequence integrated within each rDNA repeat in one of the two chromosome XII homologs (tetO-rDNA). The strain additionally contained a tetracycline repressor protein fused to GFP (TetR-GFP) under the control of a meiotic promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2011</xref>). These two modifications, namely the meiosis-restricted expression of TetR-GFP and the heterozygosity of the tetO-rDNA array, did not affect growth rate in vegetative cells. Using this method, we observed that, in aged cells, a substantial fraction of the tetO-rDNA/TetR-GFP signal and a small fraction of the Hta1-mApple signal were sequestered away from the dividing chromosomes after the onset of anaphase II and disappeared during late stages of gamete maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Nsr1 similarly demonstrated partial sequestration after the onset of anaphase II in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A portion of the histone H2B (Htb1-mCherry) was also sequestered away from the gamete nuclei, reminiscent of the behavior of histone H2A in the GFP-marked rDNA strain. This chromatin demarcation occurred predominantly in aged cells and always co-localized with the sequestered nucleoli. Since the extrachromosomal histone mass is present in aged cells independent of the GFP-marked rDNA array, the discarded rDNA circles are likely assembled into chromatin, and the extrachromosomal histone signal can be used as a proxy for rDNA circles.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47156.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nucleolar material is sequestered away from chromosomes during meiosis II in young and aged cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Montage of a young cell (one generation old) with the nucleolar tag Nsr1-GFP progressing through meiosis (UB16712).

However, other nuclear proteins – including histones, the rDNA-associated protein Cfi1, and the Ran exchange factor Prp20 – are largely retained with dividing nuclei during anaphase II (unpublished data). A more thorough cataloging of nuclear components is needed to identify parameters that differentiate excluded nuclear material from retained nuclear material. Strong association with chromatin, as in the case for histones, Cfi1 and Prp20, may be one way to mediate the selective inheritance of nuclear proteins into gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dilworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Straight et al., 1999</xref>).

This raises the intriguing possibility that some core nucleoporins may be able to overcome the physical or diffusion barrier imposed by the plasma membrane. In mitosis, an active transmission mechanism involving the nucleoporin Nsp1 is required for NPCs to pass the bud neck diffusion barrier and enter into daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makio et al., 2013</xref>). Whether any factors facilitate selective NPC inheritance into gametes during meiosis II is an important direction for future studies. Further, daughter-inherited NPCs are modified by the deacetylase Hos3 as they pass through the bud neck, resulting in the formation of a daughter nucleus with distinct cell-cycle behaviors from the mother nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Transmission through the leading edge of the gamete plasma membrane might similarly provide an opportunity for any inherited NPCs to acquire gamete-specific modifications and functions.

In this context, acrosome formation, potentially akin to gamete plasma membrane formation, corresponds to the redistribution of nuclear pores to the caudal end of the nucleus, coincident with chromatin condensation and elimination of un-inherited nuclear material. Whether removal of age-induced damage is also coupled to nuclear remodeling during metazoan spermatogenesis remains to be determined.</p><p>Elimination of age-induced damage during gamete maturation may also be integral to gamete rejuvenation in other organisms.

All live imaging experiments used conditioned sporulation media (SPO filter-sterilized after five hours of sporulation at 30°C), as this was found to enhance meiotic progression. With the CellASIC system, cultures in SPO (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.85) were transferred to a microfluidic Y04D plate and were loaded with a pressure of 8 psi for 5 s. Conditioned SPO was subsequently applied with a constant flow rate pressure of 2 psi for 15–20 hr. With the 96-well plates, cells were adhered to the bottom of the wells and 100 μl of conditioned SPO was added to each well.

Freezing was done in a Bal-Tec HPM-010 high-pressure freezer (Bal-Tec AG).</p><p>High pressure frozen cells stored in liquid nitrogen were transferred to cryovials containing 1.5 ml of fixative consisting of 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1% uranyl acetate, and 5% water in acetone at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195°C) and processed for freeze substitution according to the method of McDonald and Webb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDonald, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McDonald and Webb, 2011</xref>). Briefly, the cryovials containing fixative and cells were transferred to a cooled metal block at −195°C; the cold block was put into an insulated container such that the vials were horizontally oriented and shaken on an orbital shaker operating at 125 rpm. After 3 hr, the block and cryovials had warmed to 20°C and were transitioned to resin infiltration.</p><p>Resin infiltration was accomplished by a modification of the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDonald (2014)</xref>. Briefly, cells were rinsed 4–5 times in pure acetone and infiltrated with Epon-Araldite resin in increasing increments of 25% over 3 hr plus 3 changes of pure resin at 30 min each. Cells were removed from the planchettes at the beginning of the infiltration series and spun down at 6000 x g for 1 min between solution changes.

Initial alignment was performed using the Midas tool in the ETomo interface of the IMOD package; afterwards, sections were rotated and minorly warped in Midas to improve alignment. The plasma membrane, nuclear envelope, and nucleoli were segmented in IMOD by manual tracing using the Drawing Tools plugin created by Andrew Noske. If a serial section was missing or unusable, the Interpolator plugin created by Andrew Noske was used to approximate any contours in the missing slice.

Nsr1 signal was measured after nucleolus segregation to the four dividing nuclei, determined by the appearance of four Nsr1 foci in the four nuclei. Percent sequestration was measured by calculating the raw integrated intensity in the fifth compartment and dividing it by the sum of the signal present in the four nuclei and the fifth compartment. The mean intensity measured from non-cellular background was subtracted in each field of view before quantifying Nsr1 levels.</p><p>For the vacuolar lysis experiments, the timing of vacuolar membrane disruption and either excluded nucleoporin or protein aggregate disappearance were scored in cells that eventually became tetrads. Vacuolar membrane disruption was defined as the time point at which Vph1 signal becomes diffuse, instead of localizing to the membrane. Protein aggregate and NPC disappearance was defined as the time point at which the excluded fluorescence signal was no longer visible. Only cells in which both vacuolar membrane disruption and nucleoporin or protein aggregate disappearance could be confidently called were included in our analysis. In less than 25% of cells, the vacuole appeared to crumple and collapse over more than an hour prior to vacuolar membrane disappearance. Since we were unable to interpret these changes in vacuolar morphology, these cells were not included in our quantification.</p><p>For protein aggregate and nucleolar sequestration experiments, sequestration was scored in WT cells that formed tetrads and <italic>spo21Δ</italic> cells that progressed through anaphase II, as tetrad formation cannot be assessed in <italic>spo21Δ</italic> cells. Protein aggregate sequestration was scored in aged cells and was defined as the aggregate no longer associating with chromatin after the four anaphase II nuclei became distinct. Nucleolar sequestration was scored in young cells and was defined as the presence of a fifth focus that did not associate with a gamete nucleus after the four anaphase II nuclei became distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>For each meiotic time point, 3.7 OD<sub>600</sub> equivalents of cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 mL of 5% trichloroacetic acid and incubated at 4°C for ≥10 min.

For both, the aging factors are sequestered away from the majority of the chromatin mass in anaphase II before being degraded, likely by the release of vacuolar proteases. In exploring the underlying mechanism for this spatial segregation, the authors focus on components of the nuclear envelope including nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), making the remarkable discovery that in all cells (young and old) NPCs are sequestered away from the majority of chromatin during anaphase II in a compartment that likely is also the repository for Hsp104 foci and rDNA circles. Thus, a significant portion of the majority of nups, with the exception of some components of the nuclear basket, are degraded during sporulation. The authors explore the mechanism of this NPC sequestration and show that it requires the formation of the pro-spore membrane, they further provide evidence that vacuolar-lysis is responsible for nup degradation.</p><p>Overall, the data are nicely presented and of high quality. This is an important paper that greatly impacts the field of cell biology. It remains unknown how unwanted materials are segregated from gametes, which is a challenging issue that is likely beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The function of the NPC sequestration mechanism; While it remains unclear what the function of NPC sequestration actually is, the authors imply that it is likely part of a mechanism to clear protein aggregates or rDNA circles. This point could be better established if the authors could more directly link these factors to NPCs themselves. Genetic knockouts in the SAGA complex, for example might be useful to decouple rDNA circles from NPCs as has been shown in Yves Barral's work (Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014). Alternatively, what is the consequence of preventing the degradation of nups/protein aggregates? If a pep4Δ was incorporated, would the spores fail to germinate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47156.066</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The function of the NPC sequestration mechanism; While it remains unclear what the function of NPC sequestration actually is, the authors imply that it is likely part of a mechanism to clear protein aggregates or rDNA circles.

We tried to test whether the SAGA complex is involved in coupling rDNA circle clearance to NPC sequestration in two different ways: First, we deleted <italic>GCN5</italic>, a SAGA component known to tether rDNA circles to NPCs in mitosis (Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014). However, this disruption prevented cells from undergoing meiosis, consistent with previous work (Burgess et al., 1999). Second, we employed an auxin-inducible degron strategy (Nishimura et al., 2009) to deplete Gcn5 and Spt3,another SAGA subunit implicated in tethering rDNA circles to NPCs(Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014). Each protein was tagged with IAA17-3V5, and was brought into a strain background carrying an F-box receptor (osTIR1) under a copper-inducible promoter. To deplete Gcn5, we first induced osTIR1 expression 5h 30min after entry into meiosis followed by 1 mM auxin (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid) treatment at 6h. As a control, we performed identical treatments on Gcn5-AID strains lacking osTIR1. By immunoblotting, we confirmed that Gcn5 was successfully depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> panel A, time of auxin addition = 0 minutes). We found that Gcn5 depletion resulted in spore-packaging defects and low sporulation efficiency (20%, N = 300 cells). This suggests that Gcn5 alone or the SAGA complex is required for proper spore formation. Given that prospore membrane formation is necessary for both NPC and age-induced damage sequestration, we were unable to determine whether Gcn5 is required for tethering rDNA circles to NPCs during meiosis and therefore coupling NPC and rDNA circle sequestration.</p><p>We next used a similar approach to efficiently deplete Spt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> panel B, time of auxin addition = 0 minutes). Spt3 depletion did not cause a substantial sporulation defect (84% sporulation efficiency, N = 307 cells). Using this allele in the rDNA reporter strain background, we performed live cell imaging experiments. We found no defects in rDNA circle sequestration upon Spt3 depletion in aged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> panels C-D, scale bar = 2 μm, N = 45 -Tir1 cells and 24 +Tir1 cells).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47156-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Given our results, we are unable to link NPC sequestration and rDNA circle sequestration at this time. There are at least three possible models that could explain these observations. First, tethering of rDNA circles to NPCs is not involved in rDNA sequestration during meiosis, and so disruption of the SAGA complex has no effect. Second, a different or redundant mechanism exists to tether rDNA circles to NPCs in meiosis. Third, unlike Gcn5, Spt3 depletion is not sufficient to completely inactivate SAGA, and full SAGA inactivation causes defects in spore formation which precludes the definitive testing of this complex’s function in rDNA circle tethering to NPCs in meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, what is the consequence of preventing the degradation of nups/protein aggregates? If a pep4Δ was incorporated, would the spores fail to germinate?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>pep4Δ</italic> cells are unable to enter meiosis (Zubenko and Jones, 1981); therefore, we were unable to assess whether the deletion impacted germination. To get around this issue, we tried three parallel methods to inhibit vacuolar protease activity: (1) chemical inhibition with the protease-inhibitor AEBSF (Webster et al., 2014); (2) deletion of Prb1, a proteinase required for full protein degradation during sporulation (Zubenko and Jones, 1981); and (3) depletion of Pep4, via an auxin-inducible degron strategy (Nishimura et al., 2009). Unfortunately, none of these approaches were feasible to test the consequence of preventing nucleoporin and/or protein aggregate degradation on spore viability. Details on each of the strategies follow:</p><p>1) We treated cells with 1 mM AEBSF (sold as Pefabloc SC by Roche) at various time points after the meiotic divisions (8, 10, 12, and 14 h) to inhibit vacuolar serine proteases. This concentration was within the range recommended by the manufacturer (400 μm to 4 mM) and was previously used in yeast cells (Webster et al., 2014). However, treatment with 1mM AEBSF in meiosis resulted in cell death. Adding a ten-fold lower concentration (100 uM) resulted in mild meiotic defects and did not appear to grossly delay the turnover of unpackaged nuclei, a known target of mega-autophagy, as assessed by remaining Htb1-mCherry signal at around 24 hours (Eastwood et al., 2012).</p><p>2) Although <italic>prb1Δ</italic> cells have previously been shown to have sporulation defects (Zubenko and Jones, 1981), they were also reported to have defective turnover of unpackaged nuclei during mega-autophagy (Eastwood et al., 2012). As such, we constructed <italic>prb1Δ</italic> strains with Nup170-GFP and Htb1-mCherry to assess NPC turnover. Nup170-GFP signal remained in many cells at 24 hours; however, meiotic progression in two tested <italic>prb1Δ</italic> diploids was extremely delayed – the majority of cells hadn’t entered the meiotic divisions at 12 hours – so we were unable to differentiate between the effects of delayed meiotic progression and impaired vacuolar lysis. By 48 hours, most remaining nucleoporin signal was eliminated, suggesting that NPCs are eventually turned over. We hypothesize that a meiotic delay may be responsible for the persistence of unpackaged Htb1-mCherry signal late in sporulation that was previously interpreted as an impairment of mega-autophagy (Eastwood et al., 2012).</p><p>3) We constructed a Pep4-IAA7-3V5 fusion, and brought it into a background with osTIR under a copper-inducible promoter. At three different meiotic time points (6, 8, and 10 h), we attempted depletion by inducing osTIR expression with 50 μm CuSO<sub>4</sub> for thirty minutes and then treating with 1 mM auxin. Although the allele was functional (as assessed by successful progression through meiosis), depletion was unsuccessful (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, panels A and B), likely because Pep4 was inaccessible to TIR and the proteasome in the lumen of the vacuole. Note that for the treated conditions, 0 minutes is the time of auxin treatment.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47156-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Based on these data, we have been unable to determine the function of the NPC sequestration mechanism in young cells. Given that NPC remodeling also takes place in metazoan spermatogenesis, it seems likely to play a fundamental role in gametogenesis in addition to its involvement in clearing damaged NPCs and/or senescence factors. Until a separation-of-function mutant is isolated that specifically disrupts NPC sequestration but still allows spore formation, it will be difficult to determine its full contribution to gamete health and rejuvenation.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
