In mammalian cells, this process is dependent on the recognition of the hexanucleotide AAUAAA motif in the pre-mRNA polyadenylation signal by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. A core CPSF complex comprising CPSF160, WDR33, CPSF30 and Fip1 is sufficient for AAUAAA motif recognition, yet the molecular interactions underpinning its assembly and mechanism of PAS recognition are not understood. Based on cross-linking-coupled mass spectrometry, crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 subcomplex and biochemical assays, we define the molecular architecture of the core human CPSF complex, identifying specific domains involved in inter-subunit interactions. In addition to zinc finger domains in CPSF30, we identify using quantitative RNA-binding assays an N-terminal lysine/arginine-rich motif in WDR33 as a critical determinant of specific AAUAAA motif recognition. Together, these results shed light on the function of CPSF in mediating PAS-dependent RNA cleavage and polyadenylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>protein-RNA interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG-337284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clerici</surname><given-names>Marcello</given-names></name><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF-343-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faini</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HEALTH-F4-2008-201648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aebersold</surname><given-names>Ruedi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>233226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aebersold</surname><given-names>Ruedi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>670821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aebersold</surname><given-names>Ruedi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ULTRA-DD grant no. 115766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aebersold</surname><given-names>Ruedi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural, biochemical, and proteomic analyses of a four-subunit core module of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex reveal its molecular architecture and specific determinants of polyadenylation signal recognition in human mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 3’-terminal polyA tail of eukaryotic mRNAs is generated by a two-step process consisting of an initial endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent RNA transcript followed by polyadenylation of the upstream cleavage fragment by polyA polymerase (PAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>). Although 3’-polyadenylation is an obligatory step in the biogenesis of non-histone mRNAs, many eukaryotic genes contain alternative polyadenylation sites that generate different protein isoforms, or mRNA isoforms with variable 3’-untranslated regions (UTRs), thereby modulating their ability to interact with microRNAs and 3’-UTR interacting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elkon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>). The selection of a specific polyadenylation site is a dynamically regulated process during cell differentiation, proliferation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sandberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shepard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graber et al., 2013</xref>), making mRNA polyadenylation a key mechanism of gene expression control.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the principal cis-acting motif within the polyadenylation signal (PAS) that defines the site of cleavage and polyadenylation is a hexanucleotide A(A/U)UAAA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Proudfoot and Brownlee, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). This sequence motif (also referred to as the PAS hexamer motif or AAUAAA motif) is typically located approximately 10–30 nucleotides upstream of the endonucleolytic cleavage site, which is generally marked by the sequence CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheets et al., 1990</xref>). The key protein factor responsible for polyA site definition is the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), a multisubunit complex that specifically recognizes the AAUAAA motif, catalyzes pre-mRNA cleavage, and recruits PAP to initiate polyadenylation at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the upstream cleavage fragment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takagaki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 1991</xref>). Other cis-elements in the vicinity of the AAUAAA motif that contribute to the definition of the polyA site include upstream UGUA-containing sequences (USE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carswell and Alwine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brackenridge and Proudfoot, 2000</xref>) and downstream G- and GU-rich sequences (DSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gil and Proudfoot, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McLauchlan et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gil and Proudfoot, 1987</xref>). These elements are recognized by the cleavage factor I (CFI) and the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>), both of which contribute to polyA site definition and its regulation.</p><p>The initial biochemical characterization of CPSF revealed the presence of four subunits: CPSF160, CPSF100, CPSF73 and CPSF30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bienroth et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy and Manley, 1992</xref>). Two additional subunits integral to CPSF, Fip1 and WDR33, which are homologous to the yeast 3’ processing factors Fip1p and Pfs2p, respectively, were identified at a later stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). RNA cleavage is catalyzed by CPSF73, a zinc-dependent endonuclease that contains a metallo-beta-lactamase domain and a beta-CASP domain. CPSF73 has very weak enzymatic activity in isolation, implying that other CPSF subunits or 3’-end processing factors are required for efficient cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>). CPSF100, despite its high structural similarity to CPSF73, is catalytically inactive and its function is hitherto unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>). In turn, CPSF160, WDR33, CPSF30 and Fip1 have been shown to form a stable complex independently of CPSF100 and CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). This ‘core’ polyadenylation module of the CPSF complex is able to bind to an RNA containing the AAUAAA motif with nanomolar affinity (K<sub>D</sub> ~2 nM) and to promote its polyadenylation by PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). Although CPSF160 had originally been identified as the subunit that mediates PAS hexamer motif recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murthy and Manley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dichtl et al., 2002</xref>), recent studies employing UV cross-linking have indicated that CPSF30 and WDR33 directly interact with the PAS hexamer instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). CPSF30 contains five consecutive zinc finger (ZF) domains and a C-terminal zinc knuckle domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barabino et al., 1997</xref>). The RNA binding activity of CPSF30 is primarily mediated by the second and third ZF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). This region of CPSF30 is also targeted by the NS1 protein of the influenza virus, enabling the virus to inhibit the polyadenylation of host mRNAs encoding innate immunity factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2008</xref>). Fip1 has been shown to regulate alternative polyadenylation (APA) in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these findings, interactions between Fip1 and uridine-rich RNA motifs located upstream of the PAS hexamer motif have been mapped in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that Fip1 plays an important role in modulating PAS selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite its importance for mRNA biogenesis and the regulation of gene expression, the molecular architecture of the CPSF complex and its mechanism of PAS hexamer motif recognition are poorly understood. Here, we present structural and functional insights into the assembly of the core AAUAAA-binding module of the human CPSF complex. We show that CPSF160 and WDR33 form an heterodimer independently of the other CPSF subunits and report a 2.5 Å-resolution crystal structure of the subcomplex. We further reveal that CPSF30 orchestrates the assembly of the quaternary core CPSF module complex by bridging CPSF160-WDR33 with Fip1. Finally, we show that in addition to CPSF30 ZF domains, specific recognition of the PAS hexamer is mediated by the N-terminal region of WDR33. These results establish a framework for further mechanistic studies of the CPSF complex in eukaryotic mRNA polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A core module containing the N-terminal WD40 domain of WDR33 is sufficient for PAS recognition by CPSF</title><p>A recent study demonstrated that a four-subunit CPSF core complex containing WDR33 is necessary and sufficient to support AAUAAA motif-dependent polyadenylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). Human WDR33 is a ~145 kDa protein composed of an N-terminal WD40 beta-propeller domain and a poorly conserved C-terminal region containing low-complexity sequences. To shed light on the assembly of the CPSF polyadenylation module, we first reconstituted by co-expression in Sf9 insect cells a minimal complex consisting of full-length human CPSF160 (CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>), CPSF30 (CPSF30<sup>FL</sup>) and Fip1 (Fip1<sup>FL</sup>) proteins, and a fragment of WDR33 comprising only the N-terminal region containing the WD40 domain (WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then tested whether the reconstituted complex is capable of specific binding to an RNA containing the PAS hexamer motif. To this end, we used a Atto<sup>532</sup>-labelled 16-nucleotide RNA containing the AAUAAA hexamer and tested its binding in a fluorescence polarization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The RNA was bound with sub-nanomolar affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.65 ± 0.09 nM), in general agreement with a previously reported value (K<sub>D</sub> ~2 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, the affinity of the complex for a mutated version of the RNA containing a single nucleotide substitution in the hexanucleotide (AA<italic>G</italic>AAA) was reduced by more than 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Together, these results indicate that a core module of the CPSF complex containing the WD40 domain of WDR33 is able to bind the AAUAAA motif with both high affinity and specificity, implying that the C-terminal region of WDR33 is not necessary for CPSF assembly and PAS recognition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33111.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the CPSF160-WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup>-CPSF30-Fip1 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Equilibrium binding of CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>-WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup>-CPSF30<sup>FL</sup> -Fip1<sup>FL</sup> to an Atto<sup>532</sup>-labelled, 16-nucleotide RNA containing the PAS hexanucleotide (AAUAAA), measured by fluorescence polarization.

To this end, we used the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), which cross-links lysine residues located within approximately 35 Å of each other, and identified cross-linked peptides by mass spectrometry. We identified 54 and 99 validated inter- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and intra-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) cross-linked sites, respectively (as judged by xQuest score higher than 30, corresponding to an approximate false discovery rate of 10%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The cross-links cover most of the sequences and structured domains of the constituent subunits. We observe distinct cross-linking patterns of CPSF160 to the other three subunits. Whereas Fip1 forms cross-links along the entire CPSF160 sequence, WDR33 and CPSF30 cross-links mostly to the middle and C-terminal regions of CSPF160, respectively. Notably, lysine residues K46, K50 and K55 in the N-terminal region of WDR33 upstream of the predicted WD40 domain form a cross-linking hotspot, interacting extensively with the central part of CSPF160, all five zinc finger domains of CPSF30 and a central, highly conserved region of Fip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, we identify numerous cross-links between the conserved Fip1 region and the zinc finger and the C-terminal zinc knuckle domains of CPSF30. Finally, cross-links from CSPF160 residues map exclusively to CPSF30 zinc finger domains ZF1 and ZF2 (spanning residues K35-K92). Together, these results highlight extensive inter-subunit interactions within the polyA signal-binding core module of the CPSF complex and further underscore the critical role played by WDR33 in the assembly of the CPSF complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer reveals the structural scaffold of the CPSF complex</title><p>To gain insights into the molecular architecture of the CPSF core complex, we reconstituted and crystallized a heterodimeric complex consisting of CPSF160<sup>FL</sup> (residues M1-F1443) and an N-terminal WDR33 fragment encompassing residues Q35-K410 (WDR33<sup>Q35-K410</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The structure of the complex was solved at 2.5 Å resolution by a combination of molecular replacement and tantalum bromide (Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub>) and sulphur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), refined to an <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> factor of 26.2% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The structure revealed that CPSF160 is a multidomain protein composed of three seven-bladed WD40 beta-propeller domains (bP1, bP2 and bP3 for beta propeller 1 to 3) and a C-terminal helical domain (CTD). The three beta-propellers form a compact tristar arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), reminiscent of the domain arrangement observed in the DNA Damage Binding protein 1 (DDB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The central beta-propeller domain (bP2) is located at the top of the bP1-bP3 contact region, with the CTD sealing the interaction between the three beta-propellers at their central junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, side view). The N- and C-terminal propellers (bP1 and bP3) are oriented in a pseudosymmetric fashion and interact with each other at a ~60° angle, creating a deep cavity in between. The cavity is closed on the distal side by three elongated loops (el1-el3) comprising residues P223-T237 (el1), L300-C324 (el2) and C1044-K1069 (el3) projecting from bP1 and bP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). CPSF160 and DDB1 share a remarkable structural similarity despite low sequence identity (~16%), in particular for the bP1-bP3-CTD ensemble (RMSD 2.5 Å for 737 aligned Cα atoms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, in contrast to DDB1, bP2 is tightly packed against the other two propeller domains and CTD in CPSF160, making extensive ionic and hydrophobic interactions (~3600 Å<sup>2</sup> of total buried area and 54 charged interactions for CPSF160 in comparison to ~1000 Å<sup>2</sup> and 10 interactions for DDB1). This tight packing suggests that bP2 is locked in a fixed position in CPSF160, whereas different crystal forms show significant conformational flexibility of bP2 in DDB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As in DDB1, the three beta-propeller domains of CPSF160 do not follow a linear tandem topology; instead, three discontinuous regions of the CPSF160 polypeptide sequence contribute to bP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33111.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the overall structure of the CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>-WDR33<sup>Q35-K410</sup> complex.

The NTD has a unique fold with no secondary structure features except for an N-terminal alpha-helix. The NTD is further supported by a short loop (residues R404-K410) extending C-terminally from the last beta-strand of the WD40 propeller. Upstream of the NTD, residues Q35-N53, which were included in the crystallized protein construct, are disordered in the crystal structure and could not be modeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The WDR33 NTD is completely buried in the cavity formed by CPSF160 bP1 and bP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), with CPSF160 loops el1, el2 and el3 locking the NTD in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The CPSF160-WDR33 complex is further stabilized by contacts between WDR33 beta-propeller domain and CPSF160 bP1 and bP3. The CPSF160-WDR33 interaction is strikingly reminiscent of the architecture of the DDB1-DDB2 DNA repair complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scrima et al., 2008</xref>). Superposition of CPSF160 and DDB1 results in almost perfect overlap of the N-terminal alpha-helices of WDR33 and DDB2. However, due to local differences in the N-terminal domains WDR33 and DDB2, the respective beta-propeller domains of the two proteins are shifted by ~10 Å relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Overall, CPSF160 and WDR33 establish an extensive network of interactions encompassing 45 hydrogen bonds and 19 salt bridges, with a total buried surface of ~6900 Å<sup>2</sup>, equally distributed over the two proteins. These structural observations are thus consistent with CPSF160 and WDR33 forming a tight heterodimeric subcomplex within the polyA signal-binding module of the human CPSF complex.</p><p>The molecular architecture of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer is in good agreement with our cross-linking mass spectrometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), despite many of the cross-links originating from lysine residues within disordered regions of CPSF160 (internal loops) and WDR33 (N-terminal region). Among the cross-links that can be mapped on the atomic model of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer, 12 are consistent with the conventional Euclidean distance of 35 Å. Notably, of the six cross-links with distance violations, five originate from the same CPSF160 residue (see Materials and methods). Four cross-links between CPSF160 K1055 located in loop el3 and WDR33 residues K46, K50, K55 and K410 are consistent with the CPSF160 beta-propeller three being in proximity of the N-terminal region of WDR33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Molecular topology of the core CPSF complex</title><p>In light of the crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer, we sought to investigate the physical interactions linking CPSF30 and Fip1 to CPSF160-WDR33 within the AAUAAA-binding core module of CPSF.

As for Fip1<sup>FL</sup>, binding was dependent on the presence of CPSF30<sup>FL</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 3–4), indicating that a direct physical interaction between CPSF30 and Fip1<sup>CD</sup> is required to recruit Fip1 to the CPSF core module.

Although the observed increase in affinity upon removal of CPSF30 domains ZF4-5 and Fip1 is presently unclear, it is conceivable that CPSF30 ZF4-5 and/or Fip1 play an autoinhibitory role within CPSF by sterically hindering the accessibility of CPSF30 ZF2-3 domains to the AAUAAA motif.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33111.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CPSF30 ZF3 domain and WDR33 N-terminal motif are principal determinants of AAUAAA motif.</title><p>Equilibrium binding measured by fluorescence polarization of CPSF complex variants containing different CPSF30 constructs (<bold>A</bold>) and WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup> mutants (<bold>B</bold>) to an Atto<sup>532</sup>-labelled 16-nucleotide RNA containing the PAS hexamer (AAUAAA).

This is in good agreement with previous experiments demonstrating that both the ZF2 and ZF3 domains are required for interactions with the AAUAAA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, however, no further reduction in AAUAAA RNA binding was observed when CPSF30 was further truncated to remove the ZF2 domain (CPSF30<sup>ZF1</sup>), or omitted from the core module altogether, indicating that in the absence of the ZF3 domain, the ZF2 domain of CPSF30 does not contribute to AAUAAA binding. Binding was significantly decreased for all CPSF complex variants when a mutant RNA containing a single-base substitution in the PAS hexamer motif (AAGAAA) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that some specificity for the AAUAAA RNA is retained also in the absence of CPSF30. Given that WDR33, as opposed to CPSF160, has been implicated in AAUAAA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>), this suggests that WDR33 indeed contributes to specific recognition of the PAS hexanucleotide.</p><p>We next sought to identify specific features in WDR33 involved directly in AAUAAA motif recognition. Our cross-linking and mass spectrometry analysis indicated that an N-terminal motif located immediately upstream of the NTD in WDR33 is a cross-linking hotspot. This region, which is not resolved in the structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 subcomplex, is the only part of WDR33 that cross-links to CPSF30 ZF2 and ZF3 domains, pointing to the spatial proximity of the two regions in the CPSF subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the sequence of the N-terminal motif is characterized by a highly conserved pattern of positively charged residues (K46-K55) that might be involved in RNA binding by ionic or cation-π interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these observations, we designed two WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup> constructs in which specific lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal motif were substituted with alanine (WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup> K46A/R47A and R49A/K50A). These mutant proteins were still able to support the assembly of the CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>-WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup>-CPSF30<sup>ZF1-3</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal motif is not required for the assembly of the core CPSF module. Next, we tested binding of the resulting complexes to AAUAAA RNA in a fluorescence polarization assay. Both sets of mutations in WDR33 resulted in substantial reduction in affinity, with K46A/R47A binding with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 7.78 ± 0.78 nM (a ~70 fold reduction compared to wild-type WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup>) and R49A/K50A with a K<sub>D</sub> of 2.42 ± 0.66 nM (~25 fold reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Notably, binding assays with the mutant RNA containing a single-base substitution in the PAS hexamer motif (AAGAAA) revealed that the K46A/R47A substitution in WDR33 results in a ~5 fold reduction in affinity compared to wild-type WDR33<sup>M1-K410</sup> (200 nM versus 43 nM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), whereas the R49A/K50A substitution leads to ~12 fold reduction in affinity (500 nM versus 43 nM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results indicate that the positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal region of WDR33 are involved in AAUAAA motif recognition and contribute both to the affinity and specificity of AAUAAA binding. Taken together, these experiments identify the ZF2 and ZF3 domains of CPSF30 and the N-terminal motif of WDR33 as the critical determinants of AAUAAA recognition within the CPSF complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A four-subunit core module of the mammalian CPSF complex has previously been shown to be sufficient for the recognition of the AAUAAA hexamer motif of the polyadenylation signal via its CPSF30 and WDR33 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). In this work, we sought to shed light on the structural architecture of the core module of human CPSF and its molecular mechanism of AAUAAA motif recognition. Using cross-linking and mass spectrometry analysis, we define interactions within the core module, revealing that WDR33 is a key component of the complex and identifying its N-terminal region as an interaction hotspot in the absence of bound RNA, positioned in close proximity to the remaining three subunits. The crystal structure of the CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>-WDR33<sup>Q35-K410</sup> subcomplex reveals extensive interaction between the two proteins resulting from shape complementarity of the N-terminal domain of WDR33 and a deep cavity organized by the beta-propeller domains and extended loops in CPSF160. The CPSF160-WDR33 subcomplex thus constitutes the structural scaffold of the core polyadenylation module of the CPSF complex and provides an interaction platform for the other CPSF subunits, including CPSF100 and CPSF73. Surprisingly, the architecture of the CPSF160-WDR33<sup>Q35-K410</sup> heterodimer, consisting of four WD40 beta-propeller domains, is highly reminiscent of the DDB1-DDB2 complex involved in the detection and repair of UV-induced DNA damage, suggesting distant evolutionary relationships between the two molecular machineries. A recent cryo-EM structure of the yeast Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1-Fip1 complex, which is orthologous and functionally equivalent to the human CPSF160-WDR33-CPSF30-Fip1 complex and constitutes the polyadenylation module of the yeast CPF complex, revealed striking similarities to the crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>). The yeast Cft1-Pfs2 subcomplex superimposes with the human CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer with RMSDs of 2.56 Å for CPSF160 and Cft1 and 1.55 Å for WDR33 and Pfs2, indicating that the core CPSF scaffold is highly evolutionarily conserved. Together, these structures reveal a high degree of structural homology between the yeast CPF and mammalian CPSF complexes. Overall, the structure of the yeast complex is supportive of the data presented in our study, as further discussed below.</p><p>Using co-expression and co-precipitation experiments, we dissect the individual inter-subunit interactions underpinning the assembly of the core CPSF polyadenylation module. In addition to its critical role in AAUAAA binding, CPSF30 functions in linking the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer and Fip1. While the N-terminal ZF1 domain of CPSF30 is required for the interaction with CPSF160-WDR33, the zinc finger domains ZF4 and ZF5 are involved in the recruitment of Fip1. This is good agreement with previous studies of the yeast CPSF30 ortholog Yth1 showing that deletion of the fifth zinc finger domain impairs interactions with Fip1p and Pap1p (the yeast orthologs of Fip1 and PAP) and causes a polyadenylation defect in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barabino et al., 2000</xref>). Our interaction data are consistent with the yeast Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1-Fip1 complex structure, in which the N-terminal region of Yth1 up to and including ZF1 mediates the interaction with Cft1-Pfs2 (CPSF160-WDR33) while the C-terminal ZF4 and ZF5 domains, together with Fip1, are structurally disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, Yth1 ZF1 and ZF2 domains are located in the cleft formed by Cft1 and Pfs2, in good agreement with our cross-linking data.</p><p>Using RNA-binding assays with complexes containing truncated CPSF30 proteins, we show that the CPSF30 ZF2 and ZF3 domains play key roles in the specific recognition of the AAUAAA motif. ZF3 additionally appears to play a structural role in the positioning of ZF2, since ZF2 does not appear to be able to support RNA binding in the absence of ZF3. These results are in agreement with experimental results showing that deletion of the ZF2 domain in the context of full-length human CPSF30 abrogates AAUAAA RNA interactions in vitro, while point mutations in yeast Yth1p that likely result in the unfolding of the second zinc finger domain abrogate mRNA polyadenylation in vivo and in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barabino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). The CPSF30 zinc knuckle domain is not essential for the assembly of the core CPSF polyadenylation module, which is consistent with the absence of this domain in yeast Yth1. However, deletion of the ZK domain in human CPSF30 reduces the efficiency of its cross-linking to AAUAAA-containing RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the ZK domain also contributes to RNA binding. However, the precise role of the ZK domain remains to be investigated.</p><p>Our co-precipitation and RNA binding assays reveal that Fip1 is a peripheral subunit that is dispensable for specific recognition of the AAUAAA motif. The central conserved domain of Fip1 (Fip1<sup>CD</sup>) interacts with the ZF4 and ZF5 domains of CPSF30, as observed for the yeast orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barabino et al., 2000</xref>). Given the conservation of the Fip1<sup>CD</sup> in yeast and protozoa, this interaction mode is conserved across all eukaryotes, which enables the cleavage and polyadenylation complexes to recruit, via Fip1, other polyadenylation factors including polyA polymerase and CStF (or the related factor CFI in yeast). Given that Fip1 has intrinsic RNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>), the interaction also likely enables mammalian Fip1 to modulate polyA site definition, which might be critical for the recently uncovered role of Fip1 in embryonic stem cell renewal and somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although CPSF160 was originally assumed to be the CPSF subunit involved in AAUAAA RNA binding, recent biochemical studies have provided compelling evidence that AAUAAA recognition is mediated by WDR33 instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). WDR33 can be cross-linked to AAUAAA-containing RNA in vitro and transcriptome-wide photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis reveals that WDR33 binds near the AAUAAA motif in vivo with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>). Using in vitro RNA-binding assays, we show that the CPSF160-WDR33 subcomplex retains substantial affinity and specificity for the AAUAAA motif in the absence of CPSF30, indicating that WDR33 indeed contributes to specific recognition of the AAUAAA hexanucleotide. Upstream of the NTD, human WDR33 contains a lysine/arginine-rich motif that is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes but not in the yeast orthologue Pfs2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the absence of bound AAUAAA RNA, the N-terminal motif is a cross-linking hotspot located in physical proximity to the CPSF30 ZF3 domain, suggesting that the motif is involved in AAUAAA recognition. Consistent with these observations, mutations of specific lysine or arginine residues in the motif impair AAUAAA motif binding by the core CPSF module in vitro. Crucially, these mutations do not perturb module assembly, suggesting that the WDR33 N-terminal motif is not involved in CPSF30 recruitment and instead mediates direct interactions with the AAUAAA motif. Unlike in mammals, where polyA site definition is strictly dependent on the A(A/U)UAAA hexanucleotide, the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation machinery recognizes a degenerate, A-rich sequences known as the positioning element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo and Sherman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the difference in the N-termini of human WDR33 and yeast Pfs2p might account for the differences in polyA site definition by the yeast and mammalian polyadenylation machineries.</p><p>Based on our structural observations and interaction analysis, we conclude that the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer functions as an interaction platform, recruiting CPSF30 and indirectly Fip1, via the ZF1 domain in CPSF30, and interacting with additional subunits of the CPSF complex including CPSF100 and CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). AAUAAA motif binding occurs at the subunit interface of CPSF160 and WDR33 in close proximity to the WDR33 N-terminus, where the N-terminal lysine/arginine-rich motif of WDR33 and the ZF2 and ZF3 domains of CPSF30 act synergistically to recognize the AAUAAA motif in a sequence-specific manner. This enables the CPSF complex to bind the AAUAAA motif with subnanomolar affinity and remarkable specificity. While this manuscript was in preparation, a cryoEM structure of the human CPFS160-WDR33-CPSF30-Fip1 complex bound to the AAUAAA motif RNA was published, revealing that both the ZF2 and ZF3 domains of CPSF30 and the N-terminal region are responsible for sequence-specific recognition of the AAUAAA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), in agreement with our structural and biochemical insights. Together, these studies establish the structural framework for polyadenylation signal recognition by the core CPSF complex and set the stage for further structural and mechanistic studies of the mammalian polyadenylation machinery.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33111.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of the mammalian core CPSF complex bound to the PAS hexamer motif.</title><p>CPSF160 and WDR33 form heterodimer acting as a structural scaffold of the core CPSF complex.

MS data were converted to mzXML format with msConvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>) and searched with xQuest/xProphet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walzthoeni et al., 2012</xref>) with an MS1 tolerance of 10 ppm and an MS2 tolerance of 0.2 and 0.3 Da for common ions and cross-link ions, respectively. Default settings for xQuest and xProphet settings were selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leitner et al., 2014</xref>). The search database contained the peptide sequences of the analyzed proteins and the corresponding decoy sequences. Cross-linked peptides were identified with a minimal length of 5 amino acids and at least four bond cleavages or three adjacent ones per peptide. Cross-linked peptides were defined as validated if they had a total ion current explained higher than 0.1 and an xQuest score higher than 30, corresponding to an approximate false discovery rate of 10%. 18 (12%) of the 153 validated cross-linked sites could be mapped to residues present in the atomic model of CPSF160-WDR33. From the subset of mapped cross-linked residues, 12 had an Euclidean distance lower that 35 Å, whereas six showed a distance between 42 and 100 Å. Notably, 5 of the six cross-linked sites originated from a common peptide on CPSF160 (682-LALHKPPLHHQSK-694). Figures were prepared with xiNET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe et al., 2015</xref>), UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and UCSF Chimera X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CPSF160-WDR33 complex crystallization and structure determination</title><p>Crystals of CPSF160<sup>FL</sup>-WDR33<sup>Q35-K410</sup> were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 0.5 μl of protein at 4.4 mg/ml and 0.5 μl of reservoir solution containing 11% (w/v) PEG 3400, 37.5 mM ammonium formate and 112.5 mM magnesium formate (native data set) or 10% w/v PEG 3400 and 140 mM magnesium formate (Sulfur SAD data set). For derivatization with tantalum bromide (Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub>), crystals were grown in 8% w/v PEG3400 and 70 mM magnesium formate and soaked in the reservoir solution containing 1 mM Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub> for one hour. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to a solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 80% (v/v) of reservoir solution and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X06DA (PXIII) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) and processed using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). Data collection statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Native and Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub>-SAD data comprised four data sets and native sulfur-SAD comprised 17 data sets collected on two different crystals. All data sets were collected by exposing different parts of the same crystal, rotating the crystal through 360° in each data set and changing the kappa angle between datasets in 5° increments to ensure data completeness and redundancy. The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement (MR) and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using the Phaser module in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). A low-score MR solution (TFZ = 4) was obtained for the native data set using a polyalanine model based on the DDB1 structure (PDB entry 3EI3) as search model. The solution was subsequently used to perform MR-SAD on the sulfur- and Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub>-SAD datasets. A homology model of CPSF160 was fitted in the map obtained by Ta<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>12</sub> MR-SAD, manually rebuilt using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) with the aid of the sulfur site positions identified by sulfur-MR-SAD and refined using phenix.refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting atomic model was used to perform MR-SAD on the sulfur-SAD dataset, which yielded an improved map and additional sulfur sites. After several iterations of MR-SAD and manual building, whereby the manually optimized model was used as input for sulfur MR-SAD yielding an optimized map that allowed further building of the model, a homology model of WDR33 beta-propeller domain could be fitted in the map and manually refined. Finally, the CPSF160-WDR33 model was used to perform molecular replacement in the high resolution native data and manually built and improved using Coot and refined using phenix.refine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pull-down assays</title><p>For pull-down assays from Sf9 cells expressing CPSF subunits, the cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.05% Tween20, and lysed by sonication.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural insights into the assembly and polyA signal recognition mechanism of the human CPSF complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Nick J Proudfoot (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study presents the first high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure for the central RNA recognition subunits of the cleavage polyadenylation complex in mammals, the heterodimer CPSF160-WDR33 (N-terminal ~ 400aa). It also investigates protein-protein interactions within the reconstituted 4 subunit complex consisting of CPSF160, N-terminal part of WRD33, CPSF30 and FIP1 using cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry and pull-down assays. Insight is obtained as to how this module achieves selective interaction with the PAS, substantially extending the original papers that demonstrated the role of WDR33 in cleavage and polyadenylation (Chan et al., 2014 and Schonemann et al., 2014). All three reviewers find this study to report interesting findings that nicely complement the recent study from the Passmore lab on the polyadenylation module from yeast (Casanal et al., 2017). In view of the competitive nature of this research we do not suggest any further experimental analysis, but do recommend a fair number of changes and clarifications to the manuscript that we feel are necessary for it to be ready for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p>1) Casanal et al. should be referenced and discussed in context of the reported data.</p><p>2) The PAS is not just the AAUAAA sequence but is rather a combination of USE-AAUAAA-DSE. AAUAAA should be described as the central hexamer sequence of the PAS but not the PAS itself. Original references on PAS sequence should be cited.</p><p>3) Domains and their positions (aa) should be clearly indicated on schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and domain boundaries should be made clearer. For example, it is unclear if the coloured part of WDR33 comprises just the β propeller domain or includes the structured N-terminus. This is relevant when judging where the cross-link sites are as discussed extensively in the paper. Abbreviations (such as 'CD' in FIP1, CTD in CPSF160, ZK in CPSF30) should be explained in figure legend.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: It would be helpful to colour-code the three domains of CPSF160. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> – selection of the colours makes them are hard to distinguish and precludes appreciation of the structural similarity.</p><p>5) An explanation of why RNA binding is increased when truncated CPSF30 is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is required. Does the absence of Fip1 contribute to this?</p><p>6) MS analyses and interpretation. In subsection “Crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer reveals the structural scaffold of the CPSF complex”, it should be more explicitly stated how many X-links were or were not consistent with their structure. In subsection “Molecular topology of the core CPSF complex”, final paragraph, the sentence 'These conclusions are consistent […]' should be rephrased as the argument made is unclear. Fip1 is mentioned in the beginning of the sentence, but data concerning this subunit are not mentioned. The corresponding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the sites of cross-linking on WDR33 and CPSF160. It would be useful to indicate more precisely which parts of Fip1 and CPSF30 are cross-linked to these sites?</p><p>7) The cross-linking hot spot at the N-terminus of WDR33 is discussed quite a bit. It appears that the cross-linked amino acids are very close to the part of WDR33 visible in the x-ray structure. In addition, the very many cross-links of this short amino acid sequence, including some to other parts of the known structure, provide many constraints. It would be useful to present this information in a model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is helpful, but more details are still necessary. Mass spectrometric raw data as well as xQuest/xProphet output and setting files should be made publicly available via an appropriate data repository. What are 'validated' cross-linked sites?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and text in subsection “Molecular topology of the core CPSF complex”: It is unclear how the pull-down assays were performed. In panel A, the his-strep tag on WDR33 was presumably used, but it is hard to see which part of the tag was used. In panel C, lane 6, WDR33 was not present, so it is unclear how the precipitation was done. Asterisks in panel A and B are not explained.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel B shows a re-analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.

Cite Schonemann et al. for the first sentence, second paragraph.</p><p>Here they reconstituted the four subunit complex from co-purified WDR33 – Fip1 and CPSF160 – CPSF30 heterodimers. The authors might wish to discuss how this fits with the interactions they see. For example, reconstitution from WDR33 and CPSF160 expressed separately from each other is inconsistent with the authors' idea that the interaction between the two might require co-folding durch assembly.</p><p>Mammalian CstF and yeast CF I are not exactly equivalent.

We first note that the yeast Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1-Fip1 complex structure is similar to the crystal structure of the human CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer.</p><p>“A recent cryo-EM structure of the yeast Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1-Fip1 complex, which is orthologous and functionally equivalent to the human CPSF160-WDR33-CPSF30-Fip1 complex and constitutes the polyadenylation module of the yeast CPF complex, revealed striking similarities to the crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer (Casanalet al., 2017). The yeast Cft1-Pfs2 subcomplex superimposes with the human CPSF160-WDR33 heterodimer with RMSDs of 2.56 Å for CPSF1160 and Cft1 and 1.55 Å for WDR33 and Pfs2, indicating that the core CPSF scaffold is highly evolutionarily conserved.”</p><p>We also make further reference to the Casanal et al. study in the subsequent paragraph and state: “Our interaction data is consistent with the yeast Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1-Fip1 complex structure, in which the N-terminal region of Yth1 up to and including ZF1 mediates the interaction with Cft1-Pfs2 (CPSF160WDR33), while the C-terminal ZF4 and ZF5 domains, together with Fip1, are structurally disordered (Casanal et al., 2017). Notably, Yth1 ZF1 and ZF2 domains are located in the cleft formed by Cft1 and Pfs2, in good agreement with our cross-linking and mass-spectrometry data.”</p><p>In the final paragraph of the Discussion section we now cite the Sun et al. PNAS paper and state:</p><p>“While this manuscript was in preparation, a cryoEM structure of the human CPFS160-WDR33CPSF30-Fip1 complex bound to the AAUAAA motif RNA was published, revealing that both the ZF2 and ZF3 domains of CPSF30 and the N-terminal region are responsible for sequence-specific recognition of the AAUAAA motif (Sun et al., 2017), in agreement with our structural and biochemical insights. Together, these studies establish the structural framework for polyadenylation signal recognition by the core CPSF complex and set the stage for further structural and mechanistic studies of the mammalian polyadenylation machinery.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The PAS is not just the AAUAAA sequence but is rather a combination of USE-AAUAAA-DSE.

A possible explanation could be that these domains sterically hinder the access of the AAUAAA RNA motif to CPSF30 ZF2-3. We added the following sentence in the Results section describing the CPSF-AAUAAA motif affinity measurements: “Although the observed increase in affinity upon removal of CPSF30 domains ZF4-5 and Fip1 is presently unclear, it is conceivable that CPSF30 ZF4-5 and/or Fip1 play an autoinhibitory role within CPSF by sterically hindering the accessibility of CPSF30 ZF2-3 domains to the AAUAAA motif.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) MS analyses and interpretation.

We have also added an estimate of the false discovery rate and detailed the origin and extent of the distance violations in the cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis section (Results section second paragraph). The subset of mapped cross-links that are more than 35 Å apart have proportionally lower (poorer) xQuest ld-scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and therefore are expected to be less reliable. The number of distance-violating cross-links (6) is within the expected false discovery rate of 10% (15 expected false cross-links). We also note that many of the cross-links originated from lysine residues within disordered regions of CPSF160 (internal loops) and WDR33 (N-terminal region), therefore limiting our ability to verify whether the conventional Euclidean distance of 35 Å was violated in their case.

WDR33 K50 was cross-linked to several lysine residues in CPSF30 ZF2-4 domains but disordered in the crystal structure. Since K50 is in close proximity to the last ordered residue of the crystal structure (R54), we have depicted a line representing WDR33 N-terminal extension carrying the K50 residue, in order to have a more complete overview of the cross-links between WDR33 N-terminal cross-linking hotspot and CPSF30.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The cross-linking hot spot at the N-terminus of WDR33 is discussed quite a bit. It appears that the cross-linked amino acids are very close to the part of WDR33 visible in the x-ray structure. In addition, the very many cross-links of this short amino acid sequence, including some to other parts of the known structure, provide many constraints. It would be useful to present this information in a model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is helpful, but more details are still necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the most relevant information yielded by the cross-linking mass spectrometry experiments is the proximity of the cleft formed by CPSF160-WDR33 (including WDR33 N-terminal “hotspot”) and CPSF30 zinc finger domains (in agreement with Casanal et al., 2017) and the middle portion of Fip1 including its conserved domain (CD). We summarize this information in the updated version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We decided to exclude from the schematic model the cross-links between CPSF160 and WDR33 which map on the atomic coordinates since the information implicit in the crystal structure is more accurate and, therefore, the cross-link data, although in good general agreement, is redundant in this context. Additionally, as explained in our answer to point (6), many cross-links map on disordered regions of the crystal structure, restricting the amount of cross-links that can be correctly displayed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mass spectrometric raw data as well as xQuest/xProphet output and setting files should be made publicly available via an appropriate data repository.
