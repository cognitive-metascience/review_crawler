concentration-response relationship estimated in a population. Yet, in specific individuals, decisions based on the population-level effects frequently result in over or under-dosing. Here, we interrogate the relationship between population-based and individual-based responses to anesthetics in mice and zebrafish. The anesthetic state was assessed by quantifying responses to simple stimuli. Individual responses dynamically fluctuated at a fixed drug concentration. These fluctuations exhibited resistance to state transitions. Drug sensitivity varied dramatically across individuals in both species. The amount of noise driving transitions between states, in contrast, was highly conserved in vertebrates separated by 400 million years of evolution. Individual differences in anesthetic sensitivity and stochastic fluctuations in responsiveness complicate the ability to appropriately dose anesthetics to each individual. Identifying the biological substrate of noise, however, may spur novel therapies, assure consistent drug responses, and encourage the shift from population-based to personalized medicine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year, millions of patients undergo general anesthesia for complex or life-saving surgeries. In the vast majority of cases, the drugs work as intended. But a minority of patients take longer than expected to regain consciousness after anesthetic, and a few wake up during the surgery itself. It is unclear what causes these unintended events.</p><p>When choosing an anesthetic dose for each patient, physicians rely on data from large clinical studies. These studies expose many patients to different doses of an anesthetic drug. At higher doses, fewer and fewer patients remain conscious. This enables physicians to identify the dose at which an average person will lose consciousness. But this approach ignores the difference between the response of an individual and that of the population as a whole. At the population level, the likelihood of a patient being awake decreases smoothly as the concentration of anesthetic increases. But within that population, each individual patient can only ever show a binary response: awake or not awake.</p><p>To compare anesthetic effects on individuals versus populations, McKinstry-Wu, Wasilczuk et al. exposed mice to a commonly used anesthetic called isoflurane. During prolonged exposure to a constant dose of the drug, each mouse was sometimes unconscious and sometimes awake. These fluctuations in responsiveness seemed to occur at random. Exposing zebrafish to propofol, an anesthetic that works via a different mechanism, had a similar effect.</p><p>Notably, the responses of both species to anesthesia showed a phenomenon known as inertia. If an individual was unresponsive at one point in time, they were likely to still be unresponsive when assessed again after three minutes. The amount of inertia was similar in mice and zebrafish. This suggests that the mechanism responsible for inertia has remained unchanged over more than 400 million years of evolution.</p><p>The results reveal similarities between how individuals respond to anesthetics and how individual anesthetic molecules act on cells. When a molecule binds to its receptor protein on a cell, the receptor fluctuates spontaneously between active and inactive states. Studying how individuals respond to drugs could thus provide clues to how the drugs themselves work. Future studies should explore the biological basis of fluctuations in anesthetic responses. Understanding how these arise will help us tailor anesthetics to individual patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>state transitions</kwd><kwd>personalized medicine</kwd><kwd>individual differences</kwd><kwd>stochastic fluctuations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 GM123317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinstry-Wu</surname><given-names>Andrew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proekt</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM088156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelz</surname><given-names>Max B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM107117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelz</surname><given-names>Max B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM112596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelz</surname><given-names>Max B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Responses to anesthetics differ among individuals and fluctuate stochastically despite constant drug concentration, however, the amount of noise driving transitions between the responsive and the unresponsive state is conserved.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the great promises of personalized medicine is the delivery of a maximally efficacious and minimally harmful dose of appropriate medication to every patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>). Traditionally, dosing decisions are based on the relationship between drug concentration and the magnitude of effect observed in a population expressed as the sigmoidal dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodman, 1996</xref>). An implicit assumption of this approach is that population averages adequately reflect the processes operating within each individual patient. This is not always true. For many drug classes such as antiepileptics, anesthetics, and antiarrhythmics, the response is binary at the level of an individual—the desired effect is either present or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Löscher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sunderam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jürgens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonner, 2002</xref>). The population-based dose-response curve, in contrast, is a smooth graded function of drug concentration. Therefore, in order to deliver on the promise of optimal drug dosing at the individual level, the relationship between individual binary responses and the population-based graded estimates of drug potency have to be more rigorously defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koch-Weser, 1975</xref>).</p><p>Many examples of graded population-level responses co-existing with discrete, binary individual responses are seen in biophysics. A priori, one might have expected that the current flow through a single ion channel molecule would simply be a scaled version of the current recorded in a cell containing many such ion channels. Yet, this is not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sakmann and Neher, 1984</xref>). While at the whole cell level, current varies smoothly as a function of voltage and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>), each ion channel molecule stochastically switches between conductive and nonconductive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fukushima, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldrich et al., 1983</xref>). Ligand-gated ion channels also stochastically fluctuate between discrete conductive and non-conductive states at a constant concentration of a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swanson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papke et al., 1989</xref>). Stochastic transitions between discrete states extend to higher levels of organization. For example, synaptic transmission is mediated by stochastic vesicular fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuffler and Yoshikami, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rizzoli and Betz, 2005</xref>). At the cellular level, stochastic fluctuations in gene expression and protein abundance are observed even in a clonal population of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McAdams and Arkin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>). For instance, stochastic forces influence differentiation patterns across identical cells and give rise to drastically different proteomic responses of clonal cancer cells to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Losick and Desplan, 2008</xref>). Thus, stochastic fluctuations among discrete states even in a constant environment are the rule at the microscopic level in many, if not all, biological processes.</p><p>Detailed quantitative models of stochastic switching between different states of an individual molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1995</xref>) are required to forge the relationship between discrete microscopic events and graded responses in the population. Macroscopic constructs such as pharmacologic efficacy depend upon drug-induced changes in discrete states of single molecules as well as stochastic switches among them. Yet, drug efficacy does not uniquely specify responses of individual molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colquhoun, 1998</xref>). Thus, while discrete responses at the individual level can be linked to the smooth population-level responses using techniques from statistical mechanics, individual responses cannot be readily inferred from population-level analyses.</p><p>Here, we asked whether stochastic fluctuations among discrete states, similar to those postulated to act at the level of individual molecules, organelles, and cells influence the responses of intact multicellular organisms exposed to a constant drug concentration. For this purpose, we chose to focus on anesthetics. Anesthesia is thought to consist of four basic components: amnesia, immobility, analgesia, and unconsciousness. Responses to stimuli are typically used to quantify the various components of anesthesia. At lower anesthetic doses that produce light sedation, a patient can respond to salient verbal commands and less noticeable auditory commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2014</xref>), albeit with longer latency. When the state of general anesthesia is attained, the patient is unresponsive even to a painful surgical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller, 2014</xref>). Clinical assessment of anesthetic depth ultimately collapses to binary outcomes: amnestic or not, immobile or not, and conscious or not. We consequently studied binary responses to a simple stimulus at a fixed anesthetic concentration across individuals to determine whether they are anesthetized or not. These all-or-none responses can be assessed by determining whether a human patient reacts to a simple verbal command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Russell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flaishon et al., 1997</xref>). The concentration of anesthetic at which 50% of patient lose their ability to respond to verbal commands is known at MAC-awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franks, 2008</xref>). In rodent literature, the righting reflex (RR) is typically used to establish whether a mouse is awake or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wasilczuk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franks, 2006</xref>). MAC-awake and the EC<sub>50</sub> for loss of RR are closely correlated across mechanistically distinct anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franks, 2008</xref>). Discrete responses to simple stimuli can be used in other organisms such as larval zebrafish to assess anesthetic potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to discrete measures used in individual subjects, anesthetic potency at a population level is expressed as a smooth sigmoid function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller, 2014</xref>). Traditionally, the dichotomy between the graded population-level response on the one hand, and the binary responses of individuals on the other, has been interpreted as inter-subject variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sonner et al., 2000</xref>). For instance, at the population level half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), it is assumed that half of all the subjects will be able to consistently respond to the stimulus while the other half will consistently fail to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Yet, this is not the only possibility. It is possible that at EC<sub>50</sub>, each individual subject will respond to 50% of stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, it is possible that the probability of response is influenced by the state of the subject at the moment when the stimulus is applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different individual behaviors can produce identical population effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Presence (top) or absence (bottom) of righting reflex is a binary behavioral measure that distinguishes awake from anesthetized mice. Schematic representations of three qualitatively distinct models that yield 50% population responsive probability (PRP) are shown in B-D. (<bold>B</bold>) Responses in each individual remain constant on repeated righting reflex assessments. Hence, PRP is solely a consequence of individual differences in drug sensitivity. This is the commonly assumed model. (<bold>C</bold>) PRP is a consequence of a constant response probability for each animal on each trial; responses on repeated trials fluctuate, but the probability of response is independent of the state of the animal. (<bold>D</bold>) PRP is a consequence of a state-dependent fluctuations in responses to repeated presentation of the stimulus. In this example, animals tend to stay in the previously observed state.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50143-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To distinguish among these possibilities, we exposed both mice and zebrafish to fixed concentrations of two mechanistically distinct anesthetics and repeatedly tested their responsiveness. The results unequivocally demonstrate that at a fixed drug concentration, each individual mouse or zebrafish stochastically switches between being responsive and unresponsive. The probability of response depends upon the subject’s state. Therefore, stochastic state switching is apparently present at all organizational levels, from receptor to cell to whole animal. Unlike identical ion channel molecules, however, individual animals both in highly genetically inbred and across outbred populations exhibited dramatic variability in parameters that describe the stochastic switching between the responsive and unresponsive states. The inter-individual variability in parameters of the stochastic model fit to each individual was highly structured in both mice and in zebrafish. One manifestation of this structure is that while the overall sensitivity to anesthetics varied among individuals, the amount of noise that drives state switches was the same across individuals exposed to the same anesthetic concentration.</p><p>As a result of the inter-subject variability and stochastic intra-subject fluctuations in responsiveness, the population-level concentration response cannot be used to reliably determine the probability that any given individual will (or will not) be anesthetized. Detailed quantification of stochastic forces that shape the within-subject fluctuations in responsiveness and between-subject variability lays the foundation for the construction of more informative stochastic models that can reconcile binary responses of individual organisms with population-based measures of drug potency. These models can in turn be used to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine to deliver the appropriate dose of medication tailored to each individual patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual responses to anesthetics fluctuate in a state-dependent fashion at a fixed drug concentration</title><p>The presence of the righting reflex (RR) during continuous isoflurane administration was used as the measure of responsiveness in mice.

Hence, fluctuations in responsiveness under constant anesthetic concentration are inconsistent with a Bernoulli process. Therefore, while effective concentration is a useful measure of population-based drug potency, it cannot be adequately applied to an individual. Specifically, effective concentration cannot account for the apparent resistance to state transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Individual differences are highly structured</title><p>We now turn to the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations and population level variability. One common assumption is that observing a single mouse over long period of time is equivalent to observing a snapshot of the population of mice. In other words, an experiment on each individual mouse can be thought of as a different realization of the same process. In an apparent departure from this assumption, we observed high inter-individual variability in responsiveness in mice and in zebrafish. For instance, at 0.6% isoflurane some mice were able to right themselves on fewer than 20% of trials, while other mice within the same highly inbred population, exposed to the same anesthetic concentration, during the same experiment, were able to right themselves on ~70% of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Experimentally observed inter-individual variability was significantly higher than in simulations constrained to have the same number of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, F(1, 38)=27.8, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic> for mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, F(1,142)=52.5, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic> for zebrafish, Brown-Forsythe test). This implies that the observed inter-subject variability in responsiveness is unlikely to be solely due to finite sample size. Rather, anesthetic sensitivity can differ significantly between individuals.</p><p>We then sought to determine how inter-individual variability is reflected in the parameters of a model of trial-to-trial fluctuations in responsiveness fit to each animal individually (Materials and methods). The dwell times in responsive and unresponsive states for both mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were approximately exponential. No significant autocorrelations in fluctuations were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, switching between states of responsiveness and unresponsiveness in each individual can be well approximated by a two-state transition probability matrix (Materials and methods). Because the sum of transition probabilities in each row of this matrix is exactly one, the two-state transition probability matrix is completely specified by knowing the two transition probabilities along the diagonal, <italic>P(U|U)</italic> and <italic>P(R|R)</italic>. The plane spanned by these two diagonal transition probabilities, therefore, is the parameter space for models of stochastic fluctuations in responsiveness in mice and in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Movement along the x-axis to the right, results in decrease in the overall probability of response (e.g. from I to II and from III to IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, movement up along the y-axis results in the increase in the overall probability of response (e.g. from III to I and from IV to II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moving along the dotted lines within the parameter space does not affect the overall probability of being responsive – that is systems II and III have the same overall probability of response. The key difference between II and III is the number of transitions between the responsive and the unresponsive state. In contrast, movement from I to IV does not affect the sum of <italic>P(U|U)</italic> and <italic>P(R|R)</italic>. As a result, while the overall probability of responsiveness in I and IV is different, the amount of noise that drives state transitions between the responsive and the unresponsive states is the same. To realize why this is the case, we can visualize the two-by-two transition probability matrix as an energy landscape with two wells which correspond to the responsive and the unresponsive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Proekt and Hudson, 2018</xref>). Conservation of the sum of<italic> P(U|U)</italic> and <italic>P(R|R)</italic> reflects the fact that the sum of the depths of the wells is conserved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Stability of responsiveness and unresponsiveness are linked.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) The transition probability matrix for each individual can be represented as a point on a plane spanned by the diagonal elements P(U|U) and P(R|R) denoting the probability of staying in the previously observed state.

(Center) Examples of simulations constructed by creating transition probability matrices from the corresponding locations in the parameter plane. (Right) Movement along the dashed gray lines preserves the overall probability of response (Traces II and III). As one moves along the dashed gray line from bottom left to top right, the frequency of state transitions decreases but the overall response probability stays the same. In contrast, movement parallel to the line y = −x results in changes in response probability while conserving the noise driving transition between the responsive and the unresponsive states (Traces I and IV). This is because the line y = −x preserves the sum of stability of the responsive and the unresponsive states.

The fact that their sum is constant across individuals implies that the amount of noise that drives state transitions between responsive and unresponsive states was consistent in all individuals exposed to a fixed anesthetic concentration. Yet, sensitivity to anesthetics measured as the overall probability of responding to a stimulus varied broadly in the same population of individuals. Altogether these results indicate that, while transitions between states of responsiveness are noise-driven and therefore unpredictable, the amount of noise is tightly controlled in all individuals. Too little noise would result in individuals being trapped in a single state, whereas too much noise would overpower the intrinsic dynamics of the brain, leading to a noise dominated process characterized by rapid state switching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual differences in drug sensitivity complicate decoding of drug concentration from drug responses</title><p>Sigmoid dose-response curves are one-to-one functions—knowing drug concentration is sufficient to estimate probability of a response in a population. Critically, the converse is also true; knowing the probability of a response in a population is sufficient to determine the concentration of the drug to which this population is exposed. While this one-to-one relationship may hold for a population, we sought to determine whether the large inter-individual variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) complicates this one-to-one relationship at the level of an individual. We compared individual transition probability matrices estimated at 0.6% and 0.3% isoflurane. Note that here, mice exposed to 0.6% isoflurane were distinct from mice exposed to 0.3% isoflurane. Individual matrices estimated for 0.3% isoflurane, much like those estimated at 0.6% isoflurane, exhibited strong negative correlations (<italic>R<sup>2</sup> = −0.86, p&lt;0.0001, Pearson’s R)</italic> between the diagonal elements of the transition probability matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Note, however, that there is significant overlap (57%) between the two distributions. As a consequence of this overlap, it is not possible to reliably determine whether an individual was exposed to 0.6% or 0.3% isoflurane over a large range of individual anesthetic sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The same phenomenon was observed for individual zebrafish exposed to medium alone or 3 μM propofol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation is in stark contrast to the population-based measures of anesthetic potency. Hill slopes of the population-based dose-response curves for anesthetics are some of the steepest among clinically useful drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joiner et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, small increases in drug concentration are expected to result in a dramatic change in the probability that an individual will be anesthetized. Yet, as demonstrated here, there is considerable overlap in sensitivity to anesthetics.

To investigate the origins of this observation, we constructed a simple mathematical model that can explain this striking correlation. The Markov process defined by a two-state transition probability matrix can be thought of as a discrete approximation of a continuous system that fluctuates stochastically between two stable states. To illustrate how such a multistable system can be embodied in the brain, we consider a simple network consisting of two neuronal populations (α and β <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The two neuronal populations inhibit each other and excite themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno-Bote et al. (2007)</xref> demonstrate that activity of such networks can be parameterized as a function of difference in activity of the two neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Because of self-excitation and mutual inhibition, the network exhibits two stable activity patterns: one where activity of α dominates, and the other, where activity of β dominates. We operationally define these stable network patterns as awake and anesthetized respectively. The likelihood of every activity pattern of the network is expressed by an ‘energy function’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The more likely activity patterns are associated with lower energy and the less likely activity patterns are associated with higher energy. In the absence of noise such networks stay in one of the two stable states indefinitely. When noise is added to the system, it switches between the two stable network configurations stochastically. While the amount of noise changes the frequency of switching between the two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), it does not have a dramatic effect on the shape of the overall distribution of states. In both cases the distribution of states of the system is bimodal akin to what we observe in the startle reflex data in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A simple bistable neuronal network model with noise, reproduces experimental findings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The network consists of two neuronal populations (β and α) which are operationally defined as ‘sleep active’ and ‘wake active’ respectively. Neuronal populations are mutually inhibitory and self-excitatory. Activity of such networks can be parametrized as a function of difference in activity between α and β using an energy function (<bold>B</bold>). At population-level EC<sub>50</sub> (middle panel) some individuals have low probability of being in the awake state (Sensitive), while others have a high righting probability (Resistant). These differences in sensitivity are reflected in the depth of the energy wells which correspond to the Anesthetized (β-dominated) and Awake (α-dominated). The increase in the depth of the anesthetized well is proportional to the decrease in the awake well. (<bold>C</bold>) Shows the time evolution of network activity (at equal depths of the awake and the anesthetized wells) with different noise amounts. Trace shows the time evolution and the marginal distribution shows the probability distribution of states. Noise drives the time-evolution of the system: as more noise is added, the system fluctuates more rapidly. Since the distribution of states is bimodal, the states of the system can be discretized by applying a threshold. This is analogous to thresholding the SR responses in the zebrafish. (<bold>D</bold>) Discretized activity of the network was analyzed using a two-state Markov process as for experimental results. The parameters of the transition probability matrix are shown for different anesthetic sensitivities (color) and amounts of noise (symbol size). In order to obtain the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> the amount of noise has to be constrained among individuals (σ = 0.4 matches the results at EC<sub>50</sub> for propofol and isoflurane).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50143-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To model the effects of anesthetics on different individuals, we assume that anesthetics activate sleep-active β neurons and inhibit wake-active α neurons. To account for the strong negative correlation between <italic>P(U|U)</italic> and <italic>P(R|R)</italic>, we assume that the degree of anesthetic-induced excitation and inhibition is correlated. Thus, individual differences in anesthetic sensitivity can be modeled by modulating the anesthetic effect on the network. In an attempt to model the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, we simulate the behavior of such networks with various amounts of noise. We then approximate the data of the kind seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> obtained for different anesthetic sensitivities and noise levels using a Markov model akin to that deployed for analysis of righting and startle reflex throughout this work. To accomplish this, the continuous fluctuations in the state of the network are binarized using a threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) into the ‘responsive’ and the ‘unresponsive’ states. The transition probability matrix is then estimated from these binary time-series. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>. When the noise amounts are small, the system tends to stay in its previously observed state. Thus, for low-noise simulations, the points are found around the periphery of the plane spanned by <italic>P(U|U)</italic> and <italic>P(R|R)</italic>. When the noise is exceedingly high, the dynamics of the system become independent of the shape of the energy landscape and tends toward the point (0.5, 0.5) in the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. This would be expected if the system behaved like a Bernoulli process at EC<sub>50</sub>. In order to reproduce the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, the amount of noise needs to be tuned and maintained at an approximately the same level across individuals. In the simulations, this corresponds to Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation (σ)=0.4. These simulations support our conjecture that while individuals are different in terms of anesthetic sensitivity, the amount of noise that drives fluctuations between the responsive and the unresponsive states is conserved. Note, that in the units of trial number, the dwell time distributions were similar in fish and in mice. However, in mice the trials were spaced 3 minutes apart whereas in fish the inter-trial interval was 30 seconds. Thus, in units of seconds, mice dwelled signficantly longer in the awake and the unresponsive state than zebrafish. In order to account for this difference in the characteristic dwell times, the time scale of fluctuations shown in Figure 8C would have to be scaled by a specie-specific diffusion constant (Methods). </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that even when an animal is exposed to a fixed drug concentration, its response fluctuates stochastically. The probability of response depends on the state of the animal at the moment of stimulation. Specifically, the fluctuations exhibit inertia – the animal is more likely to be stuck in its current state than to transition between states of responsiveness. In contrast to most drugs that are administered either intravenously or orally, the route of administration of many anesthetics is inhalational. This allows us to assure that the drug concentration in the animal is at equilibrium with the ambient concentration in a closed chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>). We utilize this significant experimental advantage to focus on the dynamics of responses within each individual at a constant drug concentration. However, stochastic fluctuations are not unique to a volatile anesthetic. An intravenous anesthetic, propofol, administered to zebrafish equilibrated with a fixed concentration bath, was also associated with dynamic fluctuations in responsiveness. The stochastic processes that govern the fluctuations observed under two mechanistically distinct anesthetics were remarkably similar between mice and zebrafish. It is curious to note that while the dwell times in the responsive and the unresponsive state in mice and in zebrafish were similarly correlated, the absolute duration of these states varied signficantly between mice and zebrafish. The duration of responsive and unresponsive states was approximately similar to the duration of sleep episodes in these two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that this relationship between duration of sleep episodes and the duration of the episodes of unresponsiveness arises because similar neurobiological mechanisms are responsible for both transitions between sleep and wakefulness and fluctuations between the responsive and the unresponsive states observed under anesthesia. </p><p>Our observations of stochastic switching between responsive and unresponsive states are consistent with previous findings showing that at a fixed anesthetic concentration, spectral characteristics of electrical activity within thalamocortical networks switch stochastically between several discrete activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hudson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clement et al., 2008</xref>). Similar observations have been made using electroencephalography (EEG) of patients under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vlisides et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings in this study suggest that such stochastic fluctuations have a behavioral counterpart expressed as fluctuating ability to respond to a stimulus. It has been suggested previously that anesthetics stabilize neuronal dynamics in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>) and in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solovey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso et al., 2019</xref>). Stabilization of neuronal dynamics may contribute to the behavioral inertia observed in fluctuations in responsiveness of both mice and zebrafish. This resistance to state transitions may contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Proekt and Hudson, 2018</xref>) to anesthetic hysteresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuizenga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Warnaby et al., 2017</xref>) – a left-shift in a dose-response curve for emergence relative to induction of anesthesia that has been observed across taxa from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to humans.</p><p>Stochastic responses at a fixed drug concentration help explain several otherwise puzzling phenomena in clinical anesthesiology. On the one hand, Hill slopes of dose-response curves for anesthetics are reported between 10 and 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller, 2014</xref>); some of the steepest of the clinically used drugs. This is traditionally interpreted as a sign of low inter-subject variability in responsiveness. Nonetheless, approximately ten percent of patients transiently wake up during surgery as measured by their ability to respond to a verbal command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Russell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaskell et al., 2017</xref>). Luckily, incidence of awareness accompanied by post-operative recall is much less frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avidan et al., 2008</xref>). However, even episodes of awareness associated with recall and high risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osterman et al., 2001</xref>) are not reliably detected by the existing EEG-based monitors of anesthetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avidan et al., 2011</xref>). While anesthetics are thought to impart dose-dependent effects on neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stanski et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katoh et al., 1998</xref>), only weak correlations are observed between EEG characteristics and anesthetic concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitlock et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, both inter-individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitlock et al., 2011</xref>) and fluctuations of EEG measures of depth of anesthesia at a constant drug concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom et al., 2005</xref>) obscure the relationship between drug concentration and the observed state of the EEG. It is likely that the traditional population-based approach of estimating the relationship between the concentration of the drug and the response dramatically under-represents the within and inter-subject variability. Indeed, under most circumstances, each animal is tested only once at each drug concentration. The repeated testing of each animal under a fixed drug concentration is more akin to the clinical scenario where the patient is exposed to many surgical stimuli that can elicit stochastic fluctuations in the level of consciousness.</p><p>The Hill slope value observed in our study was approximately an order of magnitude lower than the previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joiner et al., 2013</xref>). This relative decrease in Hill slope reflects high inter-individual variability and stochastic fluctuations in each individual. There are several significant differences between our experimental paradigm and those explored in the previous work. Previous work, guided by purely pharmacokinetic considerations, used shorter isoflurane exposures. In contrast, here we measured anesthetic responsiveness after a two-hour equilibration time. Under most circumstances, Markov processes lead to a single equilibrium distribution of states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roman, 1989</xref>). The time it takes to reach this equilibrium, however, is dictated by, among other things, the degree of resistance to state transitions. Thus, one reason for the discrepancy between our Hill slope estimate and that published previously is that our analysis assures that the population of animals is at a behavioral steady state. In order to reliably anesthetize an individual after a short exposure, higher concentrations of anesthetics are necessary. Indeed, our EC<sub>50</sub> estimate (0.54–0.55% isoflurane) is significantly lower than that published in the previous work (0.9% for induction and 0.83% for emergence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>). Another fundamental difference between our approach and that used in the previous work is that we tested mice repeatedly. In contrast, in the previous work, mice are typically tested only once at each concentration. Repeated testing revealed trial-to-trial fluctuations. These fluctuations increase the apparent variability in responsiveness, thereby decreasing the apparent Hill slope of the population.</p><p>The detailed mechanism of these stochastic fluctuations is not known as anesthetics exert effects on many molecular targets distributed broadly throughout the brain and spinal cord. A number of lines of evidence converge on the fact that anesthetics at least in part hijack the sleep-wake circuitry by exciting sleep-promoting and inhibiting wake-promoting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>). Switching between sleep and wake is thought to be mediated by the reciprocal inhibition between these neuronal populations. Networks consisting of reciprocally inhibitory neuronal populations tend to exhibit self-reinforcing behavior. Once sleep-active neurons activate beyond a certain threshold, they shut down the wake-active neurons thereby decreasing their inhibitory effects and further strengthen mutual excitation amongst the sleep-active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saper et al., 2005</xref>). The converse happens during wakefulness. In the absence of perturbations, the network consisting of such mutually inhibitory self-reinforcing neuronal populations will remain in the same state indefinitely. Once sufficient noise is added, however, the system will stochastically switch between consolidated states of sleep and wakefulness. Theoretical investigations of bistable neuronal networks suggest that activity within such mutually inhibitory neuronal populations can be well approximated by a diffusion on an energy landscape with two potential wells; one for each stable activity pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno-Bote et al., 2007</xref>). Anesthetics can therefore be thought of as stabilizing (deepening) the wells associated with unresponsiveness and de-stabilizing the wells associated with wakefulness. The degree to which these states are stabilized by clinically relevant doses of anesthetics is apparently insufficient to consistently keep all animals in the anesthetized state. Hence, stochastic fluctuations may be responsible for episodes of awareness that occur during surgeries.</p><p>The importance of noise in systems near a bifurcation between two stable behaviors is not limited to circuits that control sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chialvo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Destexhe and Contreras, 2006</xref>). Neuronal architectures similar to those involved in sleep and wakefulness are thought to play a role in diverse processes such as sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno-Bote et al., 2007</xref>), decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>), seizure generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suffczynski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fröhlich et al., 2010</xref>), and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camperi and Wang, 1998</xref>) to name a few. Mathematically similar phenomena govern transitions between normal sinus rhythm and arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is likely that stochastic fluctuations between distinct responses observed under constant drug concentration are not unique to anesthetics.</p><p>To determine whether a bistable system with noise can explain the striking correlations between P(U|U) and P(R|R) observed herein, we simulated such a neural-network-inspired system with parametrically varied amount of noise. The results of this simulation show that in order to obtain such correlations, the amount of noise must be conserved among individuals. Another issue addressed by the modeling approach is the binary nature of behavioral responses in each individual. In zebrafish, this binarization was motivated by the observation of a bimodal distribution of distances travelled by each zebrafish after the tap stimulus. This bimodality naturally suggests that the responses fall into two distinct classes. Yet, similar measurements are much more difficult to perform for the righting reflex. Thus, it is not clear from behavioral observations of RR alone, whether the underlying processes that give rise to a response on a RR trial are continuous or discrete. Furthermore, even if the underlying processes are discrete it is not a priori clear that only two states are present. We observed that dwell times in both the responsive and the unresponsive state are well-approximated by a single exponential distribution. Thus, we only find empirical evidence for two states. Longer recordings may be required in future work to determine whether other states are needed to completely describe the data. The two state Markov model used to analyze behavioral responses, can be seen as a natural discretization of the continuous bistable system exemplified by our modeling approach. For most reasonable choices of threshold, the continuous system and its discrete approximation will yield similar results.</p><p>In some ways, our observations of stochastic switching between different states at a fixed drug concentration are similar to those well known for single receptor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papke et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tank et al., 1982</xref>). There is an important distinction, however, between molecular scale state transitions and those observed at the behavioral level in animals. At the molecular scale, differences between receptors are largely immaterial—the same stochastic model can be used to describe state transitions in all receptors of a particular kind. Thus, observing a single receptor molecule over time is sufficient to determine the response of a population of such receptors. Within intact multicellular organisms, in contrast, we show that the transition probabilities were significantly different amongst highly genetically similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uchimura et al., 2015</xref>) and genetically outbred individuals exposed to the same anesthetic concentration. Observation of one individual on many trials does not equate to observing a population of individuals. Indeed, at population level EC<sub>50</sub>, some animals were three times as likely to be responsive as other individuals from the same population. Furthermore, these individual differences were consistent across time in each individual.</p><p>The inter-individual variability in the transition probabilities that govern switching between responsive and unresponsive states was constrained such that the sum of the diagonal elements was a constant. This constraint is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates from zebrafish to mice. Note that the sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix is known as the trace and is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalue of a transition probability matrix for a reversible Markov process is 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levin and Peres, 2017</xref>). The fact that the trace is approximately the same in all individuals under similar experimental conditions implies that the spectral gap of the 2 × 2 transition probability matrix defined as, λ<sub>1</sub>−λ<sub>2</sub>, where λ<sub>n</sub> is the <italic>n<sup>th</sup></italic> eigenvalue is also a constant conserved among individuals. The spectral gap of the matrix sets its mixing time, or the time it takes for a system starting out in a random distribution of states to approach its equilibrium distribution. In this particular case, the equilibrium distribution is the overall probability that a given animal will be able to respond to a stimulus. Boltzmann equation asserts that diffusive systems of the kind used in our model come to a single equilibrium distribution that depends just on the energy function. The time it takes to reach this equilibrium distribution of states, however, depends on the amount of noise. The more noise is added to the system, the quicker it reaches the equilibrium distribution. Thus, there is a fundamental relationship between the conservation of the spectral gap across individuals and the tightly controlled noise in a continuous system characterized by a two well potential. In a clear departure from the predictions made by the population-level dose-response curve, our findings indicate that the equilibrium probability of responding to a stimulus at a given drug concentration is different for distinct individuals. The time it takes to reach this behavioral equilibrium, however, is conserved amongst animals. This strongly implies that the noise which drives state transitions between responsive and unresponsive states is tightly biologically controlled. A similar observation has been made for stochastic influences on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>On the one hand, our results may be seen as disappointing for the clinical practice of anesthesiology. Because of the strong influence of stochastic forces, it does not appear possible to keep a subject reliably in an anesthetized state without exposing them to the potentially dangerous high concentrations of anesthetics associated with subsequently impaired cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whitlock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, the fact that variability in transition probabilities is constrained offers a possible novel avenue for improvement by developing therapies specifically aimed at state stabilization. Selective stabilization of the unconscious state could provide a solution to minimize the risk of spontaneously shifting into a brain state where awareness is possible, without requiring drug concentrations prone to adverse effects. How might this be achieved? One possibility is to target the mechanisms that are known to affect the stability of the sleep-wake circuitry. For instance, interference with orexinergic signaling destabilizes both sleep and wake states thereby increasing the frequency of spontaneous transitions between sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mochizuki et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, interference with orexin signaling also affects responses to anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shirasaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Detailed investigation of the synergy between anesthetics and modification of noise inherent in neuronal networks that control sleep and wakefulness may help develop novel therapies that will allow clinicians better control over the state of each individual patient.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania and were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.

The presence or absence of the righting reflex (RR) was checked every 3 min, starting after 2 hr of isoflurane exposure to assure pharmacokinetic equilibration. RR was assessed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). A mouse was considered to have an intact righting reflex if it was able to restore its upright posture twice in a row after being turned on its back by rotating the anesthetic chamber without interrupting anesthetic delivery. Otherwise, the righting reflex was considered to be absent. Forty RR assessments were performed per animal per exposure. In total, 160 RR assessments were performed on each mouse at each anesthetic concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Propofol exposure with Startle Reflex evaluation in zebrafish</title><p>At 5 days post fertilization (dpf), individual larvae were placed into a 96-well glass plate (JG Finneran, 500 μL volume wells).

This paper presents a useful examination of the variable and stochastic nature of behavior during anesthesia, separating trial- and individual-level variability in behavioral outcomes.

However, the state of anesthesia is a spectrum with multiple dimensions – for example, a patient can be in a lightly anesthetized state in which they will not react to a simple sensory stimulus, but will still react to a painful stimulus. The Introduction should be written to clarify this distinction. The method the authors propose can be applied to a specific desired behavioral outcome of interest during anesthesia, but it doesn't mean that anesthesia itself is binary.</p><p>- While the authors state several times that behavior is thought to be constant during anesthesia, in general it is known that behavior is variable at a given concentration, for example a binomial state-space model of variable behavior during multiple concentrations of anesthesia has been previously developed and should be cited, Wong et al., 2014.</p><p>- The discussion of bistable states is a bit misleading, particularly the section comparing sleep and anesthesia, since it seems unlikely this is a bistable switching between sleep and wakefulness. Even a very gradual descent into anesthesia will appear bistable if a single yes/no threshold is applied to define the behavioral state. In this scenario, the bistable nature is imposed by the behavioral reporting scheme used, and a completely different result could be obtained by using a different behavioral paradigm (for example, if using a study measuring reaction time or magnitude of response). The methods point out the thresholding techniques applied to achieve a binomial outcome (a decision as to whether the mouse achieves 2 separate rightings, and a threshold of distance travelled that is applied to the zebrafish). The Figure 2—figure supplement 2 provides an example of this, as while there is bimodality to the behavior, the yes/no behavioral report is imposed by the authors' threshold. It's useful to distinguish between the bistability of the behavioral test (which is useful for clinical purposes) vs. the bistability of the brain state (which is not shown here, since no neural data were acquired, and in general is found to exhibit complex graded dynamics across anesthetic states).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper describes experiments that characterize responsiveness of mice (righting reflex) and zebrafish (startle reflex) in the presence of varying concentrations of anesthetics. The investigators find that i) responsiveness does not match expectations of a Bernoulli process, but rather it fluctuates on a time scale slower than their repeated observations; ii) anesthetic sensitivity differs between individuals, both on a short-term and on a long-term basis; and iii) response probability shows a broad distribution for individuals, in contrast to the expected steep dose-response of population responses. Based on similarities between inter-individual transition variability characteristics the authors argue that noise driving transitions is a conserved and tightly constrained value across species.</p><p>The study has many strengths. It uses an interestingly different approach to address an old question, one that has been investigated extensively in the past but that remains unanswered and of intense interest. The methodology is sound, and the observations have been carefully and thoroughly documented. The analysis based on probabilistic statistics makes a convincing case for fluctuating responsiveness that differs between individuals, a finding that is novel and important to the field.</p><p>One aspect of the paper that I find less convincing, and possibly problematic, is that the Abstract and Discussion focus so strongly on the 'noise' driving transitions, concluding that noise is tightly controlled and conserved across species – all without having made any explicit assessment of the inferred noise nor any attempt to manipulate it. Rather, the conclusion was based on the finding that the joint distributions of transition probabilities lie on a diagonal and are strongly negatively correlated (Figure 4). The interpretation that 'noise' drives the transitions depends on the underlying model. The authors do put forward a possible model, with their suggestion that the consolidated states of 'sleep' and 'wakefulness' may form such a neurophysiological model. In their model, noise is required to overcome a barrier between the states, similar to the barrier between metastable states of a receptor. This is a reasonable, even attractive, model, but it is conceptual rather than quantitative. Thus, it is difficult to understand how this might be applied to state changes in different individuals or species, and whether the amount of noise is the same or not. Perhaps a quantitative model of the depths of wells/heights of barriers could be derived from the data, using the data of Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to derive transition rates, and compare them explicitly between individuals and species.</p><p>Another interesting observation that is discussed relatively extensively is the relationship between individual responsiveness, which seems to show a relatively shallow concentration-response, compared to the expected steepness based on previous population data. It would be useful to know whether the aggregated data do indeed show the expected (as quoted) Hill coefficient of 10-40. If this is the case, can the authors explain how dispersed shallow concentration responses add up to steep population response relationships? If it is not the case, this information is worth noting and it will further inform the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50143.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] It is not clear to me that the pharmacological community (or life scientists and clinicians more generally) would be surprised by the results of this study.

Thank you. To address it we had to perform additional experiments as in the original manuscript, two different cohorts of mice were subjected to 0.3 and 0.6% isoflurane. We now subjected a separate cohort of mice to both 0.4 and 0.7% isoflurane and report the results in the revised manuscript. When the mice are compared to themselves at different isoflurane concentrations the overlap (shown in newly added Figure 7) is still present. However, it is smaller than that in Figure 6. Using bootstrapping we estimated the response distributions for each individual and compared the distributions observed at 0.4 and 0.7% isoflurane on an individual basis. The results revealed variable degree of overlap at the level of an individual. The comparatively smaller overlap in this new experimental group is consistent with our observations that specific parameters of fluctuations are a unique identifiable feature of an individual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on the text:</p><p>- The paper's Introduction states that anesthesia is a binary state, and that an individual is either anesthetized or not.

The reviewer is correct to say that the state of anesthesia is a “spectrum with multiple dimensions”. We now discuss this important caveat in the Introduction to the manuscript in detail. That being said, while it is true that responses to anesthetics can be thought of as a spectrum, several lines of evidence suggest that our binarized definition of the anesthetic state is not without merit.</p><p>First, the most universally used measure of anesthetic potency is minimal alveolar concentration (MAC). MAC was originally defined as the concentration at which 50% of subjects lose their ability to respond to painful surgical stimuli. Subsequently other MAC-values have been defined. For instance, MAC-awake defines the concentration at which 50% of human subjects lose their ability to respond to verbal commands. This MAC-awake value is very closely correlated with MAC for righting reflex in mice for a number of mechanistically distinct anesthetics Franks 2008. Thus, while it is true that multiple anesthetic end points can be defined, with respect to the most common measures used for several decades in anesthesia research, the responses of each individual are binary.</p><p>The second reason to suspect that the state of general anesthesia may not be entirely graded is that during exposure to a fixed anesthetic concentration, brain activity stochastically fluctuates between several discrete states Hudson et al., 2014. The discrete nature of fluctuations in brain activity under anesthesia has been confirmed with cluster analysis. Similar fluctuations among discrete activity patterns are observed in human EEG during surgery Chander et al., 2014. Here we show that, much like brain activity, behavioral responses also fluctuate at a fixed drug concentration.</p><p>While it is true that one could devise a continuous measure of behavioral responses such as response latency suggested by the reviewer, this measurement is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. Finally, the ultimate goal of administering anesthesia is to render the patient unconscious. The increase in the reaction time that would most likely be observed with low doses of anesthetics does not distinguish between conscious and unconscious patient. Patients capable of responding to the stimulus, albeit with longer latency, are nevertheless awake by definition. While little is known about the neuronal correlates of consciousness, it is nevertheless reasonable to assume that there is a discrete difference between the conscious and the unconscious state of the brain.</p><p>We have added a continuous bistable system into the manuscript. This model illustrates the relationship between the discrete responses defined on the basis of behavior and the underlying continuous dynamics (see details below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While the authors state several times that behavior is thought to be constant during anesthesia, in general it is known that behavior is variable at a given concentration, for example a binomial state-space model of variable behavior during multiple concentrations of anesthesia has been previously developed and should be cited, Wong et al., 2014.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

Also, please see our response to Major Comment 3 with respect to the discrete nature of brain activity under anesthesia. We acknowledge the thresholding issue in the Discussion section. We also address the issue of thresholding in a mathematical model (see responses to reviewer 3) newly added to the manuscript. This model does not a prioriassume the discreteness of responses and explicitly introduces a threshold for binarizing behavior. Our choice to binarize the data is a practical one. As noted by the reviewer, while movement of the zebrafish in response to a tap stimulus is continuous, the distribution of the net amount of movement is clearly bimodal. The implication of this bimodality is that movements elicited by the startle stimulus fall into two distinct classes: responsive and unresponsive. Our goal here was not to precisely model the kinematics of each specific response but to more coarsely describe the system as fluctuating between the responsive and the unresponsive state. No experimental observation is purely binary. Even in the presence of perfectly binarized responses, measurement error will necessarily contaminate the results and yield a bimodal distribution, which is what we observe in the zebrafish. This for instance is also true for single ion channel recordings: the histogram of conductance levels is multimodal.</p><p>We use the following observations to assert that stochastic fluctuations between two states is a parsimonious model that can account for the data:</p><p>1) Dwell times in each state are exponentially distributed.</p><p>2) No autocorrelations in fluctuations are observed.</p><p>3) Deviations from a Bernoulli process imply stabilization of the unresponsive state.</p><p>4) A continuous bistable model when subjected to a threshold (akin to that used for zebrafish data) recapitulates all experimental results (including the correlation between P(U|U) and P(R|R).</p><p>It is possible that a more complex model will be required in the future. However, all of the present data are readily explained by noise driven fluctuations of a bistable system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] One aspect of the paper that I find less convincing, and possibly problematic, is that the Abstract and Discussion focus so strongly on the 'noise' driving transitions, concluding that noise is tightly controlled and conserved across species – all without having made any explicit assessment of the inferred noise nor any attempt to manipulate it.

We de-emphasized the significance of noise. We also agree that quantification and a more formal definition of noise was lacking. To address this shortcoming, we introduced a mathematical model that summarizes our findings and defines noise more rigorously.</p><p>We chose to describe the system as stochastic switching between two states: responsive and unresponsive. This choice is motivated by the observation that the dwell time distribution (both mice and fish) in the responsive and the unresponsive states were approximately exponential and no autocorrelations in fluctuations were found. Thus, stochastic state transitions are the simplest model that can account for the data.</p><p>Specifically, the Markov process that we used in the paper can be thought of as a discrete approximation to a continuous system with noise. In order to account for the apparent resistance to state transitions (see Figure 3), a continuous model must have a stabilization mechanism. One of the simplest examples of such systems with relevance to neuroscience is a system of mutually inhibitory neuronal populations with self-excitation Moreno-Bote et al., 2007. Theoretical work on such winner-take all networks suggests that the state space of all activity patterns exhibited by them can be characterized by an energy landscape (see newly added Figure 8). Each well in the energy landscape corresponds to an activity pattern where one of the neuronal groups is active and the other is silent. The dynamics of such networks can then be modeled as a diffusive process on this energy landscape. Because in our work we found evidence for just two states (each dwell time is approximately exponential) we modeled the system using two mutually inhibitory “wake active” and “sleep active” neuronal populations. Effects of anesthetics can be modeled as exciting “sleep active” neurons and inhibiting “wake active” ones. Because we observe that the individual differences in anesthetic responses in both mice and in zebrafish are constrained such that stability of the anesthetized state (P(U|U)) is negatively correlated with stability of the awake state (P(R|R)), we modeled anesthetic-induced excitation of sleep active and inhibition of wake active neurons as proportional.</p><p>Using this model, we can now examine the effect of noise. This was performed by simulating diffusion on an energy landscape using a stochastic differential equation where the gradient of the energy landscape and (Gaussian) noise drive the time-evolution of the state of the network. Newly introduced Figure 8 shows the results of this analysis. As expected, when the noise is low the system tends to dwell in its previously observed state. If noise is high, the system switches state rapidly. While the state of the system is continuous, the distribution of states is multimodal (Figure 8C). This is in precise accordance to what we observe in zebrafish. This also addresses the concerns of reviewer 2 regarding binarization of continuous data. By finding the gap between the two modes we threshold the data (exactly as in zebrafish experiments) and approximate the resultant binarized system using a two-state Markov process in the same way as in the zebrafish and mouse behaviors. The results in Figure 8D are in precise accordance with the observed data. When the noise is low, the systems characterized by different drug sensitivities are found around the outer periphery of the plane spanned by P(U|U) and P(R|R). When the noise is high, the dynamics become dominated by noise and the systems tend to the point (0.5 0.5) in this plot. Only when noise is constrained to an intermediate level, do we observe a line of points that characterizes the individual differences between mice and zebrafish. This is the foundation for our claim that, in order to observe the experimental data (Figure 4 and 6) the noise that drives fluctuations between states of responsiveness must be constrained. It is possible that a more sophisticated model could also reproduce the results, yet this simple model is sufficient and therefore we adapt it in our interpretation of the data.</p><p>As you suggested, we studied the dwell time distributions in both mice and in fish by fitting them to exponential functions. We observe that much like in the case of the transition probabilities (P(U|U) and P(R|R) the time constant for the dwells in the responsive and the unresponsive states are strongly negatively correlated. We now added this important observation into the manuscript. More generally, the specifics of the dwell time distribution will depend on the shape of the energy function and not just the depths of the wells. Since we do not have any means to measure the shape of the energy wells, we did not seek to formally relate the time constants for dwell time distribution to the height of the energy barrier. That being said, we found that standard deviation of 0.4, when added to the bistable system most closely approximated the results in both mice and in zebrafish at ~ EC<sub>50</sub> (Figure 8D). We also compared the sum of the decay rates for the responsive and the unresponsive states in mice and in zebrafish. This sum of decay rates is a proxy for the depths of the energy wells. We failed to detect any significant differences between fish and mice. This further confirms the intuition that the amount noise, relative to the height of the energy barrier, is conserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another interesting observation that is discussed relatively extensively is the relationship between individual responsiveness, which seems to show a relatively shallow concentration-response, compared to the expected steepness based on previous population data. It would be useful to know whether the aggregated data do indeed show the expected (as quoted) Hill coefficient of 10-40. If this is the case, can the authors explain how dispersed shallow concentration responses add up to steep population response relationships? If it is not the case, this information is worth noting and it will further inform the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Like you, we were also intrigued by the stark difference between our estimates of inter subject variability and the steep population dose-response curve that has been noted in previous studies. To answer your question, we performed additional experiments on a cohort of 20 mice that were subjected (in the same way as in the rest of the manuscript) to 0.4 and 0.7% isoflurane. Combining the data from 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.9% isoflurane concentrations and modeling the results using the standard Hill equation yields a slope of ~2. This is consistent with our observations of inter-subject variability but is clearly lower than the previously published data. It is presently unclear how this difference arises and how to reconcile the previously published results with the ones presented herein. One of the fundamental differences is that we test the righting reflex repeatedly. Repeated testing yields fluctuating results which contribute to the variability of the response. Because in previous studies the response was typically tested only once per anesthetic concentration, the variability appears much smaller. Also, as we now discuss in the manuscript, the fluctuations in responsiveness introduce time-dependence. This time dependence reflects the rate at which a stochastic process approaches its equilibrium distribution. Long exposures used in our study yield a behavioral equilibrium (for a population of mice). Short exposures used previously may not. This is consistent with our finding that the EC<sub>50</sub> for RR is considerably less in our work than in previously published studies. We now discuss this in the manuscript directly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
