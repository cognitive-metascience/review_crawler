metastasis are poorly understood. Wnt5a signaling results in acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) mediated depalmitoylation of pro-metastatic cell adhesion molecules CD44 and MCAM, resulting in increased melanoma invasion. The mechanistic details that underlie Wnt5a-mediated regulation of APT1 activity and cellular function remain unknown. Here, we show Wnt5a signaling regulates APT1 activity through induction of APT1 phosphorylation and we further investigate the functional role of APT1 phosphorylation on its depalmitoylating activity. We found phosphorylation increased APT1 depalmitoylating activity and reduced APT1 dimerization. We further determined APT1 phosphorylation increases melanoma invasion in vitro, and also correlated with increased tumor grade and metastasis. Our results further establish APT1 as an important regulator of melanoma invasion and metastatic behavior. Inhibition of APT1 may represent a novel way to treat Wnt5a driven cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell lines</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>Wnt5a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI118891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Benjamin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA181633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witze</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-15-027-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witze</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRG –78-002-34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witze</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of serine residues 209 and 210 on APT1 increases its depalmitoylating activity, promoting Wnt5a mediated melanoma cell invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt5a signaling pathway plays a critical role in multiple biological processes as it regulates cell polarity and polarized cell movement during embryonic development. Wnt5a expression is strongly correlated with melanoma progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 2003</xref>). Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, with a 5 year survival rate of only 17% for metastatic melanoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sandru et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, the elevated expression of Wnt5a in human melanoma samples and subsequent in vitro studies have suggested a role for Wnt5a in melanoma metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Da Forno et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, Wnt5a expression is positively correlated with poor outcome, with high Wnt5a expression being associated with decreased patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Da Forno et al., 2008</xref>). With this information, it has been suggested that Wnt5a expression be used as a prognostic clinical risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Da Forno et al., 2008</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms by which Wnt5a promotes metastatic behavior remains unknown. Thus, elucidation of the signaling events downstream of Wnt5a that promote polarized cell movement and metastatic behavior have the potential to enhance our understanding of the contribution of Wnt5a to melanoma metastasis.</p><p>Our lab and others have shown Wnt5a signaling promotes migration and invasion in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dissanayake et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Weeraratna et al., 2002</xref>). Wnt5a is a secreted ligand in the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway and upon interacting with its Frizzled receptor, activates a signal transduction cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). Wnt5a signaling controls cell polarity and directional cell movement, and Wnt5a treatment promotes recruitment and reorganization of proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Wnt5a stimulation promotes asymmetrical localization of cell adhesion molecules, increases cell motility, and elevates levels of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in a polarized manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Witze et al., 2013</xref>). The tyrosine kinase receptor ROR2, which is predominantly expressed in metastatic melanoma, has been shown to specifically interact with Wnt5a and mediate Wnt5a signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Connell et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and polarized localization of cell adhesion molecules, others have shown that elevated Wnt5a expression promotes melanoma invasion and human biopsies directly correlated Wnt5a expression with tumor grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Weeraratna et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Pro-metastatic cell adhesion molecules, such as transmembrane receptors CD44 and MCAM (Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule), have been shown to play a role in cell migration and metastasis. CD44 levels are elevated in multiple cancer types and MCAM is expressed in melanoma cells and not untransformed melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wielenga et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shih et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shih et al., 1994b</xref>). Palmitoylation of these cell adhesion molecules strongly influences protein function. CD44 has been shown to be palmitoylated and inhibiting CD44 palmitoylation through cysteine point mutations strongly enhanced breast cancer migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babina et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, cysteine point mutations that block MCAM palmitoylation increases metastatic cell behavior in melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>S-Palmitoylation is the reversible addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid to cysteine residues via a thioester linkage. Palmitate addition is mediated by palmitoyltransferases and acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) remove palmitate from proteins to regulate protein localization, trafficking, and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vartak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin and Conibear, 2015</xref>). Acyl protein thioesterases 1 and 2 (APT1 and APT2; aka LYPLA1 and LYPLA2) are cytosolic depalmitoylases that have been proposed to act constitutively to depalmitoylate proteins from membranes. However, there is evidence that protein depalmitoylation is a signal regulated modification. Wnt5a stimulation has been shown to induce the depalmitoylation of both MCAM and CD44 through APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Wnt5a mediated melanoma cell invasion is reduced by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of APT proteins. Another group has also shown that growth factor stimulation is also sufficient to inhibit depalmitoylating activity of APT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kathayat et al., 2017</xref>). Wang, et al. demonstrated that increased APT1 expression increased melanoma invasion in the absence of exogenous Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be determined how Wnt5a signaling increases depalmitoylation through APT1. These results led us to investigate the link between Wnt5a signaling and regulation of APT1-mediated depalmitoylation. We hypothesized APT1 depalmitoylating activity could be regulated by upstream signaling events, specifically the Wnt5a signaling pathway.</p><p>Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway increases the depalmitoylating activity of APT1. We have mapped a regulatory phosphorylation site on APT1 and utilizing site specific point mutations, we unravel the impact of phosphorylation on APT1 activity and its importance in melanoma cell invasion. Using a depalmitoylation probe (DPP) that measures depalmitoylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kathayat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qiu et al., 2018;</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck et al., 2017</xref>), we show APT1 phosphorylation increases its depalmitoylating activity. This is the first study showing a signaling pathway can direct protein depalmitoylation through a phospho-switch on APT1 that we propose functions to disrupt an inactive APT1 dimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnt5a signaling induces APT1 phosphorylation</title><p>Wnt5a induced metastatic cell behavior was previously shown to be dependent on increased protein depalmitoylation driven by APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesized a mechanism for increased depalmitoylation could be a result of regulatory post-translational modifications of APT1 that increases APT1 activity. To investigate if APT1 is post-translationally modified in response to Wnt5a stimulation, we used mass spectrometry to identify Wnt5a dependent post-translational modifications (PTMs) of APT1. Low Wnt5a producing WM239A melanoma cells expressing CFP-FLAG tagged wild type APT1 (APT1<sup>WT</sup>-CFP-FLAG) were treated with purified Wnt5a and APT1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG magnetic particles. APT1 was eluted with FLAG peptide. The immunopurified APT1 was alkylated and trypsinized and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The only phosphorylation sites identified on APT1 were on serine residues 209 and 210. Whereas single phosphorylation of either serine 209 or 210 was detected, we can’t rule out the possibility of dual phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These findings are consistent with a previous high throughput mass spectrometry screen by another group that identified APT1 phosphorylation on serine residues 209 and 210 in laryngeal cancer cells (Phosphosite.org, site group ID: 25299324 and 25299327).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34362.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wnt5a signaling induces APT1 phosphorylation on serines 209 and 210.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Annotated MS/MS spectrum of identified S209 phosphopeptide of protein APT1.

To validate the antibodies, WM239A cells ectopically expressing APT1<sup>WT</sup>-CFP-FLAG were treated with purified Wnt5a for 15 min. APT1<sup>WT</sup>-CFP-FLAG was then immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. With phospho-APT1 antibodies to both serine 209 and serine 210, we detected phosphorylated APT1 (pS209-APT1/pS210-APT1) that increased following Wnt5a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The induction of APT1 phosphorylation at Ser210 was detected in whole cell lysate without immunoprecipitation, showing a relatively high stoichiometry of phosphorylated APT1 to total APT1 after Wnt5a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also observe a similar, but weaker, increase in exogenous phospho-APT1 in whole cell lysate utilizing the pS209-APT1 antibody in response to Wnt5a (data not shown). However, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of the endogenous APT1 in the whole cell lysate from these cells (data not shown). To determine the temporal kinetics of Wnt5a induced APT1 phosphorylation, WM239A cells ectopically expressing APT1<sup>WT</sup>-CFP-FLAG were treated with purified Wnt5a for increasing lengths of time, APT1<sup>WT</sup>-CFP-FLAG was then immunoprecipitated and APT1 phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting. APT1 phosphorylation peaked at 30 min and began to decrease at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine the function of the Wnt5a induced phosphorylation, a phospho-deficient APT1 double mutant was generated by mutating both serine residues 209 and 210 to alanine (from here on referred to as APT1<sup>SA</sup>). When WM239A cells ectopically expressing APT1<sup>SA</sup> are treated with Wnt5a, the levels of phosphorylation of APT1 at Ser209 measured by immunoblotting were unchanged compared to cells expressing APT1<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of APT1 has been previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devedjiev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Won et al., 2016</xref>) allowing us to model where the phosphorylated serine residues are positioned on the three-dimensional structure (PDB:5sym). We found that the phosphorylated serine residues 209 and 210 are solvent exposed on the lip of the hydrophobic putative acyl-binding channel and adjacent to the catalytic triad (Ser119, His208, Asp174), suggesting phosphorylation of these sites could influence APT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these results indicate Wnt5a signaling in melanoma cells induces APT1 phosphorylation at serine residues 209 and 210 and our phospho-specific antibodies are selective for these sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>APT1 phosphorylation increases depalmitoylating activity</title><p>To investigate how Wnt5a induced phosphorylation of APT1 affects its function, phosphorylated serine 209 was mutated to a negatively charged aspartic acid (APT1<sup>S209D</sup>) to mimic the negative charge of phosphate on serine 209. To measure APT1 activity, we utilized a recently developed fluorescent depalmitoylation probe, DPP-3, that contains a thiol conjugated seven carbon fatty acid that when hydrolyzed, generates a fluorescent product that can be measured at λ<sub>ex</sub>490/9 nm; λ<sub>em</sub>545/20 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kathayat et al., 2017</xref>).

We quantified fluorescence emission in individual cells and determined that Wnt5a stimulation significantly increased the fluorescence emission compared to control buffer treated cells, indicating an increase in endogenous APT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To confirm the increase in fluorescence emission in response to Wnt5a was through APT1, we immunoprecipitated APT1 from WM239A APT1<sup>WT</sup> cells stimulated with purified Wnt5a or untreated control cells, and measured depalmitoylating activity in vitro using DPP-3. APT1 isolated from Wnt5a stimulated cells showed an increase in depalmitoylating activity compared to untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a is sufficient to increase APT1 activity we found stimulation with the canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt3a, was unable to increase APT1 activity compared to Wnt5a and was similar to cells treated with control buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We confirmed these cells are competent to respond to the Wnt3a concentration used because we observe stabilization of β-catenin beginning at 75 ng/ml of Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, the ability to increase APT1 activity appears to be specific to the non-canonical Wnt pathway.</p><p>To directly assess how the phosphorylation state of APT1 affects depalmitoylation in live cells, WM239A melanoma cells expressing APT1<sup>WT</sup> or the phospho-mutants APT1<sup>SA</sup> and APT1<sup>S209D</sup> were incubated with the DPP-3 probe for 30 min and fluorescence emission was measured by live-cell microscopy. Consistent with the in vitro results, APT1<sup>S209D</sup> has greater depalmitoylating activity in cells compared to either APT1<sup>WT</sup> or APT1<sup>SA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Wnt5a treatment increases APT1<sup>WT</sup> activity to levels higher than the phosphomimetic mutant APT1<sup>S209D</sup>.

Treatment with either protein kinase inhibitors inhibited the Wnt5a mediated increase in APT1 activity to levels comparable to unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

The extent of protein palmitoylation is the result of an equilibrium between palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of substrates. To determine the immediate effect of expressing the phospho-mutant forms of APT1 on protein palmitoylation before the cell adapts and reaches a new steady state, we generated an inducible expression system to measure the effects of acute expression of APT1<sup>WT</sup> and the APT1 phosphorylation mutants on a specific depalmitoylation substrate.

Our interrogation of the crystal structure revealed that the phosphorylation sites 209 and 210 reside in the interface of the dimer and could potentially destabilize the dimeric form and decrease the inhibitory dimeric interaction. We measured the distance between the serine residues to the methionine (Met 65) residue on the opposite dimer and found a short distance of less than 4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that phosphorylation of one of these sites would be less favorable for dimer formation. Studies confirming the dimeric state of APT1 in solution are lacking. We therefore sought to distinguish the APT1 monomer from the dimer by size-exclusion chromatography.

Here, we uncover a molecular switch that promotes protein depalmitoylation in response to non-canonical Wnt signaling. We demonstrate Wnt5a signaling induces APT1 phosphorylation and this activates APT1, increasing its depalmitoylating activity and thus depalmitoylation of its substrates. While phosphorylation of these serine residues has been observed in mass spectrometry studies, this is the first example of differential phosphorylation of APT1 in response to an extracellular signal. Ultimately, activation of APT1 signaling results in increased depalmitoylating activity, leading to increased melanoma invasion, and correlating with increased tumor grade and metastasis.</p><p>Understanding APT1 protein function has been hindered by a deficiency in assays for measuring thioesterase activity either in vitro or in cells. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed small molecule fluorophore, DPP-3, which allowed us to measure the activity of APT1 both in vitro and in cultured cells. This assay revealed the phospho-mimetic mutant APT1 has greater thioesterase activity compared to wild type APT1. The increase in activity was also observed by live cell imaging and the phospho-dead mutant had similar activity to wild type APT1. Using live imaging, we were able to demonstrate that the ability to increase endogenous APT1 activity is specific to Wnt5a and the noncanonical Wnt pathway, as we found Wnt3a lacks this ability.</p><p>The first crystal structure of APT1 revealed a dimer with the active site buried in the dimer interface (Devedjiev et al., 2000), suggesting the dimer must dissociate prior to interaction with its substrate. The phosphorylation sites are located on the edge of the hydrophobic channel distant from the site of catalysis, but at the dimer interface. Our proposed model is phosphorylation impedes formation of an inactive dimer. Few studies have examined if APT1 forms a dimer in solution. Using size-exclusion chromatography we detected a complete shift of the APT1<sup>WT</sup> monomer population to the dimer. The shift was dependent on the concentration of APT1 since at the APT1<sup>WT</sup> dimer concentration APT1<sup>S209D</sup> remains a monomer. Furthermore, using three-dimensional modeling, we were able to determine the distance between the serines that are phosphorylated and the neighboring APT1 in the dimer interface to be 4.3 Å. With such a short distance between the serine and the adjacent APT1, it is consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of this serine would impede the dimerization of APT1. However, it is still unclear if this reduction in dimer formation is sufficient to account for the increase in APT1 activity. We still don’t know if the higher activity of APT1<sup>S209D</sup> compared to APT1<sup>WT</sup> is caused by reduced dimer formation or a conformational change in the protein that increases activity. Alternatively, phosphorylation could alter the conformation of APT1 allowing it to accommodate the lipid substrate or increase the rate of catalysis independent of dimer formation.</p><p>When analyzing the results of the in vitro fluorogenic palmitoylation assay using the DPP-3 probe and the acyl biotin exchange assay measuring palmitoylation of MCAM as a protein substrate, there is a small discrepancy between the two assays for phospho-deficient mutant APT1<sup>SA</sup>. In the acyl biotin exchange assay, we observe APT1<sup>SA</sup> displaying decreased activity compared to APT1<sup>WT</sup> cells. Whereas in our in vitro depalmitoylation assay with the DPP-3 probe, we do not observe a significant difference between the APT1<sup>SA</sup> mutant and APT1<sup>WT</sup>. It is important to note that in whole cells there are other factors that play a role in this signaling pathway and this might contribute to the difference in the acyl biotin exchange assay, where we are measuring depalmitoylation of a protein APT1 substrate in this signaling pathway. It is possible that modifications of the substrate MCAM affect how its accessed or preference for depalmitoylation. Adaptor proteins may hinder or ease the depalmitoylation of the protein. Due to decreased melanoma invasion in collagen observed in APT1<sup>SA</sup> expressing cells, we hypothesize that the decreased depalmitoylation of MCAM may play a role in the APT1 mediated invasion. Thus, this is a more physiologically relevant measure of the depalmitoylation activity than solely using the artificial probe in vitro. Concerning the DPP-3 probe, it is still a reliable tool to assess APT1 depalmitoylation, when taken together with other data, which we have been able to do in this study.</p><p>The APT1 gene, LYPLA1, is amplified across a wide variety of tumor types, including 31.8%, 23.2% and 13.8%, in neuroendocrine prostate cancer, uterine carcinosarcoma and invasive breast carcinoma, respectively. Other cancers with amplified LYPLA1 include metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and uveal melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beltran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eirew et al., 2015</xref>). Serine 210 is mutated not only in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krauthammer et al., 2012</xref>), but also in multiple tumor types including colorectal adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giannakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>). This bulky residue behaves similarly to the phosphorylated APT1 in vitro, suggesting this disease relevant mutation might result in increased depalmitoylation and thus increased invasion in patients. Using three-dimensional modeling, we find the leucine to be positioned 5.5 Å next the dimer interface and based on modeling, this mutation will not accommodate dimeric conformation. Due to this finding, this signaling pathway becomes increasingly important, not only in Wnt5a driven cancers mentioned above, but also for patients who present with APT1 mutations in other tumor types. There is a possibility APT1 mutation in this phospho-site could be regulating cancer metastasis across other tumor types. Not surprisingly, the S210L mutation in APT1 is observed at a much lower frequency compared to well-established oncogenes frequently mutated in melanoma, such as BRAF or NRAS. We therefore think it is unlikely APT1 mutations contribute significantly to oncogenesis and tumor initiation. We did map the positions in the three-dimensional structure of the other mutations in APT1 catalogued in the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The only mutation that is positioned within the dimer interface is S210L, making it unlikely that the other low frequency mutations would increase APT1 activity through reduced dimerization. Therefore, APT1<sup>S210L</sup> may provide some selective advantage to tumor growth in vivo since it occurs at a higher frequency than the other mutations in APT1.</p><p>The data we present offers insights to the Wnt5a signaling pathway and its contribution to tumor progression and metastasis. Patients who present with elevated Wnt5a expression are in dire need of effective therapy and directly targeting the Wnt5a pathway is one possible avenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Prasad et al., 2015</xref>). By identifying increased APT1 activity through either gene amplification or mutation of serine 210 as a driver of this pathway, we could expand the number of patients who can benefit from inhibition of the Wnt5a-APT1 pathway. This suggests APT1 signaling may play a larger role as a possible target for treating metastatic melanoma patients, especially those with APT1 amplification/mutations or disease recurrence after other treatments.</p><p>Here we show regulation of protein depalmitoylation by activation of the Wnt5a signaling pathway. This novel discovery allows us to better understand how secreted signals regulate protein function and polarized cell behavior. Wnt5a signaling directly regulates APT1 depalmitoylating activity and protein function, with activation or mutations in this pathway contributing to metastatic behavior. Novel therapeutics for Wnt5a driven cancers are lacking in the clinic. Understanding the signaling mechanism behind Wnt5a driven tumor progression and metastasis is imperative if we aim to create novel therapies against this pathway and to achieve our goal of increasing cancer patient survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The coding sequence of APT1 was amplified from pcDNA3.1-APT1-FLAG and inserted into the AgeI/SalI sites of the pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE backbone.

The protein pellet from CHCl3-MeOH precipitation was resuspended in 6 M urea/2 M thiourea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 supplemented with Phosphatase and Protease Inhibitors Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 hr at room temperature and the carbamidomethylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After alkylation proteins were digested first with endopeptidase Lys-C (Wako, Cambridge, MA; MS grade) for 3 hr, after which the solution was diluted 10 times with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3. Subsequently, samples were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of approximately 1:50 for 12 hr at room temperature. After digestion, the samples were concentrated to the volume of ∼100 μl by lyophilization.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to crystallize our thoughts on the work that would be necessary to move forward with the publication of your paper. At this point we ask that you consider the essential revisions below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a novel pathway in which Wnt5a regulates cell adhesion and invasion of metastatic cells by triggering phosphorylation of the acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), which enhances its activity; prior work showed that Wnt5a mediated invasion is reduced by inhibitors of APT proteins. Adhesion molecules including CD44 and MCAM are palmitoylated, and removing this modification increases migration and invasion. The authors demonstrate using mass spectrometry Wnt5a-induced phosphorylation of APT1 at two residues, one of which is mutated in melanoma. Using a phosphomimetic S209D mutant, they show that this modification enhances depalmitoylation activity, and when expressed in melanoma cells enhances invasiveness. Disrupting APT1 phosphorylation in response to Wnt5a (by site-directed mutagenesis of APT1) compromises the migratory capacity of cells overexpressing APT1. They conclude that phosphorylation-stimulated decreases in palmitoylation are accompanied by cell morphology changes consistent with models of metastasis. The study also introduces new antibodies for detecting phosphorylated APT1 that will likely be useful for futures studies focused this gene family and more generally the role of protein palmitoylation in the regulation of cancer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript reports a potentially novel pathway for Wnt5a control of cell adhesion and invasion. However, there are a number of experiments needed to strengthen the conclusions of the paper. Also, there were particular concerns about the proposed mechanism in which phosphorylation of the S209-S210 region controls enzyme activity by disrupting inhibitory dimerization.</p><p>1) The study heavily relies on a single purified Wnt protein. There is no attempt to demonstrate specificity of this response using either a Wnt5a that has no activity (mutation of the lipidation site or use of an inhibitor of Wnt acylation, for example), or other purified Wnt proteins. Given that other types of stimulation (such as growth factors) can also influence APT1 activity, the potential contribution of protein contaminants (or even the buffer/detergents used to maintain Wnt5a solubility) to APT1 phosphorylation/response should be examined. A control buffer should be applied in parallel studies using recombinant Wnt5a if this hasn't already been done (not mentioned in Materials and methods section).</p><p>2) The role of cell autonomous Wnt signaling in regulating APT1-dependent tumor cell outgrowth (Figure 3C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1) should be evaluated pharmacologically or with a genetic approach to increase confidence in the relevance of this overexpression approach for reporting physiological cancer cell behavior.</p><p>3) Have the authors tested whether protein kinase inhibitors will prevent the Wnt5a-stimulated effects of APT1 activity? Likewise, have the authors assessed the capacity of phosphatase inhibitors in any of the assays? Similarly, the in vitro palmitoylation assays can be easily be validated for their capacity to response to phosphorylation by testing whether pretreatment with purified or enriched enzyme with a phosphatase (e.g. lambda phosphatase). Data in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that wt APT1 may display basal levels of phosphorylation. Phosphatase pretreatment should make the differences between the treated and untreated samples larger, including the mutants.</p><p>4) In Figure 2 the authors report the depalmitoylating capacity of APT1 using an interesting in vitro assay. Some attempt to express the data quantitatively should be made. Some kinetic constants such as initial rates and maximal velocities of depalmitoylation should be calculated and presented so that statistical comparisons may be drawn. This is quite important when considering the activity of Wnt5A-treated esterase activity.</p><p>5) Similarly, the small but apparently significant increase in esterase activity of ATP1 following Wnt5A treatment should also be directly compared with two SA and SD mutants. The increase in activity in response to Wnt5A may be due to other signaling pathways and not necessarily through the same mechanism proposed by the authors.</p><p>6) Several concerns regarding the experiments purporting to show that phosphorylation of these serines enhance activity by disrupting an inactive dimer. The dimer was seen in crystal structures and appears to occlude the active site.</p><p>a) The authors claim that the recombinant material used in their studies is a dimer by gel filtration, but no data are shown. Looking at the structure, the serines in the dimer interface would not be accessible to a kinase, so there must at least be a monomer-dimer equilibrium. They need to show the gel filtration data of WT and mutant APT1.</p><p>b) DSC crosslinking is used to suggest that there is a dimer, but the level of crosslinking is weak (Figure 4D). Moreover, DSC is a short, lysine specific crosslinker; inspection of the dimer structure suggests that no lysines are close enough for DSC crosslinking. Thus, it is not clear what they are seeing in this experiment.</p><p>c) Given the proximity of the serines to the active site, it seems equally plausible that their mutants or phosphorylation preclude or at least hinder access to the active site, or perhaps alter the structure to reduce catalysis. Could this also explain S210L?</p><p>d) Given the mutational data shown in Figure 5A, where do these mutations map? Are they consistent with the dimer hypothesis? What might they be doing?</p><p>7) The data presented in Figure 5B and described in the Results section are a little misleading. The data in Figure 5B for the wt and SD mutants appear to be the identical data presented in Figure 2A (exactly the same error bars). The experiment should be repeated under the identical conditions. Perhaps the assays on the SL mutant were conducted at the same time as the other mutants. If this is the case then the manuscript should reflect this or the figure should be modified to express this (e.g. presenting the wt and SD data as a 'dissolved' or slightly 'transparent' form).</p><p>8) Ser210 may be the most frequently mutated residue in APT1 but at 5 mutations out of xxx tumors, its potential significance should be discussed in the context of mutation frequencies found in well-established drivers of melanoma such as BRAF or NRAS for example.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Wnt5a Signaling Induced Phosphorylation Increases APT1 Activity and Promotes Melanoma Metastatic Behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have strengthened the paper considerably with new experiments that support the model for the effect of Wnt5a on adhesion and invasiveness of tumor cells. These include comparison of the activity of Wnt3a with that of Wnt5a to bolster the argument that the effect is Wnt5a/non-canonical pathway specific; use of two general kinase inhibitors to further probe the key role of phosphorylation; demonstrating that inhibition of APT1 blocks the effect of the mutants; quantifying the effect of the S209D on enzyme activity; and presentation of data showing dimerization of the purified wt, but not mutant, protein.</p><p>1) In the subsection “APT1 Phosphorylation Increases Depalmitoylating Activity”, it might be useful to explicitly note that the identity of the kinase is unknown.</p><p>2) The dimerization mechanism model requires further clarification and discussion:</p><p>- The authors should be absolutely clear as to the basis of the statement &quot;…phosphorylation of APT1 does not completely block dimerization…&quot; Is it the very small rise at the highest concentration at 0.375 mg/ml SEC trace? The presence of &quot;dimer&quot; in the S209D gel in Figure 4D looks like an artifact of boiling in reducing sample buffer, which can cause some disulfide formation; in fact, C173 is surface exposed. Or is this inferred by the fact that the mutant retains some activity? If the latter, this is an interpretation based on the model and is something of a circular argument.</p><p>- The model for dimerization assumes the dimer interface seen in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which as noted in the original review is not compatible with the DSC crosslinking. The explanation provided by the authors is problematic, as it would imply transient formation of different dimers. There is another dimer in crystal lattice that could account for observed crosslinking, e.g. between K219 and K90. Perhaps this dimer could limit access of substrate, and electrostatic repulsion between D101 might explain S209D; or, there are allosteric effects of S209 and S210 on formation of this &quot;alternative&quot; dimer interface (this also touches on the analysis of the other mutations shown in Figure 5). In any case, either explicit discussion of the DSC result is needed or these crosslinking data should be removed. Without a definitive experimental analysis of the true dimer interface, the connection between activity and dimer formation remains correlative, and the effect of the mutants at S209 and S210 may well be due to other effects as they now note.</p><p>- The traces in Figure 4E should be labeled with the apparent MW of the standard peaks. Also, the fraction numbers are unreadable; perhaps colored bars indicating which fractions have been run on the gel would be better.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34362.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript reports a potentially novel pathway for Wnt5a control of cell adhesion and invasion.

Instead, to determine if the increase in APT1 activity is specific to non-canonical Wnt5a we repeated the live cell depalmitoylation assay using purified Wnt3a, a conical Wnt ligand. We first confirmed the cells in our assay could respond to purified Wnt3a and found that treating APT1<sup>WT</sup> expressing WM239A cells with 75 and 150ng/ml of Wnt3a for 1 hour was sufficient to stabilize β-catenin, an established measure of canonical Wnt signaling activation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We then measured APT1 activity in live WM239A APT1<sup>WT</sup> cells treated with either control buffer, 150 ng/ml Wnt5a, or 150 ng/ml Wnt3a and found Wnt3a is unable to increase APT1 activity above levels observed with control buffer after 45 minutes (Figure 2E).

When the melanoma spheroid invasion assay is carried out in the presence of ML348 invasion caused by expressing the APT1<sup>S209D</sup> or APT1<sup>S210L</sup> mutant is blocked (Figure 3E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).

WM239A cells expressing APT1<sup>WT</sup> were treated with either DSMO control, 10 µM BI-D1870, or 0.2 µM staurosporine for 1 hour, loaded with 10 µM DPP-3, treated with Wnt5a and analyzed by live-cell fluorescence microscopy after 15, 30, and 45 minutes. Both kinase inhibitors block Wnt5a induced increased APT1 activity, suggesting the APT1 phosphorylation is the mechanism for increasing activity. We intentionally used high concentrations of inhibitors since the objective was to nonspecifically inhibit kinases since we have yet to identify the relevant kinase. We chose to include the 30 minute time point for Wnt5a treatment in the paper (Figure 2G), even though it worked at all time points.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34362.013</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34362-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>We agree the phosphatase experiment is an excellent idea. However, when we attempted to inhibit the Wnt5a induced APT1 activity with lambda phosphatase treatment, it was extremely challenging to retain the activity of APT1 pulled down from cells. The procedure required an anti-FLAG pull-down followed by extensive washes then the lambda phosphatase reaction, and additional washes prior to the enzymatic assay. After all of the steps we had very low APT1 activity across all samples. We suspect this is due to the extra incubations in the lambda phosphatase buffers and extra washes that lengthened the duration of the experiments. We hope that showing the increase in APT1 activity induced by Wnt5a is inhibited with two kinase inhibitors in live cells is adequate to strengthen the conclusion that the phosphorylation of APT1 in response to Wnt5a signaling is the mechanism of increased APT1 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2 the authors report the depalmitoylating capacity of APT1 using an interesting in vitro assay. Some attempt to express the data quantitatively should be made. Some kinetic constants such as initial rates and maximal velocities of depalmitoylation should be calculated and presented so that statistical comparisons may be drawn. This is quite important when considering the activity of Wnt5A-treated esterase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the initial velocity rates for APT1<sup>WT</sup> and APT1<sup>S209D</sup> using the DPP-3 probe, we incubated purified APT1<sup>WT</sup> and APT1<sup>S209D</sup> with increasing concentrations of DPP-3 substrate. Initial velocities were calculated by fitting the linear regression of the fluorescence vs. time for APT1<sup>WT</sup> or APT1<sup>SD</sup> at each DPP-3 substrate concentration (Figure 2B, C). We measured the initial velocity of APT1<sup>S209D</sup> to be between 2 to 4-fold higher than APT1WT. We have included Table 1 which presents the initial velocities and the standard error of the mean for each substrate concentration tested. We did not determine the maximal velocity for APT1<sup>S209D</sup> because we were unable to reach saturation with our highest concentration of substrate. At concentrations higher than 5 µM we believe we had problems with solubility of the substrate. Nevertheless, the increased enzyme kinetics of phospho- mimetic APT1<sup>S209D</sup> is quantitatively higher than APT1<sup>WT</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similarly, the small but apparently significant increase in esterase activity of ATP1 following Wnt5A treatment should also be directly compared with two SA and SD mutants. The increase in activity in response to Wnt5A may be due to other signaling pathways and not necessarily through the same mechanism proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the DPP-3 assay using live-cell imaging on APT1<sup>WT</sup>, APT1<sup>SA</sup>, and APT1<sup>SD</sup> mutants and the results are represented in Figure 2F. As expected, Wnt5a treatment increases depalmitoylating activity of APT1WT to levels similar to the APT1<sup>S209D</sup> mutant. Wnt5a has no significant effect on APT1<sup>SA</sup> or APT1<sup>S209D</sup>. The inability of Wnt5a to further increase the activity of APT1<sup>S209D</sup> is important because this would suggest the Wnt5a mediated increase is entirely driven by APT1 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Several concerns regarding the experiments purporting to show that phosphorylation of these serines enhance activity by disrupting an inactive dimer. The dimer was seen in crystal structures and appears to occlude the active site.</p><p>a) The authors claim that the recombinant material used in their studies is a dimer by gel filtration, but no data are shown. Looking at the structure, the serines in the dimer interface would not be accessible to a kinase, so there must at least be a monomer-dimer equilibrium. They need to show the gel filtration data of WT and mutant APT1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the results of the gel filtration experiment after repeating the experiment using three different concentrations of APT1 (25 kD) protein in Figure 4E. When APT1 was loaded on the column at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml both APT1<sup>WT</sup> and APT1<sup>S209D</sup> eluted at the same time as a 29kD standard. When the protein concentration is increased to 0.25 mg/ml a second peak of APT1<sup>WT</sup> begins to resolve closer to the 44kD standard (Figure 4E). When the APT1<sup>WT</sup> protein concentration was increased to 0.375 mg/ml a second peak was resolved near the 44kD standard that was not observed with APT1<sup>S209D</sup>. The peak at 29kD for APT1<sup>WT</sup> is abolished at this concentration (Figure 4E). These results support the findings in the crosslinking experiments, indicating APT1 dimerizes and phosphorylation of APT1 does not completely block dimerization, but impedes dimer formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) DSC crosslinking is used to suggest that there is a dimer, but the level of crosslinking is weak (Figure 4D). Moreover, DSC is a short, lysine specific crosslinker; inspection of the dimer structure suggests that no lysines are close enough for DSC crosslinking. Thus, it is not clear what they are seeing in this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible the APT1 dimer is detected by chemical crosslinking without lysines within close proximity to each other in the active site because the interaction between monomers is more dynamic than what is represented in the crystal structure. The transient interactions that form when the protein monomers interact may bring lysine residues outside of the dimer interface within crosslinking distance and this intermediate and not the stable dimer is what is captured in this assay. We feel the SEC data support this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Given the proximity of the serines to the active site, it seems equally plausible that their mutants or phosphorylation preclude or at least hinder access to the active site, or perhaps alter the structure to reduce catalysis. Could this also explain S210L?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that increased access to or altered structure of the active site caused by phosphorylation are alternative mechanisms to regulate catalysis. We now discuss these possibilities in the Discussion section.</p><p>“However, it is still unclear if this reduction in dimer formation is sufficient to account for the increase in APT1 activity. Alternatively, phosphorylation could alter the conformation of APT1 allowing it to accommodate the lipid substrate or increase the rate of catalysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Given the mutational data shown in Figure 5A, where do these mutations map? Are they consistent with the dimer hypothesis? What might they be doing?</p></disp-quote><p>We mapped the positions of all of the mutations identified in the TCGA database (Figure 5A) on the three-dimensional crystal structure to determine if any localize to the dimer interface. The only mutation that maps in the dimer interface is S210L which is the only mutation to occur at a frequency higher than 2. Therefore, we think it is unlikely that the mutations other than S210L would disrupt the dimer. We think it is likely the low frequency mutations are passenger mutations that have minimal effect on APT1 activity or tumor growth or fitness. We now discuss this point in greater length in the Discussion.</p><p>“We did map the positions in the three-dimensional structure of the other mutations in APT1 catalogued in the TCGA database (Figure 5A). The only mutation that is positioned within the dimer interface is S210L, making it unlikely that the other low frequency mutations would increase APT1 activity through reduced dimerization. Therefore, APT1S210L may provide some selective advantage to tumor growth in vivo since it occurs at a higher frequency than the other mutations in APT1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data presented in Figure 5B and described in the Results section are a little misleading. The data in Figure 5B for the wt and SD mutants appear to be the identical data presented in Figure 2A (exactly the same error bars). The experiment should be repeated under the identical conditions. Perhaps the assays on the SL mutant were conducted at the same time as the other mutants. If this is the case then the manuscript should reflect this or the figure should be modified to express this (e.g. presenting the wt and SD data as a 'dissolved' or slightly 'transparent' form).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the figure was misleading, it was not our intent to misrepresent the data. To remove any confusion, we have repeated the experiment under identical conditions comparing purified APT1<sup>WT</sup>, APT1<sup>S209D</sup>, APT1<sup>S210L</sup> and APT1<sup>S119A</sup>. We agree that this will remove any possible misconceptions about how the experiment was performed. Below is the representation of an experiment including all mutants analyzed at the same time shown in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Ser210 may be the most frequently mutated residue in APT1 but at 5 mutations out of xxx tumors, its potential significance should be discussed in the context of mutation frequencies found in well-established drivers of melanoma such as BRAF or NRAS for example.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we agree that it is unlikely this mutation is plays a role in cancer like bona fide oncogenes such as BRAF and NRAS. Because it occurs at a higher frequency than the other APT1 mutations that all reside outside the dimer interface, we think that this mutation is beneficial to the primary tumor in vivothrough a mechanism that is not easily observed in cell culture. We added to the Discussion the idea that this mutation occurs at a low frequency compared to established drivers such as BRAF and NRAS and is therefore not likely an oncogenic driver.</p><p>“Not surprisingly, the S210L mutation in APT1 is observed at a much lower frequency compared to oncogenes frequently mutated in melanoma, such as BRAF or NRAS. We therefore think it is unlikely APT1 mutations contribute significantly to oncogenesis and tumor initiation.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have strengthened the paper considerably with new experiments that support the model for the effect of Wnt5a on adhesion and invasiveness of tumor cells.

Or is this inferred by the fact that the mutant retains some activity? If the latter, this is an interpretation based on the model and is something of a circular argument.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the statement that phosphorylation does not completely block dimerization to explain the crosslinking data and partly because of the small rise of the dimeric peak at the highest concentration. We agree the results are insufficient to say dimerization is not completely blocked by phosphorylation. Since we have chosen to remove the crosslinking data as per your comment below, we will also remove this statement to focus our conclusion on the inhibition of APT1 dimerization by phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The model for dimerization assumes the dimer interface seen in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which as noted in the original review is not compatible with the DSC crosslinking. The explanation provided by the authors is problematic, as it would imply transient formation of different dimers. There is another dimer in crystal lattice that could account for observed crosslinking, e.g. between K219 and K90. Perhaps this dimer could limit access of substrate, and electrostatic repulsion between D101 might explain S209D; or, there are allosteric effects of S209 and S210 on formation of this &quot;alternative&quot; dimer interface (this also touches on the analysis of the other mutations shown in Figure 5). In any case, either explicit discussion of the DSC result is needed or these crosslinking data should be removed. Without a definitive experimental analysis of the true dimer interface, the connection between activity and dimer formation remains correlative, and the effect of the mutants at S209 and S210 may well be due to other effects as they now note.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the crosslinking data could have multiple interpretations. We would like to remove the crosslinking data and instead focus on the SEC data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The traces in Figure 4E should be labeled with the apparent MW of the standard peaks. Also, the fraction numbers are unreadable; perhaps colored bars indicating which fractions have been run on the gel would be better.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 4E (Now Figure 4D) to include legible fraction numbers and we have labelled the figure with the apparent MW of the standard peaks.</p></body></sub-article></article>
