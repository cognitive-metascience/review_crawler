Furthermore, increasing gRNA sequence diversity negatively affects gRNA distribution, leading to libraries of heterogeneous quality. Here, we present a rapid and cloning-free mutagenesis technology that can efficiently generate covalently-closed-circular-synthesized (3Cs) CRISPR/Cas gRNA reagents and that uncouples sequence diversity from sequence distribution. We demonstrate the fidelity and performance of 3Cs reagents by tailored targeting of all human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and identify their essentiality for cell fitness. To explore high-content screening, we aimed to generate the largest up-to-date gRNA library that can be used to interrogate the coding and noncoding human genome and simultaneously to identify genes, predicted promoter flanking regions, transcription factors and CTCF binding sites that are linked to doxorubicin resistance. Our 3Cs technology enables fast and robust generation of bias-free gene perturbation libraries with yet unmatched diversities and should be considered an alternative to established technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas</kwd><kwd>gRNA library</kwd><kwd>3Cs technology</kwd><kwd>genome-wide</kwd><kwd>DUBs</kwd><kwd>Doxorubicin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003495</institution-id><institution>Hessisches Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIIL5-518/17.004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaulich</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC115/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaulich</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003495</institution-id><institution>Hessisches Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIIL5-519/03/03.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaulich</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC147/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaulich</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cloning-free 3Cs technology is developed for the generation of sequence-bias-free covalently closed circular synthesized (3Cs) CRISPR/Cas gRNA libraries that can interrogate the coding and noncoding human genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR/Cas has rapidly become the gold standard for unbiased high-throughput experiments, outperforming preexisting technologies such as RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). A fundamentally important aspect of high-fidelity CRISPR/Cas screening is the quality of the gRNA library that is interrogated, with its diversity and distribution primarily influencing downstream experimental scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanson et al., 2018</xref>). Conventionally used methods to generate gRNA libraries in pooled or arrayed formats include T4 ligase or homology-based cloning techniques, which require the PCR-based amplification of gRNA-encoding oligonucleotides as well as the presence of open plasmid DNA for successful gRNA sequence cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arakawa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koike-Yusa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vidigal and Ventura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Owing to these technical constraints, conventional libraries contain an unwanted PCR and cloning-dependent bias in their gRNA distribution that influences the experimental scale required for statistically significant hit calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). CRISPR libraries have become ubiquitously used in functional genomics efforts, underscoring relevance and utility of new PCR- and cloning-free technologies.</p><p>The rod-shaped filamentous phage M13 differs from other bacteriophages in that its genome-packaging capacity is variable and in that it is present as single-stranded (ss) DNA. Kunkel mutagenesis utilizes M13’s ﻿malleable coat and the ease of ssDNA purification from M13 phage and enables rapid site-specific mutagenesis to construct high-quality phage display libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handa and Varshney, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunkel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunkel, 2001</xref>). Kunkel mutagenesis has significantly contributed to the great success of phage display technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ernst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidhu, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate the applicability of Kunkel mutagenesis in the generation of high-quality and high-fidelity CRISPR/Cas and RNAi gene perturbation reagents. In more detail, we developed a highly reproducible improved Kunkel mutagenesis technology that is designed to generate 3Cs CRISPR/Cas gRNA libraries robustly over a broad range of gRNA diversities. We demonstrate the high fidelity of 3Cs gRNA libraries by targeting all human DUBs and then determining their proliferative depletion phenotype, confirming previously known and discovering hitherto unknown DUB phenotypes. In an effort to enable unbiased screening within coding and noncoding regions, we encoded SpCas9 nucleotide preferences into a degenerated oligonucleotide and generated a highly complex CRISPR/Cas gRNA library (truly genome-wide (TGW)). Doxorubicin-positive selection screens with the TGW library in unperturbed human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) were used to identify coding and noncoding regions, emphasizing the relevance of noncoding sequence elements in drug-resistance mechanisms. To enable high-content functional interrogations on a truly genome-wide scale, we introduce an optimized version of this library (oTGW). In summary, we establish the 3Cs technology as a robust alternative method for the generation of high-quality CRISPR/Cas gene perturbation libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Circular synthesized gRNAs are high-quality CRISPR/Cas reagents</title><p>In classical Kunkel mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunkel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunkel, 2001</xref>), the circular ssDNA isolated from filamentous phage is hybridized with a complementary oligonucleotide that is extended and ligated to obtain a double-stranded DNA plasmid. As Kunkel mutagenesis is performed on ssDNA, we anticipated that it would be insensitive to the secondary DNA structures of viral sequence elements and therefore should enable the PCR and cloning-free generation of lentiviral gene perturbation reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunkel, 1985</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the generation of lentiviral CRISPR/Cas gRNA libraries using circular ssDNA and Kunkel mutagenesis would reduce the coupling of gRNA diversity to gRNA distribution and would generate reagents of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42549.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The 3Cs technology - covalently-closed-circular-synthesized (3Cs) CRISPR/Cas gRNA reagents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The general 3Cs workflow.

Circular dU-ssDNA was hybridized with a gRNA-encoding complementary oligonucleotide that contained sequence homology regions (3Cs homology) at its 5′ and 3′ ends, and then extended and ligated with T7 polymerase and T4 ligase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This resulted in heteroduplexed 3Cs DNA (3Cs-dsDNA), which were composed of dU-template ssDNA and deoxythymidine-containing newly synthesized complementary DNA that also includes the gRNA-encoding oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunkel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunkel, 2001</xref>). To gain insights into the oligonucleotide requirements and kinetics of 3Cs reactions, we tested different 3Cs homology lengths of 10, 13, 15, and 18 nucleotides, performed a 3Cs reaction time series, and demonstrated that 18 nucleotides of homology (above 45°C annealing temperature) and 2 hr of 3Cs reaction time were sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunkel, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Using rule set 2 (RS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doench et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doench et al., 2016</xref>), we designed six GFP-targeting gRNA sequences and extended them by 5′ and 3′ 3Cs homology.

To remove NHT/dU-containing template and to amplify the gRNA-encoding complementary strand, 3Cs products were column-purified and transformed in <italic>dut<sup>+</sup>/ung<sup>+ </sup></italic>bacteria. Bacterial clones were grown and their plasmid DNA Sanger sequenced, revealing that 81% of pLentiGuide and 82% of plentiCRISPRv2 contained GFP-targeting gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To test whether dU supplementation reduces the amount of NHT-containing template plasmid by improving dU-incorporation during ssDNA production, CJ236 culture medium was supplemented with 2.5 µM dU. In addition, the gRNA placeholder sequence of pLentiGuide and plentiCRISPRv2 was changed to contain an I-SceI restriction enzyme recognition site. Although the effect of increased dU concentrations was negligible, I-SceI-mediated removal of wildtype plasmids reduced their level to below our detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

A one-sided Chi-squared test for goodness of fit identified a uniform distribution (p=0.1) of all six gRNA sequences.

Seven days post-transduction, we performed a T7 Endonuclease I assay and observed robust GFP gene editing, both by a single GFP-targeting 3Cs gRNA (3Cs-gRNA) and by the pool of six 3Cs-gRNAs, whereas un-transduced (–) and an NHT control gRNA failed to edit the GFP gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we designed and generated a nonrandom 3Cs-gRNA library targeting all 105 human DUBs, each with three gRNAs (DUB library).

The resulting products were resolved by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Like the I-SceI-mediated depletion of wildtype remnants from CRISPR/Cas 3Cs-gRNA constructs, a Bsu36I restriction enzyme clean-up step removed pLKO.1 wildtype remnants, and SANGER sequencing of the final E2 3Cs-shRNA library (E2.2) confirmed a randomization of forward- and reverse-complement shRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). To determine the E2 3Cs-shRNA distribution more accurately, we performed NGS sequencing with an average shRNA read count of &gt;8,300 and determined a wildtype remnant level of 0.04%, a CV of 37.9% and an AUC of 0.68, demonstrating an almost uniform distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). To correlate 3Cs-shRNA abundance and the distribution of the E2 3Cs-shRNA libraries before and after Bsu36I enzyme digest, we determined the ratios of their respective normalized read counts. Importantly, all ratios were close to one and lined up close to the respective diagonal with a linear regression R<sup>2</sup> of 0.9687 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 5F</xref>), demonstrating a high correlation of individual data points and no influence of the Bsu36I digest on 3Cs-shRNA sequence distribution. In summary, this demonstrates that our 3Cs technology can be adapted to generate high-quality shRNA reagents in single and pooled formats.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A partially randomized 3Cs gRNA library to target the coding and noncoding genome simultaneously</title><p>The 3Cs method does not require the PCR-amplification of gRNA-encoding oligonucleotides, is free of conventional cloning steps and uncouples sequence diversity from sequence distribution. Thus, we hypothesized that 3Cs gRNA library diversity is mostly limited by the number of distinguishable oligonucleotides within a 3Cs reaction and the subsequent bacterial electroporation efficiencies. Limitations in electroporation efficiencies can be overcome by accumulating the individual efficiencies of multiple parallel reactions, as routinely performed to amplify phage libraries with diversities beyond 10<sup>9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith and Scott, 1993</xref>).

As mentioned above, randomized positions in DNA oligonucleotides can contain a strong single nucleotide cytosine bias, we therefore used hand-mixed phosphoramidite pools to generate this oligonucleotide pool. In eight parallel large-scale 3Cs reactions (each involving 20 µg ssDNA and 600 ng oligonucleotide), we applied this oligonucleotide to dU-ssDNA of pLentiGuide and pLentiCRISPRv2 and resolved the 3Cs products by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, we note that the amplification of this degenerated library is limited by the number of transformed bacteria. As complete generation of this reagent is currently unfeasible, we limited our efforts to eight parallel electroporation reactions and achieved a cumulative transformation efficiency of 1.2 × 10<sup>10</sup>, accounting for ~16% of TGW sequences, assuming a stringent uniform sequence distribution.

First, the bacteriophage-mediated generation of ssDNA makes the technology applicable to all plasmids containing a f1-origin of replication. Second, ssDNA-mutagenic oligonucleotides are annealed to the ssDNA of the template DNA, thereby circumventing the need for two oligonucleotides per gRNA and amplification by PCR, reducing associated costs and sequence bias. In line with this, T7 DNA polymerase, which is used in the 3Cs reaction, has an error rate of approximately 15 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, resulting in as little as 0.0015% of mutated heteroduplex 3Cs product assuming 2 µg ssDNA of a 10 kb plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 1993</xref>). Third, the presence of a gRNA placeholder sequence enables the near-complete removal of wildtype plasmid remnants. Last, we demonstrate 3Cs applicability and performance using the example of lentiviral plasmids. However, we foresee the plasmid range to be expanded to recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) plasmids and adenoviruses, as well as coding sequences for protein mutagenesis that enable in-cell and in-vivo functional screenings.</p><p>We demonstrate the fidelity and performance of 3Cs reagents by identifying the proliferative phenotype of human DUBs, validating previously known and uncovering hitherto unknown DUB phenotypes. We show that depletion of the DUBs USP28 and BRCC3 induces positive proliferation phenotypes, suggesting that they have tumor suppressive functions. In line with this, USP28 was recently identified as preventing p53 elevation in response to centrosome loss resulting from Plk4 inhibition, thereby preventing growth arrest in response to prolonged mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, we identify DUB enzymes whose depletion reduces cell fitness dramatically. Among them are COPS6 and USP7, both of which have been implicated in DNA damage response and enhanced p53 stability, leading to a prolonged G<sub>1</sub>-phase cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2004</xref>). In line with this, recent work demonstrates a direct connection between CRISPR/Cas gene editing and a p53-dependent DNA damage response that is associated with G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that DNA damage-associated DUBs (e.g. COPS6 or USP7) can be used as p53 alternatives to control for DNA-damage-induced cell cycle arrest and negative hit calling in CRISPR/Cas functional genomic screens.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas functional genomic screens are widely used to interrogate protein-coding regions, but only few studies have used CRISPR/Cas gene editing to investigate the noncoding genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korkmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanjana et al., 2016</xref>). Although these studies have the potential to open a new area of functional genomics, their general applicability is limited to a predefined set of gRNAs and therefore to a small subset of genomic regions. A unique feature of the 3Cs technology is the uncoupling of gRNA sequence diversity from gRNA sequence distribution, facilitating the generation of partially randomized gRNA libraries. A fully randomized library with oligonucleotides of length 20 (20N) resembles the entire space of possible gRNA sequences and comprises 4<sup>20</sup> = 1.1*10<sup>12</sup> different sequences. Although an oligonucleotide pool covering this huge sequence space could theoretically be synthesized, there are at least two major reasons that render the experimental application unfeasible. The first reason is that the fraction of gRNA sequences that have a target site in the genome of interest would be very low. The ~300 million SpCas9 target sites in the human genome would be covered by a fully randomized library, but would represent only 0.027% of the library. Consequently, the second reason is that the experimental scale would have to be extremely high to cover all naturally occurring target sites, including all non-human targeting gRNAs that also need to be included, with sufficient coverage. Screening the 20N library with a coverage of 100 and a MOI of 0.5 would require 2.2*10<sup>14</sup> cells, a cell number that is clearly not feasible in current experimental setups.</p><p>By focusing on SpCas9 nucleotide preferences, we introduce the partially randomized TGW library, which preferentially targets active gRNA sequences in the entire genome, including both coding and noncoding regions. The size of the TGW library is dramatically smaller than a fully randomized library but still comprises 7.3*10<sup>10</sup> different gRNA sequences. We sought to explore the experimental application of such a large library and chose to screen for resistance to the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin in hTERT–RPE1 cells. Although insufficient TGW coverage led to low biological reproducibility, we were still able to retrieve gRNA overlap of three experiments. We identified protein-coding genes that have previously been associated with doxorubicin resistance such as CysLTR2, whose inhibition by two small chemical compounds reverted the doxorubicin-induced toxicity.</p><p>Interestingly, about half of the gRNAs for which we were able to identify a matching sequence in the human genome map to regions in the noncoding genome. Noncoding mutations have been shown to play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis by disrupting the function of cis-regulatory elements (e.g. promoters, enhancer, or transcription- factor binding sites) and topologically associating domains (TADs), thereby directly affecting the transcriptional regulation of adjacently located genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katainen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weinhold et al., 2014</xref>). We annotated noncoding regions that are associated with hits from our TGW screen by mapping the corresponding gRNA sequences against the human reference genome. By allowing up to two mismatches, we attempted to account not only for exact matches but also for mismatched target sites. This approach yielded a number of potential hits that should be interpreted with caution because cut sites might be called incorrectly and more stringent validation criteria are necessary. Nevertheless, we found a small set of gRNAs that presumably target predicted promoter sequences as well as CTCF and transcription factor binding sites, although further validation is necessary to gain mechanistic insights into how these sequences are linked to doxorubicin resistance.</p><p>Furthermore, our computational approach for coding and noncoding hit-calling is sensitive to incorrect calling of cut sites that can lead to false-positive target regions. We therefore suggest that the actual genome sequence of the cell line of interest is used in order to limit false-positive hit calling. We used the human reference genome (GRCh38.86), which might differ from the hTERT–RPE1 genome, potentially giving misleading conclusions in terms of hit calling. Another strategy to increase the rate of true-positive hits is to increase library coverage in the experiment. However, it is currently not feasible to screen either the 20N or the TGW library with sufficient coverage, at least not in adherent cell lines. To enable coverage-based truly genome-wide screenings, we reduced the TGW library diversity by truncating the library to 17-mers, yielding optimized TGW (oTGW) libraries that are more suited for high-throughput experiments with suspension cells. We propose that the oTGW CRISPR/Cas gRNA libraries are suitable for broad biological screenings with the highest genetic target complexity. Such screens can be followed by targeted validation screens using newly synthesized libraries that are tailored to the initially identified cut sites, which will enable rapid functional validation of such complex genetic experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>RRID identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>hTERT-RPE1</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_4388">CVCL_4388</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>RPE1</td><td>Ian Cheeseman</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GFP (B-2)</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_627695">AB_627695</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-alpha Tubulin</td><td>DSHB</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2315509">AB_2315509</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Mouse IgG <break/>(H + L) Secondary Antibody</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_228307">AB_228307</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Rabbit IgG <break/>(H + L) Secondary Antibody</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_228341">AB_228341</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Bacteria (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>K12 CJ236</td><td>NEB (E4141)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Bacteria (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>10 beta</td><td>NEB (C3020K)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pLentiGuide</td><td>Addgene (52963)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pLentiCRISPRv2</td><td>Addgene (52961)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>PLKO.1</td><td>Addgene (8453)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pPax2</td><td>Addgene (12260)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pMD2.G</td><td>Addgene (12259)</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Commercial kit</td><td>E.Z.N.A.

DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) as single or pooled oligonucleotides, and from Twist Bioscience or CustomArray Inc. as oligonucleotide pools. The 3Cs oligonucleotides were designed with two homology regions flanking the intended 20-nt gRNA sequence. The homology regions were at least 15 nt in length (T<sub>m</sub> above 50°C) and matched the 3′ end of the U6 promoter region and the 5′ start of the gRNA scaffold in the template plasmids. The TGW and the oTGW 3Cs oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of a pattern of nucleotide preferences as previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doench et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). The observed nucleotide preferences were translated into a degenerated 17-nt DNA sequence (oTGW, see 'DNA oligonucleotides'). The randomized oligonucleotides for the six libraries of increasing diversity each had stretches of an increasing number of fully randomized nucleotides (see 'DNA oligonucleotides'). The oligonucleotide with four randomized positions was designed to contain the stretch of four consecutive Ns beginning at position 30 of the oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotides with increasing randomization were designed by extending the randomized pattern in an alternating fashion left and right by one randomized position each. The randomized segments and the flanking constant regions were designed to replace the I-SceI recognition site in the template plasmid to enable the clean-up digestion step.

The digestion reaction was subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 0.5% TAE/agarose gel (100 V, 30 min) to separate the undigested 3Cs synthesis product from linearized template plasmid. The band resembling the undigested correct 3Cs synthesis product was purified using a Thermo Fisher Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In a second step, the purified 3Cs synthesis product was electroporated according to the electroporation protocol described above. The final P2 library preparation was purified from liquid culture using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and quality controlled with analytical restriction enzyme digests. 3Cs-shRNA pools were generated according to the above protocol with the following modifications. Instead of using I-SceI for the clean-up digestion, we used Bsu36I to digest template plasmid remnants in the first DNA pool (P1). P1 was electroporated using the settings described above to yield the final pool (P2). Both 3Cs-shRNA pools were purified from liquid culture using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and were quality controlled with analytical restriction enzyme digests and Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 41965–039) and hTERT–RPE1 cells (ATCC, CRL-4000 and Ian Cheeseman’s) in DMEM: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11320–074), each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10270) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P4333) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

In brief, 3′ sequencing adapters were trimmed using a prefix of the 3′ homology sequence; trimmed reads were further trimmed by keeping only the last 20 nucleotides for all libraries except the oTGW, for which the last 17 nt were kept. Only reads with no ambiguously sequenced nucleotides were considered for further analyses. For the TGW and the oTGW, the resulting sequences were compared to the TGW or oTGW DNA sequence pattern, respectively, using Python and regular expressions. The reads obtained from sequencing the six randomized libraries with diversities ranging from 256 to 262,144 gRNAs were processed similarly by comparing the trimmed reads with the gRNA pattern of the respective library. For the GFP and DUB libraries, the reads were aligned to the respective sequence library. Matching sequences were counted to determine the read count distribution of a sample. The read counts of individual gRNAs for a sample were normalized by the total number of read counts that could be assigned to the respective library. The screening of samples after treatment of the cells was carried out in the same way. To determine the dispersion of the read counts, the coefficient of variation was computed by dividing the standard deviation of the normalized read counts by the mean of the normalized read count <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Each read was then scored by summing the normalized frequencies for all reads individually. The observed read count per gRNA was then multiplied with this score, divided by the sum of all read counts that matched the respective gRNA pattern, and normalized to the sum of all corrected and normalized read counts. Lorenz curves were generated on the basis of the corrected and normalized read counts.</p><p>Read count data from the DUB screen were analyzed by summing all individual gRNA read counts per gene and normalizing each gene read count per sample to the total number of read counts within that sample. Spearman correlation and Shapiro-Wilk confidence tests were performed to assess the reproducibility of the DUB screen replicates.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael R Schlabach (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Given the nature of this contribution the editors recommend this be reconsidered as a Tools and Resources paper rather than as a Research Article.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Wegner et al. describe an innovative approach to generate pooled sgRNA or shRNA libraries. Such libraries are now ubiquitously used as part of functional genomics efforts and thus an improved method to generate them is of high significance and utility.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper has now been seen by three reviewers. There was broad enthusiasm about the approach for generating complex libraries. However, there were concerns about some aspects of the work and a general feeling that the paper would benefit by streamlining the presentation to focus on the most solid and novel aspects of the method.</p><p>Four areas of concern are highlighted below:</p><p>1) There was general enthusiasm for the library generation strategy and as well as the value of an alternate approaches to create high diversity complex libraries. That said there were concerns that the comparison to alternate PCR-based approaches may not fairly represent how well those approaches can work when carefully implemented. Although there were some differences on this point, it seems that the most conservative and time efficient way to respond to these concerns would be to generally emphasize the capabilities of the present strategy and avoid relative comparisons unless they are directly substantiated by side-by-side comparisons. Additionally, since this is primarily a methods paper, it was felt that a better description of the workflow, including time and reagent requirements would be important to address in revision. For example, in the text or as a table/figure, the workflow Figure 1A could be fleshed out to provide more specifics about time and yields.</p><p>2) There was concern that, while the underlying quality of the DUB screen may be high, that the analysis strategy is not well validated. The raw sequencing data output of the screen should be analyzed by one or more of the established hit-calling methods (e.g. MAGeCK) to provide a better sense of the robustness of the hits as well as the real world performance of this library.</p><p>3) There is considerable concern about the conclusions from the TGW screens. While there is an appreciation for the innovative nature of the approach, the quality of the results, both in terms of the completeness and false positive rates, is difficult to evaluate given the data presented. Short of what would likely be a major experimental and analytical effort, the authors should tone down the claims and present this as an exploratory effort. For example, limitations such as very low reproducibility and the need to allow multiple mismatches to map sgRNAs should be discussed alongside the need for extensive validation.</p><p>I also pass on a couple of the specific reviewers' comments to provide context for the above:</p><p>Regarding analysis of the DUB screen: The section on the DUB screen is a bit convoluted and would benefit from using standardized analysis methods and a more focused discussion of the screen results for example by omitting the GO term analysis, which does not add very much.</p><p>To analyze the data, the authors sum sgRNA counts overall genes, but the more established approach in the field would be to calculate phenotypes for each sgRNA and to then aggregate these into gene-level phenotypes and derive p-values using statistical tests. Standardized pipelines exist to perform these analyses, such as MAGeCK. These phenotypes should also be compared to those from negative controls, both non-targeting controls and neutral-cutting controls, in particular given that the cell line used by the authors is p53-positive.</p><p>In addition, the assessment of screen quality by read counts across replicates is not fair; this should be a comparison of sgRNA enrichments across replicates. The variation (and correlation) in read counts stems almost entirely from differences in the starting abundances of sgRNAs in the library. Finally, Figure 3—figure supplement 1G should perhaps just be a scatter plot of the two sets of phenotypes against each other; the current representation is biased by the sorting and makes the data look better than they might be.</p><p>Regarding the TGW screen: The tgw screens should be de-emphasized on results and a more frank description of the shortcomings of it as an exploratory technique, assuming they don't want to do more work to figure out what any of these guides are really doing. That was my major objection with the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42549.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Four areas of concern are highlighted below:</p><p>1) There was general enthusiasm for the library generation strategy and as well as the value of an alternate approaches to create high diversity complex libraries.

In the revised version of the manuscript, we avoid comparable statements where not appropriate. As a result, the text has been reworded and Supplementary Figure 3C showing NGS comparisons of previously reported reagents with our 3Cs-DUB library has been removed.</p><p>Area#2 (visualization of workflow):The reviewers pointed out that a better visualization of the workflow that includes times, yields and reagent requirements is necessary. As this is primarily a methods paper, we are thankful for this critical comment and provide a new Figure 1A in which the molecular biology of 3Cs reactions is put into context of phage, ssDNA and final library generation. We highlight possible break points in the protocol, at which users can pause or reagents be long-term stored. Furthermore, to better illustrate the general time frame, we provide time estimates for total and hands-on time and, when appropriate, provide reagent yields. In addition, we now provide a comprehensive list of all reagents and equipment required to perform 3Cs in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript, as well as in the key_resource_table.xlsx file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was concern that, while the underlying quality of the DUB screen may be high, that the analysis strategy is not well validated.

We are thankful for raising this critical point and followed the reviewer’s suggestion. As such, we have extensively adapted text and Figure 3 to reflect log2-fold changes and their associated p-values for individual proliferative DUB phenotypes. Even though not asked for, we provide shRNA-mediated validation of positive and negative proliferative DUB phenotypes as new experimental support for the performance of the gRNA library. Furthermore, one reviewer pointed out that our initial gene-ontology (GO) analysis does not add much to the conclusions drawn from this section. In light of the overall manuscript, we agree with the reviewer and have removed the GO analysis part from the text and Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is considerable concern about the conclusions from the TGW screens.

We thank the reviewers for stressing this topic and have substantially changed the Results and Discussion section to better reflect the limitations associated with the TGW screens. Furthermore, we now highlight the fact that the TGW screen has been an exploratory effort, provide a more careful examination on the shortcomings of library and screen and make clear that doxorubicin resistance-associated target regions will need extensive future validations.</p><p>To better reflect the overall criticism and enable an unbiased evaluation of the 3Cs technology in the future, we also provide a shortened manuscript title “Circular synthesized CRISPR/Cas gRNAs for functional interrogations in the coding and noncoding genome” in which we avoid “high-fidelity”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
