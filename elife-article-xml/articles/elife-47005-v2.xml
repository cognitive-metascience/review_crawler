Immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 are thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, thereby maximising gene expression. Because of this potentially costly sacrificial process, we investigated if ubiquitination of NPR1 plays transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover. Here we show ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase, UBE4, it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity. Thus, immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47005.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant diseases cause devastating crop losses around the world and threaten the food supply of millions of people. Over time, plants have developed various mechanisms for fighting off infections caused by pests and other pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. When plants become infected they kick their immune system into action by rapidly switching on and off certain genes. They do this by activating the protein NPR1 which regulates the plant’s immune genes. NPR1 is essential for fighting off infections and plants that do not have this protein are highly susceptible to disease.</p><p>Peculiarly, once the plant has detected an infection it builds resistance by destroying the NPR1 protein. A previous study suggested that plants do this to replace old ‘inactive’ NPR1 with newer versions that can activate the genes needed to stop the disease developing. This process, however, requires a lot of energy that could be re-directed to other aspects of the immune response. Now, Skelly et al. – including one of the researchers involved in the previous study – have explored whether there may be other reasons for why plants destroy the NPR1 protein.</p><p>Plant cells target NPR1 for destruction by repeatedly tagging it with molecules called ubiquitin to form ubiquitin chains. The length of these chains determines whether a protein is stable and ready for action, or whether it is ready to be destroyed. In experiments with a commonly studied plant known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> Skelly et al. found that the length of ubiquitin chains attached to the NPR1 protein could fine-tune its level of activity: short ubiquitin chains activate NPR1, while longer chains lead to its destruction and shut down the protein. This suggests that the steps leading to the destruction of NPR1 regulate the immune genes needed to fight off disease.</p><p>This work has uncovered important new components of how plants defend themselves from infection. If these findings translate to crop plants they could inform future agricultural strategies for enhancing the plant’s own defences to increase crop yields, which would provide more food for a rapidly growing population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NPR1</kwd><kwd>salicylic acid</kwd><kwd>systemic acquired resistance</kwd><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF090321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spoel</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L006219/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spoel</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>678511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spoel</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of plant immune genes is controlled by the opposing actions of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases that modify the master coactivator NPR1, thereby regulating its intrinsic transcriptional activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune responses must be tightly controlled to provide appropriate, efficient and timely resistance to pathogenic threats. A major hallmark of eukaryotic immune responses is dramatic reprogramming of the transcriptome to prioritise defences over other cellular functions. In plants transcriptional reprogramming is largely orchestrated by the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) that accumulates upon recognition of biotrophic pathogens. SA not only induces resistance in infected local tissues, it is also required for establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a form of induced resistance with broad-spectrum effectiveness that is long-lasting and protects the entire plant from future pathogen attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spoel and Dong, 2012</xref>). Establishment of SAR and associated transcriptome reprogramming are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator NPR1 (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) genes 1). The majority of SA-induced genes are NPR1 dependent, indicating NPR1 is a master regulator of plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, loss of NPR1 function results in severely immune-compromised plants unable to activate SAR.</p><p>Since NPR1 exerts its activity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinkema et al., 2000</xref>), controlling its nuclear entry provides a means to prevent spurious activation of immune responses. Indeed, in resting cells NPR1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a large redox-sensitive oligomer that is formed by intermolecular disulphide linkages between conserved cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mou et al., 2003</xref>). NPR1 monomers that escape oligomerization and enter the nucleus are ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING Ligase 3 (CRL3), a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in their degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, constitutive clearance of NPR1 from nuclei of resting cells by concerted action of CRL3 and the proteasome is necessary to prevent untimely activation of its target genes and associated autoimmunity.</p><p>Upon activation of SAR, NPR1 is subject to an array of post-translational modifications. A combination of alterations in redox-based modifications, phosphorylation and SUMOylation of NPR1 result in the formation of a transactivation complex that induces the transcription of immune-responsive target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skelly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Withers and Dong, 2016</xref>). Subsequent to these post-translational control points, NPR1 becomes phosphorylated at Ser11 and Ser15, which surprisingly results in recruitment of CRL3 followed by its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome, genetic mutation of CRL3, and mutation of Ser11/15 all stabilised NPR1 protein, yet impaired the expression of SA-induced NPR1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). These findings indicate that paradoxically, ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 are required for the full expression of its target genes. We previously proposed a proteolysis-coupled transcription model in which activation of target gene transcription results in NPR1 being marked as ‘spent’ by Ser11/15 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). SUMOylation of NPR1 was required for Ser11/15 phosphorylation and facilitates its interaction with other transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saleh et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that NPR1 becomes inactivated only after it has initiated gene transcription. Removal of inactive NPR1 from target promoters may be necessary to allow binding of new active NPR1 protein that can reinitiate transcription, thereby correlating the rate of NPR1 turnover to the level of target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). This type of transcriptional control by unstable (co)activators has also been reported in other eukaryotes, including for key transcriptional regulators such as the nutrient sensor GCN4 in yeast and the estrogen receptor ERα as well as oncogenic cMyc and SRC-3 activators in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lipford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Métivier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reid et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von der Lehr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that the use of unstable transcriptional (co)activators may be an evolutionary conserved mechanism for fine-tuning gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kodadek et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While transcription-coupled degradation of unstable (co)activators is an attractive model for controlling transcriptional outputs in eukaryotes, it is potentially also a costly sacrificial process. Therefore we explored the alternative possibility that prior to degradation, ubiquitination itself might act as a transcriptional signal. As chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules are thought to be necessary for recruitment of most substrates to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>), it is plausible that processive ubiquitination could provide a window of opportunity for NPR1 to activate its target genes. In this study we demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of NPR1 is controlled by several ubiquitin chain modifying enzymes. Both stepwise ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities contribute to the regulation of NPR1 target genes and establishment of plant immunity. Our findings imply that in eukaryotes transcriptional outputs of unstable (co)activators may not be fine-tuned by their proteasomal turnover per se but rather by conjugated ubiquitin chains of dynamic variable length.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The E4 ligase UBE4 regulates SA- and NPR1-mediated plant immunity</title><p>To examine if stepwise ubiquitination of NPR1 plays a role in plant immune responses we examined a potential role for E4 ligases. Unlike E3 ligases, the E4 class do not contribute towards initial ubiquitination of substrates but rather extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoppe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koegl et al., 1999</xref>). In Arabidopsis the E4 ligase UBE4/MUSE3 has been implicated in the degradation of NLR (nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Mutant <italic>ube4/muse3</italic> plants exhibited enhanced disease resistance but this phenotype could only be explained in part by the increased stability of an NLR receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore we investigated if UBE4 is involved in downstream NPR1-dependent immune signalling by acquiring a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like mutants in CRL3 ligase that fail to degrade NPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>), adult <italic>ube4</italic> plants displayed enhanced expression of immune genes in absence of pathogen challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In agreement with this, when the potential for enhanced disease resistance was examined by using a high inoculum of <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326, adult <italic>ube4</italic> mutants showed autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To establish if these phenotypes were dependent on SA signalling, <italic>ube4</italic> mutant plants were crossed with SA-deficient <italic>ics1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wildermuth et al., 2001</xref>). The constitutive immune gene expression observed in <italic>ube4</italic> was abolished in <italic>ube4 ics1</italic> double mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, a low inoculum dosage of <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 that does not cause disease in wild-type (WT) and mutant <italic>ube4</italic> plants, did result in bacterial proliferation in mutant <italic>ics1</italic> plants. In agreement with the gene expression data, enhanced susceptibility was maintained in <italic>ube4 ics1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating the autoimmune phenotype of adult <italic>ube4</italic> plants is completely dependent on SA. Because SA-dependent immunity is largely regulated by the transcription coactivator NPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 1997</xref>), we crossed <italic>ube4</italic> with <italic>npr1-1</italic> mutant plants. Constitutive immune gene expression in <italic>ube4</italic> plants was abolished in <italic>ube4 npr1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and this double mutant was equally susceptible to a low <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 inoculum as <italic>npr1</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that in unchallenged plants UBE4 suppresses the expression of SA-mediated NPR1 target genes and prevents autoimmunity, conceivably by altering the stability of upstream NLR immune receptors as well as the downstream NPR1 coactivator.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47005.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The E4 ubiquitin ligase UBE4 regulates SA-mediated plant immunity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of NPR1 target genes normalised relative to constitutively expressed <italic>UBQ5</italic> in four-week old plants of the indicated genotypes.

By contrast, SA-induced polyubiquitination of NPR1-GFP was compromised in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), but ubiquitinated NPR1 was still detected at high-molecular weight. Therefore we sought to distinguish if in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants, NPR1 was modified by long ubiquitin chains or multiple shorter chains, both of which yield high-molecular weights on SDS-PAGE. Thus, we performed pull down experiments with recombinant S5a ubiquitin interacting motifs (S5aUIM) that preferentially bind chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deveraux et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young et al., 1998</xref>). Compared to plants carrying wild-type <italic>UBE4</italic> alleles, the amount of SA-induced polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP pulled down with recombinant S5aUIM was strikingly lower in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that UBE4 promotes formation of long ubiquitin chains on NPR1 leading to its proteasomal degradation. To determine if UBE4 may act directly on NPR1, we assessed the ability of UBE4 to physically interact with ubiquitinated NPR1. We isolated ubiquitinated NPR1-GFP from SA and MG132-treated <italic>ube4</italic> mutants and subsequently incubated with recombinant FLAG-UBE4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, NPR1-GFP specifically pulled down FLAG-UBE4, indicating that UBE4 physically binds to polyubiquitinated NPR1 to facilitate ubiquitin chain extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Progressive ubiquitination controls transcriptional activity of NPR1</title><p>Because UBE4 enhanced polyubiquitination of NPR1 and controlled its stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we investigated if similar to CRL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>), it also promotes transcriptional activity of NPR1. In stark contrast to <italic>cul3a cul3b</italic> mutants that were compromised in SA-induced expression of NPR1 target genes, plants carrying two different <italic>ube4</italic> mutant alleles exhibited elevated expression levels that were much higher than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To explore the effect of UBE4 on the NPR1-dependent transcriptome, we performed RNA Seq on SA-treated WT, <italic>ube4</italic> and <italic>npr1</italic> plants. Among 2612 genes whose expression changed by ≥2 fold in response to SA in WT or <italic>ube4</italic> mutants, 75% were stringently dependent on NPR1 (<italic>i.e.</italic> ≥1.5 fold difference compared to <italic>npr1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Compared to WT plants, SA-induced NPR1 accumulated to elevated levels in both <italic>cul3a/b</italic> and <italic>ube4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, NPR1 protein levels cannot explain differences in transcriptional output of NPR1. We then examined if changes in polyubiquitin chain length regulate NPR1 association with its target promoters. To that end we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on plants that constitutively expressed NPR1-GFP, thereby eliminating genotype-dependent differences in NPR1 protein level. Coinciding with elevated <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression, at 8 hr after SA treatment more NPR1-GFP was bound to the <italic>PR1</italic> promoter in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants compared to plants carrying wild-type <italic>UBE4</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This indicates that in absence of long polyubiquitin chains, early occupancy by transcriptionally competent NPR1 is increased at target promoters. We also examined a later time point after SA treatment (24 hr) and found that NPR1-GFP was still associated with the <italic>PR1</italic> promoter in plants expressing wild-type <italic>UBE4</italic>, but not in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Nonetheless, <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression remained at elevated levels in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), implying that in absence of long-chain polyubiquitination NPR1 strongly switches on target genes without the need for long-term residency at their promoters.</p><p>To investigate if CRL3 and UBE4 act independently or in tandem, we crossed <italic>ube4</italic> single with <italic>cul3a cul3b</italic> double mutants and analysed the expression of NPR1 target genes in the resulting triple mutant. Strikingly, <italic>cul3a cul3b ube4</italic> mutants showed severe developmental defects, including stunted growth and complete sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Very few viable homozygous plants were recovered, perhaps suggesting these two ligases work together and share substrates. Nonetheless we were able to select just enough plants to examine the behaviour of NPR1 target genes. In <italic>cul3a cul3b ube4</italic> mutants the SA-induced expression of several genes, including <italic>PR</italic> genes, was impaired to a similar extend as in <italic>cul3a cul3b</italic> double mutants, indicating that elevated gene expression observed in <italic>ube4</italic> plants is dependent on CRL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). However, a subset of NPR1 target genes (<italic>i.e. WRKY18</italic>, <italic>WRKY38, WRKY62</italic>) were dramatically upregulated in <italic>cul3a cul3b ube4</italic> mutants to a level higher than in any of the other genotypes. This suggests that in absence of CRL3 and UBE4, these genes were activated through another pathway or were highly responsive to elevated homeostatic levels of NPR1 protein and may therefore not be suitable readouts for this particular epistatic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Regardless of this specific, our broader findings suggest that CRL3 and UBE4 function sequentially in the stepwise addition or extension of ubiquitin chains on NPR1 but with opposing effects on its transcriptional activity.</p><p>We then examined if in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants NPR1 lingered in a highly transcriptional active state that does not require proteasome-mediated turnover. To negate any feedback effects of loss of UBE4 activity on endogenous NPR1 expression, seedlings constitutively expressing NPR1-GFP were treated with SA plus a range of MG132 concentrations. SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>WRKY</italic> gene expression was inhibited by increasing concentrations of MG132 in <italic>NPR1-GFP</italic> (in <italic>npr1</italic>) plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). By contrast, the SA-induced expression of these NPR1 target genes was largely unresponsive to MG132 in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants, especially at lower concentrations. Thus, loss of UBE4 largely uncoupled NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity, demonstrating the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity. In summary, our findings indicate that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Deubiquitinases regulate NPR1-dependent transcription</title><p>Trimming or removal of ubiquitin chains is performed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) and may provide another layer of regulation of NPR1 activity.

We produced recombinant T7-tagged UBP6 and incubated it with HA-tagged ubiquitin vinyl sulfone (HA-UbVS), an ubiquitin mimic that cannot be hydrolysed upon irreversible binding to DUB active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodovsky et al., 2001</xref>). HA-UbVS readily labelled T7-UBP6 but only upon addition of 26S proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating UBP6 has proteasome-activated DUB activity. Moreover, addition of WP1130 inhibitor completely blocked HA-UbVS labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), illustrating the effectiveness of this inhibitor on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UBP6.</p><p>To examine if UBP6 can cleave ubiquitin chains we incubated recombinant UBP6 with free ubiquitin chains or with di-ubiquitin of different linkage types and compared it to activity of recombinant human USP14. Similar to human USP14, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UBP6 displayed very little deubiquitination activity on free ubiquitin chains or di-ubiquitin of K48 and K63 linkage types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). Only wild-type UBP6 but not UBP6(C113S) in which the catalytic cysteine residue was mutated, was weakly capable of trimming K63-linked chains in presence of 26S proteasomes, although this activity required very long incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings mirror the poor in vitro activity of human USP14 on free ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, human USP14 deubiquitinates anchored ubiquitin chains of various linkage types, including K48 linkages that target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore we proceeded to investigate if UBP6 activity cleaves ubiquitin chains anchored to NPR1. Indeed, incubation of purified polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP with recombinant UBP6 and 26S proteasomes led to the release of ubiquitin conjugates of approximately hexa-ubiquitin chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This release of ubiquitin conjugates was dependent on SA treatment, suggesting that UBP6 counteracts SA-induced polyubiquitination of NPR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that UBP6 is an active DUB capable of removing ubiquitin chains en bloc from NPR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Deubiquitination by UBP6 and UBP7 regulates NPR1 stability and transcriptional activity</title><p>So what is the effect of UBP6- and UBP7-mediated deubiquitination on NPR1 function? We found that treatment of <italic>NPR1-GFP</italic> (in <italic>npr1</italic>) seedlings with WP1130 inhibitor increased the levels of SA-induced polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP while reducing the unmodified amount of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that UBP6 and UBP7 activities are required for deubiquitination of SA-induced NPR1-GFP, thereby rescuing it from degradation. To further examine this possibility, we analysed the stability of endogenous NPR1 protein in SA-treated <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> double mutants. CHX chase experiments revealed that compared to WT plants, NPR1 was destabilised in <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Accordingly, expression of FLAG-tagged UBP6 in the <italic>ubp6/</italic>7 mutant background restored NPR1 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that UBP6 and UBP7 serve to stabilise NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains that signal for its proteasome-mediated degradation.</p><p>Given the importance of progressive ubiquitination for the transcriptional activity of NPR1, we explored how UBP6- and UBP7-mediated deubiquitination might affect NPR1 coactivator function. Because UBP6 and UBP7 were required for NPR1-dependent <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), we questioned if NPR1 was still associated with the <italic>PR1</italic> promoter in absence of UBP6 and UBP7 activities. Surprisingly, ChIP experiments showed that SA-induced association of NPR1-GFP with the <italic>PR1</italic> promoter was strongly enhanced in presence of WP1130 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that UBP6 and UBP7 prevent the build-up of long polyubiquitin chains that block the transcriptional activity of NPR1. It also implies that similar to their yeast homologue, UBP6 and UBP7 exhibit proteasome inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>). This activity is thought to delay degradation of proteasome substrates, thereby creating a window of opportunity for DUBs to deubiquitinate substrates and pardon them from proteolysis. Importantly, proteasome inhibitory activity does not require the catalytic active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, to investigate how deubiquitination and proteasome inhibitory activities of UBP6 contribute to the regulation of NPR1 coactivator activity, we expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type UBP6 (FLAG-UBP6) and catalytically inactive UBP6(C113S) (FLAG-UBP6m) in <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> double mutants. While <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> mutants were compromised in SA-induced activation of all NPR1 target genes tested, expression of FLAG-UBP6 fully restored SA-responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). By contrast, FLAG-UBP6m restored SA-induced expression of only a subset, but not all NPR1 target genes. A distinction was observed between <italic>WRKY</italic> and <italic>PR</italic> genes, with the former requiring catalytic DUB activity of UBP6 while the latter did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These data indicate that catalytic and non-catalytic activities of UBP6 regulate distinct NPR1-dependent gene sets.</p><p>Finally we examined what the relevance is of UBP6- and UBP7-regulated transcriptional activity of NPR1 in context of plant immunity. We first treated plants with or without SA before challenge inoculation with virulent <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326. SA treatment induced resistance in WT plants but did not block bacterial propagation in <italic>ubp6/7</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that UBP6 and UBP7 are required for NPR1 coactivator activity and associated development of SA-dependent immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system plays vital roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression, in large part by controlling the abundance of transcriptional regulators. Paradoxically, proteasome-dependent instability of selected potent eukaryotic transcriptional activators is necessary for the expression of their target genes. It is thought that their transcription-coupled degradation ensures the target promoter is continuously supplied with fresh activators that reinitiate transcription, thereby maximising gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kodadek et al., 2006</xref>). However, this sacrificial process is energy-expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peth et al., 2013</xref>), raising a dilemma of why such mechanisms evolved to regulate transcriptional activators. Our study on the immune coactivator NPR1, however, indicates that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover.</p><p>We discovered that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise event, requiring the actions of CRL3 and the E4 ligase UBE4. In resting cells, CRL3-mediated turnover of NPR1 is important for preventing autoimmunity in absence of pathogen threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>). The NPR1-dependent autoimmune phenotype of <italic>ube4</italic> mutants is reminiscent of that observed in <italic>cul3a cul3b</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spoel et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that in addition to CRL3 ligase, UBE4 is required to clear NPR1 from the nucleus and prevent untimely activation of immunity. In presence of SA, however, CRL3-mediated ubiquitination induced NPR1 coactivator activity, whereas formation of polyubiquitin chains by UBE4 blocked its activity and ultimately led to proteasome-mediated turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Rather than initiating substrate ubiquitination, E4 ligases are thought to extend existing ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crosas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koegl et al., 1999</xref>), thereby determining substrate commitment to proteasome-mediated degradation and contributing to proteasome processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aviram and Kornitzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koegl et al., 1999</xref>). Functionally these enzymes are emerging as important players in limiting the activity of NLR immune receptors as well as potent eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UBE4/MUSE3 works in concert with a CRL1/SCF<sup>CPR1</sup> ligase to regulate stability of the intercellular immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2 that recognise pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together with our finding that UBE4 acts in concert with CRL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), this suggests a single E4 enzyme may assist in diverse ubiquitin-mediated pathways controlled by different E3 ligases.</p><p>The role of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UBE4 in ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 are reminiscent of stepwise ubiquitination of the mammalian tumour suppressor p53, a potent transcriptional activator of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. The stability of p53 is regulated by amongst others the E3 ligase MDM2 (or HDM2 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pant and Lozano, 2014</xref>). Although MDM2 limits p53 activity by promoting its turnover, MDM2 only catalyses multi-monoubiquitination of p53, which is insufficient for recognition by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2001</xref>). Progression to the polyubiquitinated form of p53 in the nucleus is carried out by the U-box E4 ligase UBE4B that interacts with both MDM2 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu and Leng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Although this is similar to the proposed roles of CRL3 and UBE4 in controlling NPR1 stability, initial ubiquitination has different effects on p53 and NPR1. While MDM2-mediated monoubiquitination controls nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2003</xref>), it probably does not have a direct effect on intrinsic p53 activator activity. Instead, initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, at least in part by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially also by promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although it remains unclear if CRL3 adds only monoubiquitin or generates short chains shy of tetraubiquitin, the minimal signal required for proteasome recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>), progression to polyubiquitin chain formation by UBE4 results in transcriptional shut down as polyubiquitinated NPR1 still occupied target promoters but lacked transcriptional potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). This type of stepwise ubiquitination may be a general mechanism to control unstable transcriptional (co)activators in eukaryotes. For example, multi-monoubiquitination of the oncogenic growth coactivator SRC-3 results in its transcriptional activation, while subsequent chain extension targets it for degradation, but E4 ligases have not yet been implicated. We propose here that stepwise ubiquitination established by the sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases may generate a transcriptional timer that controls the activity and lifetime of unstable (co)activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47005.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model for how dynamic ubiquitination regulates transcriptional outputs of NPR1.</title><p>NPR1 occupancy at target gene promoters initiates low-level transcription (dashed green arrow).

Several unstable mammalian transcription activators, including p53 and the immune activator NF-κB, are also regulated by diverse DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colleran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pant and Lozano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schweitzer and Naumann, 2015</xref>). In these cases DUBs promote transcription by stabilising p53 and NF-κB at their target promoters. For example, loss of USP7-mediated deubiquitination of NF-κB resulted in increased turnover and decreased promoter occupancy of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colleran et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, we found that knockout of UBP6 and UBP7 resulted in enhanced turnover and decreased transcriptional output of NPR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, inhibition of UBP6/7 deubiquitination activities with WP1130 resulted in enhanced occupancy of transcriptionally inactive NPR1 at the <italic>PR1</italic> target promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These data suggest that (<italic>i</italic>) like their yeast and mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), UBP6 and UBP7 exhibit proteasome inhibitory activities that at least temporarily prolong promoter occupancy by NPR1, and (<italic>ii</italic>) UBP6 and UBP7 prevent inactivation of NPR1 by opposing the formation of long ubiquitin chains.</p><p>UBP6 showed a similar DUB activity as its mammalian homologue USP14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), in that it appeared to deubiquitinate NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains en bloc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Such activity places this DUB in direct opposition to UBE4-mediated chain extension activity. In yeast Ubp6 was previously reported to oppose ubiquitin chain extension activity of the E4 ligase Hul5, thereby regulating substrate recruitment to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crosas et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, Arabidopsis UBP6 and UBP7 opposed ubiquitin ligase activities to extend the lifetime of transcriptionally active NPR1. Although we cannot completely rule out that these DUBs function in opposition to CRL3, their en bloc ubiquitin removal activity suggests they more likely remove longer ubiquitin chains generated by UBE4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Other DUBs may also play a role in regulating SA-responsive gene expression. This is illustrated by our findings that all tested DUB inhibitors blocked NPR1 target gene expression, while mutation of exclusively UBP6 and UBP7 had a similar effect. This discrepancy is expected because the specificity of DUB inhibitors has well-recognised limitations in that they often target multiple related DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is likely especially true for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> which encodes for &gt;60 DUB enzymes, many of which cluster into related sub-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">March and Farrona, 2017</xref>). Besides UBP6/7 other DUBs may therefore also play a role in regulating SA-responsive gene expression but their precise functions remain unknown.</p><p>In summary, we report that disparate ubiquitin modifying enzymes play important roles in establishment of plant immune responses. We demonstrate that the opposing actions of an E3 and E4 ligase pair and two DUBs can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of the unstable immune coactivator NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover. Dynamicity in conjugated ubiquitin chain length may be a powerful mechanism for controlling the activity of unstable eukaryotic (co)activators in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

infection</title><p>All <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants used in this study were in the Columbia genetic background, with WT referring to wild-type Col-0 throughout. Plants were grown under long day conditions (16 hr photoperiod) on soil in controlled-environment growth chambers at 65% humidity and 22°C unless otherwise stated. Seeds were stratified at 4–8°C in darkness for 2 days before moving to growth chambers. Plants were grown in a soil mix composed of peat moss, vermiculite and sand at a ratio of 4:1:1 respectively, and illumination was provided by fluorescent tube lighting at an intensity of 70–100 μmol m<sup>−2</sup>sec<sup>−1</sup>. For experiments on seedlings, seeds were sterilised by washing in 100% ethanol for 2 mins before incubating in 50% household bleach for 20 mins. After removal of bleach, seeds were washed at least 3 times with sterile H<sub>2</sub>O before use. Sterilised seeds were spotted on Murashige and Skoog agar media and stratified before placing under lighting conditions as above. All T-DNA insertion mutants used were genotyped by PCR using standard conditions with gene specific primers in combination with left-border primers specific to each mutant collection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The coding sequences of the <italic>UBE4</italic> (At5g15400) and <italic>UBP6</italic> (At1g51710) genes were amplified using Phusion polymerase (NEB) from WT <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cDNA with the addition of CACC at the 5’ end required for TOPO cloning. The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned in to the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers’ instructions. The active site residue of UBP6 was then mutagenised to serine (C113S) using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to manufacturers’ instructions. Genes were then recombined into pEarleyGate 104 and 202 plasmids by LR reaction (Invitrogen) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Earley et al., 2006</xref>) to generate <italic>35S::YFP-UBE4</italic>, <italic>35S::FLAG-UBP6</italic> and <italic>35S::FLAG-UBP6(C113S)</italic> constructs. These plasmids were used to transform protoplasts or to transform <italic>Agrobacterium tumifaciens</italic> strain GV3101 (pMP90) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kneeshaw et al., 2014</xref>).

Selection of transformants was performed by spraying 10 day old seedlings with 120 μg/l BASTA at least three times. Further confirmation of transformation was performed by immunoblotting. Segregation of BASTA resistance was analysed in the T<sub>2</sub> generation to confirm plants had single transgene insertions.</p><p>For SA treatments, adult plants were sprayed with, while seedlings were immersed in 0.5 mM SA or H<sub>2</sub>O. CHX, MG132 and DUB inhibitors were all used to treat seedlings by immersion at the concentrations stated in respective figure legends.

Plants were infected by pressure infiltration with a syringe through the abaxial leaf surface. For measurement of bacterial growth, a single leaf disc per plant was cut from infected leaves at the stated dpi and ground in 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Serial dilutions were plated on LB supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and colonies were counted after 2 days incubation at 30°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR</title><p>Leaf tissue or whole seedlings were frozen and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenised in RNA extraction buffer (100 mM LiCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) before addition of an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). The homogenate was vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform/isoamylalcohol, vortexed and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. This step was repeated once before the aqueous layer was added to a 1/3 vol of 8 M LiCl and incubated overnight at 4°C. The extract was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was washed with ice cold 70% ethanol then rehydrated and dissolved in 400 μl H<sub>2</sub>O for 30 min on ice. Finally, 40 μl of NaAc (pH 5.3) and 1 ml of ice cold 96% ethanol was added before incubating for 1 hr at −20°C.

RNA was then quantified and submitted to GATC Biotech/Eurofins (Constance, Germany) for RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> TAIR10 genome using Bowtie. TopHat identified potential exon-exon splice junctions of the initial alignment. Strand NGS software in RNA-Seq workflow was used to quantify transcripts. Raw counts were normalised using DESeq with baseline transformation to the median of all samples. Data were then expressed as normalised signal values (<italic>i.e.</italic> log<sub>2</sub>[RPKM] where RPKM is read count per kilobase of exon model per million reads) for all statistical tests and plotting. Genes were then filtered by expression (20%–100%) and differentially expressed genes determined by Benjamini Hochberg FDR with 2-way ANOVA (p=0.05). Additionally, we required SA-induced genes to meet a ≥ 2 fold change cut-off, whereas NPR1-dependent genes required ≥1.5 fold change in Col-0 or <italic>ube4</italic> plants when compared to <italic>npr1</italic> mutants.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamic ubiquitination determines transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to emphasize that we are overall very positive about the work and would like to see it published in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work uncovers highly complex and dynamic ubiquitination of NPR1, the master regulator of the SA pathway. CUL3, UBE4, and UBP6/7 act together to regulate progressive ubiquitination of NPR1, thereby controlling NPR1 activity, in addition to previously known ubiquitin dependent degradation. The work is of great interest to the broad field of transcriptional regulation, and is overall well executed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In most cases, the authors have used only a single allele for T-DNA knock-out mutants (most important for <italic>ube4</italic> and <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic>). Unless functional complementation is provided, this is not robust enough to come up with a solid conclusion. Please provide additional genetic evidence supporting the role of UBE4 and UBP6/7 in NPR1 ubiquitination using other alleles.</p><p>2) The role of UBE4 in promoting NPR1 degradation are not entirely convincing. To show that NPR1 stability is affected by UBE4, they generated two lines, one expressing NPR1-GFP in Col-0 or, the other in the <italic>ube4</italic> background. Unexpectedly, NPR1 either accumulates to lower, or similar levels in the mutant background, compared to WT (see Figures 2A and 2C respectively). Have the authors analysed the transcript levels in these lines, and are they comparable?</p><p>3) Because Figure 2A is central to the manuscript, it would be good to have some quantification here. The loading control is not really equal, protein concentration seems to go down in the Col-0, while up in the <italic>ube4</italic> background. Normalising the signal to the corresponding S5a would help to make the point. Also related, is S5a not degraded via the proteasome? If authors have the coomassie, it would be good if they would include it.</p><p>4) It will be necessary to test association between UBE4 and NPR1 in vivo on SA-treated plants to support a direct action of UBE4 on NPR1. Finally, the ability of UBE4 to elongate ubiquitin chains is not consistent with Figure 2D or 6C where the ubiquitin chains seem to have the same length (reaching the same size). To convince the reader, the authors must provide more resolutive blots for high molecular weight. The elongation or trimming activities of UBE4 and UBP6/7, respectively, should result in marked migration differences on a western blot.</p><p>5) UBP6 is proposed to trim ubiquitin off NPR1 upon SA treatment, counteracting UBE4 (Figure 6C). This conclusion would be more convincing if the authors performed the exact same experiment without SA treatment. One should expect not to see the 50kDa 6x ubiquitin band showing up if UBP6 acts only on UBE4-extended chains.</p><p>6) Since UBE4 is also required for the degradation of multiple NLRs. The elevated defense gene expression and disease resistance in the <italic>ube4</italic> mutant observed may be a combination of both NPR1 function and NLR function. Although the authors show that the elevated defense gene expression and increased disease resistance in <italic>ube4</italic> mutant require ICS1 and NPR1, the same maybe true for NLR activated defenses. This will need to be thoroughly discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47005.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In most cases, the authors have used only a single allele for T-DNA knock-out mutants (most important for ube4 and ubp6 ubp7).

New Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E show that both mutant alleles compromise degradation of the endogenous SA-induced NPR1 protein.</p><p>Moreover, in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A we show that like in <italic>ube4-2</italic> plants, SA-induced <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression is enhanced in the <italic>muse3</italic> mutant.</p><p>b) In the original manuscript we already complemented <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> mutants with a <italic>35S::FLAG-UBP6</italic> construct. We now show in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1E that enhanced NPR1 turnover observed in <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> mutants is indeed alleviated by complementation with <italic>35S::FLAG-UBP6</italic>. Furthermore, in Figure 6G and 6F we already demonstrate that impaired expression of NPR1 target genes in the <italic>ubp6 ubp7</italic> mutant is rescued to near WT levels when FLAG-UBP6 is expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of UBE4 in promoting NPR1 degradation are not entirely convincing.

Unexpectedly, NPR1 either accumulates to lower, or similar levels in the mutant background, compared to WT (see Figures 2A and 2C respectively). Have the authors analysed the transcript levels in these lines, and are they comparable?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To accurately compare stability of the NPR1-GFP protein in different genetic backgrounds, we ensured that <italic>NPR1-GFP</italic> transcript levels were comparable (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Nonetheless, accumulation of SA-induced NPR1-GFP protein is somewhat variable between experiments (see replica samples in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), which was mirrored by the endogenous NPR1 protein (see replica samples in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E). Therefore we strictly used qualitative and quantitative cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays rather than steady-state levels to draw conclusions on the stability of NPR1. This well established proteostasis approach clearly shows that NPR1-GFP and endogenous NPR1 are both stabilised in <italic>ube4</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Because Figure 2A is central to the manuscript, it would be good to have some quantification here. The loading control is not really equal, protein concentration seems to go down in the Col-0, while up in the ube4 background. Normalising the signal to the corresponding S5a would help to make the point. Also related, is S5a not degraded via the proteasome? If authors have the coomassie, it would be good if they would include it.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of our data and improving loading controls are excellent suggestions. We have done the following:</p><p>a) New Figure 2—figure supplements 1C-E show the quantification (n=3) of NPR1-GFP and endogenous NPR1 protein levels in CHX chase assays. These data demonstrate that NPR1 protein is significantly more stable in the <italic>ube4</italic> mutant background.</p><p>b) Rather than using the S5a protein, we have now used the more stable GAPDH protein to normalise the data. Thus, we repeated the experiment shown in new Figure 2A to include GAPDH as a loading control and we also utilised GAPDH to normalise the quantitative data on NPR1 stability shown in new Figure 2—figure supplements 1C-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It will be necessary to test association between UBE4 and NPR1 in vivo on SA-treated plants to support a direct action of UBE4 on NPR1. Finally, the ability of UBE4 to elongate ubiquitin chains is not consistent with Figure 2D or 6C where the ubiquitin chains seem to have the same length (reaching the same size). To convince the reader, the authors must provide more resolutive blots for high molecular weight. The elongation or trimming activities of UBE4 and UBP6/7, respectively, should result in marked migration differences on a western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>As an E4 ligase the UBE4 protein is not expected to participate in direct protein-protein interaction with NPR1 itself. Rather UBE4 would be expected to transiently bind to the ubiquitin chain that decorates NPR1. In accordance, we have found it difficult to repeatedly co-immunoprecipitate UBE4 and NPR1 in vivo, which is not unusual for highly transient enzyme-substrate interactions. Nonetheless, using highly sensitive mass spectrometry approaches we observed that in some but not all experiments UBE4 co-immunoprecipitated with NPR1-GFP in vivo. Encouraged by this result we then immunoprecipitated ubiquitinated NPR1-GFP from plants that were treated with SA and proteasome inhibitor. Ubiquitinated NPR1-GFP was then incubated with in vitro synthesised FLAG-UBE4 and interaction assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. To our delight new Figure 2F demonstrates that FLAG-UBE4 indeed associated with polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP.</p><p>Regarding ubiquitin chain length, it should be noted that protein ubiquitination results in a branched (rather than linear) polypeptide, the size of which by definition cannot be determined accurately by SDS-PAGE. Indeed, it is known that even unconjugated, non-linear polyubiquitin chains do not migrate at expected molecular size. Our immunoblots are already performed on low percentage acrylamide gels so further resolution cannot be obtained, nor would it be a reliable indicator of ubiquitin chain length. For this very reason we performed pull down experiments with recombinant S5a ubiquitin interacting motifs (S5aUIM) that preferentially bind chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules (Deveraux et al., 1994; Young et al., 1998). This experiment shows that UBE4 promotes formation of long ubiquitin chains on NPR1 (see Figure 2E).</p><p>Moreover, differences in ubiquitination patterns observed in Figures 2D and 6C are due to distinct detection methods. While Figure 2D was visualised with an α-GFP antibody to detect only polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP protein, Figure 6C was visualised with an α-ubiquitin antibody and thus shows both conjugated and free ubiquitin chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) UBP6 is proposed to trim ubiquitin off NPR1 upon SA treatment, counteracting UBE4 (Figure 6C). This conclusion would be more convincing if the authors performed the exact same experiment without SA treatment. One should expect not to see the 50kDa 6x ubiquitin band showing up if UBP6 acts only on UBE4-extended chains.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. Indeed, new Figure 6—figure supplement 1Dshows that only after SA treatment UBP6 released smaller ubiquitin species, suggesting it primarily acts only UBE4 extended ubiquitin chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since UBE4 is also required for the degradation of multiple NLRs. The elevated defense gene expression and disease resistance in the ube4 mutant observed may be a combination of both NPR1 function and NLR function. Although the authors show that the elevated defense gene expression and increased disease resistance in ube4 mutant require ICS1 and NPR1, the same maybe true for NLR activated defenses. This will need to be thoroughly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We have adjusted our conclusions from these data in the Results section. We now described that:</p><p>“In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the E4 ligase UBE4/MUSE3 has been implicated in the degradation of NLR (nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. […] Therefore we investigated if UBE4 is involved in downstream NPR1-dependent immune signalling by acquiring a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Our concluding remarks for this section have been altered to:</p><p>“Collectively, these data suggest that in unchallenged plants UBE4 suppresses the expression of SA-mediated NPR1 target genes and prevents autoimmunity, conceivably by altering the stability of upstream NLR immune receptors as well as the downstream NPR1 coactivator.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
