functions of plant NLR immune receptors are poorly understood. We used in vitro Mu transposition to generate a random truncation library and identify the minimal functional region of NLRs. We applied this method to NRC4—a helper NLR that functions with multiple sensor NLRs within a Solanaceae receptor network. This revealed that the NRC4 N-terminal 29 amino acids are sufficient to induce hypersensitive cell death. This region is defined by the consensus MADAxVSFxVxKLxxLLxxEx (MADA motif) that is conserved at the N-termini of NRC family proteins and ~20% of coiled-coil (CC)-type plant NLRs. The MADA motif matches the N-terminal α1 helix of Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1, which undergoes a conformational switch during resistosome activation. Immunoassays revealed that the MADA motif is functionally conserved across NLRs from distantly related plant species. NRC-dependent sensor NLRs lack MADA sequences indicating that this motif has degenerated in sensor NLRs over evolutionary time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like humans, plants get sick. They can be infected by parasites as diverse as fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematode worms and insects. But, also like humans, plants have an immune system that helps them defend against disease. Their first line of defence are disease resistance genes. Many of these genes encode so-called immune receptors, which are proteins that detect parasites and kick-off the immune response.</p><p>Plant genomes may encode anywhere between 50 and 1000 immune receptors; some of which work solo as singletons, while others operate in pairs or as complex networks. Understanding how immune receptor genes have evolved would give fundamental knowledge about how they work, which in turn would set the stage for researchers to be able to use them to protect agricultural crops from disease.</p><p>One driving force behind the evolution of many genes is gene duplication. Genes duplicate and afterwards the two copies can evolve in different ways. The original immune receptors are multi-tasking proteins that both detect parasites and trigger the immune response. Yet, following gene duplication, evolution has led to some immune receptors becoming dedicated to detection and losing the ability to trigger a defence response on their own.</p><p>Now, Adachi et al. have discovered a molecular signature – named the MADA motif – that defines the subset of immune receptors that can trigger the immune response in plants. This motif is made of just 21 amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) at one end of the receptor and, remarkably, a short fragment of the protein containing this motif is enough to trigger a defence response when produced in plants. In contrast, the immune receptors that have specialized to only detect parasites have lost this molecular signature throughout evolution, presumably because they do not need it as they rely on their receptor partners to trigger defences instead.</p><p>Every year, billions of dollars’ worth of food is lost to plant diseases. These new findings will enable the research community to classify disease resistance genes into categories to help deduce the network architecture of the plant immune system. A better understanding of this, and how networks of plant immune receptor evolve, should set the stage for breeding crop plants that are more able to resist diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>N. benthamiana</italic></kwd><kwd>Immune receptor</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The MADA motif is functionally conserved across NLRs from distantly related plants and has degenerated in sensor NLRs over evolutionary time.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have evolved intracellular immune receptors to detect host-translocated pathogen virulence proteins, known as effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourelis and van der Hoorn, 2018</xref>). These receptors, encoded by disease resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes, are primarily nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs). NLR-triggered immunity (also known as effector-triggered immunity) includes the hypersensitive response (HR), a type of programmed cell death associated with disease resistance. NLRs are widespread across eukaryotes and have been described in animals and fungi in addition to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to other taxa, plants express very large and diverse repertoires of NLRs, with anywhere from about 50 to 1000 genes encoded per genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steuernagel et al., 2018</xref>). Genome-wide analyses have defined repertoires of NLRs (NLRome) across plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2016</xref>). An emerging paradigm is that plant NLRs form receptor networks with varying degrees of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). NLRs have probably evolved from multifunctional singleton receptors—which combine pathogen detection (sensor activity) and immune signalling (helper or executor activity) into a single protein—to functionally specialized interconnected receptor pairs and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2019a</xref>). However, our knowledge of the functional connections and biochemical mechanisms underpinning plant NLR networks remains limited. In addition, although dozens of NLR proteins have been subject to functional studies since their discovery in the 1990 s, this body of knowledge has not been interpreted through an evolutionary biology framework that combines molecular mechanisms with phylogenetics.</p><p>NLRs are multidomain proteins of the ancient group of Signal Transduction ATPases (STAND) proteins that share a nucleotide-binding (NB) domain. In addition to the NB and LRR domains, most plant NLRs have characteristic N-terminal domains that define three subgroups: coiled-coil (CC), CC<sub>R</sub> or RPW8-like (RPW8) and toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2016</xref>). In metazoans, NLRs confer immunity to diverse pathogens through a wheel-like oligomerization process resulting in multiprotein platforms that recruit downstream elements, such as caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tenthorey et al., 2017</xref>). Plant NLRs have long been thought to oligomerize through their N-terminal domains when they’re activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentham et al., 2018</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanisms that underpin NLR activation and subsequent execution of HR cell death have remained largely unknown until very recently. In two remarkable papers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al. (2019a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al. (2019b)</xref> have significantly advanced our understanding of both the structural and biochemical basis of CC-NLR activation in plants. They reconstituted the inactive and active complexes of the Arabidopsis CC-NLR ZAR1 (HOPZ-ACTIVATED RESISTANCE1) with its partner receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures revealed that activated ZAR1 forms a resistosome—a wheel-like pentamer that undergoes a conformational switch to expose a funnel-shaped structure formed by the N-terminal α helices (α1) of the CC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). They propose an engaging model in which the exposed α1 helices of the ZAR1 resistosome mediate cell death by translocating into the plasma membrane and perturbing membrane integrity similar to pore-forming toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). However, whether the ZAR1 model extends to other CC-NLRs is unknown. One important unanswered question is the extent to which the α1 helix ‘death switch’ occurs in other CC-NLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Although ZAR1 is classified as a singleton NLR that detects pathogen effectors without associating with other NLRs, many plant NLRs are interconnected in NLR pairs or networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2019a</xref>). Paired and networked NLRs consist of sensor NLRs that detect pathogen effectors and helper NLRs that translate this effector recognition into HR cell death and immunity. In the Solanaceae, a major phylogenetic clade of CC-NLRs forms a complex immunoreceptor network in which multiple helper NLRs, known as NLR-REQUIRED FOR CELL DEATH (NRC), are required by a large number of sensor NLRs, encoded by <italic>R</italic> gene loci, to confer resistance against diverse pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, nematodes and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). These proteins form the NRC superclade, a well-supported phylogenetic cluster divided into the NRC helper clade (NRC-helpers or NRC-H) and a larger clade that includes all known NRC-dependent sensor NLRs (NRC-sensors or NRC-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The NRC superclade has expanded over 100 million years ago (Mya) from an NLR pair that diversified to up to one-half of the NLRs of asterid plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). How this diversification has impacted the biochemical activities of the NRC-S compared to their NRC-H mates is poorly understood. For example, it’s unclear how the ZAR1 conceptual framework applies to more complex NLR configurations such as the NRC network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>This paper originates from use of the in vitro Mu transposition system to generate a random truncation library and identify the minimal region required for CC-NLR-mediated cell death. We applied this method to NRC4—a CC-NLR helper of the NRC family that is genetically required by a multitude of NRC-S, such as the potato late blight resistance protein Rpi-blb2, to cause HR cell death and confer disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). This screen revealed that the N-terminal 29 amino acids of NRC4 are sufficient to induce cell death. Remarkably, this region is about 50% identical to the N-terminal ZAR1 α1 helix, which undergoes the conformational ‘death switch’ associated with the activation of the ZAR1 resistosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Computational analyses revealed that this region is defined by a motif, following the consensus MADAxVSFxVxKLxxLLxxEx, which we coined the ‘MADA motif’. This sequence is conserved not only in NRC4 and ZAR1 but also in ~20% of all CC-NLRs of dicot and monocot species. Motif swapping experiments revealed that the MADA motif is functionally conserved between NRC4 and ZAR1, as well as between NLRs from distantly related plant species. Interestingly, NRC-S lack N-terminal MADA sequences, which may have become non-functional over evolutionary time. We conclude that the evolutionarily constrained MADA motif is critical for the cell death inducing activity of CC domains from a significant fraction of plant NLR proteins, and that the ‘death switch’ mechanism defined for the ZAR1 resistosome is probably widely conserved across singleton and helper CC-NLRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mu mutagenesis of NRC4 reveals a short 29 amino acid N-terminal region that is sufficient for induction of HR cell death</title><p>The N-terminal CC domain of a subset of CC-NLR proteins can mediate self-association and trigger HR cell death when expressed on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentham et al., 2018</xref>). However, to date truncation experiments have been conducted based on educated guesses of domain boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maekawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cesari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wróblewski et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, one amino acid difference in the length of the assayed truncation can affect cell death inducing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casey et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we designed an unbiased truncation approach using bacteriophage Mu in vitro transposition system to randomly generate a C-terminal deletion library of the helper NLR NRC4. By using a custom-designed artificial transposon (Mu-STOP transposon) that carries staggered translation stop signals at Mu R-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poussu, 2005</xref>), we targeted the full-length coding sequence of the NRC4 autoactive mutant, NRC4<sup>D478V</sup>, (referred to from here on as NRC4<sup>DV</sup>). We generated a total of 65 truncated NRC4<sup>DV</sup>::Mu-STOP variants and expressed these mutants in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves using agroinfiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, only a single truncate carrying the N-terminal 29 amino acids triggered visible cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

MEME revealed several conserved sequence patterns in each of the four largest tribes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Within Tribe 2, a motif that is conserved at the N terminus of 87 of 102 proteins overlapped with the N-terminal 29 amino acids of NRC4 we identified as sufficient to cause cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, the conserved sequence pattern of this very N-terminal motif matched the ZAR1 α1 helix that undergoes a conformational switch during activation of the ZAR1 resistosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Future analyses will determine whether MADA-CC-NLRs are generally more evolutionarily constrained than non-MADA containing NLRs.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Evolution of NLRs from singletons to networks.</title><p>We propose that the N-terminal MADA motif/α1 helix has emerged early in the evolution of CC-NLRs and has remained constrained throughout time as singletons evolved from multifunctional proteins into specialized paired and networked NLR helpers. In contrast, the MADA motif/α1 helix has degenerated in sensor CC-NLRs as they rely on their NLR helper mates for executing the immune response (‘use-it-or-lose-it’ model of evolution). In addition, some sensor NLRs, such as a large subset of NRC-S proteins, have acquired N-terminal domains (NTDs)—prior to their CC domains—that function in pathogen detection. Such NTDs would preclude a free N-terminal α1 helix, which would be incompatible with the current model of ZAR1 resistosome activation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49956-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition, about half of the NRC-S proteins have acquired N-terminal extensions (N-terminal domains) before their CC domain, which would preclude a free N-terminal α1 helix essential for a ZAR1 type ‘death switch’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In fact, the N-terminal domains of Prf and Sw5b function as baits that sense pathogen effectors, suggesting functional analogy to integrated effector detection motifs found in some NLRs, and are not known to be involved in executing the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, we hypothesize that the CC domains of these and other sensor NLRs have extensively diversified over evolutionary time and are losing the capacity to function as HR cell death executors. This could be a consequence of relaxed selection given that these proteins rely on their MADA-CC-NLR partners to execute the immune response as discussed above. Additional structure-function experiments will be needed to determine the extent to which this ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ evolutionary model applies to the sensor sub-class of NLR immune receptors.</p><p>Understanding the precise nature of the N-terminal sequences that can functionally replace the α1 helix requires further investigation. In the MADA motif swap experiments, we found one exception to the correlation between MADA predictions and functional complementation of NRC4. The N-terminal sequence of the NRC-S NLR Rx, which was negative in the MADA HMMER searches, complemented the cell death activity of NRC4 MADA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nonetheless, previously the NB domain of Rx was reported to be capable of triggering cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rairdan et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the CC domain of Rx is dispensable for activation of HR. Therefore, in our ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ model, the N-termini of some NRC-S may not have fully degenerated into non-functional sequences and may have residual ability to functionally complement MADA. In the future, it would be fascinating to determine resistosome configurations of NLR sensor and helper hetero-complexes. As discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jubic et al., 2019</xref>), one hypothesis is that sensor NLRs associate with the resistosome as functional equivalents of RLCKs in the ZAR1 resistosome. Another is that sensor NLRs form one of the wheel spokes in a hetero-oligomeric resistosome as in the mammalian NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tenthorey et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that in this configuration, the N-terminus of a sensor NLR such as Rx remains evolutionarily constrained in terms of length and sequence composition. Future structural analyses of NLR sensor/helper heterocomplexes are needed to address these questions.</p><p>Already, our evolutionary model appears to be consistent with some paired NLR configurations in addition to the NRC-H/NRC-S network. One example is rice Pik-1 and Pik-2, which are a well-established NLR pair that detects the AVRPik effector of the rice blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Białas et al., 2018</xref>). AVRPik binding to the integrated heavy metal associated (HMA) domain of Pik-1 results in HR cell death and blast fungus resistance only in the presence of its helper Pik-2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>). In our computational analyses only Pik-2 was detected to carry an N-terminal MADA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, HMM score = 10.4) even though the CC domains of both proteins grouped into Tribe 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The Pik-2 MADA motif could substitute for the N-terminus of NRC4 in our cell death assays despite having six additional amino-acids at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These results are consistent with our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> model and imply that the helper NLR Pik-2 may execute HR cell death via its N-terminal MADA motif whereas its paired sensor NLR Pik-1 does not have the capacity to carry this activity on its own.</p><p>In addition to ZAR1, RPP8 is another Arabidopsis MADA-CC-NLR with high similarity to the N-terminus of NRC4 with nine invariant amino acids out of 17 (53%; HMMER score = 30.8). This RPP8 MADA motif could substitute for the N-terminus of NRC4 indicating that it is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In Arabidopsis, RPP8 (AT5G43470) and its paralogs occur at dynamic genetic loci that exhibit frequent sequence exchanges as deduced from comparative genomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuang et al., 2008</xref>). Four of the five RPP8 paralogs in the Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 were deemed to have a MADA motif based on our HMMER searches, whereas a fifth paralog LOV1 (AT1G10920) was negative and did not complement NRC4 autoactivity in the MADA motif swap experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). LOV1 confers sensitivity to the victorin effector produced by the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Cochliobolus victoriae</italic> by binding the defense-associated thioredoxin TRX-h5 when it is complexed with victorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lorang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, LOV1 binds TRX-h5 via its CC domain indicating that this region has evolved a pathogen sensor activity in this NLR protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lorang et al., 2012</xref>). How the sensor activity of the CC domain of LOV1 relates to the absence of a detectable MADA motif and whether this protein relies on other MADA-CC-NLRs to execute the cell death response are unanswered questions that are raised by these observations.</p><p>In activated ZAR1 resistosome, a funnel-shaped structure formed by five α1 helices is thought to directly execute hypersensitive cell death by forming a toxin-like pore in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). To what extent do activated MADA-CC-NLRs function according to this ZAR1 model? Structure informed mutagenesis of ZAR1 revealed that F9, L10 and L14 on the outer surface of the funnel-shaped structure are required for immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Here, our Ala and Glu scans of the MADA motif revealed that the NRC4 L9, L13 and L17 residues are essential for HR cell death activity. All three residues mapped to the outer surface of NRC4 α1 helices as predicted from a homology model based on the ZAR1 resistosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also found that mutations that perturb the MADA motif and prevent YFP self-association impair the capacity of NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP to cause cell death and form puncta in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our current interpretation of these results is that NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP forms high-order complexes to cause cell death. However, direct support for this hypothesis is still missing. In addition, we lack detailed analyses of the cellular dynamics of the NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP puncta and the degree to which they associate with membrane compartments in living plant cells. In the future, further biochemical, structural and cellular analyses are needed to determine the precise nature of the broadly conserved MADA motif and address the extent to which the ZAR1 ‘death switch’ model occurs in CC-NLRs.</p><p>As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al. (2019b)</xref>, the interior space of the funnel structure is also important because the ZAR1 double mutant E11A/E18A is impaired in cell death and disease resistance activities. However, in our Glu mutant scan, we failed to observe a reduction in HR cell death activities with single site mutants in these residues or other amino acids that are predicted to line up the interior space of the funnel-shaped structure. Whether or not this reflects genuine biological differences between ZAR1 and NRC4 remains to be studied.</p><p>A subset of CC-NLRs of the RPW8/HR family of atypical resistance proteins have a distinct type of coiled-coil domain known as CC<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barragan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019b</xref>). We failed to detect any MADA type sequences in these CC<sub>R</sub>-NLR proteins. Indeed, the CC<sub>R</sub> domain has similarity to mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) proteins and fungal HeLo/HELL domains, which form multi-helix bundles and act as membrane pore forming toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barragan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahdi et al., 2019</xref>). Whether the CC<sub>R</sub> domains function as a distinct cell death inducing system in plants compared to MADA-CC-NLRs remains to be determined. Interestingly, Arabidopsis HR4, a CC<sub>R</sub> containing protein, interacts in an allele-specific manner with the genetically unlinked CC-NLR RPP7b to trigger autoimmunity in the absence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barragan et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al. (2019b)</xref> showed that RPP7b forms higher-order complexes of six to seven subunits only when activated by the matching autoimmune HR4<sup>Fei-0</sup> protein in a biochemical process reminiscent of activated ZAR1 resistosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). In our HMMER searches, RPP7b and its four Arabidopsis paralogs were all classed as carrying the MADA motif. Thus, findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al. (2019b)</xref> directly link a MADA-CC-NLR to the formation of resistosome type structures consistent with our view that the ZAR1 model widely applies to other NLRs with the MADA α1 helix. It will be fascinating to determine whether or not RPP7b and HR4 are both capable of executing cell death, especially as two-component systems of NLR and HeLo/HELL proteins are common in fungi and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barragan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Plant NLRs can be functionally categorized into singleton, sensor or helper NLRs based on their biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2019a</xref>). However, it remains challenging to predict NLR functions from the wealth of unclassified NLRomes that are emerging from plant genome sequences. It has not escaped our attention that the discovery of the MADA motif as a signature of NLR singletons and helpers—but missing in sensor NLRs—enables the development of computational pipelines for predicting NLR networks from naïve plant genomes. Such in silico predictions can be tested by co-expression of paired NLRs in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. In addition, MADA motif predictions can be validated using our straightforward functional assay of swapping the NRC4 N-terminus, with the readouts consisting of both HR cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and resistance to <italic>P. infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Dissecting the NLR network architecture of plant species is not only useful for basic mechanistic studies but has also direct implications for breeding disease resistance into crop plants and reducing the autoimmune load of NLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chae et al., 2016</xref>;

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Plant NLR proteins are immune receptors that activate defenses upon recognition of pathogen proteins. We have recently learned that in the coiled-coil NLR (CC-NLR) protein ZAR1 upon activation the N terminal segment forms a what appears to be a pore that can make holes into the plasma membrane, thereby triggering both cell death and immune responses.</p><p>Whether this finding applies to other NLRs remains unknown. The current study shows that a surprisingly large number of plant NLRs share a similar N terminal motif as found in ZAR1. This motif, termed MADA motif, primarily is found in CC-NLRs that execute defense signaling, but seems to be degenerated in CC-NLRs that solely function in sensing pathogens. The authors further show that this motif is functional and interchangeable between ZAR1 and other NLRs. Although some of the details still need to be investigated further, these findings already in the current state significantly advance our understanding of this class of plant immune receptors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An N-terminal motif in NLR immune receptors is functionally conserved across distantly related plant species&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jian-Min Zhou as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Transposon-mutagenesis combined with YFP-fusion experiments suggested that a minimal of 29 amino acids from the N terminus of NRC4, a CC-NLR, can trigger cell death when overexpressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants. Extensive bioinformatics analyses identified a conserved motif, dubbed MADA motif, in the very N terminus of ~20% CC-NLRs. Interestingly, the MADA motif is harbored by the N-terminal α-helix of ZAR1, which has been shown to act as a molecular switch in triggering cell death and immunity. Site-directed mutagenesis and motif-swapping experiments nicely supported exchangeability of MADA motif among different CC-NLRs. Together, the authors provide evidence that the N-terminal switch model may generally apply to a large number of CC-NLRs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In ZAR1, the MADA motif corresponds to the N-terminal helix that rearranges upon oligomer formation into the part of the funnel that protrudes away from the rest of the pentamer, has a very hydrophobic exterior and was proposed to interact with the membrane. It is not explained how a 29 amino acid peptide could function by itself. It is also difficult to imagine a fusion to GFP could lead to a pentameric configuration. This concern should be addressed prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Does the 29 amino acid peptide or intact NRC4 protein (activated form) oligomerize? Do they associate with plasma membrane? Any mechanistic data would help greatly.</p><p>2) Non-MADA motifs, such as ones from tribes 1, 3, and 4, should be included in the motif-swapping experiment. Maybe MADA motif is not special?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An N-terminal motif in NLR immune receptors is functionally conserved across distantly related plant species&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Thus, we hypothesized that YFP promotes oligomer formation of the NRC4 29 amino acid peptide. To test this hypothesis, we mutated YFP alanine 206 to lysine. This is a common mutation reducing YFP homo-affinity, and is often called “monomeric mutation” (Zacharias et al., 2002). Consistent with our hypothesis, the A206K mutation compromised cell death triggered by NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have also performed experiments to get clues to the second question ‘Do they associate with plasma membrane?’. We observed subcellular localization of NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and found that the NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP fluorescence forms puncta in the cytoplasm associated with lower accumulation in the nucleus (Figure 9). Interestingly, some of the puncta were probably at the plasma membrane (Figure 9). We still do not know what are these NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP puncta, but the MADA and YFP A206K mutations reduced puncta formation (Figure 9). These results indicate that both intact MADA motif and YFP are required for the formation of puncta, which might be associated with the membrane. Consistent with this view, we have also confirmed that MADA mutations suppress NRC4<sub>1-29</sub>-YFP cell death (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We believe that these results are consistent with the current resistosome model and provide a useful platform for future NLR research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Non-MADA motifs, such as ones from tribes 1, 3, and 4, should be included in the motif-swapping experiment. Maybe MADA motif is not special?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this request and we now include additional swapping experiments. We swapped the N-termini of Rx, Bs2 and LOV1 into NRC4 autoactive mutant background. LOV1, Bs2 and Rx N-terminal domains belonged to N-terminal tribes 2, 11, and 25, respectively, and they were not detected as MADA-NLRs in our HMMER analysis. Rx and Bs2 are NRC-dependent sensor NLR, whereas LOV1 is the only non-MADA-NLR in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RPP8 gene cluster (mentioned in the Discussion). Bs2<sub>1-17</sub> and LOV1<sub>1-25</sub> sequences could not confer cell death activity to NRC4 autoactive mutant (Figure 10), however, Rx<sub>1-17</sub> did. We have confirmed that the phenotypes are not due to differences in protein accumulation. We included the results and discussed their implications in the Discussion section. We conclude that NLR-sensors may have varying levels of MADA N-termini degeneration.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The introduction of a mutation in the YFP protein that prevents its self-association abrogated the observed activities of the MADA motif.

We think that addressing in details the subcellular translocation in living cells requires more detailed analyses and is beyond the scope of the main finding of this manuscript. We stated the unanswered question as a future perspective in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that Rx (residues 1-17) confers cell death activity, although it does not contain a MADA motif, challenges the proposed division between sensor NLRs and helper NLRs.

In addition, we included this text to the paragraph:</p><p>“In the future, it would be fascinating to determine resistosome configurations of NLR sensor and helper hetero-complexes. As discussed elsewhere (Adachi et al., 2019a; Dangl review), one hypothesis is that sensor NLRs associate with the resistosome as functional equivalents of RLCKs in the ZAR1 resistosome. […] Future structural analyses of NLR sensor/helper heterocomplexes are needed to address these questions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
