We used larval zebrafish to identify a population of pretectal neurons that control hunting. By combining calcium imaging with a virtual hunting assay, we identified a discrete pretectal region that is selectively active when animals initiate hunting. Targeted genetic labelling allowed us to examine the function and morphology of individual cells and identify two classes of pretectal neuron that project to ipsilateral optic tectum or the contralateral tegmentum. Optogenetic stimulation of single neurons of either class was able to induce sustained hunting sequences, in the absence of prey. Furthermore, laser ablation of these neurons impaired prey-catching and prevented induction of hunting by optogenetic stimulation of the anterior-ventral tectum. We propose that this specific population of pretectal neurons functions as a command system to induce predatory behaviour.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48114.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hunting is an innate behaviour that relies on predators executing a precise set of actions to identify, approach, target, and strike prey. In vertebrates (animals with a backbone), the identity of the brain circuits that trigger hunting is still unclear. These networks are thought to link sensory perception (seeing prey) with a specialised action (starting an attack).</p><p>Larval zebrafish are a good model in which to study these circuits, because they have a tiny, transparent brain where neurons can be observed in real time. In addition, it is expected that the networks that control hunting in this species will be preserved across other vertebrates.</p><p>To discover these networks, Antinucci et al. genetically engineered zebrafish larvae so that their brain cells would ‘glow’ when they became active. This revealed which individual brain cells would turn on when zebrafish started to hunt. These neurons were in a part of the brain called the pretectum, which receives visual information about prey from the eye.</p><p>Next, Antinucci et al. harnessed a technique called optogenetics to artificially turn on these brain cells in the pretectum, which caused the fish to start hunting even when prey was absent. In fact, stimulating just one pretectal cell was enough to trigger the behaviour. Conversely, killing pretectal brain cells using precise laser surgery hindered hunting in zebrafish exposed to prey.</p><p>These experiments suggest that pretectal brain cells act like a command centre that controls hunting. They likely play a decision-making role, determining when animals do and do not respond to events in their surroundings. Similar neurons likely control other types of behaviour. Understanding how these circuits work at the cellular level in zebrafish may help scientist study them in other organisms, such as humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>predation</kwd><kwd>command system</kwd><kwd>pretectum</kwd><kwd>optic tectum</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor processing</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, 101195/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bianco</surname><given-names>Isaac H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship, 204708/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antinucci</surname><given-names>Paride</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bianco</surname><given-names>Isaac H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, 101195/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bianco</surname><given-names>Isaac H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A discrete population of genetically accessible pretectal neurons controls visually guided hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In response to sensory information and internal states, animals select specific actions from a repertoire of options and produce adaptive behavioural programmes. Neuroethological studies in a variety of species have pinpointed brain regions, and identified neurons, that specifically promote particular behaviours ranging from the courtship songs of fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) to parental behaviours of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). Identifying the neural circuits that control specific behaviours, as well as modulatory systems that influence if and how behaviours are performed, will shed light on the neural mechanisms of decision making, action selection and motor sequence generation.</p><p>Prey catching is an innate, complex behaviour that is crucial for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sillar et al., 2016</xref>). In various species, hunting responses can be evoked by prey-like stimuli, defined by specific conjunctions of sensory features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ewert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anjum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>), and predatory behaviour is modulated by internal state variables including associative learning and feeding drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ewert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jordi et al., 2015</xref>). Several brain regions show activity during hunting and are expected to subserve neural functions including prey detection and localisation, control of pursuit, capture and consummatory actions, and motivation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comoli et al., 2005</xref>). Although electrical stimulation of brain regions, including the optic tectum, can evoke hunting actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewert, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bels et al., 2012</xref>) and recent studies in rodents have identified circuits that motivate predatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2018</xref>), premotor circuits that directly control vertebrate hunting have yet to be identified.</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify neurons that control predatory behaviour, using larval zebrafish as a vertebrate model system. In larval zebrafish, hunting is an innate, visually guided behaviour, which involves a sequence of specialised oculomotor and locomotor actions. A defining characteristic is that larvae initiate hunting by rapidly converging their eyes, which substantially increases their binocular visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>). A high vergence angle is maintained during prey pursuit, which entails a sequence of discrete orienting turns and approach swims, which culminate in binocular fixation of prey followed by a kinematically distinct capture swim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McElligott and O'malley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marques et al., 2018</xref>). Neural activity associated with prey-like visual cues has been detected in the axon terminals of a specific class of retinal ganglion cell (RGC), which terminate in retinal arborisation field 7 (AF7) in the pretectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>). Prey-responsive pretectal cells have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muto et al., 2017</xref>) as well as highly prey-selective feature-analysing neurons in the optic tectum (OT) that display non-linear mixed selectivity for conjunctions of visual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). Premotor activity in localised tectal assemblies immediately precedes execution of hunting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>) and optogenetic stimulation of the anterior-ventral tectal region can induce hunting-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fajardo et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, ablation of RGC input to either AF7 or OT substantially impairs hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Based on this evidence, we hypothesised that neural circuits controlling the induction of hunting might be located in the vicinity of AF7 or OT. Our experimental requirements for identifying such neurons were (1) that they display neural activity specifically related to execution of hunting behaviour, rather than visual detection of prey, and (2) that direct stimulation of such neurons would induce naturalistic predatory behaviour in the absence of prey. First, we used 2-photon calcium imaging paired with a virtual hunting assay and identified a high density of neurons in the AF7-pretectal region that were specifically recruited when larvae initiated hunting behaviour. We identified a transgenic line that labelled these neurons and found two morphological classes: One projects ipsilaterally to the optic tectum and the second extends long-range projections to midbrain oculomotor nuclei, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the contralateral hindbrain tegmentum. Remarkably, optogenetic stimulation of single pretectal neurons evoked hunting-like behaviour in the absence of prey. Pretectal projection neurons of either class could evoke hunting routines with naturalistic oculomotor and locomotor kinematics but opposite directional biases. Finally, laser-ablation of the pretectal population impaired hunting of live prey and prevented induction of hunting by optogenetic stimulation of the rostral tectum. In sum, we propose that this specific population of pretectal neurons functions downstream of prey perception to directly control execution of predatory behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neural activity associated with hunting initiation</title><p>To identify and distinguish neurons with activity related to prey perception and initiation of hunting behaviour, we performed 2-photon calcium imaging while larval zebrafish engaged in a virtual hunting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>).

Each VMV described (a) mean GCaMP fluorescence responses to each of the ten visual cues during non-response trials, in which larvae did not release hunting behaviour, and (b) coefficients from multilinear regression of fluorescent timeseries data on a set of motor predictors (derived from eye and tail kinematics; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Three motor predictors indicated convergent saccades associated with leftwards, rightwards or symmetrical/no tail movements (labelled ‘<italic>Conv tail L</italic>’, ‘<italic>Conv tail R</italic>’ and ‘<italic>Conv tail sym</italic>’, respectively). Next, we used an unsupervised clustering procedure to identify consistent sensorimotor tuning profiles. A correlation-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm performed initial clustering of VMVs from cells with either high visually evoked activity or that were well modelled in terms of motor variables (comprising ~10% of neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and Materials and methods). The centroids of the resultant cluster ‘seeds’ defined a set of functional archetypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and subsequently, all remaining neurons were assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid within a threshold distance limit (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.7, VMVs below threshold remained unassigned). This approach allowed us to classify more than 50% of imaged neurons (93,054 out of 181,123 cells) into 36 clusters with homogenous functional properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>).</p><p>This analysis identified neurons that were recruited during hunting initiation. Specifically, four clusters showed activity highly correlated with eye convergence events (clusters 25–28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) yet exhibited little activity in response to visual cues (including prey-like moving spots; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In two of these clusters, activity was selective for the direction of motor responses. Thus, cluster 26 was selective for convergent saccades associated with leftwards turns and cluster 28 was tuned to rightwards hunting responses. By contrast, the other two clusters did not show selectivity for the direction of tail movements during hunting initiation (cluster 25, associated with symmetrical/no tail movement and 27, responsive to motion in either direction). Other functional clusters comprised visually responsive neurons that were selectively activated by small prey-like moving spots (‘prey-responsive’ clusters 1–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but displayed little motor-related activity.</p><p>We computed a ‘hunting index’ (HIx) for individual neurons as a direct means to distinguish neural activity associated with hunting initiation from ‘sensory’ activity evoked by prey-like visual stimuli. Briefly, for each hunting response, GCaMP fluorescence in a time window (±1 s) surrounding the convergent saccade was compared to activity at the same time in non-response trials during which the same visual stimulus was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, top). The mean of these difference measures across all response events represents the HIx score for the cell and quantifies neural activity attributable to hunting initiation while accounting for any visually evoked response. To account for directional tuning, we separately computed HIx for hunting responses paired with leftwards, rightwards or symmetrical/no tail movements. This analysis revealed that neurons in clusters 25–28 showed considerably higher HIx scores than other cells, including those in prey-responsive clusters (1 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Tail directional preferences were consistent with those determined by regression modelling.</p><p>Overall, our functional analyses identified four clusters of neurons with activity specifically associated with the specialised motor outputs that characterise initiation of hunting behaviour and showed little activity in response to prey-like visual cues. Thus, we will refer to these as ‘hunting-initiation’ clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pretectal neurons are recruited during hunting initiation</title><p>A high density of neurons in hunting-initiation clusters were located in the pretectum.

Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></caption></media><p>Strikingly, we found that optogenetic stimulation of individual <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons could induce sustained, hunting-like behavioural routines. As in naturalistic hunting, optogenetically induced hunting routines comprised a sequence of swim bouts that coincided with a sustained period of elevated ocular vergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). These sequences were initiated by a convergent saccade accompanied by a lateralised swim bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in several cases terminated with a bout resembling a capture swim and paired with jaw opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). The fraction of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons that induced hunting (32%, 23 out of 70 cells) was similar to the proportion that were assigned to hunting-initiation clusters (28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hunting-like responses were entirely dependent on blue light stimulation. For responsive fish, we observed 18.1% median response probability in LED-On trials vs. 0% in LED-Off trials (p&lt;0.0001, N = 23 fish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, control experiments demonstrated that opsin-negative animals do not produce hunting behaviours in response to blue light stimulation alone (0/16 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). By examining single-cell morphology, we found that the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells that could evoke hunting behaviour belonged to the projection classes that innervated the ipsilateral optic tectum (9/23 cells, hereafter abbreviated ‘ipsi-projecting’) or that belong to the presumptive APN and connect to the contralateral tegmentum (14/23 cells, ‘contra-projecting’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>).</p><p>How closely do the hunting-like routines induced by optogenetic stimulation of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons compare to hunting behaviour? To address this question, we compared a variety of oculomotor and locomotor kinematics between optogenetically induced hunting routines versus hunting of live <italic>Paramecia</italic>. The duration of hunting sequences, defined by the period of elevated ocular vergence, as well as vergence angles, were equivalent between natural and optogenetically evoked behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). In 100% of optogenetically-evoked hunting routines, a lateralised swim bout immediately followed saccadic convergence with short latency, comparable to natural hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). We analysed several kinematic features of these initiating bouts, which resemble ‘J-turns’, focussing on features that distinguish hunting swims from spontaneous exploratory behaviour. This revealed a high degree of kinematic similarity between natural hunting bouts and optogenetically induced hunting bouts. In both cases, bouts comprised a highly lateralised sequence of half-beats (‘bout asymmetry’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, see Materials and methods for details), a large fraction of curvature was localised to the distal segments of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) and bouts displayed low tail beat frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). Notably, all such parameters were significantly different as compared to spontaneous swims. Optogenetically induced hunting bouts showed a reduction in average vigour and theta-1 angles (maximum tail angle during the first half beat) compared to bouts during <italic>Paramecia</italic> hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O,P</xref>). However, the latter displayed a bimodal distribution of theta-1 and optogenetically induced hunting bouts overlapped with the lower amplitude component of this distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>, bottom). In sum, our data indicate that optogenetic stimulation of single <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons can induce naturalistic hunting-like behaviour.</p><p>Next, we compared hunting routines induced by optogenetic activation of ipsi- versus contra-projecting <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons. We did not observe differences in response latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>), duration of evoked hunting sequences or number of swim bouts they contained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) or oculomotor kinematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). A similar fraction (~40%) of both types of pretectal neuron could drive hunting sequences that terminated with capture swims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). However, the laterality of evoked hunting responses differed between the two projection classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R,S</xref>): Stimulation of ipsi-projecting <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons most frequently induced hunting in which the first swim bout was oriented in the ipsilateral direction (<italic>i.e.</italic> a left pretectal neuron evoked leftward turning). By contrast, contra-projecting neurons most frequently induced contralaterally directed hunting responses.</p><p>To directly establish whether the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons that can induce predatory behaviour are the same cells that are recruited during visually evoked hunting, we combined optogenetic stimulation and functional calcium imaging of single neurons. To achieve this, we first established that optogenetic stimulation of a given <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neuron could induce hunting and then tethered the larva in agarose and performed calcium imaging of H2B-GCaMP6s, expressed in the nucleus of the same neuron, while the animal engaged in the virtual hunting assay. Visuomotor fingerprinting and cluster assignment of these neurons showed that they all belonged to hunting-initiation clusters (clusters 25–27) and had high HIx scores (N = 6 cells from six fish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Optogenetic activation of multiple <italic>KalTA4u508-</italic>expressing pretectal neurons induces short-latency hunting responses</title><p>Optogenetic stimulation of single <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons induced hunting routines with relatively low response probability (~20%) and long latency (~4 s). We investigated if response rates might be increased by stimulating a larger number of pretectal neurons or increasing light intensity.</p><p>First, we optogenetically stimulated single <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons at a range of irradiance levels (0.44–2.55 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 459 nm).

In one of the two blind larvae in which we could optogenetically evoke hunting, response rate was positively modulated by irradiance but mean response latency did not fall below 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). Although preliminary, this suggests that single pretectal cells may not be able to recruit downstream motor pattern generator circuits to execute hunting programmes with short latency.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of multiple <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons reliably evoked hunting behaviour at short latency. We showed this by using patterned illumination to focally activate the AF7-pretectal region in tethered <italic>KalTA4u508;UAS:CoChR-tdTomato</italic> transgenic larvae (7 dpf, 4 s LED-On periods, 470 nm, 21.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). We unilaterally stimulated the population of transgenically labelled neurons in the AF7-pretectal region and observed convergent saccades paired with lateralised tail movements with high response probability (55.43 ± 35.26%, mean ± SD, N = 7 larvae) and short latency (82.87 ± 5.46 ms, mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Every convergent saccade was associated with tail movement, which tended to be directed contralateral to the stimulated pretectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>) similar to activation of single contra-projecting <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells.

Optogenetic activation of single <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal cells could release predatory behaviour in the absence of prey, and ablation of these cells impaired both natural hunting as well as hunting-like behaviour evoked by avOT stimulation. Based on functional and anatomical data, we propose that <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal cells function as a command system linking visual perception of prey-like stimuli to activation of tegmental pattern generating circuits that coordinate specialised hunting motor programmes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Do AF7-pretectal neurons comprise a command system controlling predation?</title><p>We suggest that <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons satisfy the criteria for a command system for induction of predatory behaviour. A command neuron has been defined as ‘a neuron that is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation of a given behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kupfermann and Weiss, 1978</xref>). Although a small number of striking examples of such cells have been identified in invertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frost and Katz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flood et al., 2013</xref>), it is recognised that the ‘necessity’ criterion is unlikely to be fulfilled in larger nervous systems where individual neurons display functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshihara and Yoshihara, 2018</xref>). Thus, command systems (sometimes referred to as decision neurons, command-like neurons or higher-order neurons) have been defined as interneurons that are active in association with a well-defined behaviour and whose activity can induce that behaviour, but without the strict necessity requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshihara and Yoshihara, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To what extent do <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons satisfy these criteria? First, we showed that these cells are recruited during naturalistic hunting. By comparing neural activity in response versus non-response trials we were able to disambiguate ‘sensory’ activity, evoked by prey-like visual cues, from activity specifically associated with <italic>execution</italic> of hunting behaviour. We discovered that <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons, located close to AF7, display no detectable activity in response to prey-like stimuli but are reliably activated when larvae release convergent saccades at the commencement of hunting. This activity signature is compatible with a premotor role in directing predatory actions, as opposed to visual encoding of prey.</p><p>Strikingly, optogenetic stimulation of single <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons could evoke sustained hunting routines. As such, this is one of the first examples of a behavioural action sequence induced by activation of a single neuron in a vertebrate. Crucially, this induction occurred in the absence of any prey-like stimulus, supporting a role for these neurons in release of predatory behaviour downstream of perceptual recognition of prey. Optogenetic stimulation of single cells allowed us to test behaviour in freely swimming larvae and interrogate the roles of two distinct classes of AF7-pretectal cell. However, hunting was induced with surprisingly long average latency (~4 s) and in only ~20% of trials. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation directed at the entire transgenically labelled AF7-pretectal population reliably induced behaviour with very short latency,~80 ms. These findings are compatible with the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> population comprising a command <italic>system</italic> controlling hunting and suggest that during natural behaviour, presumed downstream pattern generating circuits are unlikely to be brought to threshold by the action of single pretectal neurons.</p><p>Ablations targeting <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons impaired, but did not eliminate, hunting. One contributing factor is likely to be that ablations were incomplete. We observed that 10% of labelled <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons survived ablation and due to variegation of transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akitake et al., 2011</xref>), this is probably a lower bound on the size of the surviving pretectal population. Notably, the observation that hunting can be evoked by stimulation of only a single neuron suggests few surviving cells could in principle suffice to release predatory behaviour. Although hunting evoked by stimulation of anterior-ventral OT was strongly diminished in <italic>KalTA4u508</italic>-ablated animals, we do not rule out the possibility that there might be redundant, distributed circuitry involved in hunting initiation.</p><p>Overall, our data support the conclusion that a discrete population of pretectal neurons comprises a command system controlling predatory hunting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neural circuitry controlling visually guided hunting</title><p>How might these pretectal neurons fit within a sensorimotor pathway controlling visually guided hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>)? Current evidence suggests visual recognition of prey is mediated by tectal and/or pretectal circuits. The axon terminals of zebrafish ‘projection class 2’ retinal ganglion cells in AF7 appear tuned to prey-like stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>) and a subpopulation of tectal neurons show non-linear mixed selectivity for conjunctions of visual features that best evoke predatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). In accordance with these findings, we observed prey-responsive neurons in tectum and AF7-pretectum which were activated by small moving spots regardless of whether or not the animal produced a hunting response. Ablations of either AF7 or tectal neuropil have been shown to substantially impair hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>), compatible with an important function for these retinorecipient regions in visual perception of prey.</p><p>Command systems are thought to sit at the sensorimotor ‘watershed’, linking sensory processing to activation of motor hierarchies. Our data support a circuit organisation where downstream of prey detection, the recruitment of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons might be the neural event that corresponds to the decision of the animal to initiate hunting. The dendritic arbours of these pretectal neurons lie in immediate apposition to RGC terminals in AF7, suggesting a biological interface for transforming visual sensory activity into premotor commands to release behaviour. Photoactivation data also suggests the AF7-pretectal region is closely interconnected with ipsilateral OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), providing a further route for visual prey detectors in OT to recruit a hunting response. Consistent with this, our ablation data indicate that induction of hunting by stimulation of anterior-ventral OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fajardo et al., 2013</xref>) requires <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons.</p><p>Two morphological classes of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neuron were able to induce predatory behaviour with similar efficacy and motor kinematics, but opposite directional biases. Both morphologies appear similar to neurons previously identified in the AF7 region by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack et al. (2014)</xref>. Contralaterally projecting neurons extended axon collaterals around the nMLF and oculomotor nuclei as well as in close apposition to reticulospinal neurons in the hindbrain. This projection pattern, as well as the identification of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons in adult brain sections, suggests these cells reside in the larval zebrafish APN. Their axonal projections provide a pathway for recruitment of tegmental motor pattern generators to produce the specialised eye and tail movements observed during hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McElligott and O'malley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marques et al., 2018</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of ipsilaterally projecting <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons evoked hunting routines in which the first orienting turn displayed an ipsilateral bias. It is possible that this arises from recruitment of tectal efferent pathways to the ipsilateral tegmentum, which have recently been suggested to mediate prey-directed orienting turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Whilst it is remarkable that stimulation of single pretectal neurons could induce hunting-like behaviour in the absence of prey, natural hunting is a precise orienting behaviour directed towards a (visual) target. Optogenetically induced hunting routines involved swim bouts where turn angle fell within the lower portion of the distribution measured during prey hunting. A probable explanation is that in the presence of prey, appropriate steering signals derive from OT to guide lateralised orienting turns. Compact tectal assemblies show premotor activity immediately preceding hunting initiation and are anatomically localised in relation to the directionality of hunting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, focal stimulation of the retinotopic tectal map has long been known to evoke goal-directed orienting responses including predatory manoeuvres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bels et al., 2012</xref>) and suppression of specific populations of neurons in superior colliculus (SC) impairs visual prey detection and accurate pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoy et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesise that pretectal activity releases predatory behaviour and operates in parallel with prey-directed steering signals, most likely from OT.</p><p>Command systems have been identified that evoke both discrete actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korn and Faber, 2005</xref>) as well as entire behavioural programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flood et al., 2013</xref>). Constant stimulation of pretectal <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons produces extended hunting sequences that commenced with saccadic eye convergence followed by serial execution of multiple swim bouts during which elevated ocular vergence – a hallmark of predatory behaviour – was maintained. In some cases, optogenetically induced hunting sequences even terminated in capture swims associated with jaw movements. This suggests that the function of pretectal activity is to induce the overall hunting programme and that individual component actions (<italic>i.e.</italic> discrete tracking swim bouts) are coordinated by downstream motor pattern generating circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Induction and modulation of predatory behaviour</title><p>In recent years, several studies in rodents have demonstrated that pathways converging on the periaqueductal grey (PAG) can potently modulate predatory behaviour. The central amygdala (CeA) displays activity changes during hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comoli et al., 2005</xref>) and optogenetic activation of the CeA→ventral PAG pathway motivates prey pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Stimulation of the medial preoptic area to vPAG pathway promotes acquisition/handling (grabbing, biting) of objects, including prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2018</xref>), and activation of a GABAergic projection from lateral hypothalamus to lateral/ventrolateral PAG motivates attack on prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In these studies, the presence of prey, or a prey-like stimulus, was required for neuronal stimulation to induce predatory behaviour. This suggests these pathways promote hunting by potentiating visuomotor activity, rather than directly inducing release of motor programmes downstream of sensory perception. Recently, a glutamatergic pathway from SC to the subthalamic zona incerta (ZI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shang et al., 2019</xref>) and a GABAergic pathway from medial ZI to PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) have been shown to respond to prey-like sensory cues and promote hunting when optogenetically stimulated. However, optogenetic stimulation evokes limited expression of a subset of hunting-related behaviour in the absence of prey. The ZI→PAG pathway appears to integrate multiple visual, vibrissal and auditory prey-related sensory signals, discriminate prey from non-prey objects, and generate a positive valence signal to motivate predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Comparing and contrasting the properties of hunting-related circuits identified in different vertebrates may prove a useful means to characterise the neural substrates involved in detecting and attending to prey, motivating hunting behaviour, and controlling and sustaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>) predatory action sequences.</p><p>Notably, neurons that control the release of behavioural programmes, such as the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal cells described here, represent key circuit loci at which sensory information might be integrated with internal state signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flood et al., 2013</xref>). In the context of vertebrate hunting, it will be important to elucidate the circuit mechanisms that modulate recruitment probability of such decision-making circuits, enabling animals to vary the expression of predatory behaviour in accordance with internal physiological states, experience, and competing behavioural demands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(KalTA4u508) u508Tg</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Transgene</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(UAS:jGCaMP7f)u341Tg</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Transgene</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(UAS:CoChR-tdTomato)u332Tg</td><td>This study</td><td>ZFIN ID: <break/>ZDB-ALT-190226–4</td><td>Transgene</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s)jf5Tg</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068735">25068735</ext-link></td><td>ZFIN ID: <break/>ZDB-ALT-141023–2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vladimirov et al., 2014</xref></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(atoh7:gapRFP) cu2Tg</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17147778">17147778</ext-link></td><td>ZFIN ID: <break/>ZDB-ALT-070129–2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(UAS:GCaMP6f, cryaa:mCherry)icm06Tg</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28623664">28623664</ext-link></td><td>ZFIN ID: <break/>ZDB-ALT-160119–5</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knafo et al.

Regressors were generated for oculomotor and locomotor variables (7 eye and 3 tail kinematics, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) by convolving time-series vectors for the relevant kinematic with a calcium impulse response function [CIRF, approximated as the sum of a fast-rising exponential, tau 20 ms, and a slow-decaying exponential, tau 420 ms for GCaMP6f and jGCaMP7f or 3 s for H2B-GCaMP6s; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miri et al., 2011</xref>). To account for delays between neural activity and behaviour and/or indicator dynamics, we time-shifted the regressor matrix relative to the fluorescent response variable so as to minimise the residual squared error of an ordinary least squares regression model. We used elastic-net regularised regression to improve interpretability and prediction accuracy in the presence of multicollinearity between the regressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zou and Hastie, 2005</xref>). Elastic net models were fit using the ‘glmnet’ package for MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qian et al., 2013</xref>) and hyperparameters controlling the ratio of L1 vs. L2 penalty (alpha) and the degree of regularisation (lambda) were selected to minimise ten-fold cross-validated squared error.

VMVs from all imaged neurons were assembled into a matrix and each component was normalised across cells by dividing each column by its standard deviation.</p><p>VMV clustering was performed using a two-step procedure. First, we performed hierarchical agglomerative clustering of VMVs using a correlation distance metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). For this first step, we selected only neurons that either exhibited strong visual responses (specifically, the maximum value of components 1–10 had to be within the top 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of such values across all neurons) or was well modelled in terms of behavioural kinematics (R<sup>2</sup> had to be within the top 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> across all neurons). The centroids of the ‘seed’ clusters generated in this step (correlation threshold, 0.7) constituted a set of archetypal response profiles. Next, the VMVs of the remaining neurons were assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid (within a correlation distance threshold of 0.7) to produce the final clusters.</p><p>To assign cluster identities to <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5T</xref>), VMVs were generated as described above and the same assignment strategy and correlation distance threshold (0.7) were used.

Brains were manually dissected with forceps prior to immunostaning. First, dissected brains were permeabilised by incubation in proteinase-K (40 µg/ml) in PBS with 1% Triton-X100 (PBT, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. This was followed by 3 × 5 min washes in PBT, 20 min fixation in 4% PFA at room temperature and 3 × 5 min washes in PBT. Second, brains were incubated in block solution (2% goat serum, 1% DMSO, 1% BSA in PBT, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hr. Subsequently, brains were incubated in block solution containing primary antibodies overnight, followed by 6 × 1 hr washes in PBT on a slowly rotating shaker. Third, brains were incubated in block solution containing secondary antibodies overnight, followed by 6 × 1 hr washes in PBT. Finally, PBT was rinsed out by doing washes in PBS and brains were stored at 4°C. Imaging was performed using the two-photon microscope described above at 790 nm. Primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-GFP (AMS Biotechnology, TP401, dilution 1:1000) and mouse anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, 9102, p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), dilution 1:500).

Brains were then carefully dissected under a stereomicroscope and transferred to saline phosphate buffer (PBS), where they were maintained for at least half an hour. Two different procedures were used for sectioning the brains. For cryostat sectioning, brains were cryopreserved, embedded in Tissue Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and frozen using liquid nitrogen cooled methylbutane. Transverse sections of the brain (12 µm thick) were obtained using a cryostat and collected in gelatine-coated slides. For vibratome sectioning, brains were first embedded into 3% agarose in PBS. Transverse sections of the brains (100 µm thick) were obtained using a vibratome and transferred to PBS in microtubes. Immunostaining was performed by either adding solutions onto the cryostat sections or changing the solutions inside the microtubes. Sections were incubated first in normal goat serum (Sigma, dilution 1:10) in PBS with 0.5% Triton for 1 hr at room temperature, and then with a cocktail of two primary antibodies (rat anti-GFP, Nacalai Tesque, 04404–26, dilution 1:1000, and rabbit anti-RFP, MBL International, PM005, dilution 1:1000) for 24 hr at room temperature. Next, after three washes in PBS, brain sections were incubated with a cocktail of two secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat Alexa 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11006, dilution 1:500, and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11011, dilution 1:500) for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS, mounted with 50% glycerol in PBS and imaged using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 20 × 0.50 NA objective.

Then, we computed the local cell density at each soma location using an adaptive Gaussian-based kernel density estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breiman et al., 1977</xref>), with the bandwidth at each point constrained to be proportional to the <italic>k</italic>th nearest neighbour distance where:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula>and <italic>n</italic> is the number of neurons (N = 6,630 cells from 8 fish).

The same custom-built 2-photon microscope used for functional imaging was used to photo-activate PA-GFP in a small region (9 × 9 µm) containing cell bodies located in AF7-pretectum. The photo-activation site was selected by imaging the brain at 920 nm. Photo-activation was performed by continuously scanning at 790 nm (5 mW at sample) for 4 min. Larvae were then unmounted and allowed to recover. At 7 dpf, an image stack (1200 × 800 px, 0.38 µm/px, ∼200 µm z-extent) was acquired at 920 nm covering a large portion of the midbrain, tegmentum and hindbrain.

Images were acquired under 850 nm illumination using a high-speed camera [Mikrotron MC1362, 250 Hz (<italic>optogenetic stimulations</italic>) or 700 Hz (<italic>visuomotor behaviours assessment</italic>), 500 µs shutter-time] equipped with a machine vision lens (Fujinon HF35SA-1) and an 850 nm bandpass filter to block visible light. In all experiments, larvae were placed in the arena and allowed to acclimate for around 2 min before starting experiments.</p><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Optogenetic stimulations</title><p>Larvae were placed in a petri dish with a custom-made agarose well (28 mm diameter, 3 mm depth) filled with fish facility water. Blue light was delivered across the whole arena from above using a 470 nm LED (OSRAM Golden Dragon Plus, LB W5AM) or a 459 nm LED (OSRAM OSTAR Projection Power, LE B P2W). Irradiance (0.44–2.55 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was varied using constant current drive electronics with pulse-width modulation at 5 kHz. ‘LED-On’ trials included 7 s periods of continuous blue light illumination, interleaved with ‘no-stimulation’ trials in which no blue light was provided. Both LED-On and no-stimulation trials lasted 8 s. A minimum of 10 LED-On trials were acquired for each fish. LED and camera control were implemented using LabVIEW (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Assessment of visuomotor behaviours</title><p>Larvae were placed in a 35 mm petri dish filled with 3.5 ml of fish facility water. Visual stimuli were projected onto the arena from below using an AAXA P2 Jr Pico Projector via a cold mirror. Visual stimuli were designed using Psychophysics Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Looming stimuli expanded from 10 to 100° with L/V ratio of 255 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>). Optomotor gratings had a period of ∼10 mm and moved at one cycle/s. Optomotor gratings and looming spots were presented in egocentric coordinates such that directional gratings always moved 90° to left or right sides with respect to fish orientation and looming spots were centred 5 mm away from the body centroid and at 90° to left or right. Stimuli were presented in pseudo-random order with an inter-stimulus interval of minimum 60 s. Stimuli were only presented if the body centroid was within a predefined central region (11 mm from the edge of the arena). If this was not the case, a concentric grating was presented that moved towards the centre of the arena to attract the fish to the central region. At the beginning of each experiment, 60 <italic>Paramecia</italic> were added to arena. Each experiment typically lasted ~1 hr. Final <italic>Paramecia</italic> numbers were counted manually from full-frame video data from the final 10 s of each experiment and adjusted for consumption in 60 min [multiplying by 60/experiment duration (min)]. During experiments, eye and tail kinematics were tracked online as described below. Camera control, online tracking and stimulus presentation were implemented using LabVIEW (National Instruments) and MATLAB (MathWorks).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analyses of free-swimming behaviour</title><p>Data analysis was performed using LabVIEW (National Instruments) and MATLAB (MathWorks). Eye and tail kinematics were tracked offline for optogenetic experiments, and online for assessment of visuomotor behaviours with some differences. First, images were background-subtracted using a background model generated over 8 s in which the larva was moving (<italic>offline tracking</italic>), or a continuously updated background model (<italic>online tracking</italic>). Next, images were thresholded and the body centroid was found by running a particle detection routine for binary objects within suitable area limits. For online tracking, eye centroids were detected using a second threshold and particle detection procedure with the requirement that these centroids were in close proximity to the body centroid. For offline tracking, eye centroids were detected using a particle detection procedure that uses both binary and greyscale images to identify the two centroids within suitable area limits that had the lowest mean intensity values. For online tracking, body and eye orientations were computed using second- and third-order image moments. For offline tracking, body orientation was computed as the angle of the vector formed by the centre of mass of the body centroid (origin) and the midpoint between the eye centroids. Eye orientation was computed as the angle between the major axis of the eye and the body orientation vector. Vergence angle was computed as the difference between the left and right eye angles. The tail was tracked by performing consecutive annular line-scans, starting from the body centroid and progressing towards the tip of the tail so as to define nine equidistant x-y coordinates along the tail. Inter-segment angles were computed between the eight resulting segments. Reported tail curvature was computed as the sum of these inter-segment angles. Rightward bending of the tail is represented by positive angles and leftward bending by negative angles. To identify periods of high ocular vergence, which represent hunting routines, a vergence angle threshold was computed for each fish by fitting a two-term Gaussian model to its vergence angle distribution. A fish was considered to be hunting if vergence angle exceeded this vergence threshold. For experiments assessing visuomotor behaviours, the vergence angle distribution was invariably bimodal and the vergence threshold was computed as one standard deviation below the centre of the higher angle Gaussian. For optogenetic experiments, in cases where the vergence angle distribution was not bimodal, a fixed vergence threshold of 55° was used.</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Optogenetic experiments</title><p>Response probability was computed as the fraction of LED-On trials in which at least one hunting routine (<italic>i.e.</italic> period with ocular vergence above threshold) was detected during the 7 s stimulation period. Similarly, for no-stimulation trials, response probability is the fraction of trials in which at least one hunting-like routine was detected. Response latency for LED-On trials was calculated from light stimulus onset. Swim bouts were identified using velocity thresholds (800°/s for bout onset, 200°/s for bout offset) applied to smoothed absolute tail angular velocity traces. Tail beat frequency was computed as the reciprocal of the mean full-cycle period during a swim bout. Tail vigour is computed by integrating absolute tail angular velocity (smoothed with a 40 ms box-car filter) over the first 120 ms of a swim bout. Bout asymmetry measures the degree to which tail curvature during a bout shows the same laterality as that determined during the first half-beat. It is computed as the fraction of time points in which the sign of tail angle matches the direction of the first half beat. This metric is high for hunting related J-turns but close to zero for forward swims. For each bout, the fraction of total curvature localised to the distal third of the tail was computed for the first half beat. To identify capture swim-like movements during optogenetically evoked hunting routines, movies were individually inspected and the following criteria were used to classify a swim bout as capture swim: (1) small change in body orientation associated with (2) divergence of the eyes and (3) jaw movement/suction and/or (4) dorsiflexion of the body.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Assessment of visuomotor behaviours</title><p>Escape responses to loom stimuli were identified if the instantaneous speed of the body centroid exceeded 75 mm/s. An optomotor response gradient [OMR turn rate (°/s)] was calculated for each presentation as the total change in orientation during the stimulus presentation divided by the duration of the presentation [for leftwards OMR stimuli, the OMR turn rate (typically negative) was multiplied by –1 to group the data with rightwards OMR stimuli]. Mean swim speed was calculated as the total distance covered by the larva in the central region of the arena divided by the total time spent in this region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Optogenetic stimulation of AF7-pretectum in tethered larvae</title><p>Patterned illumination was delivered to the pretectum of tethered larvae using a custom-built digital micromirror device (DMD) rig. The DMD (Texas Instruments DLP LightCrafter 6500) was illuminated using a liquid light-guide coupled 470 nm LED (Mightex BLS-LCS-0470-50-22). A relayed image of the DMD was expanded and projected onto the sample plane of the objective (Zeiss N-Achroplan 20 × 0.5 NA) such that individual micromirrors were 0.46 × 0.46 µm at sample. Larvae, mounted in the same way as for calcium imaging, were imaged at 100 Hz under 850 nm illumination using a sub-stage FL3-U3-13Y3M-C camera (Point Grey). Trials were 10 s long and included a 4 s period of continuous blue light illumination of either the left or right AF7-pretectum (~75 × 75 µm target, 22.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). A minimum of 6 stimulation trials were performed for each target region. Movies were individually inspected to identify hunting-like events, which were defined by execution of saccadic eye convergence. The apparatus was controlled using LabVIEW (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Laser ablations</title><p><italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal neurons were targeted for ablation in 6 dpf <italic>Tg(KalTA4u508;UAS:mCherry;elavl3:itTA;Ptet:ChR2-YFP)</italic> or <italic>Tg(KalTA4u508;UAS:mCherry;atoh7:GFP)</italic> larvae, which were anaesthetised using MS222 and mounted in 1% low-melting temperature agarose (Sigma-Aldrich).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vatsala Thirumalai as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors uncover the role of a group of pretectal neurons in generating hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. By using an impressive combination of techniques and detailed functional, anatomical and behavioural analyses the authors have identified a brain region that contains a fraction of cells that can be stimulated to induce hunting-like behaviour and ablated to diminish the same behaviour. This work is technically impressive and the conceptual presentation is excellent. The activation of single neurons to induce hunting-like behaviour is already impressive, and the authors go beyond that by identifying fish that do show behavioural responses on activating a given cell, and image the same cell in that fish in a virtual behavioural assay to functionally characterize it. The reviewers suggest the following essential revisions to improve what is an already strong manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors make a strong statement that these neurons constitute a 'command system' for initiating hunting based on their finding that activation of single neurons could elicit hunting routines even in the absence of prey-like stimuli. However, the reviewers felt that such a strong claim was not sufficiently substantiated by the data presented for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Each neuron that was able to trigger prey capture did so only in a minority of trials (~18%) and did so with very long latencies (~4s). If they think that the optogenetic stimulation is triggering hunts by direct activation of AF7-pretec neurons, why is it successful only in a small percentage of trials and why does it take several seconds especially in the case of the neurons that project to the nMLF? Previous reports (Thiele et al., 2014; Del Maschio et al., 2017) suggest that direct activation of nMLF generates tail bends in less than a second after photostimulation. Even if AF7-pretec were 1-3 synapses away, delay seems longer than would be predicted for a command system. If this is likely due to low levels of stimulation of ChR2, did the authors test a range of light intensities? A likely alternative interpretation would be that AF7-pretec neurons encode &quot;prey&quot; value – activation of these neurons signal the existence of prey in the visual field, which then increases the probability of downstream generation of the hunting command.</p><p>2) The criterion for deciding that the stimulation induced a &quot;hunting routine&quot; is only observing a &quot;period with ocular vergence above threshold&quot;. An alternative explanation would be that these neurons are premotor neurons driving eye vergence, and when the animal finds its eyes converged, it responds (with some delay) with a tail movement. Can the authors rule this out?</p><p>Given these concerns, the reviewers suggest that the authors reconsider their nomenclature of these neurons as a command system. The results are entirely consistent with the AF7-pretectal neurons playing a 'hunt-promoting' role. Indeed, this study parallels a recently published study (Zhao et al., 2019) identifying GABAergic neurons in zona incerta of mice as 'hunt-promoting' based on similar lines of experimentation. We believe that toning down on the &quot;command system&quot; hypothesis and instead positing this group of neurons as a &quot;hunt-promoting&quot; nucleus will be closer to the results and yet not take away from the importance of these findings.</p><p>In addition, reviewers have the following suggestions grouped broadly into experiments, analysis and presentation:</p><p>Experiments:</p><p>1) The authors stimulate single neurons using the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> reagent. They do not report on the results of stimulating the entire population of AF7-pretectal neurons labeled by the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> stable transgenic line. Is this because the line labels many neurons elsewhere in the brain? If not, it would be important to include this information. It is also essential to provide more information on the expression pattern in the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> line across all regions of the brain and in the spinal cord.</p><p>2) Authors ablated these neurons to show effects on hunting. However, the control included no photo-ablation of any cells, and therefore does not control for damage to other nearby cells, or axons of RGCs. The authors should either perform a control with ablation of similar numbers of cells nearby, or justify the current control experiment in the text while acknowledging any shortcomings.</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>1) There is no 'Eye vergence only' regressor included in the analysis of activity. If the authors claim that eye convergence without tail movement never occurs then this might be important to show explicitly (again making clear what the delays are between the eye and tail movements).</p><p>2) Clustering: To obtain their functional clusters, the authors cluster the top 5% responsive neurons then assign the rest of the neurons to these clusters based on distance to cluster centroids. This analysis would need some additional information to make it more transparent. (a) What is the distribution between the cells selected with the two criteria, namely, high visually evoked activity or well modeled in terms of motor variables? (b) What numbers of cells formed the seeds for the 36 clusters (min-max range and median)? It is also recommended to add this criteria (that clustering was done on 5% of cells) in the Results text as well.</p><p>3) It was hard to be sure that the description of AF7 neurons scoring high on the &quot;hunting index&quot; (HIx) was a significant result as opposed to falling out of the nature of the regression. HIx measures predominance of activity during hunting as compared to non-response trials. But, in a sense, these are correlated: clustering picks out those cells having motor responses, hence likely to have a high HIx? What is the additional value of the HIx?</p><p>4) Figure 1E and F: In Bianco and Engert (2015), using the same moving spot paradigm the authors find that the &quot;distribution of spot locations at time of convergent saccade did not differ for left-right versus right-left stimuli&quot;. In contrast this manuscript shows in Figure 1E and F a difference for left to right vs. right to left stimuli. Is this significant? What might account for this difference?</p><p>5) Cluster 26 and 28 show lateralized responses and in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Pretectal neurons are recruited during hunting initiation”, authors state that their distributions are also lateralized but Figure 1—figure supplement 2D shows about equal numbers for cluster 26 on both sides. An explanation seems necessary.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>1) The authors need to be clearer about the nature of the visuomotor vector that they use to regress Ca fluorescence. Is it possible to visualize an example VMV or two in the supplementary figures? The figures could be better explicated: for example, in Figure 1G, meaning of terms such as &quot;Conv tail sym&quot; are not immediately obvious until one gets fairly deep into the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) To help the reader, the four tightly packed figures should be broken into perhaps 6 or 7. Currently, each figure is so dense that the font sizes are difficult to read. Further, it is harder to follow the logic when each figure is making multiple, often complex, points. Specifically, Figure 1J-O could become their own figure. The relevant subset of data shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A (i.e., the calcium responses during hunting and non-response for the key clusters of 1, 4, and 25-28) could be brought forward into that figure or another new figure. Figure 2 could likewise be split into anatomy of the AF7 neurons and their behavioral responses. The authors make a very nice analysis of the effect of the anterior ventral optic tectum (avOT) and retinal inputs on prey capture behavior. Unfortunately this has been placed in a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We would suggest that this be made into a figure on its own.</p><p>3) Subsection “Pretectal neurons labelled by <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> with hunting-initiation activity”, fourth paragraph: It's notable that the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons don't respond to visual stimuli alone, in marked contrast to the clusters of which they are members (cf. Figure 1N). Presumably this is because these neurons are a small subset of those clusters, but the authors should acknowledge this distinction in the Results and perhaps speculate on the implications – other cluster members must have more significant visual responses.</p><p>4) The Introduction and Discussion should be rewritten to position the AF7-pretectal neurons as a hunt-promoting nucleus instead of a command system. The title should also be suitably modified. It is best to avoid poorly defined terms such as 'behavioral epistasis' (in describing the interaction between avOT and AF7-pretec).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48114.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors make a strong statement that these neurons constitute a 'command system' for initiating hunting based on their finding that activation of single neurons could elicit hunting routines even in the absence of prey-like stimuli.

Therefore, we have performed two additional experiments (which are now presented within Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 2).</p><p>1) First, because the light intensities we could achieve for free swimming experiments were low (&lt;1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) we tested whether response rates might increase (and latency decrease) at higher irradiance (using a new higher power LED enabling up to 2.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). In addition, the observation that blind fish showed a substantial reduction in latency and increase in response rate in the context of avOT stimulation, suggested that perhaps the bright blue light interfered with induction of hunting. Therefore, we have also now generated and tested blind (<italic>lakritz<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) fish expressing CoChR-tdTomato in single AF7-pretectal neurons. In one blind larva we found that response rate increased with irradiance, reaching 100% at 2.55 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> whereas latency showed only a modest decrease at higher intensity. Notably, we could only generate a very small number of larvae that were both homozygous for the <italic>lakritz</italic> mutation, carriers of the necessary <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> and <italic>atoh7:gapRFP</italic> transgenes and had a single pretectal neuron labelled. Thus, these are preliminary observations, but we believe it is nonetheless informative to include this data within a figure supplement (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2) Second, we investigated the effect of stimulating multiple AF7-pretectal neurons. The <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> transgene indeed labels various other cell types (see below), preventing specific optogenetic targeting of pretectal neurons in free-swimming animals. Therefore, we used a patterned illumination system (a DMD rig) to focally stimulate the pretectal region in tethered <italic>KalTA4u508;UAS:CoChR-tdTomato</italic> larvae (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In this experiment, where the full complement of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic>-labelled pretectal cells are stimulated and higher irradiance levels were possible (22 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), we observed much higher hunting response probabilities and an order of magnitude reduction in response latency (to ~80 ms).</p><p>This new data indicates that the transgenically labelled <italic>population</italic> of AF7-pretectal cells can induce hunting with very short latency, compatible with a command system function. The long latencies observed with single cell stimulation might represent a limited capability of single pretectal neurons to bring downstream pattern generating circuits to threshold. We do not favour the interpretation that ‘AF7-pretectal neurons encode &quot;prey&quot; value – activation of these neurons signal the existence of prey in the visual field’ as <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells explicitly do not respond to the existence of prey but rather are recruited at initiation of hunting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The criterion for deciding that the stimulation induced a &quot;hunting routine&quot; is only observing a &quot;period with ocular vergence above threshold&quot;. An alternative explanation would be that these neurons are premotor neurons driving eye vergence, and when the animal finds its eyes converged, it responds (with some delay) with a tail movement. Can the authors rule this out?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that we use the period of elevated vergence to <italic>detect</italic> the occurrence and duration of (natural and optogenetically evoked) hunting routines. However, although this is our detection criterion, ocular vergence is not the only feature of those routines. In all fish where we could induce hunting, 100% of convergent saccades were paired with tail movement. This was true both in the free-swimming and tethered (DMD) optogenetic stimulation paradigms. The delay between saccadic convergence and tail movement averaged &lt;10 ms, which is very similar to natural hunting behaviour. This data was already included in our first submission but for emphasis we have now included the eye-tail lag as an additional panel in the main figure. The tail movements that are coincident with saccadic convergence showed kinematic similarities with those observed during natural hunting (i.e. asymmetry, distal curvature, tail-beat frequency etc). Multiple swim bouts were typically observed during optogenetically evoked hunting (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and remarkably, the final swim bout sometimes resembled a capture swim, characterised by jaw-opening, dorsiflexion and eye divergence (observed for ~40% of cells and now quantified in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D). It is on this basis that we consider optogenetic stimulation of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells induces hunting <italic>routines</italic>, rather than simply convergent saccades.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these concerns, the reviewers suggest that the authors reconsider their nomenclature of these neurons as a command system. The results are entirely consistent with the AF7-pretectal neurons playing a 'hunt-promoting' role. Indeed, this study parallels a recently published study (Zhao et al., 2019) identifying GABAergic neurons in zona incerta of mice as 'hunt-promoting' based on similar lines of experimentation. We believe that toning down on the &quot;command system&quot; hypothesis and instead positing this group of neurons as a &quot;hunt-promoting&quot; nucleus will be closer to the results and yet not take away from the importance of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raised two valid concerns, but we believe that the new experimental data and analyses in this revised manuscript largely tackle both. Specifically, stimulating the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> pretectal population triggers hunting with very short latency, equivalent to that observed for command neurons in other species (e.g. Inagaki et al., 2014). Second, evoked responses are not limited to saccadic convergence but comprise a sequence of oculomotor and locomotor actions with kinematic signatures of natural hunting behaviour. In the revised Discussion we now discuss the recent findings related to the SC–ZI–PAG pathway, published while this manuscript was under review. In distinction to AF7-pretectal neurons, ZI cells show <italic>sensory</italic> responses to prey-like features, appear to generate a positive valence signal to motivate predation and evoke limited hunting-like behaviour in absence of prey. This is quite distinct to the properties of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells in AF7-pretectum. Moreover, <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells satisfy the criteria for command system neurons as defined by Yoshihara and Yoshihara (2018), as summarised in the Discussion.</p><p>However, in consideration of the reviewers’ comments we have made the following changes:</p><p>i) We have changed the title to ‘Pretectal cells control hunting behaviour’ and edited the Abstract to make clear that a command system function is our interpretation of the role of the cells ‘We propose that…’.</p><p>ii) We have removed all comments concerning command neurons from the Introduction and Results.</p><p>iii) We have edited the Discussion to further clarify that a command system role is a proposal based upon the experimental results. This is mostly confined to one section entitled ‘Do AF7-pretectal neurons comprise a command system controlling predation?’ which also includes discussion of the new experimental data and further clarification.</p><p>We hope that the reviewers consider these revisions accurately represent the experimental data and make explicit the basis for our interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, reviewers have the following suggestions grouped broadly into experiments, analysis and presentation:</p><p>Experiments:</p><p>1) The authors stimulate single neurons using the KalTA4u508 reagent. They do not report on the results of stimulating the entire population of AF7-pretectal neurons labeled by the KalTA4u508 stable transgenic line. Is this because the line labels many neurons elsewhere in the brain? If not, it would be important to include this information. It is also essential to provide more information on the expression pattern in the KalTA4u508 line across all regions of the brain and in the spinal cord.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have made this clearer in the original manuscript. Indeed, the <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> transgene labels various additional cell populations within brain, spinal cord and sensory ganglia (e.g. lateral line), as well as some expression in muscle and skin. We now state this in the Results and explain that it is for this reason that we adopted a transient expression strategy to allow optogenetic stimulation specifically of the AF7-pretectal neurons. We also include an image of an entire transgenic larva (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The results of stimulating the entire (transgenically labelled) population of pretectal neurons, using the DMD set-up, is now presented (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors ablated these neurons to show effects on hunting. However, the control included no photo-ablation of any cells, and therefore does not control for damage to other nearby cells, or axons of RGCs. The authors should either perform a control with ablation of similar numbers of cells nearby, or justify the current control experiment in the text while acknowledging any shortcomings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed two ablation controls (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1). First, we ablated AF7-pretectal cells in larvae carrying the <italic>atoh7:GFP</italic> transgene to visualise RGC axons in AF7. These appeared undamaged by the ablation. Second, we ablated an equivalent number of neuronal somata slightly medial to the AF7-pretectal region (labelled by <italic>gata2a:GFP</italic>) and observed no impairment of hunting performance. These controls indicate our ablations were well targeted and cause impairment of hunting due to loss of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis:</p><p>1) There is no 'Eye vergence only' regressor included in the analysis of activity. If the authors claim that eye convergence without tail movement never occurs then this might be important to show explicitly (again making clear what the delays are between the eye and tail movements).</p></disp-quote><p>Eye convergence without tail movement is very rare, occurring for &lt;10% of saccades. We now show this data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 along with the eye-tail time lag during the virtual hunting assay (~10 ms). Due to the very limited number of events we did not generate an ‘eye vergence only’ regressor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clustering: To obtain their functional clusters, the authors cluster the top 5% responsive neurons then assign the rest of the neurons to these clusters based on distance to cluster centroids. This analysis would need some additional information to make it more transparent. (a) What is the distribution between the cells selected with the two criteria, namely, high visually evoked activity or well modeled in terms of motor variables? (b) What numbers of cells formed the seeds for the 36 clusters (min-max range and median?. It is also recommended to add this criteria (that clustering was done on 5% of cells) in the Results text as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The distributions of max visual response and regression goodness-of-fit (i.e. the metrics used for cell selection) are now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. The total fraction of cells used for clustering was 9.5% (top 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for either visual or motor components). The numbers of cells in all of the seeds (as well as the final clusters) has been added as Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G and the Results text has been edited as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was hard to be sure that the description of AF7 neurons scoring high on the &quot;hunting index&quot; (HIx) was a significant result as opposed to falling out of the nature of the regression. HIx measures predominance of activity during hunting as compared to non-response trials. But, in a sense, these are correlated: clustering picks out those cells having motor responses, hence likely to have a high HIx? What is the additional value of the HIx?</p></disp-quote><p>The HIx result does not necessarily follow from the nature of the regression but is expected based on the results of the clustering. Because convergent saccades are correlated with presentation of prey-like stimuli, it is possible that a cell may have a significant ‘motor’ coefficient for convergence but in fact be encoding the presence of prey. The results of the clustering indicate this is, however, unlikely as the convergent saccade (hunt initiation) clusters have very minimal visual activity (extracted from non-response trials). The HIx analysis confirms this and isolates the modulation attributable to hunt initiation (which is not explicitly represented by any single VMV element). We believe this analysis (as well as the stimulus and motor-triggered calcium profiles) show in a very direct and convincing way that hunt initiation neurons are specifically activated in response trials, when the fish release convergent saccades.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1E and F: In Bianco and Engert (2015), using the same moving spot paradigm the authors find that the &quot;distribution of spot locations at time of convergent saccade did not differ for left-right versus right-left stimuli&quot;. In contrast this manuscript shows in Figure 1E and F a difference for left to right vs. right to left stimuli. Is this significant? What might account for this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference versus Bianco and Engert (2015) is likely due to pooling of locations for fast (30°/s) and slow (15°/s) stimuli in that prior study. Using exclusively 30°/s prey-like cues in this study, we consistently see a preference for the larvae to respond once the spot has crossed the midline and is moving nose–tail. Cumulative distribution functions with p-value have now been added in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Cluster 26 and 28 show lateralized responses and in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Pretectal neurons are recruited during hunting initiation”, authors state that their distributions are also lateralized but Figure 1—figure supplement 2D shows about equal numbers for cluster 26 on both sides. An explanation seems necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2D (now Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) shows data for <italic>all</italic> clustered neurons, whereas the statement in the Results text refers to cluster 26/28 cells <italic>in AF7-pretectum</italic>. The strongly lateralised anatomical distributions of these cells <italic>in pretectum</italic> is shown in the insets in Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation:</p><p>1) The authors need to be clearer about the nature of the visuomotor vector that they use to regress Ca fluorescence. Is it possible to visualize an example VMV or two in the supplementary figures? The figures could be better explicated: for example, in Figure 1G, meaning of terms such as &quot;Conv tail sym&quot; are not immediately obvious until one gets fairly deep into the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>VMVs for all clustered neurons are displayed in Figure 1; these are not used to regress Ca fluorescence but instead describe the visual responses and regression coefficients. We have edited the schematic in Figure 1G to make this clearer. We suspect the reviewers are asking for examples of kinematic regressors alongside Ca data. This has now been added in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E. We have added a description of the Conv tail L/R/sym regressors/coefficients to the Results text to aid the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To help the reader, the four tightly packed figures should be broken into perhaps 6 or 7. Currently, each figure is so dense that the font sizes are difficult to read. Further, it is harder to follow the logic when each figure is making multiple, often complex, points. Specifically, Figure 1J-O could become their own figure. The relevant subset of data shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A (i.e., the calcium responses during hunting and non-response for the key clusters of 1, 4, and 25-28) could be brought forward into that figure or another new figure. Figure 2 could likewise be split into anatomy of the AF7 neurons and their behavioral responses. The authors make a very nice analysis of the effect of the anterior ventral optic tectum (avOT) and retinal inputs on prey capture behavior. Unfortunately this has been placed in a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We would suggest that this be made into a figure on its own.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised manuscript we now present the results across 8 main figures. We opted to split Figure 1 after panel K so that this figure now covers functional identification of hunting-related neurons, while localisation of hunting-initiation cells to the AF7-pretectal region is now presented separately in Figure 2. As suggested, the anatomy and response properties of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> cells is now divided (into Figures 3 and 4). We have added an additional supplementary figure to present the DMD stimulation data and in line with the reviewers’ suggestion, now present the avOT data in a main figure, Figure 7. Figure 8 presents the effect of <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> ablation on avOT-induced hunting and the final circuit model. We have increased font sizes and hope that the new layout has improved presentation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Pretectal neurons labelled by KalTA4u508 with hunting-initiation activity”, fourth paragraph: It's notable that the KalTA4u508 neurons don't respond to visual stimuli alone, in marked contrast to the clusters of which they are members (cf. Figure 1N). Presumably this is because these neurons are a small subset of those clusters, but the authors should acknowledge this distinction in the Results and perhaps speculate on the implications – other cluster members must have more significant visual responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following statement to the Results: ‘The absence of visual activity in <italic>KalTA4u508</italic> neurons is in contrast to the small responses seen previously in hunting-initiation clusters (Figure 2), suggesting some functional heterogeneity in clusters derived from pan-neuronal imaging.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Introduction and Discussion should be rewritten to position the AF7-pretectal neurons as a hunt-promoting nucleus instead of a command system. The title should also be suitably modified. It is best to avoid poorly defined terms such as 'behavioral epistasis' (in describing the interaction between avOT and AF7-pretec).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, the Introduction, Discussion and title have been modified. The term ‘behavioural epistasis’ has been removed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
