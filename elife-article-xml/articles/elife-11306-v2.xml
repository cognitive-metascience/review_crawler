Only two enzymes - the acyl-protein thioesterases APT1 and APT2 – are known to catalyze palmitate removal from cytosolic cysteine residues. It is unclear if these enzymes act constitutively on all palmitoylated proteins, or if additional depalmitoylases exist. Using a dual pulse-chase strategy comparing palmitate and protein half-lives, we found knockdown or inhibition of APT1 and APT2 blocked depalmitoylation of Huntingtin, but did not affect palmitate turnover on postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) or N-Ras. We used activity profiling to identify novel serine hydrolase targets of the APT1/2 inhibitor Palmostatin B, and discovered that a family of uncharacterized ABHD17 proteins can accelerate palmitate turnover on PSD95 and N-Ras. ABHD17 catalytic activity is required for N-Ras depalmitoylation and re-localization to internal cellular membranes. Our findings indicate that the family of depalmitoylation enzymes may be substantially broader than previously believed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11306.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11306.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11306.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins play important roles in many processes in cells. Some of these proteins can be modified by the addition of a molecule called palmitate. This process, termed “palmitoylation”, helps direct these proteins to the compartments within the cell where they are needed to carry out their roles. One target of palmitoylation is N-Ras, which is a protein that can promote the development of cancer.</p><p>We understand quite a lot about how palmitate is added to proteins, but much less about how it is removed. So far, researchers have only identified two enzymes – known as APT1 and APT2 – that can remove palmitate from proteins, but it is possible that there are others. Identifying other “depalmitoylase” enzymes could help us find ways to block the removal of palmitate from N-Ras, which could lead to new treatments for some cancers.</p><p>Lin and Conibear used several biochemical techniques to search for depalmitoylase enzymes in human cells. The experiments reveal that although APT1 and APT2 are important for removing palmitate from some proteins, they are not needed to remove palmitate from N-Ras. Instead, Lin and Conibear found that an enzyme called ABHD17 removes palmitate from N-Ras. The next step following on from this work will be to find out what other proteins ABHD17 acts on in cells. A longer-term challenge will be to develop specific chemicals that inhibit ABHD17 activity and test if they are able to reduce the growth of cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11306.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11306.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ABHD17A</kwd><kwd>ABHD17B</kwd><kwd>ABHD17C</kwd><kwd>FAM108A1</kwd><kwd>FAM108B1</kwd><kwd>FAM108C1</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>Palmostatin B</kwd><kwd>Acyl Protein Thioesterase</kwd><kwd>depalmitoylation</kwd><kwd>N-Ras</kwd><kwd>PSD95</kwd><kwd>APT1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute of Genetics Team Grant, GPG-202165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conibear</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001805</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leading Edge Fund, 30636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conibear</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005247</institution-id><institution>University of British Columbia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Four Year Fellowship (FYF)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>David Tse Shen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigator Salary Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conibear</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Palmitate turnover is controlled by distinct enzyme families with different specificities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein S-palmitoylation involves the post-translational attachment of the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conibear and Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>).

We used a dual-click chemistry pulse-chase scheme to simultaneously measure palmitate and protein turnover of proteins expressed in COS-7 cells and labeled with the palmitate analogue 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) and the methionine surrogate L-azidohomoalanine (L-AHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin and Cravatt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). N-Ras had a rapid palmitate turnover as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Magee et al., 1987</xref>). SNAP25 turned over slowly, whereas the glutamate decarboxylase subunit GAD65 and PSD95 had intermediate rates of depalmitoylation, demonstrating that these neuronal proteins undergo palmitate turnover at comparable rates in COS-7 cells or neuronal lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>). A palmitoylated N-terminal fragment of Huntingtin (N-HTT) implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yanai et al., 2006</xref>) also showed an intermediate palmitate turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Treatment with the APT1/2 inhibitor PalmB inhibited the depalmitoylation of these substrates without affecting protein turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, we found three proteins identified in a global palmitoyl-proteomics analysis (SPRED2, GOLIM4, and ITM2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2011</xref>) did not undergo significant palmitate turnover, suggesting the apparent PalmB-resistant decline in palmitate labeling was due to protein instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results confirm that proteins have inherently distinct rates of depalmitoylation, potentially reflecting differential recognition by APTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin and Conibear, 2015</xref>).

In pulse-chase experiments, we found HDFP robustly inhibited the depalmitoylation of N-Ras, PSD95, and N-HTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Because palmitate removal from N-Ras and PSD95 does not require APT1 or APT2, their depalmitoylation may be mediated by a distinct mSH that is a common target of both PalmB and HDFP. To identify overlapping targets, we defined a set of 19 candidate mSHs that showed &gt;25% inhibition by HDFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2011</xref>) but excluded known proteases and mSHs with established luminal activity. We added to this list APT1L, which was previously implicated in BK channel depalmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2012</xref>) but whose HDFP sensitivity was unknown. The PalmB sensitivity of each enzyme was evaluated by a competitive activity-based protein profiling (cABPP) assay, in which binding of an inhibitor occludes the enzyme active site and prevents labeling with the activity probe fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-rho) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kidd et al., 2001</xref>). As expected, PalmB significantly reduced FP-rho labeling of both APT1 and APT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>). In contrast, it had little effect on the labeling of seven candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>), highlighting the distinct substrate specificities of PalmB and HDFP. Four mSHs did not label with FP-Rho due to low activity or expression and could not be assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, PalmB potently inhibited seven candidates: FASN, PNPLA6, ABHD6, ABHD16A, and ABHD17A/B/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).

We found ABHD17A localized to the plasma membrane and to Rab5- and Rab11-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Mutation of the predicted active site serine (S211A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) abolished ABHD17A activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) but did not alter its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), whereas removing the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-19 (∆N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) shifted it to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) and reduced its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, neither mutant stimulated N-Ras or PSD95 depalmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting both the catalytic activity and membrane localization of ABHD17A are functionally important.</p><p>We next examined the cellular consequences of ABHD17A expression. Disrupting N-Ras palmitoylation by mutating the palmitoylated residue (C181S) or treating cells with the inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) relocalized N-Ras from the plasma membrane to internal organelles, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodwin et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Overexpression of APT1 or APT2 had little effect on N-Ras localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), consistent with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agudo-Ibáñez et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of ABHD17A, but not catalytically dead or cytosolic mutant forms, redistributed N-Ras from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments consistent with its altered palmitoylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the membrane-localized pool of ABHD17A depalmitoylates N-Ras and alters its subcellular targeting.</p><p>To determine if the endogenous ABHD17 proteins regulate palmitate cycling in vivo, we investigated the effect of ABHD17 knockdown on N-Ras depalmitoylation in HEK293T cells. RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction) showed efficient silencing of ABHD17A alone, or ABHD17A, ABHD17B, and ABHD17C in concert, after 72 hr with siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). ABHD17A knockdown had a slight effect on N-Ras depalmitoylation (p=0.084). In contrast, N-Ras palmitate turnover was significantly inhibited when all three ABHD17 proteins were simultaneously downregulated (p=0.0083), and this was not further enhanced by the APT1 and APT2 inhibitors C83 and C115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Knockdown was less effective than PalmB treatment, which could be due to activity of the residual ABHD17 enzymes. PalmB may also inhibit additional factors that either directly or indirectly affect N-Ras palmitate cycling. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ABHD17 proteins redundantly mediate palmitate turnover on N-Ras.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11306.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous knockdown of ABHD17 isoforms inhibits N-Ras palmitate turnover.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-qPCR of ABHD17A, ABHD17B, and ABHD17C transcript levels in HEK 293T cells treated with Non-Targeting siRNA (”NT”, black), ABHD17A siRNA alone (”A KD”, gray), or ABHD17A/ ABHD17B/ ABHD17C siRNAs (”Triple KD”, light gray) for 72 hr. n = 3, mean ± SEM.

Using a combination of tagging reagents for palmitoylation (17-ODYA) and protein levels (L-AHA) in pulse chase experiments, the authors investigate various inhibitors of known cytosolic depalmitoylases. They find somewhat surprisingly that Ras, previously believed to be depalmitoylated by APT1 and APT2, is not actually affected by these enzymes. This was shown using both knockdown of these enzymes by RNAi (with nice positive controls) as well as more selective inhibitors of these enzymes than the previously reported PalmB. The evidence directly challenges the prior conclusions that APT1 is the target of palmostatin B mediated inhibition of H/Nras depalmitoylation (Dekker, et al. Nat Chem Biol. 2010 Jun;6(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>):449-56), which relied on less robust strategies of acyl-biotin exchange chemistry and indirect surrogates of palmitoylation using fluorescence protein subcellular localization. The authors then search for the real Ras depalmitoylase, using chemoproteomic and overexpression strategies and make a reasonably strong case that ABHD17A is a Ras (and PSD95) depalmitoylase. This is demonstrated by overexpression of wt but not Ser mutant or N-terminal deletion mutant (which mislocalizes) ABHD17A. Overexpression of ABHD17A, ABHD17B, ABHD17C and ABHD6 suggested the first 3 serine hydrolyses could decrease palmitoylation levels of PSD-95. Additional site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the catalytic residue and plasma membrane localization of ABHD17A was required for depalmitoylation of PSD-95-GFP and EGFP-N-Ras in COS-7 cells. ABHD17A localization and active-site mutation also affected the cellular distribution of EGFP-N-Ras in COS-7 cells. This is interesting work with important implications for the palmitoylation field. The clarity this new evidence provides is essential to guide efforts that will define and potentially interrupt the contribution of protein palmitoylation to Nras driven malignancies including melanoma and leukemias. It is by and large technically strong and innovative, nicely taking advantage of a series of elegant chemical tools most of which were previously reported by Martin and Cravatt. The manuscript in a general sense seems appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, as a short paper, however I do have several concerns that should be considered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A missing experiment is an RNAi knockdown (or genetic knockout) of ABHD17A which could/should induce palmitoylation of Ras and PSD95 according to the authors' model. This would be especially helpful since no selective inhibitor appears to be available for this enzyme. If the authors have already done this experiment, they should comment on the results. If they have not, they should discuss why not.</p><p>2) Interestingly, an analysis of Hras, which is dually palmitoylated, is conspicuously absent in the present study and this is notable largely because of the direct challenge made toward the prior conclusions regarding APT1 activity on both H- and Nras.

We had not previously attempted this experiment due to its inherent challenges, but in response to the reviewers’ request, we have now investigated palmitate turnover on N-Ras after single knockdown of ABHD17A, or triple knockdown of ABHD17A/B/C in the presence or absence of APT1/2-selective inhibitors. We present these results in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and discuss them in a new paragraph in Results and Discussion, paragraph 8. Importantly, we observed significant inhibition of N-Ras depalmitoylation after knockdown of all three ABHD17 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrating the ABHD17 proteins are critical mediators of N-Ras depalmitoylation in vivo.</p><p> <italic>2) Interestingly, an analysis of Hras, which is dually palmitoylated, is conspicuously absent in the present study and this is notable largely because of the direct challenge made toward the prior conclusions regarding APT1 activity on both H- and Nras.

Cell Biol., 2010), and could be regulated by distinct APTs. To address the reviewers’ comments, we have now conducted a preliminary analysis of wild type H-Ras palmitoylation indicating that overexpressed ABHD17A can target H-Ras (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). Dissecting the relative roles of ABHD17 and APT1 in regulating turnover at each palmitoylation site, and the corresponding effects on H-Ras membrane localization and lipid microdomain association, will require additional long-term studies.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11306.015</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11306.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11306.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11306-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We do not believe our results necessarily contradict previous findings. Many prior studies used Palmostatin B as an indirect means to examine APT1 activity on H- and N-Ras in cultured cells, and based on our results, it is likely many effects attributed to APT1 were due to ABHD17. Only a few studies have directly measured Ras palmitoylation after APT1 knockdown or overexpression. Dekker et al. (Nat. Chem. Biol., 2010) reported APT1 knockdown increased steady state palmitoylation of N-Ras by acyl biotin exchange assay (p=0.15), whereas Agudo-Ibáñez et al. (Mol. Cell Biol., 2015) showed overexpression of APT1 significantly reduced steady state [3H]-palmitate labeling of H-Ras (p&lt;0.005). In contrast, we specifically measured depalmitoylation rates using a pulse-chase protocol that detects rapid palmitate turnover. Our results demonstrate that ABHD17 isoforms play a more important role than APT1/2 in regulating dynamic palmitate cycling on specific substrates including N-Ras, but do not preclude a function for APT1/2 in regulating steady-state palmitoylation of H-Ras.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p><italic>1) Although not essential, it would be of some value to assess the depalmitoylation of Ras palmitoylated peptides by ABHD17A as well as APT1 and APT2 to see if the cellular results can be observed in a purified system.</italic> </p><p>We agree an <italic>in vitro</italic> palmitoylation assay would be valuable. However, this is not a trivial experiment because we have shown ABHD17A must be membrane-anchored to display full activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A more thorough analysis of how membrane association affects ABHD17A activity will be required before pursuing this approach.</p><p><italic>2) I am not really sure what is meant by the dashed lines and the cropping of lanes in several of the blots.

All quantitation was performed on the uncropped gels, thus we believe cropping had no effect on the results. Nevertheless, we repeated the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref> as suggested, and our revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the new, complete gels. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (PSD95 panel) we would be happy to provide uncropped gels on request.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> ABHD4 looks like it may be tagged by PalmB when taking loading into account.</italic> </p><p>Some binding to ABHD4 is possible, as our analysis showed PalmB reduced the activity of ABHD4 by approximately 25%, consistent with our observation that PalmB binds additional mSHs. However, to find the most significant PalmB targets, we chose the set of enzymes showing &gt;50% inhibition for more detailed study.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panels D and E, it appears that the baseline levels of palmitoylation of Ras and PSD95 are elevated in S211A and DeltaN.

This would be worth future investigation, but is beyond the scope of the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
