modulates important aspects of animal physiology, yet roles in regulating innate immunity are relatively unexplored. From genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we identified splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60 whose activity suppresses immunity, but promotes longevity, suggesting a tradeoff between these processes. Bacterial pathogen exposure affects gene expression and splicing in a <italic>rnp-6</italic> dependent manner, and <italic>rnp-6</italic> gain and loss-of-function activities reveal an active role in immune regulation. Another longevity promoting splicing factor, SFA-1, similarly exerts an immuno-suppressive effect, working downstream or parallel to RNP-6. RNP-6 acts through TIR-1/PMK-1/MAPK signaling to modulate immunity. The mammalian homolog, PUF60, also displays anti-inflammatory properties, and its levels swiftly decrease after bacterial infection in mammalian cells, implying a role in the host response. Altogether our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved modulation of immunity by specific components of the splicing machinery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kew</surname><given-names>Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wenming</given-names></name><name><surname>Antebi</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60 suppresses immunity by modulating host splicing and transcriptional responses to infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immunity comprises the first line of defense against invading micro-organisms. The presence of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activates conserved signaling pathways to protect the host and bring infection under control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zindel and Kubes, 2020</xref>). Over the last several decades, several powerful invertebrate models including the round worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have provided significant and unique insights into underlying mechanisms of innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). Pioneering studies demonstrated that evolutionarily conserved core signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>), HLH-30/TFEB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Visvikis et al., 2014</xref>) and β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irazoqui et al., 2008</xref>) regulate innate immunity from worms to mammals.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the MAPK cascade of NSY-1-SEK-1-PMK-1 is essential to innate immunity, and has orthologs in mammals (ASK1 MAPKKK-MKK3/6 MAPKK-p38 MAPK pathway) playing a similar role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). This signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> depends on TIR-1, a Toll-Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain protein and an ortholog of mammalian SARM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couillault et al., 2004</xref>). Deletion mutants of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PMK-1 pathway correspondingly exhibit dysregulated transcriptional responses and hypersensitivity to infection challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fletcher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>). Evidently, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like-receptors, which function upstream to control the MAPK pathway in mammals and insects, do not appear to play a significant role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> infection responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pujol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pukkila-Worley and Ausubel, 2012</xref>), but rather mediate the aversive behavioral response to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt and Ringstad, 2015</xref>). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) apparently play an important role in controlling the MAPK pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the context of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zugasti et al., 2014</xref>). However, identities of the actual ligands during infection for these receptors are not clear except for <italic>dcar-1</italic>, whose ligand was identified to be an endogenous molecule, 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (HPLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zugasti et al., 2014</xref>). Various stressors also trigger the MAPK pathway, but how these different inputs activate MAPK cascades in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not well understood.</p><p>mRNA splicing is an essential process in eukaryotic cells whereby intervening non-coding sequences (introns) are removed from primary transcripts, and protein coding sequences (exons) are joined together to form the mature mRNA. This activity is catalyzed by a family of specialized proteins called splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wani and Kuroyanagi, 2017</xref>). Different combinations of exons enlarge the repertoire of proteins and thus increase diversity of molecules at play in the physiological response. Various physiological processes are regulated by splicing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including heavy metal resistance, metabolism and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heintz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tabrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2019a</xref>), yet how splicing affects innate immunity, especially in invertebrate models, remains relatively unexplored. Here we report a novel role of splicing factors in immunity that reveal a crucial host response during bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>G281D substitution of RNP-6 enhances resistance to abiotic stresses</title><p>Cellular stress resistance mechanisms help manage diverse environmental and physiologic challenges.

PUF60 facilitates the association of the U2 snRNP with target RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Page-McCaw et al., 1999</xref>). PUF60 is essential, and heterozygous loss of function causes Verheij syndrome, which is characterized by severe developmental abnormalities in most patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Low et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verheij et al., 2009</xref>). PUF60 is also involved in Hepatitis B virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found a G281D amino acid substitution in <italic>rnp-6</italic> lying within the second RNA binding motif at a position conserved across evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, this mutation confers no obvious developmental phenotypes, despite <italic>rnp-6</italic> null mutants being embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnsen et al., 2000</xref>). Upon outcrossing the original mutant, <italic>rnp-6(dh1124)</italic> was highly resistant to cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). An independent line carrying the same mutation (<italic>dh1127</italic>) was created using CRISPR gene editing, which showed the same phenotype, confirming the casual relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In subsequent experiments, we used the CRISPR line. The mutant had a slightly reduced brood size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a slight but significant developmental delay (around 3.5 hr more to reach adulthood) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a marginally shorter body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but did not significantly affect pharyngeal pumping rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the mutant was also resistant to heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting this mutation widely confers resistance to multiple abiotic stresses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>G281D substitution of RNP-6 causes infection sensitivity</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that are resistant to abiotic stresses often have better survival upon infectious insults and are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garsin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">TeKippe and Aballay, 2010</xref>). To test whether the stress resistant <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant also enhances infection survival, we infected the <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutant with different pathogenic bacteria, namely <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Unexpectedly, this mutant was more sensitive to all pathogenic bacteria tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). This phenotype was confirmed with another independently created CRISPR line (<italic>dh1125</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). We also performed the experiments on full lawn <italic>S. aureus</italic> plates. The <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutant displayed the same sensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting the sensitivity was not due to differential bacterial exposure. Although <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> animals were more sensitive to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we did not observe a difference in bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Interestingly, when cultured with the weakly pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50, the <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutant showed robust longevity at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and a normal lifespan at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>), indicating the shortened survival on pathogenic bacteria was specific and unlikely due to general sickness of the mutant. Although longevity is dependent on temperature, the mutant was sensitive to pathogenic bacterial infection at both 20°C and 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest G281D substitution of <italic>rnp-6</italic> enhances abiotic stress resistance, prolongs lifespan, but specifically compromises infection survival.</p><p>Next, we assessed the levels of RNP-6 upon infection. Using CRISPR technology, we tagged endogenous RNP-6 with a N-terminal HA tag (<italic>dh1188</italic>). We performed qRT-PCR and western blots to detect the endogenous levels of RNP-6 at both transcript and protein levels. However, no significant changes could be detected after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L,M</xref>). We conclude that although RNP-6 profoundly affects infection survival, its levels remain stable upon infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>G281D substitution of RNP-6 leads to dysregulation of immune responses</title><p>To further investigate the effect of RNP-6 on infection responses, we performed transcriptomic profiling of wildtype N2 animals and the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant, under both control <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected conditions.

When comparing infected wildtype animals and infected <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutants, we found a larger number of alternatively spliced genes (456 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). The number of alternatively spliced genes induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> could be underestimated as a result of the short infection time used (4 hr post-infection) and tissue-specific alternative splicing masked in the transcriptome from whole animals. Over half of the genes (43 out of 83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>) showing infection induced alternative splicing, were also altered in the infected <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutants when compared to infected wildtype N2 animals. This suggests that the splicing alteration induced by infection is partly dependent on <italic>rnp-6</italic>. We also analyzed the data with the SAJR algorithm, which gives a detailed classification of the splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mazin et al., 2013</xref>). In wildtype animals, <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection induced splicing events were predominated by ‘cassette exon’ (44.9%) and ‘retained intron’ (22.4%). This was also true when we compared infected <italic>rnp-6(1127)</italic> mutants with infected wildtype animals (‘cassette exon’ 59.5%, ‘retained intron’ 15.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Infection also led to inclusion of exon 6 and exon 7 of <italic>gyg-1</italic>, and again this effect was largely suppressed by the G281D substitution in the <italic>dh1127</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Viruses commonly interact with the host splicing machinery, whereas not much is known regarding bacterial interference with host RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauhan et al., 2019</xref>). We provide evidence that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, bacterial infections affect mRNA splicing, and perturbations of splicing is a trigger for immune responses while, by inference, increased splicing activity compromises immunity, thus providing a new explanation for how immune responses are modulated in the worms. Importantly, the function of RNP-6/PUF60 in immunity is conserved in mammalian cells. Thus, our results also shed light on the mechanisms of human diseases that involve PUF60.</p><p>Long-lived animals are often more stress resistant. Stress resistance and longevity are thought to be tightly and positively correlated, but this idea has been recently disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrit et al., 2019</xref>). The behavior of splicing factors RNP-6 and SFA-1 is another clear example of disconnecting longevity and biotic stress resistance. The <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D substitution and overexpression of splicing factors (RNP-6 and SFA-1) lead to sensitivity to infection but promote longevity. Notably, the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant is resistant to abiotic stresses, suggesting the sensitivity towards infection is mediated by specialized mechanisms rather than a general decline of fitness in this mutant.</p><p>One question that remains to be investigated is the nature of the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutation. In the context of survival, phenotypically this mutation appears to be a gain of function as both the G281D substitution and RNP-6 over-expression lead to compromised infection survival but prolonged lifespan on OP50. However, the G281D substitution also shows characteristics of a loss of function mutation in other aspects. For example, the transcriptional and splicing changes induced by the G281D substitution are complex with some genes showing patterns similar to that of <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi while others having different patterns. We believe that the G281D substitution does not simply increase or decrease the activity of RNP-6 but rather causes a complex change in the affinity of the RNA binding domain to different RNA molecules. The location of the substitution in the RNA binding motif also supports this idea.</p><p>One limitation of the splicing assaying with PCR on RNA extracted from whole <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals is that the changes observed might be due to changes in isoform expression pattern in different tissues rather than alternate splicing within the same tissue, as genes can have tissue enriched isoforms. Nevertheless, the <italic>rnp-6</italic> dependence of these splicing changes argues in favor of a true splicing effect.</p><p>In mammals, PUF60 is also known as far-upstream element binding protein, which inhibits the transcriptional factor FUSE binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan et al., 1994</xref>). Although RNP-6 clearly affects the transcriptome, whether a specific transcriptional regulatory function of RNP-6/PUF60 plays a role in immunity is unclear. Often transcriptional changes can reflect the coupling of transcriptional and splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley, 2014</xref>). In addition, the results from SFA-1 suggest that the effects of RNP-6 on immunity are dependent on the splicing machinery, arguing against a sole involvement of the transcriptional regulatory function of RNP-6/PUF60.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that PMK-1 MAPK signaling falls under the control of the splicing machinery. How MAPK signaling is activated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim and Ewbank, 2018</xref>). The current study suggests splicing is an important modulator of MAPK signaling and likely works upstream of TIR-1/SARM. In the non-infected state, splicing factors suppress immunity, but during bacterial infections, splicing is perturbed, leading to the activation of immune responses. Interestingly, our bioinformatic analysis suggests splicing changes upon infection are not global but limited, suggesting specificity. How altering splicing can lead to activation of PMK-1 and immune responses is not well-understood at this point. Splicing is a core cellular process and perturbations of other cellular processes, such as mitochondrial or nucleolar functions, have been shown to activate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melo and Ruvkun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiku et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>rnp-6</italic>/PUF60 RNAi derepression of the immune response could reflect damage mediated immunity. On the other hand, <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D substitution and overexpression exhibit an immunosuppressive function, arguing for a more novel and specific role of splicing in the regulation of immune defense.</p><p>In support of the latter idea, MyD88, a Toll-like-receptor signaling adaptor and an analog (functionally similar but differ significantly at the sequence level) of <italic>tir-1</italic> in mammals, is controlled by alternative mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Arras and Alper, 2013</xref>).

Also, in both dietary restricted animals and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, PMK-1 MAPK signaling is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2019b</xref>). One attractive hypothesis is that longevity promoting interventions extend lifespan by suppressing MAPK signaling through splicing.</p><p>Our study also reveals a novel and evolutionarily conserved function of RNP-6/PUF60 in regulating immunity in mammalian cells. Although <italic>rnp-6</italic> levels remain stable after infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, infection reduces the abundance of PUF60 in various mammalian cells. We hypothesize that infection induced down-regulation of PUF60 might be a recent evolutionary adaptation of the immune system. Alternatively, the activities of RNP-6 may be regulated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by other ways without affecting its abundance. Indeed, infection induced splicing remodeling is dependent on RNP-6, and knocking-down <italic>rnp-6</italic> affects splicing of genes whose splicing is regulated by infection, suggesting that RNP-6 activity is influenced by infection. Reduction of PUF60 by RNAi is sufficient to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, suggesting that PUF60 reduction induced by bacterial infection is a trigger of inflammation. This intriguing observation raises the question of how perturbation of splicing can activate immune responses. One potential explanation is aberrant splicing may produce immuno-stimulatory RNAs which can be detected by nucleic acid sensing PRRs, such as RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>), cGAS/STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mankan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2013</xref>) and PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Onomoto et al., 2012</xref>). Overexpression of PUF60, especially the mutated form, is able to reduce inflammation induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. The G281D mutation, which we identified in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> analogously augments the immunosuppressing activity of PUF60. These results indicate that the RNA binding motif where the mutation resides plays a crucial role in the control of immunity, probably through interacting with some unknown RNA species. Though both RNP-6 and PUF60 apparently suppress the immune response, the outcomes for survival upon pathogen challenge are different. This may reflect how the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules ultimately affect survival in different contexts. The E3 ubiquitin ligase ipaH9.8 from <italic>Shigella</italic> was reported to bind another splicing factor U2AF35 and modulate host cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okuda et al., 2005</xref>). Whether PUF60 is also targeted by bacterial factors remains to be investigated.</p><p>Hypomorphic mutations of PUF60 are known to cause a rare genetic disease called Verheij syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Chehadeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verheij et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggest a reduction of PUF60 activity may trigger inflammation, which could be one of the drivers of the pathology. Further examinations on the patient samples are needed to test this interesting possibility. PUF60 is also implicated in HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Whether PUF60 mediated immune regulation plays a role in these diseases awaits investigation. Targeting host splicing can also be an alternative therapeutic approach to antibiotic and multidrug resistant bacterial infection.</p><p>Our study paves the way to further explore the intriguing connection between splicing, lifespan and innate immunity in an evolutionarily conserved context. We propose that splicing factors might mediate a tradeoff between immunity and longevity, and further postulate that longevity could have arisen in some species by limiting inflammatory processes. Our results also raise multiple fundamental questions. How do the splicing factors RNP-6 and SFA-1 work to promote longevity, but compromise survival upon bacterial infection? Does RNP-6/PUF60 regulate immunity by interacting with RNA, and if yes, which RNA(s) is/are involved? How does the G281D mutation change the molecular functions of RNP-6/PUF60? Further studies are needed to precisely elucidate how splicing affects host responses towards infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental organism- <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>The following strains were used in this study: N2 (wildtype), <italic>rnp-6(dh1124), rnp-6(dh1125), rnp-6(dh1127), hlh-30(tm1978), rnp-6(dh1188), rnp-6(dh1127); wbmEx340[eft-3p::3xFLAG::sfa-1 cDNA::unc-54 3'UTR]; [myo-3p::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR], dhEx1132[rnp-6p::rnp-6; myo-2p::GFP]</italic> (RNP-6 OE#1)<italic>, dhEx1133[rnp-6p::rnp-6; myo-2p::GFP]</italic> (RNP-6 OE#2)<italic>, dhEx1134[rnp-6p::rnp-6; myo-2p::GFP]</italic> (RNP-6 OE#3)<italic>, pmk-1(km25), tir-1(tm3036), pmk-1(km25); dhEx1132[rnp-6p::rnp-6; myo-2p::GFP], rnp-6(dh1127); pmk-1(km25), daf-16(mu86), wbmEx340[eft-3p::3xFLAG::sfa-1 cDNA::unc-54 3'UTR]; [myo-3p::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR], rnp-6(dh1188); wbmEx340[eft-3p::3xFLAG::sfa-1 cDNA::unc-54 3'UTR]; [myo-3p::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR]</italic> and <italic>pmk-1(km25); wbmEx340[eft-3p::3xFLAG::sfa-1 cDNA::unc-54 3'UTR]; [myo-3p::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR].</italic> The animals were maintained at 20°C following standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Orane Visvikis (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. As you can see from the comments, the reviewers were rather positive about the manuscript and the possibility to publish it in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, they feel that there are too many requested work to allow a revision in two months. The consensus was therefore to reject the paper but to allow resubmission. If you decide to submit a revised version, it will be considered as a new submission but will likely be treated by the same reviewers. The decision 'Reject but allowing resubmission' gives you more time to revise the manuscript. We therefore encourage you to submit a new revised version of your manuscript that carefully addresses the point raised by the reviewers. If you feel that you cannot address the reviewer's comments, it is also possible to transfer the manuscript to another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this article, Kew et al. have used <italic>C. elegans</italic> model and mammalian cell lines to elegantly unravel the evolutionary conserved immune function of the splicing factor RNP6/PUF60. By combining numerous and complementary approaches (genetic screen, CRISPR gene editing, RNA-sequencing, in vivo survival assays, molecular and biochemical analysis), the authors provide strong evidence of the repressive immune function of RNP-6/PUF60 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, relying both on control of RNA splicing and gene expression, the latter lying upstream the <italic>pmk-1</italic>/p38 pathway. They also provide evidence that another splicing factor, namely SFA-1, work with RNP-6 to mediate host defense, underlying the importance of the RNA splicing function innate immunity. Finally, they show that PUF60 expression is repressed during infection of mammalian cell lines, which increases pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and promotes survival of infected cells. Overall, this well-conducted study reveals a novel function of PUF60 and contribute to enlarge the knowledge of a field in expansion. I would recommend this article for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) A major concern of this study relays on how survival assay were performed (partial or full lawn) which is not clear and may be of critical importance for the conclusion. Figure 4A: this survival assay testing <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi was apparently performed using plates with partial lawn of <italic>S. aureus</italic> as the authors state to confirm this result with a survival assay using full lawn plates (subsection “The activity of RNP-6 impairs immunity”). Is the survival assay with partial lawn of <italic>S. aureus</italic> their standard assay ? This need to be clarified in the next and in the Materials and methods. Indeed, it is not clear how the experiments with <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> and <italic>rnp-6(dh1125)</italic> in Figure 1H (as well as in Figure 1I-J with other pathogens) and Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J and K, or with the overexpressing OE strains (Figure 4D) were performed. Indeed, if based on the full lawn assay, the authors can conclude that the <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi phenotype, which display extend survival compared to control, is not a difference in bacterial exposure, it is not clear whether the phenotypes of rpn-6 G281D mutants or of the OE strains, which display enhanced susceptibility to pathogens (Esp) compared to control, are due to reduced immune response or reduced aversive behavior (and increased bacterial exposure) compared to N2. Full lawn experiment should be performed in order to conclude on the immune role of <italic>rnp-6</italic>. If partial lawn have been performed, the authors need to compare the bacterial lawn occupancy of RNP-6D281R mutants and the OE strains with N2. The author will be able to conclude on the immune regulatory function of RNP-6 only if RNP-6D281R mutant and N2 have the same avoidance behavior (and been exposed in a similar way to <italic>S. aureus</italic>).</p><p>2) As a splicing factor, rpn-6 affects RNA splicing. I believe it would improve the manuscript to specify how primer pairs have been designed so that qPCR experiments reveal an actual change in gene expression and not a change in RNA splicing (Figure 2A).</p><p>3) Figure 5GH and Figure 6H: condition of these experiments are rather surprising. While most of the <italic>pmk-1</italic> and <italic>rnp-6</italic> genetic experiment are made in animals infected by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the authors analyze the effect RNP6 on PMK-1 phosphorylation either in resting condition (RNAi) or during infection by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. It would greatly increase the quality of the conclusions to show 1) the level of P-PMK1 in N2i and <italic>rnp-6i</italic> animals infected by <italic>S. aureus</italic>; 2) the level of P-PMK1 in N2, <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> and RNP6 OE strain in the context of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. In addition, if anti-pmk1 (Kim et al., 2002) can be obtained, it would be good to blot total <italic>pmk-1</italic> to robustly show that variation of P-<italic>pmk-1</italic> are really changes in signaling rather a change in total <italic>pmk-1</italic> protein level.</p><p>4) I believe the author should cite the work of the Sasakawa group (Okuda et al., 2005) who had previously identified the Shigella NEL effector IpaH9.8 to bind RNA splicing factor U2AF35 to modulate host immune response. Although IpaH9.8 had later been shown to also target NEMO to control NF-κB and host immune response (Ashida et al. Nat Cell Biol 2010), it was shown that U2AF35 siRNA treatment reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in Shigella-infected cells HeLa (Okuda et al., 2005). Although this paper show opposite results in term of cytokine expression, it is a first evidence that modulation of a splicing factor, which is related to PUF60, during bacterial infection impacts immune responses, which reinforce the findings of Kew et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very solid investigation of how splicing factors influence stress and longevity signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that include experiments showing similar interactions in human cells. The role of RNA splicing in stress responses of animal cells is poorly studied. This study identifies a conserved RNA binding protein that plays important roles in stress responses of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells. Precise molecular mechanism have not been revealed, but the role of <italic>rnp-6</italic> and splicing in immune response are convincingly demonstrated. Furthermore, the experiments are well conceived and reported. The genetic controls are particularly robust.</p><p>1) Stress survival and longevity data – These assays can be notoriously variable between trials. Therefore, reporting of data from at least three independent trials is customary for these types of studies. The comparisons should be analyzes as individual trials as well as combined. These data can be provided in supporting files.</p><p>2) I have concerns over the use of the <italic>ret-1</italic> reporter system. It appears that the GFP and RFP are largely expressed is different tissues (head and intestine, respectively) and that the changes in ratio are largely attributed to changes in only GFP versus a true shift from one to the other. The authors should include data for changes in GFP and RFP in addition to the rations. Furthermore, controls for total expression of the reporter would be needed to be sure that these effects are not a reflection of changes in total expression in certain tissues, versus a true shift in splicing within common tissues.</p><p>3) Figures 5G-H and 6H – quantification of the representative data for Figure 5H is missing. Also, it is customary to include blots for total PMK-1 to determine if the effects are at the total level or protein modification level.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Kew et al. investigate the link between splicing and the immunity and longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and extend their study to a mammalian cell culture model. Because of my expertise, I restrict my comments on the experiments to those using <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>1) While the results are intriguing and would be of broad interest, I was concerned by Figure 3F, as in the infected sample, there are clearly larvae hatched inside that have a high GFP level and low mCherry level. This is a real problem. It indicates that (i) the experiments are not properly conducted (ii) the results involving differential splicing could be a result of differences that exist between different stages. Even if the worms shown were exceptional, it is notable that a significant number of the 83 genes alternatively spliced upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in wildtype animals are associated with aldicarb resistance. As alternative splicing is tissue as well as stage specific (e.g. neuron-specific isoforms for many genes), this raises the possibility that the results are due to a differential effect of infection on transcription in a single tissue (including through a general effect on cell viability or developmental speed). The same applies for the effect seen in the <italic>rnp-6</italic> mutant; changes in transcription within one tissue, or even subtle changes in developmental stage, would give the same result as alterations in splicing across tissues in an age-synchronized population.</p><p>2) Given the apparent strong effect on the ret reporter, which presumably should reflect endogenous splicing patterns, how is it that <italic>ret-1</italic> was not identified in the sequencing-based analysis? It is unfortunate that the authors did not generated this type of reporter for at least one of the genes they identified as undergoing differential splicing.</p><p>3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows sequencing reads coverage for several genes. If the figure is only matching pairs for their paired end 2x75nt sequencing, which it should be for this type of analysis, the level of intronic signal for several genes is unexpected. So, when they write, &quot;The splicing patterns of these genes are not significantly affected by <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection or the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutation&quot;, what is the criterion for &quot;significant&quot;, especially if one looks at the last example, <italic>cebp-1</italic>, for which there is a stark difference regarding retention of the last intron between wild-type and <italic>rnp-6</italic> samples. [typo: <italic>S. aurues</italic> in figure]. This is particularly relevant given the known links between <italic>cebp-1</italic>, its 3' UTR (pubmed/28673818), <italic>pmk-1</italic> (pubmed/27927209) and innate immunity.</p><p>4) To understand the basis of altered resistance, it is standard in the field to perform simple tests to assay the extent of bacterial colonization.</p><p>5) Interpretation of Figure 2E is complicated by the fact that the constitutive expression level of at least one of the genes under study differs between wild-type and mutant worms. Thus, for <italic>nlp-30</italic>, there is the same fold-change after infection in mutant and wild-type, so the induction is not <italic>rnp-6</italic> dependent. One therefore wonders whether their strategy for gene selection (Figure 2C) is entirely appropriate.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolutionarily conserved regulation of immunity by the splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors reveal the role of specific components of the splicing machinery in the modulation of immunity, which is important because the role of splicing in immunity is still poorly characterized. The merit of this article is that it illuminates a novel aspect of innate immune regulation in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that might be conserved in other animals.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Despite the additional data provided, it is still not clear how RNP-6 impacts the PMK-1 pathway during <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. &quot;RNP-6 exerts its inhibitory effects on immunity by suppressing the activity of PMK-1&quot; (L 305-306) is over-stated as the authors do not have proof that <italic>rnp-6</italic> impact the activation (phosphorylation) of PMK-1 during infection. Indeed:</p><p>– The authors find no effect of <italic>rnp-6</italic> OE strain or <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant on the phospho-level of PMK-1 during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (rebuttal experiment).</p><p>– The authors state that <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi reduces P-PMK-1 during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, but this result is rather questionable considering the western-blot shown (rebuttal). There are huge differences in total protein levels as revealed by the loading control (actin), but these differences are not as strong in total PMK-1. This either suggest that 1) that the level of total PMK-1 varies, or 2) the experiment is not well conducted.</p><p>– Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: control of total PMK-1 has not been provided. In addition, the quantification of this blot clearly indicates that there is a huge variation between experiments, and that P-PMK1 variation between conditions is not statistically significant.</p><p>I don't think this affect the quality of the manuscript, but the author should be accurate in their interpretation, and the their conclusion modified accordingly (subsection “RNP-6 inhibits PMK-1 MAPK signaling”). Similarly, the text should be changed in the Discussion &quot;How altering splicing can lead to activation of PMK-1.…&quot;.</p><p>2) As requested, the authors have performed bacterial lawn occupancy experiments and found it is increased in <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant compared to WT, which still leaves a doubt on a potential lack of avoidance behavior of the <italic>rnp-6</italic> mutant (rebuttal). Fortunately, the author also provide full lawn survival experiments as requested and found the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D and <italic>rnp-6</italic> OE strains to also display Esp compared to WT animals, indicating that these strains indeed have an immune defect. The authors keep describing this immune mechanism as &quot;resistance&quot; which I believe is not an appropriate term, especially in this new version of the manuscript where the authors, to answer reviewer 3, now assess the bacterial burden. Resistance, as defined by the capacity to limit bacterial burden, is opposed to tolerance, defined as ability to limit health impact of a given pathogen burden (see Schneider and Ayres Nat Rev Immunol 2008, Medzhitov, Schneider and Soares, Science 2012). In this type of survival assays, where animals are constantly exposed and fed with pathogenic bacteria, it is difficult to assess the resistance capacity. Assessing resistance capacity is easier to detect when animals are transfer onto non-pathogenic food (Sifri et al., Infect Immun 2003). Accordingly, the colonization assays, performed on animals constantly fed for 24h on <italic>S. aureus</italic>, show similar bacterial burden between control and <italic>rnp-6</italic>G281D mutant, <italic>rnp-6</italic> OE strains or <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi treated animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-H). Rather, these full lawn survival assays, controlled by similar colonization assays, allow to assess the tolerance capacity of the strains. Together, these results indicate that the immune function of <italic>rnp-6</italic> relies on a tolerance mechanism. This should be indicated in the text which, I believe, would improve the quality of the article. However, the term resistance, which has been repeatedly found though-out the manuscript, is miss-used and should be replaced by i.e.: &quot;decreased sensitivity&quot; or &quot;increased survival&quot; and only when appropriate, by tolerance. Whether <italic>rnp-6</italic> has also resistance immune branch should not be excluded, as it was difficult to assess in this experimental setting. Please also correct : &quot;<italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi did not affect <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial burden, suggesting the resistance is caused by independent mechanisms&quot;.</p><p>3) There are still problems with the data presented in Figure 3 and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Indeed, there is no demonstration of a correlation between splicing as measured by PCR and using reporter genes. Thus, they neither &quot;generate this type of reporter for at least one of the genes they identified as undergoing differential splicing&quot;, nor do they provide PCR evidence to support their observations with the <italic>ret-1</italic> reporter. As mCherry and GFP have different half-lives, changes in fluorescence intensity under a pathological situation need not reflect a change in splicing. The magnitude of the change of GFP expression is considerably higher than that of mCherry; it seems that a change in splicing is not the most important effect here.

Figure 4A: this survival assay testing rnp-6 RNAi was apparently performed using plates with partial lawn of <italic>S. aureus</italic> as the authors state to confirm this result with a survival assay using full lawn plates (subsection “The activity of RNP-6 impairs immunity”). Is the survival assay with partial lawn of <italic>S. aureus</italic> their standard assay ? This need to be clarified in the next and in the Materials and methods. Indeed, it is not clear how the experiments with rnp-6 (dh1127) and rnp-6 (dh1125) in Figure 1H (as well as in Figure 1I-J with other pathogens) and Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J and K, or with the overexpressing OE strains (Figure 4D) were performed. Indeed, if based on the full lawn assay, the authors can conclude that the rnp-6 RNAi phenotype, which display extend survival compared to control, is not a difference in bacterial exposure, it is not clear whether the phenotypes of rpn-6 G281D mutants or of the OE strains, which display enhanced susceptibility to pathogens (Esp) compared to control, are due to reduced immune response or reduced aversive behavior (and increased bacterial exposure) compared to N2. Full lawn experiment should be performed in order to conclude on the immune role of rnp-6. If partial lawn have been performed, the authors need to compare the bacterial lawn occupancy of RNP-6D281R mutants and the OE strains with N2. The author will be able to conclude on the immune regulatory function of RNP-6 only if RNP-6D281R mutant and N2 have the same avoidance behavior (and been exposed in a similar way to <italic>S. aureus</italic>).</p></disp-quote><p>Although we used partial lawn for our standard assays, we also performed the infection survival experiments using full lawn <italic>S. aureus</italic> plates.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57591-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Clearly, both <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutants and RNP-6 overexpressing animals exhibit Esp on full lawn <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection plates, indicating that the Esp phenotype cannot be explained by differential exposure to bacteria.We also compared the lawn occupancy of <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutants to N2. We observed a general increase of lawn occupancy in all strains during the course of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, which is probably due to physical inactivity caused by advanced infection. Interestingly, <italic>rnp6(1127)</italic> mutants had a higher lawn occupancy compared to N2. This could be explained by the more rapid progression of infection in this strain. Another infection sensitive mutant strain, <italic>pmk-1(km25)</italic>, displayed a similar phenotype, suggesting higher lawn occupancy may be a common phenotype of infection sensitive strains as their physical activity declines faster due to quicker progression of the infection process.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57591-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>All in all, we conclude that differential exposure to bacteria is not the cause of the Esp phenotype of <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> and RNP-6 overexpressing animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As a splicing factor, rpn-6 affects RNA splicing.

We corrected the corresponding figure in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This does not affect the conclusion of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 5G-H and 6H: condition of these experiments are rather surprising. While most of the pmk-1 and rnp-6 genetic experiment are made in animals infected by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the authors analyze the effect RNP6 on PMK-1 phosphorylation either in resting condition (RNAi) or during infection by P. aeruginosa. It would greatly increase the quality of the conclusions to show 1) the level of P-PMK1 in N2i and rnp-6i animals infected by S. aureus; 2) the level of P-PMK1 in N2, rnp-6(dh1127) and RNP6 OE strain in the context of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. In addition, if anti-pmk1 (Kim et al., 2002) can be obtained, it would be good to blot total pmk-1 to robustly show that variation of P-pmk-1 are really changes in signaling rather a change in total pmk-1 protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the total PMK-1 blots for the <italic>rnp-6</italic> and <italic>sfa-1</italic> RNAi Western blots (see Figures 5G and 6H).</p><p>We also measured the relative levels of phospho-PMK-1 in <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected animals.</p><p>Generally, we did not observe any significant effects of <italic>S. aureus</italic> on the levels of phosphoPMK-1.

Although IpaH9.8 had later been shown to also target NEMO to control NF-κB and host immune response (Ashida et al. Nat Cell Biol 2010), it was shown that U2AF35 siRNA treatment reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in Shigella-infected cells HeLa (Okuda et al., 2005). Although this paper show opposite results in term of cytokine expression, it is a first evidence that modulation of a splicing factor, which is related to PUF60, during bacterial infection impacts immune responses, which reinforce the findings of Kew et al.</p></disp-quote><p>The reference has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Stress survival and longevity data – These assays can be notoriously variable between trials.

It appears that the GFP and RFP are largely expressed is different tissues (head and intestine, respectively) and that the changes in ratio are largely attributed to changes in only GFP versus a true shift from one to the other. The authors should include data for changes in GFP and RFP in addition to the rations.

Because of my expertise, I restrict my comments on the experiments to those using <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>1) While the results are intriguing and would be of broad interest, I was concerned by Figure 3F, as in the infected sample, there are clearly larvae hatched inside that have a high GFP level and low mCherry level. This is a real problem. It indicates that (i) the experiments are not properly conducted (ii) the results involving differential splicing could be a result of differences that exist between different stages. Even if the worms shown were exceptional, it is notable that a significant number of the 83 genes alternatively spliced upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in wildtype animals are associated with aldicarb resistance. As alternative splicing is tissue as well as stage specific (e.g. neuron-specific isoforms for many genes), this raises the possibility that the results are due to a differential effect of infection on transcription in a single tissue (including through a general effect on cell viability or developmental speed). The same applies for the effect seen in the rnp-6 mutant; changes in transcription within one tissue, or even subtle changes in developmental stage, would give the same result as alterations in splicing across tissues in an age-synchronized population.</p></disp-quote><p>The worms were synchronized with special care, as <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> has a slight developmental delay. We did the egg lay sequentially to ensure the synchronization of different strains. Animals were also examined visibly before experiments to make sure that they are well-synchronized.</p><p>To further exclude the possibility of the effects of staging, we repeated the splicing PCR of <italic>prg-2</italic>, <italic>gyg-1</italic> and <italic>tos-1</italic> on day2 adult animals.</p><fig id="sa2fig9"><label>Author response image 9.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57591-resp-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The splicing patterns of day2 adults are generally consistent with those of day 1 young adults, except for <italic>gyg-1</italic>, for which day 2 <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> animals responded to infection comparably to N2 animals. In day 1 young adults, the <italic>gyg-1</italic> splicing change induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection is partially suppressed in <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> animals. Because of the special attention given for the synchronization of the animals and the reproducibility of the results in another life stage (Day 2 adulthood), the splicing changes we observed are unlikely to be caused by lack of synchronization or subtle changes in developmental stage, but rather to be the results of infection and/or the <italic>rnp-6</italic> mutation.We also repeated the <italic>ret-1</italic> reporter experiment with FUDR sterilized animals, which eliminates hatching of larvae, and we obtained similar results to the experiments performed without FUDR. We quantified the signals from anterior gut as this is the relevant tissue for bacterial infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>.</p><p>Given the tight staging, it seems less likely that tissue composition is different between genotypes. If there are tissue specific effects (e.g. differential alternative splicing in the nervous system) it still would be due to splicing, and this is inherently interesting, but lies beyond the scope of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the apparent strong effect on the ret reporter, which presumably should reflect endogenous splicing patterns, how is it that ret-1 was not identified in the sequencing-based analysis?

We collected the RNA at post-infection 4 hours whereas the imaging of <italic>ret-1</italic> reporter was done at post-infection 9 hours. The effects on <italic>ret-1</italic> maybe a delayed response. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the <italic>ret-1</italic> reporter imaging experiment at post-infection 4 hours.</p><fig id="sa2fig10"><label>Author response image 10.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57591-resp-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>At this earlier timepoint, the effects on the <italic>ret=</italic>1 reporter were very small compared to that of the later timepoint, which may be one of the reasons why <italic>ret-1</italic> was not identified in the sequencing-based analysis.

If the figure is only matching pairs for their paired end 2x75nt sequencing, which it should be for this type of analysis, the level of intronic signal for several genes is unexpected. So, when they write, &quot;The splicing patterns of these genes are not significantly affected by <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection or the rnp-6 G281D mutation&quot;, what is the criterion for &quot;significant&quot;, especially if one looks at the last example, cebp-1, for which there is a stark difference regarding retention of the last intron between wild-type and rnp-6 samples.

Indeed:</p><p>– The authors find no effect of rnp-6 OE strain or rnp-6 G281D mutant on the phospho-level of PMK-1 during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (rebuttal experiment).</p><p>– The authors state that rnp-6 RNAi reduces P-PMK-1 during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, but this result is rather questionable considering the western-blot shown (rebuttal). There are huge differences in total protein levels as revealed by the loading control (actin), but these differences are not as strong in total PMK-1. This either suggest that 1) that the level of total PMK-1 varies, or 2) the experiment is not well conducted.</p><p>– Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: control of total PMK-1 has not been provided. In addition, the quantification of this blot clearly indicates that there is a huge variation between experiments, and that P-PMK1 variation between conditions is not statistically significant.</p><p>I don't think this affect the quality of the manuscript, but the author should be accurate in their interpretation, and the their conclusion modified accordingly (subsection “RNP-6 inhibits PMK-1 MAPK signaling”). Similarly, the text should be changed in the Discussion &quot;How altering splicing can lead to activation of PMK-1.…&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We consulted other experts from the field concerning pathogen dependent PMK-1 phosphorylation. Although it is well known that <italic>pmk-1</italic> is required for resistance to bacterial pathogens in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and mutations or treatments that induce phosphorylation of PMK-1 lead to enhanced survival (Cao and Aballay, 2016; Kim et al., 2004; Park et al., 2018; Pukkila-Worley et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2020), whether bacterial pathogens actually induce phosphorylation of PMK-1 is debated.</p><p><italic>S. aureus</italic> does not activate PMK-1 phosphorylation (Dr. Javier Irazoqui, personal communications), which we also confirmed. On the other hand, PA14 infection leads to high variability of phospho-PMK-1 levels (Dr. Read Pukkilla-Worley, personal communication), which is also consistent with our data. Conceivably these differences might reflect differences in timing, or culture conditions.</p><p>Therefore, the absence of PMK-1 phosphorylation upon infection is not inconsistent with previous findings, and does not compromise the results from survival epistasis and phosphoPMK-1 blots of <italic>rnp-6i</italic> treated animals, which indicate <italic>pmk-1</italic> acts downstream of <italic>rnp-6</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion section according to the reviewers’ suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As requested, the authors have performed bacterial lawn occupancy experiments and found it is increased in rnp-6 G281D mutant compared to WT, which still leaves a doubt on a potential lack of avoidance behavior of the rnp-6 mutant (rebuttal). Fortunately, the author also provide full lawn survival experiments as requested and found the rnp-6 G281D and rnp-6 OE strains to also display Esp compared to WT animals, indicating that these strains indeed have an immune defect. The authors keep describing this immune mechanism as &quot;resistance&quot; which I believe is not an appropriate term, especially in this new version of the manuscript where the authors, to answer reviewer 3, now assess the bacterial burden. Resistance, as defined by the capacity to limit bacterial burden, is opposed to tolerance, defined as ability to limit health impact of a given pathogen burden (see Schneider and Ayres Nat Rev Immunol 2008, Medzhitov, Schneider and Soares, Science 2012). In this type of survival assays, where animals are constantly exposed and fed with pathogenic bacteria, it is difficult to assess the resistance capacity. Assessing resistance capacity is easier to detect when animals are transfer onto non-pathogenic food (Sifri et al., Infect Immun 2003). Accordingly, the colonization assays, performed on animals constantly fed for 24h on <italic>S. aureus</italic>, show similar bacterial burden between control and rnp-6G281D mutant, rnp-6 OE strains or rnp-6 RNAi treated animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-H). Rather, these full lawn survival assays, controlled by similar colonization assays, allow to assess the tolerance capacity of the strains. Together, these results indicate that the immune function of rnp-6 relies on a tolerance mechanism. This should be indicated in the text which, I believe, would improve the quality of the article. However, the term resistance, which has been repeatedly found though-out the manuscript, is miss-used and should be replaced by i.e.: &quot;decreased sensitivity&quot; or &quot;increased survival&quot; and only when appropriate, by tolerance. Whether rnp-6 has also resistance immune branch should not be excluded, as it was difficult to assess in this experimental setting. Please also correct : &quot;rnp-6 RNAi did not affect <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial burden, suggesting the resistance is caused by independent mechanisms&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the difference between resistance and tolerance/survival. We have modified the manuscript by omitting the word pathogen resistance, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are still problems with the data presented in Figure 3 and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Indeed, there is no demonstration of a correlation between splicing as measured by PCR and using reporter genes. Thus, they neither &quot;generate this type of reporter for at least one of the genes they identified as undergoing differential splicing&quot;, nor do they provide PCR evidence to support their observations with the ret-1 reporter. As mCherry and GFP have different half-lives, changes in fluorescence intensity under a pathological situation need not reflect a change in splicing. The magnitude of the change of GFP expression is considerably higher than that of mCherry; it seems that a change in splicing is not the most important effect here. Further, according to the dot plot, the GFP level for the vast majority of &quot;Infected rnp-6&quot; worms is below that for the majority of &quot;rnp-6(dh1127)&quot; worms, so the photomicrograph is totally unrepresentative and very misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Because this reporter had been previously published as reflecting splicing (Heintz et al., 2017; Kuroyanagi et al., 2013), we took it at face value, but are grateful that the reviewers pointed out possible different interpretations of this reporter.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns, we performed RT-PCR to assess the relative abundance of the two isoforms of <italic>ret-1</italic>. (see Figure 4C and D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>First, we confirmed that both <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection induced <italic>ret-1</italic> exon 5</p><p>skipping, although the effects seem to be less dramatic as indicated by the reporter system, suggesting that the splicing reporter might not truly reflect the splicing of the endogenous <italic>ret-1</italic> transcript.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that the <italic>rnp-6(dh1127)</italic> mutation did not inhibit the infection induced splicing of <italic>ret-1</italic>. Rather, the basal level of exon 5 skipping is slightly elevated in the <italic>rnp-6</italic> mutants. These observations were not reflected by the splicing reporter.</p><p>Multiple explanations could potentially account for the discrepancy of the two methods. First, we focused on a specific tissue (anterior gut) for the splicing reporter experiments whereas RT-PCR reflects the splicing events averaged over the whole animals. Second, some elements, such as splicing enhancers, may not be included into the reporter, which can lead to different splicing patterns compared to endogenous <italic>ret-1</italic> transcript. And finally, the signals from the reporter might reflect other processes, including mRNA and/or protein stability, translation and protein degradation.</p><p>We conclude that the <italic>ret-1</italic> splicing reporter does not accurately reflect the splicing of <italic>ret-1</italic> endogenous transcript. Therefore, we decided to remove the relevant data from the manuscript (Figure 3E and Figure 4C).</p><p>To replace Figure 4C, we checked how <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi affects the splicing (as measured by RTPCR) of <italic>prg-2</italic>, <italic>gyg-1</italic> and <italic>tos-1</italic>, which we identified to show <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D dependence upon infection (Figure 3) (see Figure 4C and D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>We observed that <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi affected <italic>prg-2</italic> and <italic>tos-1</italic> splicing, but had no observable effect on <italic>gyg-1</italic>. <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi promoted the splicing of <italic>prg-2</italic> intron 1, similar to the effect of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (Figure 3B), but opposite to <italic>rnp-6 G281D</italic> mutant. On the other hand, <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi inhibited the splicing of <italic>tos-1</italic> intron 1, and this splicing pattern was similar to what we observed for the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutant (Figure 3D).</p><p>In conclusion, the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutation inhibits infection induced <italic>prg-2</italic> intron 1 splicing, whereas <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi promotes the splicing event. In this regard, the <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D mutation resembles a gain-of function. However, both <italic>rnp-6</italic> G281D and <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi reduce the splicing of <italic>tos-1</italic> intron 1. Therefore, the G281D mutation and <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi result in partially opposite and also overlap splicing, similar to the results of transcript abundance of immune-genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Nevertheless, these results confirm that <italic>rnp-6</italic> RNAi affects splicing of the genes whose splicing is moderated by infection, strengthening the role of RNP-6 in infection induced splicing remodeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statements like, &quot;By contrast, we observed that the infection sensitive G281D substitution mutant of RNP-6 had a consistently suppressed phosphorylation levels of PMK-1 under <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection condition in multiple biological replicates, although this did not reach statistical significance due variability of phospho-PMK-1 levels between replicates&quot; are not appropriate.
