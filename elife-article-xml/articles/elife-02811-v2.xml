(UCP1). Previously, we reported that the TATA-binding protein associated factor 7L (TAF7L) is an important regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) differentiation. In this study, we show that TAF7L also serves as a molecular switch between brown fat and muscle lineages in vivo and in vitro. In adipose tissue, TAF7L-containing TFIID complexes associate with PPARγ to mediate DNA looping between distal enhancers and core promoter elements. Our findings suggest that the presence of the tissue-specific TAF7L subunit in TFIID functions to promote long-range chromatin interactions during BAT lineage specification.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02811.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02811.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02811.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammals produce two distinct types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue (white fat) is the more common type and is used to store energy; brown adipose tissue (brown fat) is mostly found in young animals and infants, and it plays an important role in dissipating energy as heat rather than storing it in fat for future use. In adults, higher levels of brown fat are associated with lower levels of fat overall, so there is considerable interest in learning more about this form of fat to help address rising levels of obesity in the world.</p><p>Building on previous work in which they showed that a gene control protein called TAF7L has a central role in the development of the cells that make up white adipose tissue, Zhou et al. now show that this protein also helps to regulate the development of brown adipose tissue.</p><p>Mice lacking the gene for this protein developed embryos with 40% less brown fat than wild-type mice with the gene. Moreover, these mice developed muscle-like cells in the regions that should have contained brown fat. Gene expression analysis revealed that ‘knocking out’ the gene for TAF7L changed the expression of more than a thousand genes in these mice.</p><p>Zhou et al. suggest that TAF7L works as a ‘molecular switch’ that determines whether certain precursor cells (called mesenchymal stem cells) go on to become brown fat cells or muscle cells. A future challenge will be to devise interventions to regulate the activity or levels of TAF7L as a potential means of modulating brown fat depots in animals and humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02811.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02811.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>PPARγ</kwd><kwd>DNA looping</kwd><kwd>UCP1</kwd><kwd>BAT</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Haiying</given-names></name><name><surname>Grubisic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TAF7L acts as a molecular switch that regulates the development of mesenchymal stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Recent studies found that adult humans retain active BAT depots capable of sustaining elevated basal metabolic rates compared to WAT and those higher levels of BAT correlate with lower body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carey and Kingwell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chechi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kajimura and Saito, 2014</xref>). These findings inspired heightened efforts to better understand the formation of BAT during mammalian development. Previously, we showed that TAF7L, an orphan TBP-associated factor cooperates with PPARγ in directing WAT gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>). Given the central role of PPARγ in both WAT and BAT development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kajimura et al., 2010</xref>), we wondered whether TAF7L might also serve as a co-activator regulating the formation of BAT.</p><p>To test this hypothesis and assess the functional requirement for TAF7L during BAT development, we performed haematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining and immunostaining using FABP4 and UCP1 antibodies to delineate regions of BAT in wild-type (WT) and <italic>Taf7l</italic> knockout (KO) embryos. As expected, FABP4 stains both WAT and BAT, while UCP1 only stains BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pedersen et al., 2001</xref>), which is filled with multilocular lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that UCP1<sup>+</sup> BAT in <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mice become largely disorganized, is significantly reduced in size and contains decreased lipid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Measurement of dissected BAT pads showed a ∼40% weight reduction of BAT in <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO animals compared to WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Intriguingly, skeletal muscle-like tissue emerges and invades regions that normally contain BAT in <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as revealed by a more pronounced red color of <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO BAT and the staining of pan-skeletal muscle marker myosin heavy chain (MYHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beylkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>).

Over a thousand genes exhibited altered expression levels by &gt;threefold upon <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO. In particular, BAT-selective genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Pgc1α</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, and <italic>Scd1</italic> involved in brown fat differentiation, thermogenesis, and mitochondrial function became significantly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ohno et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with the observed enhanced skeletal muscle morphological phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we observed a concomitant up-regulation of skeletal muscle genes including <italic>Myh1-8</italic>, <italic>Myf5</italic>, and <italic>Pax3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of TAF7L also led to activation of select genes in the formation of cartilage and bone development, but the majority of up-regulated genes appear to be involved in skeletal muscle development and function. We speculate that because BAT and muscle share common MYF5<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> dermotomal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kajimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Seale and Lazar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Seale et al., 2011</xref>), this relationship might favor the switch from BAT to skeletal muscle as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Our findings suggest that TAF7L tips the balance in favor of BAT development at the expense of skeletal muscle.</p><p>To examine the effects of TAF7L loss on brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro, we used C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells which is able to form multiple cell lineages including adipocytes, muscle, cartilage, and bone. We first depleted TAF7L levels in C3H10T1/2 cells by RNA interference using previously described shTAF7L and control shGFP constructs followed by induction of BAT differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>). As expected, we observed efficient formation of round fat cells peaking at day 2 post-induction in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with shGFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, TAF7L-depleted C3H10T1/2 cells formed elongated muscle-like cells rather than round fat laden adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). mRNA analysis of post-induction cells (day2) revealed that specific muscle markers (<italic>Myf5</italic>, <italic>Myod1</italic>, and <italic>Mef2c</italic>) become activated in cells treated with shTAF7L, in some cases reaching up to ∼30% of their expression level in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). At the same time, protein (PPARγ and UCP1) and mRNA (<italic>Pgc1α</italic>, <italic>Ucp1</italic>, and <italic>Cidea</italic>) levels of brown adipocyte markers become significantly reduced 5 days post-induction, suggesting an efficient blockade of brown fat differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We confirmed these results using primary WT and <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our findings suggest that loss of TAF7L shifts mesenchymal stem cells in culture from adopting an adipocyte fate toward formation of muscle-like cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02811.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TAF7L bidirectionally regulates BAT/muscle lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2 days (2D) and 5 days (5D) post-induced control (shCNTL) and TAF7L knockdown (shTAF7L) C3H10T1/2 cells stained with Oil Red O.

Here, we wanted to confirm this interaction in C3H10T1/2 cells upon brown fat induction. By using sequential immunoprecipitations of doubly tagged TAF7L (FLAG&amp;V5), followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and western blotting, we found that TAF7L pulls down a subset of TAFs normally associated with the prototypical TFIID complex. Although this coIPed complex contained a number of canonical TFIID TAF subunits, we nevertheless suspect that it may represent a fat-specific and structurally distinct complex (Fat-TFIID) because it behaved in a manner distinct from canonical TFIID by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). These immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that PPARγ co-purifies with TAF7L in the Fat-TFIID complex from differentiated C3H10T1/2 cells but not from control FLAG-V5-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) nor with canonical TFIID lacking TAF7L (data not shown). Although we failed to detect PRDM16 in these affinity purification experiments, we did find that ectopically expressed TAF7L and PRDM16 associate with each other in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that TAF7L-containing Fat-TFIID has gained the ability to bind endogenous PPARγ, which we speculate might facilitate its association with distinct cofactors such as PRDM16 in BAT or TLE3 in WAT to differentially regulate brown and white adipocyte formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02811.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TAF7L within a Fat-TFIID associates with PPARγ and facilitates DNA looping formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Silver staining shows co-immunoprecipitated proteins in FLAG-V5-GFP-expressing (GFP, lane 1) and FLAG-V5-TAF7L-expressing (TAF7L, lane 2) C3H10T1/2 differentiated fat cells.

Due to the presence of rosiglitazone in the differentiation regime, our previous ChIP-seq analysis of C3H10T1/2-derived fat cells represented a mixture of white and brown fat cells, as manifested by enhanced <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Elovl3</italic>, and <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>). Here, we have re-analyzed the binding site data for TAF7L, TBP, and PPARγ focusing on loci of activated BAT-selective genes (<italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Prdm16</italic>, and <italic>Ucp1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, TAF7L and PPARγ co-occupy overlapping regions at the <italic>Prdm16</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> loci in post-differentiated (-post) cells, but not at control genes (<italic>Ajap1</italic> and <italic>Bmod2)</italic> nor to the same genes in pre-differentiated cells (-pre). These findings suggest that PPARγ and TAF7L likely function as a coupled activator–coactivator pair that regulates BAT-specific gene transcription much as we previously described for WAT differentiation.</p><p>To extend our analysis of TAF7L mechanisms in regulating fat-specific gene transcription, we next employed chromatin conformation capture (3C) to assess its participation in transcription factor-mediated long distance DNA looping at two TAF7L-activated genes <italic>Cidea</italic> and <italic>Scd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). These two target genes are bound by TAF7L and PPARγ both at their core promoters as well as at their distal enhancers located ∼10 kb away. In contrast, TBP only binds at the core promoters of these genes. Our 3C results revealed the likely formation of DNA looping between core promoters and distal enhancers in WT BAT for both loci while significantly reduced looping was seen in BAT lacking TAF7L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest that the presence/incorporation of TAF7L into the putative Fat-TFIID complex likely mediates or enhances long-range chromatin transactions that influence BAT cell fate.</p><p>Taken in aggregate, our findings strongly suggest that TAF7L may serve as a key component of an alternative TFIID complex that favors brown fat formation vs muscle lineages. We do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms driving the enhanced formation of skeletal muscle upon loss of TAF7L, but we speculate that TAF7L depletion decreases the transcription of BAT-selective genes, which might indirectly de-repress muscle-selective genes thereby switching precursor cells toward a skeletal muscle lineage. Moreover, the presence of TAF7L potentiates the efficient participation of a specialized Fat-TFIID complex in long-range chromatin interactions. Such a DNA looping mechanism is likely mediated through association with the fat-specific transcription factor PPARγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These new findings and our previous studies support the notion that TAF7L functions as a common cofactor regulator required for both WAT and BAT development.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Vectors and plasmids</title><p>Full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP) or <italic>Taf7l</italic> cDNAs were inserted into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 vector to construct pCMV-FLAG-V5-GFP/TAF7L or into pCS2+ vector to construct pCS2+HA-TAF7L; full-length PRDM16 cDNA was inserted into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 vector to construct pCMV-FLAG-PRDM16.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>TAF4 (612054; BD, San Jose, CA), TBP (62126; abcam, Cambridge, MA), V5 (R960-25; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), HA (9110; abcam), FLAG (F31655; Sigma, Saint Louis, MI) MYHC (05-716; Millipore, Billerica, MA), FABP4 (66682; abcam), UCP1(10983; abcam), TAF7L (prepared in-house, Covance, Denver, PA), Pol II (monoclonal 8WG16, protein-A purified), PPARγ (sc-7196), ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (A2220; Sigma), Anti-V5-agarose affinity gel (A7345; Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Cells culture, stable cell line establishment</title><p>C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>C3H10T1/2 cells stably expressing FLAG-V5-GFP/TAF7L were established by transfection of the pCMV-FLAG-V5-GFP/TAF7L plasmids followed by 2 weeks of 1 µg/µl neomycin selection.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Brown adipocyte differentiation, Oil red O staining, and C2C12 myogenesis</title><p>For adipogenesis, C3H10T1/2, control and FLAG-TAF7L-expressing C2C12, and FLAG-V5-GFP/TAF7L-expressing C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Jim Kadonaga, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript “TAF7L Modulates Brown Adipose Tissue Formation” by Zhou et al. provides new evidence for the role of TAF7L in brown fat development. Brown and white fat are now appreciated to come from different developmental lineages, and the transcriptional control of their development is an area of active research. The work presented in this paper suggests an important role for a new molecular player, TAF7L. While the data shown are quite exciting, additional experiments, particularly BAT-specific studies, should be performed to support the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors used 10T1/2 cells to study the mechanism whereby TAF7L modulates brown fat development. TAF7L was overexpressed, and the complex containing this protein was purified and shown to contain PPARg. In a previous paper, the authors had observed that these two proteins interact in 293T cells. Since PPARg is required for white and brown adipocyte development, it is not evident how this interaction specifically modulates brown adipogenesis. To address this point, the authors performed ChIP-Seq and found that TAF7L and PPARg co-occupy overlapping regions of PRDM16 and Ucp1 in post-differentiated cells. To clarify this line of investigation, the authors should address the following questions.</p><p>a) What other proteins were in the TAF7L complex? Were there any brown-fat enriched proteins that TAF7L interacts with such as PRDM16, PGC1a, or EHMT1?</p><p>b) Might TAF7L modulate PPARg selectivity for PRDM16 (and brown fat) vs. TLE3 (and white fat)?</p><p>2) In their previous paper (Zhou et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2013), the authors showed that white fat development (in vitro and in vivo) is disrupted in the absence of TAF7L. This finding argues for a broader role of TAF7L in adipogenesis (or perhaps even more broadly in development). As highlighted in point 1, the authors should address how TAF7L is specifically involved in brown fat development.

As a significant advancement of our original finding that TAF7L ablation disrupts white fat tissue development (Zhou et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2013), we report that TAF7L forms a key component of an alternative Fat-TFIID complex that works in conjunction with PPARγ via a DNA looping mechanism to modulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) formation.</p><p>A note from the editors appended below outlines the critical changes to our manuscript that were recommended by the BRE and reviewers:</p><p><italic>- Two points (Major Points 1a, 3) involve data that the authors probably already have</italic>.</p><p><italic>- Several issues (Major Points 1b, 2, 5) could be addressed simply by discussing them in the text</italic>.</p><p><italic>- Major Points 4 and 6 would make it a better paper, but it could be argued that such experiments are beyond the scope of this study. It's up to the authors whether they want to strengthen this work, particularly with regard to brown fat development and physiology</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate these many useful suggestions from reviewers, which has further strengthened and broadened this study. In response to the reviewers’ comments, we have now included new data to address major points 1a, 3, and 6. Below, we also address points 1b, 2, 4 and 5, which includes suggestions that we believe are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Major</italic> <italic>points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, the authors used 10T1/2 cells to study the mechanism whereby TAF7L modulates brown fat development. TAF7L was overexpressed, and the complex containing this protein was purified and shown to contain PPARg. In a previous paper, the authors had observed that these two proteins interact in 293T cells. Since PPARg is required for white and brown adipocyte development, it is not evident how this interaction specifically modulates brown adipogenesis. To address this point, the authors performed ChIP-Seq and found that TAF7L and PPARg co-occupy overlapping regions of PRDM16 and Ucp1 in post-differentiated cells. To clarify this line of investigation, the authors should address the following questions</italic>.</p><p><italic>a) What other proteins were in the TAF7L complex? Were there any brown-fat enriched proteins</italic> <italic>that TAF7L interacts with such as PRDM16, PGC1a, or EHMT1?</italic></p><p>Although we made multiple attempts, we were unable to recover sufficient levels of protein from the IP experiments using adipocytes to perform unambiguous protein identification. However, we did find that TAF7L can interact with PRDM16 and be coIP'd when they are expressed in 293T cells. We have now included this new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>b) Might TAF7L modulate PPARg selectivity for</italic> <italic>PRDM16 (and brown fat) vs. TLE3 (and white fat)?</italic></p><p>We have not tested the association between TLE3 with TAF7L in WAT, but we did find that TAF7L can associate with PRDM16 when ectopically expressed in 293T cells. We have now revised the text to read: Although we failed to detect PRDM16 in these affinity purification experiments, we did find that ectopically expressed TAF7L and PRDM16 associate with each other in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that TAF7L-containing Fat-TFIID has gained the ability to bind endogenous PPARγ we speculate which might facilitate its association with distinct cofactors such as PRDM16 in BAT or TLE3 in WAT to differentially regulate brown and white adipocyte formation.</p><p><italic>2) In their previous paper (Zhou et al.,</italic> eLife, <italic>2013), the authors showed that white fat development (in vitro and in vivo) is disrupted in the absence of TAF7L. This finding argues for a broader role of TAF7L in adipogenesis (or perhaps even more broadly in development). As highlighted in point 1, the authors should address how TAF7L is specifically involved in brown fat development. In other words, the role of TAF7L in the browning of WAT should be addressed.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a reasonable scenario since <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mice showed changes consistent with the browning of WAT and changes in the expression of WAT genes in <italic>Taf7l</italic> KO mice compared to WT mice. However, we believe a thorough and rigorous test of this hypothesis is well beyond the scope of this current study. We are particularly concerned that fully dissecting the browning of WAT will require a careful analysis of beige cells which are likely not the same as canonical BAT.</p><p><italic>3) Photographs of whole BAT from young and adult WT and TAF7L KO mice should be provided to see the gross morphology of BAT</italic>.</p><p>We have now included photographs of whole BAT from one-month and four-month old WT and TAF7L KO mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Cold exposure experiments should be performed in TAF7L KO mice to understand the physiological consequence of lack of TAF7L in BAT</italic>.</p><p>In this Short report we chose to focus primarily on the role of TAF7L with respect to BAT developmental. In addition, our preliminary physiological studies showed mixed phenotypes because TAF7L KO resulted in differential changes in WAT versus BAT development. We felt that it would be least ambiguous to study the physiological consequences of environmental parameters such as cold exposure using BAT or WAT-specific TAF7L KO mice in future studies.</p><p><italic>5) The mechanism of how TAF7L suppresses muscle-specific genes is unclear. This point should be further investigated or minimally speculated on and discussed</italic>.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of how TAF7L suppresses muscle-specific genes is unclear at this point, we speculate that it might be an indirect effect, since our ChIP-seq data showed that TAF7L is not targeted to muscle gene promoters. We therefore favor the idea that a de-repression of muscle-genes might result from a reduction in certain fat genes caused by loss of TAF7L, which we establish here to be functioning as an activator of fat cell lineages. We have now included this speculation in the revised text.</p><p><italic>6) Differentiation assays using primary brown adipocytes (SVF differentiated to adipocytes) from WT and TAF7L KO mice should be performed</italic>.</p><p>We have now included this new data in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
