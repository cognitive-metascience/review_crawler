Here, we demonstrate that the <italic>ClockΔ19</italic> mutant behavioral phenotype is significantly modified by mouse strain genetic background. We map a suppressor of the <italic>ClockΔ19</italic> mutation to a ∼900 kb interval on mouse chromosome 1 and identify the transcription factor, <italic>Usf1</italic>, as the responsible gene. A SNP in the promoter of <italic>Usf1</italic> causes elevation of its transcript and protein in strains that suppress the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant phenotype. USF1 competes with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex for binding to E-box sites in target genes. Saturation binding experiments demonstrate reduced affinity of the CLOCKΔ19:BMAL1 complex for E-box sites, thereby permitting increased USF1 occupancy on a genome-wide basis. We propose that USF1 is an important modulator of molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00426.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00426.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00426.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Circadian rhythms are biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes that follow a 24-hr cycle, responding primarily to the periods of light and dark, and they have been observed in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. The circadian clock that drives these rhythms—which dictate our sleep patterns and other processes—involves a set of genes and proteins that participate in a collection of positive and negative feedback loops.</p><p>Previous research has mainly focused on identifying core clock genes—that is, genes that make up the molecular clock—and studying the functions of these genes and the proteins they code for. However, it has become clear that other clock genes are also involved in circadian behavior, and it has been proposed that polymorphisms in these non-core clock genes could contribute to the variations in circadian behavior displayed by different mammals.</p><p>One important feedback loop in mammals involves two key transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1, that combine to form a complex that initiates the transcription of the negative feedback genes, <italic>Period</italic> and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic>. Shimomura et al. discovered that <italic>Usf1</italic>, a gene that codes for a transcription factor that is typically involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as other cellular processes, is also important. In particular, this transcription factor is capable of partially rescuing an abnormal circadian rhythm caused by a mutation in the <italic>Clock</italic> gene in mice.</p><p>Shimomura et al. showed that the proteins expressed by the mutant <italic>Clock</italic> gene can bind to the same regulatory sites in the genome as the normal CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, but that gene expression of these targets is reduced because transcriptional activation is lower and binding of the complex is not as strong. However, proteins expressed by the <italic>Usf1</italic> gene are able to counter this by binding to the same sites in the genome and compensating for the mutant CLOCK protein. Further experiments are needed to explore how the interactions between the USF1 and CLOCK:BMAL1 transcriptional networks regulate circadian rhythms and, possibly, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00426.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00426.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

environmental cycles, most organisms have evolved endogenous clocks composed of cell-autonomous, self-sustained oscillators that drive 24-hr rhythms in biochemistry, physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</xref>). In mammals, the innate periodicity of the circadian clock is generated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops composed of a core set of clock genes expressed in cells throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</xref>). Two members of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor family, CLOCK (and its paralog NPAS2) and BMAL1 (ARNTL), heterodimerize and initiate transcription of the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1, Per2</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>) genes through E-box regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gekakis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hogenesch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting PER and CRY proteins form multimeric complexes, translocate to the nucleus, and abrogate their own transcription by repressing CLOCK:BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koike et al., 2012</xref>). As the PER and CRY proteins are degraded, CLOCK:BMAL1 occupancy increases to initiate a new round of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koike et al., 2012</xref>). While this forms the major feedback loop of the mammalian molecular clock, the overall mechanism also depends on additional feedback loops driven by ROR and REV-ERBα/β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Preitner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Significant progress has been made in identifying the core clock genes and the functions of their protein products in the clock mechanism, yet it is clear from other studies, including mutagenesis screens, that additional genes are necessary for a fully functional circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takahashi, 2004</xref>). We previously identified at least 13 loci in mice that affect circadian behavior through complex epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shimomura et al., 2001</xref>), indicating that there are other clock-relevant genes in the mammalian genome. By extension, it is possible that the variance in circadian behavior observed in the human population results from polymorphisms in non-core circadian clock genes. Thus, identifying these genes is important for both mechanistic understanding and translational application.</p><p>The quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach has been successfully applied to detect loci that associate with phenotypes of interest. An important application of QTL analysis is the identification of loci that modify the function and/or expression of a particular gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nadeau and Topol, 2006</xref>). A major obstacle, however, has been the cloning of these genes—particularly those underlying behavioral QTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nadeau and Frankel, 2000</xref>). To overcome this challenge, several approaches have been proposed, yet it remains difficult to obtain a mapping resolution suitable for gene cloning by the positional candidate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darvasi and Soller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Valdar et al., 2006</xref>). To date there are few examples of behavioral QTLs having been cloned using high-resolution mapping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yalcin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tomida et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mouse <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutation was originally induced on the C57BL/6J (hereafter B6) isogenic background by ENU mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vitaterna et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> lengthens circadian free-running period by about 1 hr in heterozygous mice, and by about 4 hr in homozygous mutant mice followed by arrhythmicity upon exposure to constant darkness (DD). We observed that the circadian period phenotype in <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup>/+ animals is suppressed by crossing to the BALB/cJ (hereafter BALB) inbred strain. On an isogenic B6 background, <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup>/+ lengthens period ∼0.6 hr, and this is suppressed to ∼0.3 hr on a (BALB x B6)F1 background.

Instead, to test whether <italic>Usf1</italic> is the gene responsible for the <italic>Soc</italic> QTL, we created <italic>Usf1</italic> overexpression transgenic mice on an isogenic B6 genetic background. From previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2007</xref>), we observed that a transgene fused to DNA fragments containing a CMV minimal promoter is induced at low levels, and thus created two independent <italic>Usf1</italic> transgenic lines, both of which exhibited a significant behavioral period-shortening effect in <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup>/+ animals, thereby minimizing the possibility of transgene position effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

By exchanging EcoRI-XhoI fragments between the B6 and BALB reporter clones, we narrowed the critical polymorphisms to the EcoRI-XhoI fragment (∼1000 bp) and identified seven common polymorphisms (five SNPs and two deletions) that match the phenotypic distribution of 16 mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We next amplified ∼100-bp fragments containing each of the seven polymorphisms from BALB and B6 genomic DNA and assayed their reporter gene activity to test whether the candidate SNPs affect promoter activity.

At all E-boxes, we detected three types of DNA:protein complexes: CLOCK:BMAL1 tandem heterodimers (CB2), CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers (CB1), and USF (consisting of USF1:USF1 and possibly USF1:USF2 or USF2:USF2 dimers). As shown previously, these E-box sites consist of tandem E-boxes spaced 6–10 nucleotides apart, and binding to these tandem sites appears to be cooperative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rey et al., 2011</xref>).

This suggests that the affinity of the mutant CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complex is lower for two reasons: first, it does not preferentially bind as a tandem complex, thus binding may not be cooperative; and second, its affinity, even as a tandem complex, remains lower suggesting that the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutation interferes both with cooperativity and with affinity. Thus, our saturation binding experiments clearly demonstrate that the affinity of CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 is significantly lower relative to the wild-type complex, and that this lower affinity is similar to the affinity of USF1 at the same sites. This suggests that under normal conditions, the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex binds with much higher affinity than the USF1 complex, but when mutant, the affinities of the CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 and USF1 complexes are comparable which allows USF1 to bind more effectively to E-box sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genome-wide location analysis of CLOCK:BMAL1 and USF1 binding sites</title><p>Because USF1 and CLOCK:BMAL1 compete for binding at the same E-boxes, and because CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 exhibits a lower affinity for these sites, we predicted that there should be a global increase in USF1 occupancy at CLOCK:BMAL1 binding sites in <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutant mice.

The peak height of USF1 binding increases dramatically in <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup><italic>/Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> animals, and there is a slight reduction in CLOCK binding in mutant animals.

In this model, USF1 expression is higher in BALB than in B6 strain owing to a promoter polymorphism. Our data show that USF1 can competitively bind to the same E-boxes in vivo as CLOCK:BMAL1. Furthermore quantitative analysis of binding kinetics indicates that the CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complex has a much lower binding affinity for E-boxes than its wild-type counterpart. This lowered affinity combined with increased expression of USF1 in BALB mice accounts for the rescue of the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> phenotype in this strain. We propose that USF1 acts as a partial agonist whose transcriptional regulation of circadian genes can compensate for the reduction in transcriptional activation by the CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together, we demonstrate that a dominant suppressor of the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutation in the BALB genetic background is an ancestral allele of <italic>Usf1</italic> which carries a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNP that enhances <italic>Usf1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). USF1 is ubiquitously expressed in both mouse and human and is a member of the evolutionarily conserved bHLH-Zip transcription factor family. USF1 participates in the regulation of several processes including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, immune responses, and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Corre and Galibert, 2005</xref>). USF1 interacts with the circadian clock gene pathway by binding to E-box regulatory sites in common with those bound by CLOCK:BMAL1 to regulate circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We find that the mutant CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complex binds with much lower affinity than wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes, arising in part from the absence of cooperativity of binding to tandem E-box sites seen with the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Because USF1 binds as a dimer, the 40% increase in USF1 levels observed in the <italic>Clock</italic> suppressor strain could lead to a substantial increase in DNA binding if those levels are below the K<sub>d</sub> for USF1 binding. In addition, because the PER:CRY negative feedback complex cannot repress USF1-mediated transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a modest increase in USF1 could activate target genes more effectively than CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1. Thus, USF1 can suppress the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutant by increased occupancy of CLOCK:BMAL1 E-box sites, acting as a partial agonist for CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription. What might the role of USF1 be in a <italic>Clock</italic> wild-type background? We have found that as CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding decreases at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koike et al., 2012</xref>), USF1 occupancy increases at these sites, exhibiting an antiphase temporal DNA binding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We speculate that the role of USF1 at CLOCK:BMAL1 sites could be to maintain an open chromatin state to facilitate CLOCK:BMAL1 binding on the following circadian cycle although additional work would be required to test this hypothesis. In addition, in <italic>Usf1</italic> knockout mice, we observe a reduction in circadian amplitude and activity levels showing that USF1 plays a role under normal conditions to enhance circadian rhythmicity and robustness. While it is tempting to speculate that these effects of <italic>Usf1</italic> might work at the level of the cell autonomous circadian oscillator, additional experiments would be required to determine at what level of organization (cell, circuit or higher) these changes in amplitude at the behavioral level originate.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00426.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for the USF1 suppression of the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutation within the circadian clock mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SNP polymorphisms between B6 and BALB in the <italic>Usf1</italic> promoter lead to a <italic>cis</italic>-mediated increase in <italic>Usf1</italic> expression levels in suppressor mouse strains. (<bold>B</bold>) In the wild-type state, CLOCK:BMAL1 tandem heterodimers bind to tandem E-box sites in the regulatory regions of the <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> genes and interact cooperatively to enhance binding affinity which is much higher than USF1 affinity. Thus, most tandem E-box sites are preferentially bound by wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 complex over USF1. (<bold>C</bold>) In contrast, in the <italic>Clock</italic><sup><italic>Δ19</italic></sup> mutant, the CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complex binds to the E1 site primarily as a single heterodimer with an affinity similar to that of USF1, yet lower than that of the wild-type CLOCK:BMAL1 tandem heterodimer complex. This allows USF1 to occupy CLOCK:BMAL1 sites more effectively in the mutant state and, as a consequence, drive transcription of CLOCK:BMAL1 target genes under conditions where mutant CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 is not transcriptionally competent. Because USF1 is not repressed by CRY1 or CRY2 negative feedback, the transcriptional activation by USF1 may be more responsive than that of CLOCK:BMAL1.

PCR conditions were: 95°C for 2 min followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Following amplification, PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>Livers from mice were immediately homogenized in 4 ml per liver of 1× PBS containing 2 mM EGS. The homogenate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Next, 110 µl of 36.5% formaldehyde was added followed by an 8 min incubation at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 µl of 2.5 M glycine and kept on ice. The homogenate was added to 10 ml of ice-cold 2.3 M sucrose containing 150 mM glycine, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 15 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF, and layered on top of a 3 ml cushion of 1.85 M sucrose (containing the same ingredients with 10% glycerol) and centrifuged for 1 hr at 24,000 rpm at 4°C in a Beckman SW32.1 rotor. The nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, transferred to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm at 4°C, washed again, and stored –80°C until use.

The fragmented chromatin was then diluted tenfold with IP buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). Approximately 120 µg of fragmented chromatin was pre-cleared by incubating with 40 µl of protein A-agarose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 2 hr at 4°C with rotation. Pre-cleared chromatin was then incubated with antibody overnight at 4°C with rotation, followed by addition of 10 µl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose and incubation for 1.5 hr at 4°C. Agarose beads were then washed twice with IP buffer, twice with high salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF), twice with LiCl wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF), and once with TE. Co-immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were eluted with 100 µl of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, then reverse crosslinked at 65°C overnight, incubated with 10 µg of RNaseA for 30 min at 37°C, with 160 µg of proteinase K for 30 min at 55°C, and then purified using the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD).

SOLiD sequencing of ChIP-Seq libraries were performed on an ABI SOLiD4 instrument with 35-bp reads according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) by the UTSW McDermott DNA Sequencing Core. Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (NCBI m37) with Applied Biosystems BioScope v1.3. The peaks were identified from uniquely mapped reads without duplicates using MACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) followed by PeakSplitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salmon-Divon et al., 2010</xref>). Sequence reads were checked for abnormal read content in input samples that led to global false positive peak detection that arise primarily from low complexity sequence and contamination from plasmid/cDNA sequences. Global false positive peaks were removed from peak lists derived from MACS and PeakSplitter, and tags derived from plasmids/cDNAs were not analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Results were further analyzed using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Peak overlaps (peak summit ± 120 bp) were determined with HOMER.

For oligonucleotide annealing, 1 nm of each forward and reverse oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">supplementary file 1</xref>) were mixed with 1× T4 polynucleotide buffer at final volume 50 μl. The reaction mix was heated at 95°C for 10 min then slowly cooled to 25°C (1 °C/min). Oligonucleotide labeling was performed in 50 μl with 50 pmole of double-stranded oligo, 5 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (NEB, Ipswich, MA), 2.5 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB), 3.75 μl ATPγ<sup>32</sup>P (Perkin Elmer cat# BLU002Z250UC, Waltham, MA), and 36.25 μl water. The reaction mix was incubated at 37°C for 30 min followed by 65°C for 10 min. After the kinase reaction, the sample was purified through a G50 spin column. EMSA reactions were performed with 15 μg of nuclear protein in 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200 ng/μl sheared salmon sperm DNA, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and 2 μl of radioactive probe in a volume of 12 μl. Binding buffer and nuclear protein were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then, 2 μl of radioactive probe was added and incubated at 16°C for 30 min. For supershifts, 1 μl of antibody was added immediately before the addition of the radio-labeled probe. The antibodies used were anti-BMAL1, anti-CLOCK (a gift from Dr. Choogon Lee) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koike et al., 2012</xref>), and anti-USF1 (sc-8983×, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX). 1 μl of 15% Ficoll was added, and the reaction mixes were loaded on 4% polyacrylamide gels (0.5× TBE with 2.5% glycerol). Gels (0.2 mm thickness, 4% polyacrylamide, Bio-Rad #161–0144) were run for 90 min at room temperature (7.5 V/cm) and exposed on phosphor imager screens for 18 hr at 4°C. For saturation binding assays, increasing amounts of probe were added to a fixed amount of nuclear extract in triplicate. A four-parameter nonlinear least squares curve fitting method (Prizm, Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to estimate the B<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> values and to conduct tests for whether each best-fit parameter differs among the four groups in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Usf1 gene trap mouse production</title><p>Mouse embryonic stem cell gene trap line W233A07 and P116C05 were obtained from the German Gene Trap Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetrap.de">http://www.genetrap.de</ext-link>). The ROSAbetageo+1 gene trap vector (incorporating fused beta galactosidase and neomycin) was introduced to 129S2/SvPas-derived TBV2 embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate mutant cell lines. Both W233A07 and P116C05 cells, carrying a vector insertion into the intron one of <italic>Usf1</italic> gene, were used to generate mice which were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for four generations. In order to detect presence of trap vector, <italic>Usf1</italic>-TrapFwd: 5′-AGTGACAACGTCGAGCACAG-3′, <italic>Usf1</italic>-TrapRev: 5′-CGGTCGCTACCATTACCAGT-3′ were used.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Louis Ptáček, Reviewing editor; Ueli Schibler, peer reviewer.</p><p>The reviewers very much appreciated the work presented and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Using a heroic forward genetics approach, Takahashi's group has previously identified a semidominant mutation in the <italic>Clock</italic> gene that lengthens the circadian period in heterozygous and homozygous mice of the C57BL/6J (B6) strain (King et al., 1997). Moreover, when exposed to constant darkness over an extended time period, most homozygous <italic>Clock</italic> mutant mice become arrhythmic. The CLOCK mutant protein still contains functional dimerization and DNA binding domains, but fails to efficiently activate target gene transcription.</p><p>In the present study, Shimomura and coworkers extended this work by identifying a non-allelic suppressor (<italic>Soc</italic>) of the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant allele as <italic>Usf1</italic> (<italic>upstream stimulatory factor 1</italic>) in BALB and other mouse strains. To this end they used a clever combination of QTL and haplotype block mapping to narrow the chromatin region carrying the <italic>Soc</italic> locus down to a DNA segment encompassing about 900 Kb and 22 protein encoding genes. A transcript expression analysis for seven candidate genes with a similar spatial expression pattern as <italic>Clock</italic> revealed that only one of these, <italic>Usf1</italic>, displayed significantly higher transcript accumulation in mice with the <italic>Soc</italic> phenotype. Moreover, a moderate overexpression of USF1 from a transgene driven by the minimal CMV promoter in B6 mice suppressed the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant phenotype in a similar fashion as the BALB <italic>Usf1</italic> allele. The cis-acting region responsible for increased <italic>Usf1</italic> transcription in BALB mice has been mapped to an about 1kb DNA fragment in the 5'-flanking region of <italic>Usf1</italic>. Importantly, in vitro (EMSA) and in vivo (ChIP-seq) binding studies demonstrated that USF1 and CLOCK-BMAL1 share significant DNA-binding specificity. The actograms of voluntary locomotor activity of <italic>Usf1</italic> knockout mice do not show a significantly different period length, but display lower amplitude and overall activity when compared to those of wild-type mice. This suggests that USF1 also contributes to the robustness of circadian behavior in the latter.</p><p>1. The authors argue USF1 binds to tandem E-box and maintains the open chromatin structure when CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer levels decline at night. This is an ideal conclusion of the manuscript, but no direct proof is offered. DNAse hypersensitivity or equivalent technique in WT, <italic>Clock</italic> mutant or <italic>Usf1</italic> knockout mice will strengthen the conclusion. If the authors do not have this expertise, they may simply remove this claim. If they want to pursue this conclusion, they may also test the following two scenarios.</p><p>2. The above role would suggest USF1 functions in a cell autonomous manner and its overexpression or knockdown should produce period/amplitude alteration of the clock. The authors argue the reduced activity and low amplitude activity rhythm supports such function. However, there are potentially alternate modes of action that can produce such a phenotype in a whole animal. For example, <italic>Usf1</italic> knockout might reduce expression of a synchronizing signal in the SCN leading to reduced amplitude of the behavioral rhythms. Overexpression or knockdown experiments in cell lines or single cell monitoring of bioluminescence from <italic>Usf1</italic>KO;<italic>Per2</italic><sup><italic>Luc</italic></sup> mice will be better to test this hypothesis.</p><p>3. If the model is true, <italic>Usf1</italic>KO in <italic>Clock</italic> mutant background would produce a more severe phenotype than the mere additive effects of two mutations. If the phenotype is comparable to that of <italic>Clock</italic> mutant, it would suggest either the proposed role of USF1 in maintaining open chromatin structure is not essential or another USF family member can compensate for the loss of USF1. Testing this double mutant is therefore critical in resolving the role of USF family of proteins in the circadian system.</p><p>4. The ChIP experiments are done in <italic>Clock</italic> homozygous mice while the <italic>Clock</italic> heterozygote mice were used to test for suppressor effect of Balbc <italic>Usf1</italic> allele. ChIp results in heterozygote may be added.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00426.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

In order to make our speculation crystal clear, we have modified the statement to read “We speculate that the role of USF1 at CLOCK:BMAL1 sites could be to maintain an open chromatin state to facilitate CLOCK:BMAL1 binding on the following circadian cycle although additional work would be required to test this hypothesis.”</p><p>Since it seems reasonable to be able to put forward some ideas in the Discussion section, we would like to be able use this qualified language in the revision.</p><p><italic>2. The above role would suggest USF1 functions in a cell autonomous manner and its overexpression or knockdown should produce period/amplitude alteration of the clock. The authors argue the reduced activity and low amplitude activity rhythm supports such function.

Thus, we have inserted the following statement to make this point explicitly and so as not to imply that we know how <italic>Usf1</italic> loss-of-function affects the cell autonomous circadian clock:</p><p>“While it is tempting to speculate that these effects of <italic>Usf1</italic> might work at the level of the cell autonomous circadian oscillator, additional experiments would be required to determine at what level of organization (cell, circuit or higher) these changes in amplitude at the behavioral level originate.”</p><p>Since this point refers back to the speculation in the previous point, and we have qualified the statements in both, we ask that the editors to allow some leeway in discussing these issues in the revision.</p><p><italic>3.

Testing this double mutant is therefore critical in resolving the role of USF family of proteins in the circadian system</italic>.</p><p>Again this point refers back to the speculation in the first point, which we have qualified, and therefore, we would assert that it is not our intention in this paper to analyze definitively or to resolve the “<italic>role of USF family of proteins in the circadian system”</italic> independently from the work already presented here showing that USF1 is a suppressor of the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant. We agree with the suggestion that these experiments would be interesting to undertake to explore the interactions of USF1 and CLOCK in the future.</p><p>However, we hope the editors agree that the double mutant experiments go beyond the scope of this already rather extensive manuscript. Such double mutant experiments would be extremely onerous at this time because we have frozen down the <italic>Usf1</italic> knockout mouse line, and this would require new matings to obtain double homozygous, double mutant mice (which are very inefficient crosses using the <italic>Clock</italic> mutant, which does not breed as a homozygote and is compromised even as a heterozygote: we have previously documented the reproductive defect in female <italic>Clock</italic> mutant mice in Miller et al. 2004. Circadian <italic>Clock</italic> mutation disrupts estrous cyclicity and maintenance of pregnancy. <italic>Current Biology</italic> 14:1367-1373.) Such double homozygous, double mutant mice would take us 6–12 months to produce, adding a very significant delay to this work.</p><p><italic>4. The ChIP experiments are done in</italic> Clock <italic>homozygous mice while the</italic> Clock <italic>heterozygote mice were used to test for suppressor effect of Balbc</italic> Usf1 <italic>allele. ChIp results in heterozygote may be added</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be desirable for us to have ChIP data from heterozygous <italic>Clock</italic><sup>Δ19</sup><italic>/+</italic> mice, but we did not attempt this work since we did not know whether the biochemical assays would be sensitive enough to detect differences in heterozygous mice given the subtle nature of the genetic suppression. To illustrate the subtlety, the BALB suppression of <italic>Clock</italic><sup>Δ19</sup><italic>/+</italic> period length is ∼0.3 hours, which is detectable at the behavioral level because the precision of the circadian clock is so good. However, this difference in period corresponds to a 0.3/24 = 1.25% difference in the cycle length. At the molecular level, we cannot detect such subtle changes and even if the molecular changes were 10-fold greater, they would be hard to discern. We also did not attempt biochemical experiments on heterozygous <italic>Clock</italic><sup>Δ19</sup><italic>/+</italic> mice because we cannot discriminate between wild-type CLOCK and CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup> in ChIP experiments and because the EMSA mobility patterns were too complex to interpret with both CLOCK:BMAL1 and CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 complexes in the same lanes.</p><p>Also, we do not make any assertions in the manuscript that imply that the experiments might be construed as having been performed on heterozygous mice. The ChIP and EMSA experiments were intended to explore the effects of the CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup> mutation on the binding affinity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex and to determine whether CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup> affects USF1 DNA occupancy. We view these experiments as intended to explore the biochemical mechanism of CLOCK:BMAL1 and CLOCK<sup>Δ19</sup>:BMAL1 occupancy in a manner analogous to the use of in vitro biochemical assays to explore mechanism in a more simplified state, rather than to recapitulate the complex <italic>Clock</italic><sup>Δ19</sup><italic>/+</italic> heterozygous state. Therefore, we would ask the editors to consider the addition of ChIP experiments on heterozygous mice as beyond the scope of this work and too onerous to undertake at this time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
