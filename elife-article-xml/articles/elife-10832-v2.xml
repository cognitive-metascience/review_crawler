Some types of adult stem cells exist primarily in a non-dividing state known as quiescence, which for a long time was thought to be essential for maintaining the stem cell state. However, researchers have discovered some adult stem cells that are either not quiescent, or only enter this state rarely.</p><p>Until now, biologists have lacked an experimental model in which the role of quiescence in maintaining stem cells can be easily investigated. Seidel and Kimble have now investigated the role of quiescence in the germline stem cells – which give rise to egg and sperm cells – of the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The results of the study revealed that although the germline stem cells divide continuously when the worms are well fed, starving the worms causes these stem cells to become quiescent.</p><p>Maintaining <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells in a stem cell state normally involves a process called Notch signaling, which cells use to communicate with each other. However, Seidel and Kimble found that the germline quiescence caused by starvation maintains the stem cell state even when Notch signaling is prevented. This suggests that, in the absence of food, quiescence alone can maintain germline stem cells, although how it does so remains a question for future work. One possibility is that quiescence stabilizes other molecules involved in the Notch signaling pathway or prevents the production of proteins that enable a stem cell to develop into a specialized cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10832.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10832.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>GLP-1/Notch</kwd><kwd>germline stem cell</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimble</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Life Science Research Foundation Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seidel</surname><given-names>Hannah S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells become quiescent under starved conditions, and this quiescence maintains the stem cell state even in the absence of GLP-1/Notch signaling, which is otherwise essential for stem cell maintenance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells in adult tissues were once thought to exist primarily in a state of cell-cycle quiescence. Such quiescence was viewed as an inherent property of the stem cell fate and thus essential for a tissue’s long-term self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hall and Watt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Potten and Loeffler, 1990</xref>). More recently, however, it has become clear that adult stem cells are not universally quiescent but instead cycle in accordance with the needs of the tissue: Some types of stem cells proliferate continuously, whereas others switch from quiescence to rapid proliferation in response to certain stimuli (e.g. wounding or hormones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wabik and Jones, 2015</xref>). In mammals, for example, hematopoietic and neural stem cells reversibly switch between quiescence and active proliferation in response to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Doetsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harrison and Lerner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>), and mammary stem cells expand transiently during pregnancy and the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asselin-Labat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Joshi et al., 2010</xref>). Though periods of sustained stem cell proliferation enable rapid tissue growth or turnover, they challenge the view of quiescence as a prerequisite for the stem cell fate. Thus, a long-standing question has remained unanswered: Does cell-cycle quiescence play a role in stem cell maintenance?</p><p>Understanding the relationship between cell-cycle quiescence and stem cell maintenance has been difficult because tractable models of facultative stem cell quiescence have been lacking. Perturbations affecting the cell cycle can in some cases impact stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Orford and Scadden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pietras et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yilmaz et al., 2012</xref>), but whether quiescence can maintain stem cells independent of the signals otherwise required for their maintenance has been untested. Such a test requires a system in which cell-cycle quiescence can be readily induced, and in which the signals otherwise required for stem cell maintenance can be readily removed. In this study, we establish the adult germline of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a model fitting these criteria. We describe a previously uncharacterized state of cell-cycle quiescence among adult germline stem cells, emerging under conditions of starvation. We then test whether this quiescence can maintain stem cells, independent of the signal required for their maintenance under conditions of active proliferation.</p><p>The adult germline of <italic>C. elegans</italic> presents a tractable model for studying stem cell behavior because of its simple, linear organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mitotically dividing germ cells—including germline stem cells—reside in the distal region of the gonad (the ‘progenitor zone’). Differentiating germ cells, in meiotic prophase, are located more proximally. (Here, we use the term ‘progenitor zone’ rather than the earlier term ‘mitotic zone’ or ‘proliferative zone’ to reflect the facultative nature of germ cell divisions.) The progenitor zone has been studied under fed conditions and is composed of a distal pool of germline stem cells and a more proximal pool of cells that have begun to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>). This proximal pool comprises cells dividing mitotically, as well as cells completing their final passage through interphase in preparation for entry into the meiotic cell cycle. We collectively refer to these cells as ‘transient progenitors’, to reflect their continued mitotic divisions and transitional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Under fed conditions, cells throughout the progenitor zone cycle asynchronously and continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>), with transient progenitors undergoing one or two rounds of division as they pass through the proximal progenitor zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fox and Schedl, 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10832.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fed versus starved adult hermaphrodite gonad of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an adult hermaphrodite gonadal arm, with the progenitor zone at its distal end and maturing gametes at its proximal end.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, nutrient limitation or changes in nutrient-sensing pathways slow germ cell proliferation, reduce germline stem cell number, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">LaFever et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">McLeod et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sheng and Matunis, 2011</xref>). These effects are mediated in part by changes in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>), including changes in the size of the somatic niche supporting germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hsu and Drummond-Barbosa, 2011</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, primordial germ cells are born in the early embryo and arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle until newly hatched larvae begin to feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butuci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fukuyama et al., 2012</xref>). This response to feeding has been hypothesized to involve food-related signals traveling through soma-to-germline gap junctions, which are required early in larval development for germ cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). Later in development, germ cells stop dividing if animals enter the non-feeding dauer larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Narbonne and Roy, 2006</xref>). Even in non-dauer larvae, germ cells proliferate less when food is scarce, an effect mediated in part by communication between food-sensing neurons and the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dalfo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Korta et al., 2012</xref>). In adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, decreased food intake slows mitotic and meiotic progression and oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Salinas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</xref>), and limited observations suggest that germ cell proliferation is also reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Salinas et al., 2006</xref>). More strikingly, full starvation from the L4 larval stage causes dramatic germline shrinkage in adult hermaphrodites, and this shrinkage is reversible upon re-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</xref>).

This quiescence is characterized by a dramatic slowing of S phase, cell-cycle arrest in G2, and the ability to re-enter M phase rapidly in response to re-feeding. We investigate these cell-cycle responses in wildtype animals and in germline tumors, and we test whether this cell-cycle quiescence requires factors controlling larval or behavioral responses to food. We next investigate the control of stem cell maintenance under starved conditions. We uncover a major difference in the requirement for GLP-1/Notch signaling in the maintenance of actively proliferating versus quiescent germline stem cells.

Cells in M phase were identified by staining for phospho-histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a marker of M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</xref>). Food removal caused a drop in the number of M-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and this response was fast: In hermaphrodites, the number of M-phase cells per progenitor zone dropped from an average of 7.6 before food removal to 2.1 after 30 min without food (n = 7 replicates of 220–551 gonadal arms per replicate per time point) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of M-phase cells continued to decline thereafter, and after 3.5 hr without food, M-phase cells were virtually absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The disappearance of M-phase cells coincided with the molt into adulthood (~5–8 hr after food removal), and the coincidence of these events persisted even under conditions where the timing of this molt was changed: Hermaphrodites starved from early L4 molted into adulthood ~12–20 hr after food removal, and gonads in these animals contained, on average, 1.6 M-phase cells per progenitor zone before the molt (n = 57, gonads collected 10.5 hr post food removal) and 0.0 M-phase cells after the molt (n = 63, gonads collected 24 hr post food removal). These results demonstrate that germ cells in hermaphrodites starved from L4 do not immediately stop dividing in response to food removal, but germ cell division eventually ceases, at or near the molt into adulthood. This finding suggests that mitotically dividing germ cells in L4s are not equivalent to those in adults, a result consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dalfo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Michaelson et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Longer starvation does not delay M-phase entry upon re-feeding</title><p>In other systems, re-entry into the mitotic cell cycle following a period of quiescence occurs more slowly after longer periods of quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Soprano, 1994</xref>). We therefore tested whether longer periods of starvation would delay mitotic re-entry upon re-feeding. We repeated the re-feeding time course in two types of animals having experienced longer starvation: Adult hermaphrodites starved from mid-L4 for 24 hr and adult hermaphrodites starved from early L4 for 72 hr. In both types of animals, re-feeding triggered a burst of M-phase cells 1.5 hr after re-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), similar to the re-feeding response in animals starved for only 12 hr (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> versus F) . We conclude that the timing of M-phase entry upon re-feeding is largely unaffected by the duration of preceding starvation, at least during the first 72 hr of starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>During starvation, germ cells progress slowly through S phase and arrest in G2</title><p>We next examined how starvation affects progression of germ cells through G1, S phase, and G2. First, we monitored cell-cycle progression in fed animals. By labeling germlines with the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and monitoring the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> M-phase cells over time, we estimated a median cell-cycle length in fed early adult hermaphrodites of ~6.2 hr, with S phase lasting ~4.4 hr, G2 lasting ~1.3 hr, and G1 and M phase together lasting ~30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also measured cell-cycle length in fed hermaphrodites aged 24-hr post mid-L4 (~12–16 hr past the early adult stage). For this age group, we estimated a median cell-cycle length of ~9.8 hr, with median G1, S-phase, and G2 lengths of &lt;30 min, ~6.8 hr, and ~2.3 hr, respectively, but with a long-tailed distribution of G2 lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We removed food from animals of both sexes and, after varying amounts of time, calculated the fraction of progenitor-zone cells in G1, S phase, and G2. S-phase cells were identified by EdU labeling, and G1 versus G2 cells were distinguished by nuclear size (see ‘Use of nuclear size to distinguish G1 versus G2 cells’ in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The following time points were collected: Animals starved from early adult for 3.5, 6.5, and 10.5 hr; animals starved from mid-L4 for 10.5 and 24 hr; and animals starved from early L4 for 10.5, 24, 48, and 72 hr. For all three age groups and for both sexes, G1 cells disappeared following food removal, and the timing of their disappearance coincided with the disappearance of M-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result demonstrates that during starvation, G1 cells continued to initiate S phase without a pronounced delay. Our second observation was that for all age groups and sexes, the fraction of S-phase cells decreased over time during starvation, and the fraction of G2 cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, S-phase and G2 fractions changed more slowly during starvation than expected from measurements of S-phase length in fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). (For example, in hermaphrodites starved from early adult, S-phase fractions changed very little during the 7 hr between time points 3.5 hr and 10.5 hr [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>], indicating that progression through S phase during this time period was minimal. By contrast, cells in fed adult hermaphrodites complete S phase in a median of ~4.4–6.8 hr [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>].) We conclude that during starvation, germ cells do not pause in G1 and instead continue through S phase and arrest in G2.

We re-fed starved animals and determined the length of time until all germ cells entered M phase. This analysis is complementary to our initial monitoring of M-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) because our initial monitoring allowed us to detect the earliest germ cells to enter M-phase upon re-feeding, whereas this analysis allowed us to detect the slowest such cells. To detect M-phase entry of all cells, we blocked M-phase exit using a temperature-sensitive mutation in <italic>emb-30</italic>, which encodes a component of the anaphase-promoting complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>emb-30(tn377ts)</italic> hermaphrodites were starved at the permissive temperature (15°C), then shifted to the restrictive temperature (25°C), and re-fed. At the time of re-feeding, germlines contained a mixture of S-phase and G2 cells (data not shown). In response to re-feeding, germ cells entered M phase, as expected, but were unable to complete the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, thus enabling us to quantify the accumulation of M-phase cells: Two hours after re-feeding, 55% of cells, on average, had entered M phase (n = 60 gonadal arms); after 4 hr, this number reached 99% (n = 66 gonadal arms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). (This analysis is restricted to the distal-most 50 germ cells, because germ cells located more proximally sometimes directly entered the meiotic cell cycle upon re-feeding. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.) Therefore, virtually all mitotically dividing germ cells completed the remainder of S phase and G2 within 4 hr of re-feeding, a time shorter than the time required to complete all of S phase and G2 in continuously fed adult hermaphrodites (~4.4–6.8 hr for S-phase, plus ~1.3–2.3 hr for G2). Thus, not only does re-feeding trigger germ cells arrested in G2 to enter M phase, but re-feeding also restores the rate of progression through S phase and earlier stages of G2.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10832.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Re-feeding restores the rate of progression through S phase and G2, as well as the meiotic entry of transient progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of distal gonads dissected from <italic>emb-30(tn377ts)</italic> adult hermaphrodites and stained with DAPI to visualize DNA (magenta) and anti-GLD-1 (green).

We tested whether the loss of GLP-1/Notch signaling produces these same effects in starved animals. We removed food from <italic>glp-1(q224ts)</italic> hermaphrodites at the permissive temperature (15°C), shifted starved animals to the restrictive temperature (25°C) for 8 hr, and then evaluated germ cell fate. Cell fate was assessed by staining for the meiosis-associated protein GLD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Jones et al., 1996</xref>) and by scoring cells for the ‘crescent’ chromosome morphology indicative of meiotic chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). This morphology is readily distinguishable from the ‘non-crescent’ morphology found in mitotic interphase. In fed controls, incubation at the restrictive temperature caused all germ cells to enter the meiotic cell cycle: Chromosomes adopted the ‘crescent’ shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and GLD-1 levels in the distal-most germ cells rose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In starved animals, by contrast, meiotic entry did not occur: 99% (n = 214) of progenitor zones retained germ cells with a interphase chromosome morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and GLD-1 levels in the distal-most germ cells remained low (n = 47 of 47 gonadal arms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Importantly, germ cells in starved animals retained the capacity for mitotic cell division, because when starved animals were re-fed at the restrictive temperature, their germ cells re-entered M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Germ cells in starved animals also retained the capacity for long-term self-renewal, because when starved animals were instead returned to the permissive temperature and re-fed for 2–3 days, 91% (n = 148) of progenitor zones retained germ cells in the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar results were observed when incubation at the restrictive temperature was extended to 16 hr or 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results demonstrate that starved animals maintain germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch. In other words, starvation inhibits the meiotic entry of germline stem cells, even in the absence of GLP-1/Notch. Similar to cell-cycle quiescence, this inhibition of meiotic entry was reversible upon re-feeding, because when starved <italic>glp-1(q224ts)</italic> animals were re-fed at the restrictive temperature, all germ cells eventually entered the meiotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10832.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Quiescence induced by three different conditions maintains germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Distance between the gonad distal tip and the first ‘crescent’ germ cell for adult hermaphrodites of the genotypes and treatments shown.

To answer this question, we performed temperature-shift experiments in <italic>glp-1(q224ts)</italic> hermaphrodites under two additional conditions: High NaCl and absence of sperm, each of which causes a twofold drop in the germ cell mitotic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Salinas et al., 2006</xref>). Animals exposed to high NaCl (300 mM) or lacking sperm (via loss-of-function mutation in <italic>fog-1</italic>) were grown at the permissive temperature, shifted to the restrictive temperature for 8 hr, and then returned to the permissive temperature for 2–3 days. Following this treatment, germ cell fate (mitotic versus meiotic) was evaluated by scoring germ cells for the ‘crescent’ chromosome morphology indicative of meiotic prophase (described above). For both high NaCl and absence of sperm, 48–79% (n = 129–231) of gonadal arms retained germ cells in the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). To control for possible pleiotropic effects of the mutation used to eliminate sperm (<italic>q785</italic>), sperm was introduced to <italic>fog-1(q785); glp-1(q224ts)</italic> animals by mating with wildtype males, and these animals were examined in parallel. In such animals, incubation at the restrictive temperature caused all germ cells to enter the meiotic cell cycle (data not shown; n = 37 gonadal arms, scored immediately following incubation at the restrictive temperature). Thus, three stress conditions that inhibit or reduce germ cell division (starvation, high NaCl, and absence of sperm) also permitted maintenance of germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch. This commonality suggests that cell-cycle quiescence itself is an effector of stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Nonetheless, such maintenance is not simply a function of inhibiting passage through M-phase, because stem cell maintenance in the absence of GLP-1/Notch was not permitted by cell-cycle arrest caused by RNAi knockdown of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (<italic>cdk-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), a result we confirmed by visualizing formation of the synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Starvation inhibits the meiotic entry of transient progenitors</title><p>The results above demonstrate that starvation inhibits the meiotic entry of germline stem cells, even in the absence of GLP-1/Notch. We therefore hypothesized that starvation might also control the meiotic entry of transient progenitors, located in the proximal progenitor zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). No markers currently exist to distinguish transient progenitors from germline stem cells, and the boundary between these pools of cells is not clear, but the two pools can be distinguished under fed conditions by restricting movement of cells out of the progenitor zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>). Under such conditions, transient progenitors enter the meiotic cell cycle, whereas germline stem cells do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>). To compare meiotic entry of transient progenitors under fed versus starved conditions, we re-fed starved animals and restricted cell movement during re-feeding; we then compared meiotic entry after re-feeding to meiotic entry after continued starvation. Meiotic entry was assessed by staining for GLD-1 and by scoring cells for the ‘crescent’ chromosome morphology indicative of meiotic prophase (described above). Cell movement was restricted by performing this experiment in <italic>emb-30(tn377ts)</italic> hermaphrodites at the restrictive temperature (25°C), a condition that induces metaphase arrest (also described above, under ‘Re-feeding restores the rate of progression through S phase and G2’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>emb-30(tn377ts)</italic> animals were starved at the permissive temperature (15°C), shifted to the restrictive temperature (25°C), and then re-fed for 6 hr or maintained in starvation. Our primary result from this experiment was that re-feeding and continued starvation affected meiotic entry differently. After 6 hr of re-feeding, cells in the proximal (but not distal) progenitor zone entered the meiotic cell cycle: GLD-1 levels in the proximal half of the progenitor zone rose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and the boundary between ‘crescent’ and ‘non-crescent’ germ cells moved distally, such that the number of cells distal to this boundary was reduced by about half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). After 6 hr of continued starvation, by contrast, very little meiotic entry was observed: GLD-1 levels in the proximal progenitor zone remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and the number of cells distal to the ‘crescent’/’non-crescent’ boundary was only slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Our inference from these results is that the proximal half of the progenitor zone was composed of transient progenitors at the start of re-feeding, and that 6 hr of re-feeding—but not 6 hr of continued starvation—allowed for their timely progression into the meiotic cell cycle. We conclude that starvation slows or blocks the meiotic entry of transient progenitors, similar to its effect on the meiotic entry of germline stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Starvation-induced quiescence is distinct from cell-cycle arrest induced by DNA damage</title><p>As a first step towards understanding the regulation of cell-cycle quiescence induced by starvation, we compared this quiescence to cell-cycle arrest caused by DNA damage, another perturbation causing G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gartner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kuntz and O'Connell, 2009</xref>). Following three criteria, starvation-induced quiescence was distinct from cell-cycle arrest caused by DNA damage. First, DNA damage strongly up-regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Craig et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, starvation-induced quiescence did not up-regulate this phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, DNA damage causes germ cell nuclei to enlarge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gartner et al., 2000</xref>), a phenotype replicated by RNAi knockdown of <italic>cdk-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jeong et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, starvation-induced quiescence did not cause nuclei to enlarge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Food was removed from early adult hermaphrodites homozygous for mutations in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway, or the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. M-phase cells were then monitored after food removal. Additionally, to test for a requirement for factors affecting behavioral responses to food, this same experiment was performed in animals defective for neuropeptide processing, neuropeptide secretion, or chemosensation, as well as in animals exposed to exogenous serotonin, which in some contexts acts as a food signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Luedtke et al., 2010</xref>). In all experiments, M-phase cells disappeared quickly in response to food removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We conclude that each of the genes tested is not individually required for starvation-induced quiescence in adult germ cells; likewise, quiescence is not affected by exogenous serotonin.

This quiescence is characterized by a slowing of S phase and a block to M-phase entry, such that cells arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Further, this quiescence maintains germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch, a signal required for stem cell maintenance under conditions of active proliferation.

This view arose from the theory that biological systems ought to protect stem cells from the risks of DNA replication and led to the notion of quiescence as an inherent property of the stem cell fate. According to this model, tissues were maintained by a hierarchy of relatively quiescent master stem cells and their faster cycling but short-lived daughters. In recent years, however, work in several mammalian and invertebrate tissues has shown that quiescence is not a prerequisite for the stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barker et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Doupe and Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Maciejowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>). Some types of stem cells do not exhibit quiescence under conditions assayed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barker et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Navascues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>), and still others vary their cell-cycle length in accordance with the physiological circumstances surrounding them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harrison and Lerner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hartman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Qiao et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, genetic or environmental perturbations that impact the cell cycle can also affect stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Orford and Scadden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pietras et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yilmaz et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, a long-standing question in the field of stem cell biology has remained: Does cell-cycle quiescence play a role in maintaining the stem cell fate? Our results answer this question by showing that quiescence itself alters the genetic requirements for stemness: Actively dividing germline stem cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> require GLP-1/Notch signaling for their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>); we find that cell-cycle quiescence—induced by starvation, high NaCl, or absence of sperm—relieves this requirement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, cell-cycle quiescence maintains germline stem cells independent of the signal required for such maintenance under conditions of active proliferation.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms maintaining stem cells during periods of cell-cycle quiescence remain to be determined. Acting downstream of GLP-1/Notch signaling to maintain germline stem cells are the PUF-family translational repressors FBF-1 and FBF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>) and the proteins of unknown molecular function LST-1 and SYGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>). Quiescence might stabilize these stem cell regulators—for example, by inhibiting the protein degradation machinery linked to the cell-cycle. Alternatively, quiescence might substitute for the repressive effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 by repressing translation on a global level. Global repression of translation is a conserved stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Spriggs et al., 2010</xref>), and the stress of starvation represses translation of at least a few genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lascarez-Lagunas et al., 2014</xref>). Another possibility is that stem cell maintenance might be regulated by a metabolite or metabolic process whose levels change during quiescence.

In mammals, cells can pause in G2 for prolonged periods of time before dividing in response to various stimuli (e.g. wounding, hormones) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gelfant, 1977</xref>). Such pausing in mammals has not been the subject of recent investigation, although the G2-to-M transition is known to be regulated by the growth factor IGF-1—for example, in mammalian uterine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesanya et al., 1999</xref>), oligodendrocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frederick and Wood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Min et al., 2012</xref>), spermatogonial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and multiple myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Stromberg et al., 2006</xref>).

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline presents such a model. This tissue undergoes dramatic shrinkage in adult hermaphrodites starved from the L4 larval stage, and such shrinkage is reversible upon re-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</xref>).

This work establishes facultative stem cell quiescence as a third major force: Because germ cells stop dividing during starvation, cells lost to cell death and oogenesis are not replaced, thus causing the germline tissue to shrink. Quiescence also contributes to re-growth during re-feeding by ensuring that germ cells are able to re-enter the cell cycle rapidly in response to food. Rapid exit from quiescence is a characteristic shared by analogous re-feeding responses in other animals, at least in the handful of examples where such responses have been examined at short time scales—for example, in the ovary of protein-limited <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hartman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Jouandin et al., 2014</xref>), in the gut of fasted rats, squirrels, and chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldewachi et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cameron and Cleffmann, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hagemann and Stragand, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kruman et al., 1988</xref>), and in the retina of yolk-deprived frog embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

Soaking was used for starvation time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and for testing whether G1 versus G2 cells could be distinguished by nuclear size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Feeding was used for measuring cell-cycle length in fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the soaking procedure, animals were incubated with rocking in M9 + 0.1% Tween-20 + 1 mM EdU for 15 min at room temperature. Gonads were dissected as for antibody staining and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSTween for 30 min, followed by −20°C methanol for ≥15 min. Gonads were blocked in PBSTween + 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Click-iT reactions were performed using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, #C10337), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that two back-to-back half reactions of 250 µl volume were performed. Gonads were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI.</p><p>EdU labeling by feeding was performed similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1693 was grown overnight at 37°C in M9 minimal media (3 g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4% glucose, and 1 µg/ml thiamin) supplemented with 5 µg/ml thymine. This culture was diluted 1:50 in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5 µM thymidine and 20 µM EdU and grown for 32 hr at 37°C. Cells were re-suspended in ~1/100th of their original volume in M9, and then spread onto 6-cm plates, using 100 µl of <italic>E. coli</italic> solution per plate. Plate media was identical to standard nematode growth media except that 60 µg/ml carbenicillin was added, peptone was omitted, and agar was exchanged for 12 g/L agar + 6 g/L agarose. Plates were seeded 1 day prior to adding worms. Worms were transferred to plates for the required period of time, and then gonads were dissected and processed as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Propidium iodide staining and its quantification</title><p>EdU-labeled gonads were stained with propidium iodide to measure DNA content and to allow for simultaneous imaging of Alexa Fluor 488 and DNA. Propidium iodide staining was performed by adding two steps to the aforementioned EdU-labeling protocol. First, prior to the blocking step, gonads were incubated in PBSTween + 20 µg/ml RNase A for 1 hr at 37°C. Second, after the Click-iT reaction, gonads were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in PBSTween + 50 µg/ml propidium iodide.</p><p>To quantify propidium iodide staining, gonads were imaged at 63× magnification on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope, with a z-stack interval of 0.37–0.39 µm. Pixel intensity per nucleus was calculated as the summation of all pixel intensities within a best-fit cylinder whose height matched the height of the focal nucleus in the z-dimension and whose cross-sectional diameter matched the largest dimension of the focal nucleus in the x–y dimension. Cylinders were defined manually by drawing circles around nuclei in ImageJ. This quantification method is undeniably crude because cylinders often included portions of neighboring nuclei. Nevertheless, this method allowed us to distinguish non-S-phase cells as having a DNA content less than S-phase cells (G1) or a DNA content greater than S-phase cells (G2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Use of nuclear size to distinguish G1 versus G2 cells</title><p>Cells were classified as G1, S-phase, or G2 by a combination of EdU labeling (to mark S-phase cells) and nuclear size. This method has not been used previously—although others have noted a correlation between cell-cycle stage and nuclei size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>)—and we justify its use here. In pilot experiments involving EdU labeling and DNA quantification, we noticed a correlation between cell-cycle stage and nuclear size: G1 and early S-phase nuclei were small, G2 and late S-phase nuclei were large, and mid S-phase nuclei were intermediate in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, G1 nuclei nearly always occurred in pairs, consistent with G1 being very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fox et al., 2011</xref>). The size difference between G1 and G2 nuclei was large enough that in EdU-labeled gonads, G1 and G2 nuclei could be distinguished by eye (n &gt; 100 nuclei, from a total of seven progenitor zones). To test the accuracy of this method more thoroughly, we obtained z-stack images of EdU-labeled, propidium iodide-stained progenitor zones from three fed early adult hermaphrodites and three hermaphrodites starved from early adult for 3.5 hr. We first classified each cell as S-phase (EdU<sup>+</sup>), G1 (EdU<sup>−</sup> and having a nuclear size equal to or smaller than the smallest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells), or G2 (EdU<sup>−</sup> and having a nuclear size equal to or larger than the largest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells). We then quantified propidium iodide staining (a measure of DNA content) and compared our ‘by size’ classification to the classification given by propidium iodide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For all cells in all six progenitor zones, the two classification systems matched perfectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore used the ‘by size’ classification system for counting G1, S-phase, and G2 cells throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Counting G1, S-phase, and G2 cells</title><p>EdU-labeled progenitor zones were imaged at 63× magnification with a z-stack interval of 1 µm. Cells were counted as belonging to the progenitor zone if they had an interphase or M-phase chromosome morphology and if their midpoint was located distal to a cross-sectional line drawn through the midpoint of the second most distal ‘crescent’ cell (i.e. the second most distal meiotic prophase cell). Progenitor-zone cells were classified as G1 (EdU<sup>−</sup> and nuclear size equal to or smaller than the smallest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells), S-phase (EdU<sup>+</sup>), G2 (EdU<sup>−</sup> and nuclear size equal to or larger than the largest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells), or M-phase (mitotic figures). Classifications were recorded using the Cell Counter plug-in for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html</ext-link>), by marking each cell in all z-slices in which it was observed. A custom R script was then used to identify marks belonging to the same cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measuring cell-cycle parameters in fed animals</title><p>Cell-cycle parameters in fed animals were determined by first measuring the length of G2. G2 was measured by labeling animals with EdU (via feeding) and calculating the fraction of M-phase cells (mitotic figures) that were EdU<sup>+</sup> over time (equation 1). Next, the length of G2 was combined with the G2 index to calculate the total length of the cell cycle (equation 2). The lengths of G1, S-phase, and M-phase were calculated by multiplying the total length of the cell cycle by the G1, S-phase, or M-phase indices (equations 3–5). Calculations of the maximum total length of the cell cycle depend on assumptions about covariance between the length of G2 and the length of M + G1 + S. If cells having a longer G2 are assumed to have a proportionally longer M + G1 + S, then the maximum length of the cell cycle for 95% or 100% of cells is given by equation 6. If cells having a longer G2 are not assumed to have a proportionally longer M + G1 + S, then the maximum length of the cell cycle for 95% or 100% of cells is given by equation 7.

Gonads were also dissected after 6 hr of continued starvation. Gonads were stained for phospho-histone H3 and GLD-1 and imaged at 63× magnification with a z-stack interval of 1 µm. Cells were identified using IRISES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vogel et al., 2014</xref>), followed by manual correction using the Cell Counter plug-in in Image J. Cells were classified as interphase, M-phase, or ‘crescent’ (i.e. meiotic prophase) according to chromosome morphology and phospho-histone H3 staining. Occasionally, at the later re-feeding time points, cells were observed bypassing the metaphase arrest; for the purposes of this experiment, such cells were classified as M-phase. Cells distal to the ‘crescent’/‘non-crescent’ boundary were defined as cells whose midpoints were located distal to a cross-sectional line drawn through the midpoint of the second most distal ‘crescent’ cell. Relative positions of cells along the distal-to-proximal axis were determined by collapsing cell positions along the <italic>z</italic>-axis and fitting these positions to a second-degree polynomial curve. Positions along this polynomial curve closest to each germ cell and closest to the distal tip cell were identified by solving, for each cell, the polynomial whose roots minimize this distance. Using this new set of positions, distances between the distal tip cell and each germ cell were calculated. Cells were then ranked according to these distances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Sample sizes</title><p>In experiments requiring image acquisition, an attempt was made to examine at least 20 gonads.

As a paradigm, the authors studied the effect of starvation on the adult germline stem cells of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and report that starvation blocks stem cells in G2, and that this block is reversible upon re-feeding. The authors provide experimental evidence indicating that GLP-1/Notch signaling is not needed under conditions of quiescence, and that the starvation response of adult germline stem cells is independent of known signaling pathways shown to mediate nutritional sensing, such as insulin signaling, TGF-β signaling, and neuropeptide signaling. Based on these and other data Seidel put forward a model of starvation regulation they refer to as &quot;facultative quiescence&quot; defined by a slow S phase that is coupled to a block in M phase, and which is independent of GLP-1/Notch Signaling. Overall, the data and methods introduced in this article not only expand the methodological toolkit to study germline stem cells, but also contribute in significant ways to our understanding of the nutritional regulation of animal stem cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments are very carefully done and clearly presented. This work lays an important foundation for future molecular genetic studies to address mechanism. The manuscript has a few shortcomings, however, which can for the most part be addressed textually. The manuscript should do a better job of incorporating two recent advances in this field. The first, from one of the reviewers, Dr. Greenstein (Starich et al., 2014) in which it was shown that soma germline gap junctions are as important as the GLP-1/Notch pathway for controlling germline stem cells. In the absence of these junctions, germ cells can neither proliferate nor differentiate, even if the GLP-1/Notch pathway is constitutively activated. These gap junctions enable the transit of small molecules, ions, and metabolites between germline and soma, thereby providing a potential mechanism for nutritional inputs to the germline. The second is a major paper from Tim Schedl's lab (Fox and Schedl, 2015), which substantially refines our understanding of germline stem cell behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. After this publication, it seems questionable (or controversial at the very least) whether it is correct to refer to a proximal population of &quot;transit-amplifying cells&quot; in this system (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> here). A more complete consideration of Fox and Schedl (2015) raises an alternative interpretation of the authors' glp-1/Notch temperature-shift experiment (Major Point 1, below). The authors should consider the following specific points:</p><p>1) The authors interpret the result that starvation in <italic>glp-1(ts)</italic> does not cause cells to enter meiosis at the non-permissive temperature as meaning that &quot;starved animals maintain germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch.&quot; Given the results of Fox and Schedl (2015) that the majority of <italic>glp-1(ts)</italic> germ cells complete a single division before entering meiosis, it seems quite possible this is a consequence of the G2 arrest of cells after starvation. Upon moving back to 15C and re-feeding, germ cells complete their mitotic division and return to a situation in which GLP-1/Notch signaling is re-established. The authors interpret a <italic>cdk-1</italic>(RNAi) experiment as evidence that a G2 block is insufficient to prevent meiotic entry. Inspection of the Methods section associated with this experiment (subsection “Temperature shifts”, third paragraph) does not provide sufficient information as to the reliability of the method to score meiotic entry in these gonads by DNA morphology. The authors should consider evaluating meiotic entry by analyzing the recruitment of meiosis-specific chromosomal proteins to chromatin (e.g., HIM-3, etc.). At the very least, readers should be able to see for themselves what these gonads look like. The authors seem to be claiming that GLP-1/Notch signaling becomes non-essential during starvation conditions, not that it is turned off. If the latter was the case, then reporters for <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> might be revealing.</p><p>2) The Introduction needs some rewriting.

A more complete consideration of Fox and Schedl (2015) raises an alternative interpretation of the authors' glp-1/Notch temperature-shift experiment (Major Point 1, below).</italic> </p><p>Fox and Schedl (2015) present a careful and detailed analysis of germline stem cell behavior after loss of GLP-1/Notch. They report that when GLP-1/Notch signaling is removed, germ cells undergo one (or sometimes two) divisions before entering meiotic prophase. This finding is fully consistent with our previous understanding of cells in the proximal progenitor zone being in a transitional yet mitotically dividing state, and this finding is also consistent with the results of our current manuscript.</p><p>The observations of Fox and Schedl (2015) lead them to hypothesize that germ cells in mitotic S-phase or G2 are not able to enter meiotic prophase without passing through a cell division. Their hypothesis raised an alternative interpretation of our <italic>glp-1</italic>/Notch temperature-shift experiments, but their hypothesis was directly refuted by our <italic>cdk-1</italic> RNAi experiments. The reviewers raise questions about our <italic>cdk-1</italic> RNAi experiments and ask for further confirmation of these experiments using HIM-3 staining (Major Point 1, below). We performed HIM-3 staining, as requested, and found that HIM-3 staining supported our original conclusions. Thus, our results do not support the interpretation suggested by Fox and Schedl (2015).</p><p>The reviewer also uses Fox and Schedl (2015) to question our use of the term ‘transit-amplifying cells’ to refer to cells in the proximal progenitor zone. In response to this criticism, we sought a suitable replacement term and selected ‘transient progenitors’ as a possibility. This term follows the suggestion of Fox and Schedl (2015) to use ‘progenitors’, with the addition of ‘transient’ to convey the idea of a transitional state.</p><p>In selecting a term to refer to germ cells in the proximal progenitor zone, we sought to convey two ideas, neither of which is controversial. First, we wished to convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in the mitotic cell cycle. This idea is supported by many studies, including Fox and Schedl (2015). Second, we wished to convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in a transitional state. This idea is supported by three key observations: (i) cells in the proximal progenitor zone have higher levels of the meiosis-associated protein GLD-1 than cells in the distal progenitor zone (many studies); (ii) cells in the proximal progenitor zone have lower levels of the stem cell regulators <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> than cells in the distal progenitor zone (Kershner et al., 2014); and (iii) cells in the proximal progenitor zone enter the meiotic cell cycle when their movement out of the progenitor zone is restricted, whereas cells in the distal progenitor zone arrest in the mitotic cell cycle and do not enter meiosis with that treatment (Cinquin et al., 2010). Based on these multiple lines of evidence, we sought terminology that would convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in a transitional yet mitotically dividing state. The term ‘transit-amplifying cells’ terms has long been used in the stem cell literature to mean just that – progeny of stem cells that continue to divide mitotically but that have limited division potential and have begun to differentiate.</p><p>We have now replaced ‘transit-amplifying cells’ with ‘transient progenitors’ throughout the revised manuscript. Yet we have mixed feelings about this replacement. The reviewers argue that ‘amplifying’ may mislead readers about the number of divisions occurring in the proximal progenitor zone. This problem was addressed in our original manuscript by informing readers that the number of divisions in this zone is one or two (and this information is retained in our revised manuscript). Moreover, the term ‘transit-amplifying cells’ has been used throughout the vertebrate literature to refer to cells with similar properties to cells in the proximal progenitor zone. Does the confusion caused by ‘amplifying’ outweigh the confusion caused by adding a new term to the literature? We ask the reviewers to consider the pros and cons of the change in terminology and the need for a new term. Our preference is to use the term ‘transit-amplifying cells’, but we agree to replace it with ‘transient progenitors’ if the reviewers remain unconvinced.</p><p><italic>The authors should consider the following specific points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors interpret the result that starvation in</italic> glp-1(ts) <italic>does not cause cells to enter meiosis at the non-permissive temperature as meaning that &quot;starved animals maintain germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch.&quot; Given the results of Fox and Schedl (2015) that the majority of</italic> glp-1(ts) <italic>germ cells complete a single division before entering meiosis, it seems quite possible this is a consequence of the G2 arrest of cells after starvation.

We observed that HIM-3 was recruited to chromosomes following the temperature shift (Figure 5–figure supplement 1). Thus, cell-cycle arrest is insufficient to inhibit meiotic entry. This result strengthens our conclusion that the ability of quiescence to maintain germline stem cells in absence of GLP-1/Notch is not simply an effect of cell-cycle arrest.</p><p>We also note that Cinquin et al. (2010) reported entry of cell cycle-arrested germ cells into meiotic prophase without DNA replication and without mitotic division:</p><p>“In unablated controls, the distal germ cells did not enter meiosis, as assayed by absence of abundant GLD-1 (100%, n = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), absence of crescent-shaped DNA (100%, n = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and absence of chromosomal HIM-3 (100%, n = 6). By contrast, when the DTC was ablated, the distal germ cells accumulated abundant GLD-1 (100%, n=5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and entered meiotic prophase, as assayed by both crescent-shaped DNA (100%, n = 9) and HIM-3 localization (100%, n = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We do not understand the mechanism by which germ cells escape cell cycle arrest after DTC ablation, but note that some nuclei with crescent-shaped DNA and chromosomal HIM-3 had not undergoneDNAsynthesis after DTCablation (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, these cells appear to have progressed from their cell cycle arrest to meiotic prophase without DNA replication.”</p><p><italic>2) The Introduction needs some rewriting.
