The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets. Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory). By monitoring the expression of two copies of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Polycomb target gene <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C </italic>(<italic>FLC</italic>) in the same plants, we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this ‘mixed’ expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of <italic>FLC</italic> expression is stored not in trans but in cis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07205.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07205.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07205.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genetic material is contained within molecules of DNA. In plants and many other organisms, these DNA molecules are packaged around proteins called histones to make a structure known as chromatin. Altering how the DNA is packaged in chromatin can control the activity of genes. For example, a group of proteins called the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) adds methyl tags to histones, which can alter the packaging of chromatin to lower the activity of particular genes.</p><p>When a cell divides, it is sometimes important that genes in the daughter cells have similar levels of activity as the parent cell. This allows individual cells to ‘remember’ past events, such as exposure to cold temperatures or other environmental conditions. The pattern of methyl tags on histones can be passed onto the daughter cells, but it is not clear if this is actually responsible for providing the memory.</p><p>One gene that PRC2 regulates is called <italic>FLC</italic>, which influences when a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> produces flowers. If the plants are exposed to cold temperatures, the activity of <italic>FLC</italic> is repressed. <italic>FLC</italic> activity remains low after the period of cold has ended to ensure that the plants produce flowers at an appropriate time. If this 'memory of cold' is held locally in the chromatin of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene, then it should be possible for two copies of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene in the same cell to show different gene activities. However, if the memory is stored more globally inside each cell by other proteins, then the two copies should have identical gene activities.</p><p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, Berry et al. added different fluorescent tags to two copies of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, which allowed the activity of each gene copy to be tracked in individual cells under a microscope. The experiments show that one copy of <italic>FLC</italic> may be switched off, while the other remains switched on inside the same cell. Furthermore, it was found that this pattern of gene activity is passed onto the daughter cells when the original cell divides.</p><p>Berry et al.'s findings show that the memory of <italic>FLC</italic> gene activity is stored locally in the chromatin of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene itself. The alteration of histones by PRC2 is one important aspect of the packaging of chromatin. The next challenge is to identify what other features of chromatin are required for a gene to be able to store this memory locally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07205.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07205.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>cis memory</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>FLOWERING LOCUS C</kwd><kwd>vernalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004588/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartley</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsson</surname><given-names>Tjelvar S G</given-names></name><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MEXTIM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004034</institution-id><institution>John Innes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rotation PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two copies of a Polycomb target gene in the same cell can be maintained in independently heritable expression states, demonstrating that long-term memory of gene expression is stored locally.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic memory can be stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors that are maintained through feedback loops (trans memory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Novick and Weiner, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ptashne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, memory could be stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes (cis memory), in the form of DNA methylation or post-translational modifications of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moazed, 2011</xref>). While in both trans and cis memory the chromatin state is inherited, in the former case chromatin <italic>responds</italic> to the transcriptional state defined by heritable concentrations of the trans-factors, whereas in the latter case it is the local chromatin environment that <italic>instructs</italic> its own inheritance and is, therefore, the key epigenetic memory element.</p><p>Whether heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications is a subject of much debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ptashne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufman and Rando, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petruk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2014</xref>). Central to this debate is Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a key transcriptional regulator in animals and plants. PRC2 catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2002</xref>) and mutagenesis experiments have shown that K27 is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pengelly et al., 2013</xref>). DNA replication poses a significant challenge to histone-modification based memory as patterns of modifications must be faithfully transmitted to daughter DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</xref>). During replication, maternal histones are shared between daughter chromosomes where they re-associate close to their original location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radman-Livaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annunziato, 2005</xref>). Since PRC2 has affinity for H3K27me3, it has been proposed that H3K27me3 on inherited histones could recruit PRC2 to daughter DNA strands in order to similarly modify newly incorporated, unmodified histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>). Supporting the hypothesis that modified histones are indeed the key inherited cis memory element, it was recently observed that passage of H3K27-methylated histones to daughter chromosomes can occur in the absence of functional PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies have suggested that Polycomb proteins themselves are maintained locally through DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petruk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francis et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>These studies provide valuable mechanistic information about how a Polycomb system <italic>could</italic> store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis. However, to definitively demonstrate that memory <italic>is</italic> stored in cis, it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonasio et al., 2010</xref>). This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation. Since imprinting involves DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>), and X-chromosome inactivation involves chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>), it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory. Cis memory has also been implicated in random monoallelic expression. However, studies so far have been limited to genes with naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>) or are performed on fixed tissues limiting conclusions regarding heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin.</p><p>To address the question of whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor <italic>FLC. FLC</italic> repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finnegan et al., 2005</xref>), making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, <italic>FLC</italic> expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which <italic>FLC</italic> is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel et al., 2011</xref>). Cold exposure results in localization of a plant-homeodomain-PRC2 complex (PHD-PRC2) to a small nucleation region within the <italic>FLC</italic> gene, which leads to locally increased H3K27me3 and co-ordinately decreased H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Lucia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnegan and Dennis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). On return to warm, the PHD-PRC2 complex spreads across the gene leading to high H3K27me3 over the whole locus and stable repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Lucia et al., 2008</xref>). After cold, H3K27me3 is present at the <italic>FLC</italic> promoter and gene body but does not spread to neighbouring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnegan and Dennis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Polycomb-dependent <italic>FLC</italic> repression is maintained throughout plant development until it is reset during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevillen et al., 2014</xref>). If <italic>FLC</italic> transcriptional states are defined by concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory), then all copies of <italic>FLC</italic> within a cell should be in the same transcriptional state. On the other hand, if <italic>FLC</italic> chromatin states instruct their own inheritance (cis memory), then it should be possible for different copies of <italic>FLC</italic> within a cell to exist in different heritable transcriptional states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To search for evidence of this ‘mixed’ transcriptional state, we generated a system in which we could visualize the expression of two copies of <italic>FLC</italic> in single cells. We generated plants expressing FLC tagged with either Venus or mCherry fluorescent protein in the <italic>FRI</italic>-sf2 <italic>flc-2</italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaels et al., 1999</xref>). The transgenes consist of 12 kb of genomic DNA surrounding <italic>FLC</italic> with the <italic>Venus</italic> or <italic>mCherry</italic> sequence inserted as a translational fusion into <italic>FLC</italic> exon 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The early flowering phenotype of <italic>flc-2</italic> mutants was fully rescued in transgenic lines, demonstrating that the fusion proteins are functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Expression of full-length FLC-Venus fusion protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblot and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like wild-type Columbia line <italic>FRI</italic>-sf2 (Col-FRI), <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> and <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> plants responded to cold exposure by accelerating flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This indicates that the <italic>FLC</italic> transgenes were stably repressed similarly to endogenous <italic>FLC</italic> after cold. Epigenetic repression was confirmed to be quantitatively dependent on the duration of cold exposure for <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> at the transcriptional level in both roots and shoots, and also at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).

Roots provide an excellent system for studying heritability of epigenetic states because cell lineages are visible as continuous files of cells that arise from repeated anticlinal divisions along the longitudinal axis of the growing root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In warm conditions, stem cells at the root tip divide approximately once every two days, while for other meristematic cells this occurs approximately once per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campilho et al., 2006</xref>). Each cell undergoes several divisions before reaching the elongation zone whereupon cell division no longer takes place and cells begin endoreduplication. Therefore, 7 days after plants are transferred from cold, a single cell in the stem cell niche will have given rise to a lineage that encompasses a long file of cells in the root meristem. These files allow a direct assay of the mitotic stability of the epigenetic state in vivo. Strikingly, images of FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry 7 days after cold exposure showed long files of cells in the same expression state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating the long-term mitotic stability of the active and repressed transcriptional states. Such files make it implausible that the observed expression levels in single cells are the result of transcriptional noise. To quantitatively characterize the <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> expression status in individual cells after different durations of cold, we developed an automated image analysis procedure to calculate the mean FLC-Venus intensity inside each cell (‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). As suggested by individual images, our unbiased analysis of 53 roots (8547 reconstructed cells) revealed that the number of cells expressing <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> decreased quantitatively with the duration of cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Importantly, <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> expression was bimodal after 6 or 8 weeks cold, and almost all cells were silenced after 10 weeks cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Having developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of <italic>FLC</italic> expression states at the single-cell level, we returned to the question of cis vs trans epigenetic memory at <italic>FLC</italic>. We crossed <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> to <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. In a trans-based memory, the only possible heritable expression states of <italic>FLC-Venus</italic>/<italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In a cis-based memory, all four states ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF are possible because the information is stored at the locus itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, non-vernalized roots showed uniform ON/ON expression of both transgenes in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To stochastically induce repression of the two <italic>FLC</italic> transgenes, we exposed F1 plants to 4–6 weeks of cold followed by 7 days growth in warm. Strikingly, we observed long files of cells in which one <italic>FLC</italic> reporter was stably repressed, while the other remained stably activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In fact, we observed long-term mitotic stability of all four possible combinations: <italic>FLC-Venus</italic>/<italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, like endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>, the reporters are actively expressed throughout development in warm conditions and epigenetically repressed specifically in response to prolonged cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Epigenetic repression, therefore, depends on cold exposure and the <italic>FLC-</italic>specific sequences within the transgenes rather than the genomic location. Furthermore, since we observe similar numbers of cells in the <italic>FLC-Venus</italic>/<italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> ON/OFF and OFF/ON expression states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we consider it unlikely that differences in genomic location or fluorophore sequence between the transgenes causes one of the copies to be preferentially repressed over the other.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that the molecular changes to the chromatin environment of <italic>FLC</italic> induced by prolonged cold exposure are sufficient to instruct epigenetic inheritance of the Polycomb-repressed transcriptional state. However, Polycomb complex binding and H3K27me may not be the only factors that constitute this locally encoded epigenetic state. Specific nucleic acid structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klose et al., 2013</xref>), non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzog et al., 2014</xref>) (for example the chromatin-associated <italic>COOLAIR</italic> antisense transcripts at <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csorba et al., 2014</xref>)), and histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>) may also play important roles. Thus, not all H3K27-methylated chromatin should be considered as epigenetically silent. What defines a local chromatin environment as sufficient to confer cis-based epigenetic memory is now a central question in this field. Our methodology of using two reporters to specifically distinguish cis vs trans memory is broadly applicable and should be helpful in this pursuit.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Plant growth conditions were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Lucia et al., 2008</xref>).

The emission spectrum of propidium iodide overlaps with that of mCherry, so could not be used in <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> or double-fluorophore experiments. The following wavelengths were used for fluorescence detection: FLC-Venus excitation 514 nm and detection 511–555 nm (with 514-nm notch filter), propidium iodide excitation 514 nm and detection 626–697 nm, FLC-mCherry excitation 561 nm and detection 570–620 nm. To allow comparison between treatments, the same laser power and detector settings were used for all FLC-Venus images and all FLC-mCherry images, respectively. For double-fluorophore experiments, Venus and mCherry fluorophores were simultaneously excited at 514 nm and 561 nm, respectively.</p><p>The following steps were used to prepare images for presentation: raw confocal z-stacks were aligned using the MultiStackReg plugin in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To reduce detector noise, a Gaussian blur with a 1.5-pixel radius was then applied to images measuring 2048 × 1024 pixels (510 × 255 μm), before taking maximum intensity projections over 2–4 z-planes (6–12 μm). Finally, the intensity was linearly adjusted separately for each channel. For visual comparison of nuclear intensity between different treatments in FLC-Venus images, the same linear adjustment was used.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Quantitative image analysis</title><p>Confocal z-stack images were analysed using a custom image processing pipeline to reconstruct cellular volumes and calculate the mean FLC-Venus fluorescence intensity per cell. The pipeline is described below and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>. The source code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JIC-CSB/root-image-analysis">https://github.com/JIC-CSB/root-image-analysis</ext-link>.</p><p>Since the propidium iodide cell wall stain is not compatible for imaging with mCherry, cell segmentation could not be performed for <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> or double-fluorophore experiments. Image analysis was, therefore, undertaken for <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> only.</p><p>Pixels not corresponding to root tissue were masked using a series of morphological transforms of the propidium iodide (cell wall) images from each stack. To prepare the masked cell wall data for segmentation into individual cells, a Gaussian filter (using a standard deviation of 2 pixels) followed by median-based local thresholding (using Fiji's Auto Local Threshold plugin and a radius of 40 pixels) was applied to each plane of the stack. Each image was skeletonized using the Fiji Skeletonize plugin and then segmented using the Watershed plugin. Together, these steps generated an individual 2D segmentation for each cell wall image in the stack. The structure of the root was then reconstructed in 3D by comparing cells in segmented 2D images with those in neighbouring planes. Briefly, cells in 2D planes were considered part of the same 3D cell if the following two criteria were satisfied: first, their centroids were within a distance of 20 pixels from one another, and second, their relative areas did not vary by more than 50%. In addition to these criteria, the maximum extent of a single cell in the z-direction was limited to 18 μm (6 z-planes). This algorithm was implemented in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</ext-link>) using the scikit-image library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scikit-image.org/">http://scikit-image.org/</ext-link>). Finally, reconstructed 3D volumes were applied to the images from the FLC-Venus fluorescent channel to calculate mean intensity across the reconstructed volume by summing FLC-Venus intensity inside the reconstructed cell (from multiple z-planes) and dividing by the total volume of the reconstructed cell (summed area from multiple z-planes).</p><p>To validate the method, the mean FLC-Venus intensity per cell was estimated manually for a random selection of 50 cells from 22 different roots. Comparison of these results with those generated by the automated procedure for the same cells indicated that the mean cellular FLC-Venus intensities were accurate in approximately 80% of cells. The remaining cells in this test set were incorrectly segmented by the algorithm.</p><p>Consecutive z-stack images were separated by 3 μm and each root typically contained 14–18 images, which encompassed approximately the top third of the root in the meristematic and elongation zones. It was observed that FLC-Venus intensity decreased with depth in the image stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This effect may have arisen due to photobleaching as a greater depth also corresponded to a later image acquisition time. To reduce this effect, we restricted the analysis to those planes where the intensity was approximately constant. The number of roots analyzed and other statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Dean and Howard groups for discussions.

Your article has been evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The overall consensus was that, although the inheritance of H3K27 methylation in cis is largely a settled matter, the results reported in your paper are important to the Polycomb-Group field and the general field of epigenetics because they provide the most compelling data to date that PcG-mediated gene silencing operates in cis.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) It's important to know how <italic>COOLAIR</italic> is expressed in the lines with transgenes. Does the insertion of the reporter disrupt expression? If <italic>COOLAIR</italic> is not expressed normally in these cells, some comment upon how that reflects its role in regulation is warranted.</p><p>2) Because the two transgenes are not equivalent (e.g. in different genomic locations, have different insertions), there is a possibility that differential sensitivity of the transgenes to diffusible PRC2 accounts for the results. Although such a possibility appears remote, it should be discussed more thoroughly.</p><p>3) Please rephrase the paragraph of the Introduction that discusses silencing at the yeast GAL1 locus. The implication that the cited reference (Kundu, 2007) concludes that epigenetic memory at GAL1 is stored in cis may be misleading, because the authors of that paper (Kundu et al.) found no effect of local chromatin state on re-induction kinetics of GAL. The authors did find that that nucleosome remodeling factors are necessary for memory at GAL, but that does not mean it happens in cis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07205.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It's important to know how</italic> COOLAIR <italic>is expressed in the lines with transgenes.

It is important to note that the insertion site for the reporter coding sequence (<italic>GUS, LUC, Venus, mCherry</italic>) is in exon 6 of the <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA, rather than at the 3′ end. This means that the inserted sequence lies downstream of the polyadenylation site for the Class I <italic>COOLAIR</italic> isoform (in the direction of antisense transcription) and within the large intron of the Class II <italic>COOLAIR</italic> isoform. The previously identified splicing and polyadenylation sites of <italic>COOLAIR</italic> are therefore not perturbed in the transgenes.</p><p>Following the reviewers' request, we measured <italic>COOLAIR</italic> expression in the <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> and <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic> lines. We found that both Class I and Class II <italic>COOLAIR</italic> are expressed from the transgenes. For the different isoforms, we found that the quantitative levels of non-vernalized <italic>COOLAIR</italic> expression varied up to approximately 2-fold between transgenes and endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>, although we did not detect any consistent pattern of differences between transgenic lines and endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>. We found that <italic>COOLAIR</italic> expression is greatly increased during cold exposure (predominantly Class I) in <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> lines, as previously shown for endogenous <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swiezewski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csorba et al., 2014</xref>). We have added these results to a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which also shows a schematic of the <italic>COOLAIR</italic> splicing isoforms detected and their relationship to the Venus/mCherry insertion site.</p><p>The role of <italic>COOLAIR</italic> in vernalization is currently unclear. Plants carrying insertions in the <italic>COOLAIR</italic> promoter, and reduced <italic>COOLAIR</italic> expression, still show stable epigenetic silencing of <italic>FLC</italic> after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23a">Helliwell et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, transgenic <italic>FLC</italic> constructs lacking the <italic>COOLAIR</italic> promoter were used to demonstrate a role for <italic>COOLAIR</italic> in promoting transcriptional down-regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csorba et al., 2014</xref>). However, accumulation of H3K27me3 at <italic>FLC</italic> during cold was not affected by removal of <italic>COOLAIR</italic>. Since the role of <italic>COOLAIR</italic> in vernalization is currently unclear, and <italic>COOLAIR</italic> expression does not show informative differences between transgenic lines and endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>, we have maintained a minimal discussion of <italic>COOLAIR</italic> in our main text. We have added the following sentence to the end of paragraph 1 of the Results: ‘We also verified that the <italic>FLC</italic> antisense transcripts, named <italic>COOLAIR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swiezewski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csorba et al., 2014</xref>), are expressed from these constructs and are induced during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p>We have also added RT-qPCR primer sequences and a reference to how <italic>COOLAIR</italic> was measured to the Materials and methods section “Expression analysis”.</p><p><italic>2) Because the two transgenes are not equivalent (e.g. in different genomic locations, have different insertions), there is a possibility that differential sensitivity of the transgenes to diffusible PRC2 accounts for the results. Although such a possibility appears remote, it should be discussed more thoroughly</italic>.</p><p>If there were substantially different sensitivity in that rate of silencing of the two transgenes due to genomic location differences, this should be evident in differences in flowering time after vernalization, which is quantitatively related to <italic>FLC</italic> epigenetic repression. Such differences are not observed in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, if this were the case, we would expect one of the transgenes (either <italic>FLC-Venus</italic> or <italic>FLC-mCherry</italic>) to be preferentially silenced before the other in F1 plants. That we see no obvious bias in the amount of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/OFF versus OFF/ON cells, suggests that both transgenes have similar probabilities of being repressed during cold. To explain this more thoroughly we have added the following sentence to the Results and Discussion section: “Furthermore, since we observe similar numbers of cells in the <italic>FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry</italic> ON/OFF and OFF/ON expression states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we consider it unlikely that differences in genomic location or fluorophore sequence between the transgenes causes one of the copies to be preferentially repressed over the other.”</p><p>To minimise the effect of the surrounding genes on transgenic <italic>FLC</italic> regulation, a large section of genomic DNA surrounding <italic>FLC</italic> was used in the transgenic construct, including the closest downstream gene and part of the upstream gene. Many (&gt;30) independent transgenic lines that we analysed showed complementation of the early-flowering phenotype and accelerated flowering in response to cold exposure. We detected quantitative expression level differences between lines and selected those with similar levels to endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>. To describe this in more detail, we have added the following sentences to the Materials and methods: “Many (&gt;30) independent transgenic lines that we analysed rescued the early-flowering phenotype of parental <italic>flc-2 FRI-sf2</italic> plants and showed accelerated flowering in response to cold exposure. Transgenic <italic>FLC</italic> lines were selected for further analysis based on similarity between expression level of the transgene and that of endogenous <italic>FLC</italic>.”</p><p>The insertion site of the fluorophore sequence is towards the 3′ end of the <italic>FLC</italic> sequence. This region has not previously been shown to be required for epigenetic repression. Important regulatory sequences for cold-induced epigenetic repression that have been identified are located in intron 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43a">Sheldon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23a">Helliwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7a">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>), close to the small “nucleation region” in which H3K27me3 arises during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel et al., 2011</xref>). Using insertions of similar length and sequence, we have minimised differences between the two transgenes while maintaining the ability to discriminate the two copies.</p><p><italic>3) Please rephrase the paragraph of the Introduction that discusses silencing at the yeast GAL1 locus. The implication that the cited reference (Kundu, 2007) concludes that epigenetic memory at GAL1 is stored in cis may be misleading, because the authors of that paper (Kundu et al.) found no effect of local chromatin state on re-induction kinetics of GAL. The authors did find that that nucleosome remodeling factors are necessary for memory at GAL, but that does not mean it happens in cis</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the way this paragraph was constructed and referenced in the original submission was potentially confusing. The intention of including this was to provide a concrete example of where a chromatin-modifying factor is required for epigenetic memory, but where memory is actually stored in trans. Since this section was obviously not helpful in conveying this message, and is not essential for the remainder of the paper we have removed all specific discussion of the GAL locus. In this section, we chose to maintain the statement “importantly, a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin” without reference. This now appears at the end of the third paragraph of the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
