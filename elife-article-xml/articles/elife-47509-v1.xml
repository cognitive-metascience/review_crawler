distributed across the North Atlantic. It is now extinct, having been heavily exploited for its eggs, meat, and feathers. We investigated the impact of human hunting on its demise by integrating genetic data, GPS-based ocean current data, and analyses of population viability. We sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of 41 individuals from across the species’ geographic range and reconstructed population structure and population dynamics throughout the Holocene. Taken together, our data do not provide any evidence that great auks were at risk of extinction prior to the onset of intensive human hunting in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century. In addition, our population viability analyses reveal that even if the great auk had not been under threat by environmental change, human hunting alone could have been sufficient to cause its extinction. Our results emphasise the vulnerability of even abundant and widespread species to intense and localised exploitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seabird exploitation</kwd><kwd>19th century extinction</kwd><kwd>paleogenetics</kwd><kwd>hunting</kwd><kwd>ancient DNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008668</institution-id><institution>NERC Environmental Bioinformatics Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L501694/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681396-Extinction Genomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>M Thomas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013562</institution-id><institution>Genetics Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Heredity Fieldwork Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Society for Evolutionary Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Jessica E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rutherford Discovery Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstruction of great auk population dynamics suggests that hunting pressure alone could have been responsible for their extinction, demonstrating that even abundant, widespread species can be vulnerable to intense exploitation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The great auk (<italic>Pinguinus impennis</italic>) was a large, flightless diving bird thought to have once numbered in the millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>).

There is little doubt that the extensive hunting pressure on the species contributed significantly to its demise. Nevertheless, despite the well documented history of exploitation since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, it is unclear whether hunting alone could have been responsible for the demise of the great auk, or whether the species was already in decline due to non-anthropogenic environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuller, 1999</xref>). For example, there is evidence of a decrease in great auk numbers on the eastern side of the North Atlantic, as reflected in a decline in bone finds in England, Scotland, and Scandinavia, which remains unexplained and could have been caused by hunting as well as environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best and Mulville, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grieve, 1885</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hufthammer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Serjeantson, 2001</xref>).

However, if the species had been at risk of extinction prior to the onset of intensive hunting in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, we would expect to see genetic signatures of population decline, including limited genetic diversity and pronounced population structure. In contrast, the lack of an observable loss in genetic diversity during the last few centuries prior to the extinction would be consistent with a rapid demographic decline at the end. At the same time, human hunting alone can only be considered a reasonable explanation for the extinction of the great auk, if population viability analyses show that extinction could have been caused by harvest rates that would have been realistic for the time and circumstances of the harvest.</p><p>Here, we examine the drivers of the extinction of the great auk by analysing whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from across its geographic range, population viability, and harvest rates.

The estimate of 756,346 mature birds is slightly below the census size estimates for the great auk’s closest relative, the razorbill (<italic>Alca torda</italic>;~1 million mature birds) and significantly below those of common and thick billed murre, also from the Alcidae family (<italic>Uria aalge</italic> and <italic>Uria lomvia;</italic> 3 million mature birds each) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BirdLife International, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">BirdLife International, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">BirdLife International, 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">BirdLife International, 2017</xref>). Given historic reports of millions of great auks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>) and in order to reduce the risk of underestimating the census size of great auks, we ran simulations for population sizes of 1 million and 3 million mature birds (2 million and 6 million birds total size including juveniles). All simulation settings were ‘optimistic’ and biased strongly towards survival. This included conservatively high estimates of reproductive success and conservatively low estimates of natural mortality. For a subset of simulations, we also introduced a further, population density dependent, linear reduction of natural mortality to half our already low rates of natural mortality. Furthermore, in order to provide maximum sustainable harvest rate estimates for more ‘realistic’ settings, we ran simulations using estimates for reproductive success and natural mortality obtained from the razorbill.</p><p>We found that under our conservative settings, annual harvest rates up to 9% of the pre-hunting population were sustainable. For example, for a pre-hunting population size of 2 million individuals, this corresponds to an annual harvest rate of 180,000 birds. In contrast, an annual harvest rate of 10% of the pre-hunting population combined with an annual egg harvest rate of 5% led to extinction in a large proportion of our simulations. A harvest rate of 10.5% (egg harvest rate 5%) of the pre-hunting population led to extinction within 350 years in all of our simulations. Assuming a density-dependent reduction of mortality had only a small effect on sustainable harvest rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, even if no eggs at all were harvested, the population was still at risk of extinction at 10.5% bird harvest rate, with extinction probabilities between 15% (population size 6 million, density-dependent mortality) and 81% (population size 6 million, no density-dependent mortality, [<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>]). These results were robust to the definition used for extinction. For comparison, when using the much higher mortality rate of the razorbill, with a starting population of 2 million birds and slightly more realistic settings for reproductive age and success, harvest rates are only sustainable up to about 40,000 birds per year even if no eggs are harvested and mortality is gradually reduced to 50% of the starting value as the population density declines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Population viability analysis.</title><p>Extinction is defined as ‘only one sex remains’.

analyses of the demographic history of great auks support a constant population size within the temporal resolution of our data (back to the most recent common ancestor of all samples 24,000–85,000 ybp). Therefore, we find no evidence of a decline in the population prior to the onset of intensive hunting. We also observed high haplotype diversity across the sampling period, right up to the demise of the species. If the great auk had been at risk of extinction prior to the onset of intensive human hunting, for example as a result of long-term suboptimal habitat or environmental change, we would expect to see genetic evidence of such stress, as for example observed in studies of cave bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stiller et al., 2010</xref>) and bison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shapiro et al., 2004</xref>). If, on the other hand, the population declined rapidly, for example as a result of extensive hunting, genetic data would have only very limited power to detect such a decline in a long-lived species. Mitochondrial DNA studies of New Zealand moa found no evidence of a population decline prior to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allentoft et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rawlence et al., 2012</xref>) and a study of the endemic Hawaiian Petrel came to a similar conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Welch et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, even a recent whole-genome study of two extinct New Zealand songbirds (huia and South Island kõkako), which disappeared after human settlement within 700 years, found no genetic evidence of population decline prior to the disappearance of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dussex et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our results are consistent with a rapid decline of great auks. It is important to keep in mind, though, that our results simply indicate that the demise of the great auk was beyond the detection limit of genetic data. They do not necessarily confirm whether the rapid demise that must have taken place prior to extinction started before or after the onset of extensive human hunting, nor do the results provide an indication of whether there was more than one population decline. A localised, unexplained decline in great auk numbers on the eastern side of the North Atlantic over the past 2,000 years, for example, which has been inferred from a decline in bone finds in England, Scotland, and Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best and Mulville, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grieve, 1885</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hufthammer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Serjeantson, 2001</xref>), does not appear to have been severe enough to leave a genetic signature.</p><p>The estimated female effective population size is considerably smaller than the census size, which has been estimated to be in the millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>). This is noteworthy because it suggests that the species went through a severe bottleneck in the recent past. The shallow divergence of less than 90,000 years between the sequenced individuals suggests a population decline in the late Pleistocene, potentially associated with climate fluctuations. However, the wide 95% credibility intervals of our divergence-time estimates prevent us from narrowing down the cause of the bottleneck to any specific event. In any case, the high percentage of singleton haplotypes in our data, which is characteristic of a population expansion following a bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Slatkin and Hudson, 1991</xref>), together with the large census size at the onset of intensive hunting, suggest that the great auk had successfully recovered from the bottleneck.</p><p>Our genetic analyses failed to detect any female population structure in space or time, indicating a lack of marked barriers to dispersal among populations across the species’ range. This is inconsistent with predictions of limited or no interbreeding between populations from either side of the North Atlantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burness and Montevecchi, 1992</xref>), and suspected regional philopatry in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montevecchi and Kirk, 1996</xref>). Such a lack of structure is, however, common in seabirds, and has been observed in several relatives of the great auk, such as the thick-billed murre (<italic>Uria lomvia</italic>; no structure within ocean basins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tigano et al., 2015</xref>), common murre (<italic>Uria aalge</italic>; structure in the Atlantic but not in the Pacific) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris-Pocock et al., 2008</xref>), ancient murrelets (<italic>Synthliboramphus antiquus</italic>; no genetic differentiation in the North Pacific) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>), and little auk (<italic>Alle alle</italic>; no structure in the Arctic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wojczulanis-Jakubas et al., 2014</xref>). While all of the great auk’s closest relatives are capable of flight, which would aid population connectivity, a lack of population structure has similarly been report from some penguin species. For example, little or no population structure has been reported for the emperor penguin (<italic>Aptenodytes forsteri</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cristofari et al., 2016</xref>), chinstrap penguin (<italic>Pygoscelis antarcticus)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mura-Jornet et al., 2018</xref>), and Adélie penguin (<italic>P. adeliae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roeder et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We can only speculate what factors may have driven this lack of population structure, but the data collected from the GPS-enabled drifting capsules are consistent with hypotheses put forward by a number of authors. It has been suggested that migrations occurred in both northward and southward directions between breeding and wintering sites, aided by ocean currents such as the East Greenland Current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meldgaard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montevecchi and Kirk, 1996</xref>). However, as these preliminary data were only available from two GPS-enabled drifting capsules and as ocean currents may have changed significantly over the past few centuries, the conclusions that we can draw from such data are somewhat limited. Furthermore, it is possible that these currents can change throughout the year. Thus, these data must be considered with caution and pending far more detailed studies of ocean currents in the North Atlantic throughout the year. Nevertheless, high vagility of the great auk is further supported by its ability to track its habitat in response to climate change, as evidenced by archaeological records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campmas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meldgaard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Serjeantson, 2001</xref>).</p><p>We find no evidence in our genetic data that would suggest that great auk populations were at risk of extinction at the time when human hunting intensified. However, the strength of our conclusions is limited in a number of respects. The mitochondrial genome is only a single genetic marker and our samples were insufficiently preserved to yield nuclear SNP data (Appendix 9), which would have offered a greater degree of resolution with the potential to detect population structure. Similarly, as a result of limitations in sample preservation and availability, the sample size of 41 is relatively small for population genetic analysis and could have limited our ability to resolve changes in population structure and size.</p><p>The key question, therefore, is whether it is at all feasible to assume that the intensive hunting of the 16<sup>th</sup>–19<sup>th</sup> centuries alone led to the extinction of the great auk. Our population viability analysis shows that, independent of the population size, harvest rates that would cause extinction under all of the conditions explored in our simulations are well below reasonable estimates of harvest rates as inferred from historical sources. For example, a total population size of 2 million birds corresponds to 1 million mature individuals. This is higher than the upper margin of our census size estimates and is consistent with the census size currently estimated for the great auk’s closest relative, the razorbill. At this census size, an annual harvest of 210,000 birds and fewer than 26,000 eggs would have caused the extinction of the great auk within 350 years.</p><p>Actual hunting pressure on great auks is likely to have far exceeded 210,000 birds annually. From 1497 AD, when Europeans discovered the rich fishing grounds of Newfoundland, fleets of 300 to 400 ships from various European countries were drawn annually to this region, which is likely to have had the highest population density of great auks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steenstrup, 1855</xref>). Fishing stations were set up near colonies of the great auk and other seabirds, and these colonies were heavily exploited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pope, 2009</xref>). Great auks were also likely to have been caught by fishing lines and in fishing nets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montevecchi and Kirk, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piatt and Nettleship, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piatt and Nettleship, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pope, 2009</xref>). Contemporary reports document a case in which approximately 1000 great auks were caught and killed within half an hour by two fishing vessels off the coast of Funk Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grieve, 1885</xref>). Thus, if each of the 400 vessels in the region spent only half an hour a year harvesting great auks at this rate, that would already correspond to 200,000 birds a year.</p><p>At a total population size of 6 million birds, corresponding to the estimated 3 million mature individuals of common murre and thick-billed murre in the North Atlantic, an annual harvest of 630,000 birds and 77,000 eggs would cause certain extinction. Even this number does not appear unrealistically high when considering that great auks were also targeted for the feather trade, with hunters living on Funk Island throughout the summer with the purpose of killing the birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaskell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kirkham and Montevecchi, 1982</xref>). Adding to the effects of excessive hunting, the great auk laid only one egg a year, which was not replaced if removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>). Thus, replenishing the large number of birds lost annually would have been highly improbable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaskell, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Critically, our estimates of harvest rates leading to extinction are likely to be conservatively high, because they are based on some unrealistically optimistic assumptions. For example, our settings assume that 100% of mature birds breed, that they had 100% breeding success, and that their offspring was independent from the time the egg was laid (hence no negative effect of parents being killed). Furthermore, we assumed the lowest natural mortality observed among all alcids for each age class and in some simulations reduced these mortality rates by half when population density declined, thereby considering the positive effects of increased availability of resources and reduced competition. Detrimental effects of small population sizes, such as inbreeding depression, were not included in our simulations. Because very little is known about the biology of the great auk, we chose to use such conservative settings to reduce the risk of underestimating the sustainable harvest rate. However, this brings an increased risk of overestimating the number of birds that could have been sustainably harvested. Using the mortality rate of the razorbill and allowing for more variation in reproductive success (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>) reduces the sustainable harvest rate for a population of 2 million birds to as few as 40,000 birds per year. However, the razorbill can produce a second egg per season if the first one is lost, so applying razorbill mortality rates to the great auk likely leads to an underestimation of the sustainable harvest rate.</p><p>Our conservative simulations require high harvest rates to cause the extinction of the great auk, but these values are largely consistent with harvest rates for present-day species. For example, until recently, between 200,000 and 300,000 murres (<italic>Uria</italic> spp.) were killed legally every year off the eastern Canadian coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>). Harvest rates were even higher before the mid-1990s, when between 300,000 and 700,000 thick-billed murres alone were being harvested annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>). In Iceland, 150,000 to 233,000 Atlantic puffins were once killed annually, representing about 2–3% of the population. In contrast, 25–30% of the populations of species of black-backed gulls are killed annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merkel and Barry, 2008</xref>). Although current figures for annual harvest rates of auk species are considerably lower than those given above and continue to decline (e.g.,~25,000 puffins were killed in Iceland in 2016 compared with ~233,000 in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Statistics Iceland, 2016</xref>]; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frederiksen et al., 2016</xref>), the harvesting rates required to cause the extinction of the great auk would not be considered excessive even by modern standards.</p><p>The roles of humans and environmental changes in causing extinctions have long been debated, not only for the great auk but also for other lost species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lorenzen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shapiro et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast with most studies of Pleistocene extinctions, which have argued for at least some level of climate-driven environmental contributions to species extinction, we have found little evidence that the great auk was at risk of extinction prior to the onset of intensive human hunting. Critically, this does not mean that our study provides unequivocal evidence that humans alone were the cause of great auk extinction. To test this hypothesis, simulations of great auk population dynamics in response to environmental change throughout the Holocene would be required. However, with little information about great auk biology, such simulations would be highly speculative. What our study has demonstrated though, is that human hunting pressure alone was very likely to have been high enough to cause extinction even if the great auk population was not already under threat of extinction through environmental change.</p><p>Our findings highlight how industrial-scale commercial exploitation of natural resources have the potential to drive even an abundant, wide-ranging, highly vagile, and genetically diverse species to extinction within a short period of time. This echoes the conclusions drawn for the passenger pigeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murray et al., 2017</xref>), which occurred in enormous numbers prior to its extinction in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Our findings emphasise the need for thorough monitoring of commercially harvested species, particularly in poorly researched environments such as our oceans. This will lay the platform for sustainable ecosystems and ensure the evidence-based conservation management of biodiversity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling and DNA extraction</title><p>We obtained great auk material for ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses from various institutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

Over the next two weeks, the capsules drifted towards Greenland and when located near the continental shelf started drifting southwards along the coast. The capsules then followed the track of the Icelandic Low, a low-pressure area found between Iceland and Southern Greenland in winter.</p><p>The Icelandic Low took the capsules in an anti-clockwise circle back towards Iceland, and onward again towards the west coast of Greenland. The Icelandic Low weakens in summer, so in late April the capsules turned westwards past the southern tip of Greenland and into the Labrador Sea. In summer, they drifted slowly towards the Labrador coast until the beginning of August when they started drifting south-eastwards along the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland and past Funk Island and around 500 km east. By the end of October, the capsules start to follow the trail of the winter low pressures across the Atlantic.</p><p>At the beginning of January, capsule one drifted eastwards, around 50 km south of St Kilda and came ashore on the island of Tiree (15.01.2017). Capsule two drifted northwards, passing around 70 km west of St Kilda and west of the Faeroes towards Iceland. In early March, the capsule was around 20 km from the east coast of Iceland when it turned eastwards and then towards south by the beginning of April. It drifted towards the Faeroes where it came ashore on the island of Sandoy (13.05.2017).</p><p>The forces driving the capsules are currents, wind, and waves. The capsules got trapped in the Iceland Low where the wind direction is in a counter clockwise circle in winter in the Denmark Strait. In spring, when the Iceland Low starts dissolving, they pass Cape Farewell and, in summer, they drift slowly in calmer summer winds and followed the cold current towards the Labrador coast and then along the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland. In autumn, they hit the path of lows crossing the Atlantic as well as following the warmer Gulfstream. In spring, when at the east coast of Iceland, the weather was calmer and thus capsule two drifted slowly towards and then away from the coast and ended up in the Faeroes.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Molecular dating</title><p>Estimating the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all our samples is not essential to understanding the causes of the extinction of the great auk, but can help with the interpretation of our reconstructions of population dynamics. Our data set is unable to yield reliable information about population dynamics beyond the MRCA of all samples. To infer the evolutionary rate and timescale, we performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the mitogenome sequences from the 25 dated samples. The analyses were conducted using the same settings and data-partitioning scheme as described in the Methods for our Bayesian phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>The sequence alignment was analysed using BEAST 1.8.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>). The evolutionary timescale was estimated using a strict clock model, with the sampling times of the mitogenomes serving as calibrations for the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rambaut, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, to test for the presence of temporal structure in the data set, we performed a date-randomisation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ramsden et al., 2008</xref>). We estimated mutation rates from 20 replicate data sets in which the sampling times were permuted and compared these with the rate estimate from the original data set. Two different criteria can be used to determine whether the data set has sufficient temporal structure for generating a reliable estimate of the mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duchêne et al., 2015</xref>): if the mean or median estimate from the original data set is not contained within the 95% credibility intervals of the rate estimates from the date-randomised replicates (CR1), or if the 95% credibility intervals of the rate estimates from the date-randomised replicates do not overlap with the 95% credibility interval of the rate estimate from the original data set (CR2).</p><p>For comparison, we used two additional methods to estimate the mutation rate. First, we used TempEst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>) to estimate the mutation rate using regression of root-to-tip distances against sampling times. Second, we analysed the data using least-squares dating in LSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">To et al., 2016</xref>). For both of these methods, a phylogram was estimated from the dated mitogenome sequences using maximum likelihood in RAxML 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>). Rooting of the tree was inferred by maximising the R-squared value in TempEst and by minimising the objective function in LSD.</p><p>Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the dated mitogenomes produced a posterior median estimate of 42,188 years (95% credibility interval 24,743–84,894 years) for the age of the most recent common ancestor. The median posterior estimate of the mutation rate was 2.74 × 10<sup>−8</sup> mutations/site/year (95% credibility interval 9.83 × 10<sup>−9</sup>–4.53 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). The data set showed some evidence of temporal structure, passing the more lenient criterion CR1 but not the more stringent CR2 of the date-randomisation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duchêne et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, with all caution required given the limited temporal structure in our data, our inference of a constant population size for the great auks should be reliable reaching back to the late Pleistocene. However, our data set is not likely to be suitable for drawing strong conclusions about population dynamics of the great auk beyond the last glacial period.</p><fig id="app3fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Date-randomisation test for temporal structure in dated mitogenome sequences.</title><p>The filled circle indicates the median posterior estimate of the mutation rate from the original data set, whereas the empty circles show the median posterior estimates from 20 date-randomised replicate data sets. The 95% credibility intervals (vertical black lines) of the estimates from the date-randomised replicates do not overlap with the median estimate from the original data set, providing some evidence of temporal structure in the data set (criterion CR1).

Data produced in this study show a lack of population structuring in the great auk (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and we therefore consider great auks of the North Atlantic to form a single panmictic population. Scenarios were run as a population-based model. Models were also run under scenarios with various definitions of extinction to evaluate any impacts on our results. Extinction was defined as: only one sex remains; population size below the critical limit of 50; or population size below the critical limit of 500. These values are based on the ‘50:500 rule’, which refers to a species’ risk of extinction as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franklin (1980)</xref>.</p><p>The outcomes of our simulations were unaffected by the choice of definition used for extinction, which is unsurprising because hunting pressure did not cease towards the extinction of the species. Given this hunting pressure, even 500 birds were well below the sustainable population size, so independent of whether the population size declined to 500 or 50 birds or there was just one sex remaining, the species was bound for extinction. These results might have looked different if our simulations had assumed a complete cessation of hunting when only 500 or only 50 birds were remaining. However, the historical record clearly shows that this was not the case. In fact, as the rarity of the great auk increased, it became more desirable for inclusion in private and institutional collections, as was the case for the last breeding pair killed on Eldey Island in June 1844 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaskell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grieve, 1885</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Newton, 1861</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steenstrup, 1855</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thomas et al., 2017</xref>). All results reported are from simulations run under extinction defined as ‘only one sex remains’.</p><p>Age of first breeding for the great auk is estimated to be 4–7 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>), and a conservative value of 4 years was therefore adopted for the model. The younger the age of first breeding, the less susceptible to extinction the species is. The species is assumed to have been monogamous, laying only one egg per breeding season,, and it is thought they did not replace the egg if it was lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuller, 1999</xref>). An assumed sex ratio of 1:1 has been applied. Life expectancy is estimated to have been 20–25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>) and we assume that breeding remained possible until death. As several alcid species breed annually once they reach sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Santo and Nelson, 1995</xref>), we set reproductive rate to 100% adult females breeding and all females producing exactly one egg per year.</p><p>Mortality rates were estimated based on records from extant alcids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Santo and Nelson (1995)</xref> report survival rates for alcid species at various life stages. Mortality at age 0–1 includes hatchlings and fledglings. For the great auk, we estimate mortality to be 9% (SD: 1), consistent with the lowest mortality reported for any alcid species for this age category by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Santo and Nelson (1995)</xref> (Japanese murrelet, <italic>Synthliboramphus wumizusume</italic>). With regard to the simulation model, juvenile mortality includes mortality in the age groups 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4; therefore, our juvenile mortality rate was divided between these groups. The lowest mortality for this age group reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Santo and Nelson (1995)</xref> is that of the crested auklet (<italic>Aethia cristella</italic>; 34%). This corresponds to approximately 13% (SD: 1) mortality per year over three years, if the population size of the respective previous year is used as reference in each year. Annual adult survival rate is estimated to be quite high for great auks, because of their large size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montevecchi and Kirk, 1996</xref>). Annual adult survival in other alcids is also high, with the razorbill being the highest reported at 93% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Santo and Nelson, 1995</xref>). We therefore used an annual mortality rate of 7% (SD:1) for adult great auks. Strictly applying the rule that we use the lowest mortality rate of any alcid species found in the literature leads to some settings that are questionable from a biological perspective. For example, our 0–1 year hatchling mortality is lower than our 1–4 years juvenile mortality. However, as we have no information about actual mortality rates in great auks, any adjustment of these settings would be arbitrary. We therefore chose to strictly use the lowest mortality rates found in the literature for each age class. For comparison, we added a simulation based on known mortality rates of the razorbill, which have a more biological realistic distribution of mortality rates, albeit perhaps somewhat too high for the great auk (see Discussion and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>).</p><p>A reduction of population size, even by harvesting, might have a positive effect on reproductive rate and mortality by freeing up resources and reducing competition. As our reproductive rate was already 100%, a way to simulate such effects was to introduce a linear, density-dependent reduction of mortality rates to half the initial value, following the formula: (0.5+(0.5*PS1))*[initial mortality rate], with PS1 being defined as initial population size (N) divided by carrying capacity (K). Simulations were run with and without this density-dependent reduction in mortality rates (DD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>).</p><p>We initially estimated the census size (Nc) for our population viability analyses from our estimated effective female population size (Ne) by doubling the effective female population size and dividing the result by Ne/Nc rations typical for birds as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frankham (1995)</xref>. However, the range of known, typical Ne/Nc ratios for birds extends over two orders of magnitude, from 0.052 to 0.74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frankham, 1995</xref>). Given these ratios, our estimates for the census size of great auks ranged from 12,292 to 756,346. As we did identify a Pleistocene population bottleneck, and given the large population size reported in historic sources, the actual census size was likely close to or even higher than the upper margin of these estimates, and this is consistent with census sizes currently estimated for the great auk’s closest relative, the razorbill (<italic>Alca torda</italic>). Within a range similar to that of the great auk, the IUCN Red List estimates that the razorbill (<italic>Alca torda</italic>) currently has a population size of 979,000–1,020,000 mature individuals. Within the same range, the common murre (<italic>Uria aalge</italic>) and the thick-billed murre <italic>Uria lomvia</italic>) are estimated to have population sizes of 2,350,000–3,060,000 and 1,920,000–2,840,000 mature individuals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">BirdLife International, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">BirdLife International, 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">BirdLife International, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we conservatively aimed for mature population sizes of 1,000,000 and 3,000,000 great auks.</p><p>Razorbills and murres can fly and therefore have access to a larger number of breeding sites than the great auk. They are also much smaller birds, which could facilitate larger population sizes in the same range. On the other hand, razorbill and murre populations may be more affected by hunting today than great auk populations were at the time intensive hunting started. Overall, we feel that our population-size estimates are a reasonably realistic reflection of great auk population sizes. We used Vortex 10.2.8.0 to estimate the census size from the number of mature individuals, assuming that birds reach maturity at 4 years of age, that they show a stable age distribution, and that the different age classes follow the fixed mortality rates described below. This resulted in census sizes for our simulations of 2,000,000 and 6,000,000 birds respectively.</p><p>To estimate hunting pressure, we compared models in which various proportions of the population were harvested (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref> for example of how harvest rates were calculated). The age categories for harvest rate are 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, and over four for both males and females. We allocated 75% of the harvest rate to the over four category as it was assumed that predominantly adult birds were harvested due to being easily accessible when breeding. The remaining 25% was then split evenly between the other four age categories (0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4), as although it has been reported that young were used as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grieve, 1885</xref>), it is unlikely they were harvested at the same intensity as the adults and represented a smaller proportion of the overall population.</p><p>As we know eggs were collected as well, we allowed for this in the model. The harvest rate for eggs was set at 5%, corresponding to 25,688 and 77,065 respectively for the two initial population sizes tested in our simulations. As great auks nested in dense groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson, 1984</xref>) eggs would have been easy to collect. Based on estimates of breeding pairs at Funk Island (&gt;100,000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birkhead, 1993</xref>), these two values allowed us to test the impact of a quarter or three quarters of all the eggs laid annually on Funk Island alone being harvested, with no harvest occurring anywhere else in the great auk range. We also ran simulations with no egg harvesting to evaluate whether this significantly changed our conclusions. With these egg harvest settings, an annual bird harvest rate of 10% of the number of birds in the pre-hunting population was identified as critical limit, with significant numbers of simulations leading to extinction. At 10.5% bird harvest rate, all simulations that included egg harvesting and a significant proportion of simulations excluding egg harvesting resulted in extinction.</p><p>Our comparative simulations with more ‘realistic’ rather than conservative settings, including razorbill mortality rates were conducted under the settings outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-9"><title>Appendix 9</title><boxed-text><sec id="s16" sec-type="appendix"><title>Nuclear SNP data</title><p>As the results of our mitochondrial genome revealed a lack of population genetic structure and high genetic diversity in the great auk, we attempted to target nuclear DNA (nuDNA) to further investigate these results, and to obtain a more detailed picture of great auk evolution and extinction.

Briefly, we used AdapterRemoval v2.1.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schubert et al., 2016</xref>) to trim the reads for adapters and low quality bases (BaseQ &lt;5 or Ns), and to exclude those reads shorter than 30 bp or with more than 50 bp of missing data. Filtered reads from each sample were mapped against the razorbill reference genome (Gilbert, unpublished) using BWA-MEM v0.7.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li, 2013</xref>), and those with low mapping quality (MapQ &lt;15) removed. After the initial alignment step, Picard (v1.128, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>) was used to exclude reads that were PCR or optical duplicates. Subsequently, GATK v3.5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) was used to perform a realignment step around indels. As we are dealing with historical samples, we also quantified the extent of DNA damage in our samples using mapDamage v2.0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jónsson et al., 2013</xref>). We characterised rates of deamination in double strands (DeltaD) and single strands (DeltaS), as well as the probability of reads not terminating in overhangs (Lambda, transformed into 1/Lambda – 1, a proxy for the overhang length of overhanging regions).

The reviewers noted that additional nuclear markers would have significantly strengthened analyses, but appreciated that obtaining this information proved methodologically difficult.

Such lack of structure is usually explained either by high dispersal or a relatively recent bottleneck, followed by range expansion. Since the Great Auk was a flightless bird, it would be very interesting if you could add a comparison to the phylogeographic structure (or lack thereof) found in penguins (e.g., Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p>d) Related to the previous comment, the manuscript could be improved by a brief comparison, perhaps in the Discussion, with what previous studies have found when analysing temporally sampled mtDNA data across demographic declines (e.g., in either extinct species or species that are critically endangered today). The manuscript does not appear to cite any papers that analysed genetic changes across the time scales explored here (i.e., a few centuries). Perhaps the human-caused decline in the Great Auk was even more rapid than the declines that have been observed in many species during the last century? Do you have enough samples (i.e., power) to detect a decline in genetic diversity in the last 100 years prior to the Great Auk's extinction?</p><p>e) Supplementary Figure 4: Please add a higher-resolution version of the TempNet figure as a main figure, instead of as a supplementary item. The reason for this is partly that there is currently no easily accessible information in the main text on how the samples are temporally distributed, which is important for context. Furthermore, the finding that diversity was still high in the last time bin (&lt;250 years) is very interesting, and should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>4) Population viability analyses:</p><p>The reviewers generally found the population viability analyses (PVA) well implemented, but highlighted a few points that need addressing.</p><p>a) You chose to specify a fairly optimistic life history scenario for the Great Auk, reasoning that, if the model predicts extinction even under these conditions, it can be safely concluded that extinction risk must have been high in the real world. While this is a reasonable approach, the PVA settings were perhaps a touch too optimistic, with zero environmental variation in reproduction, and very low variation in mortality rates (set at 1% for all age classes). Furthermore, it seems that Vortex was run with harvest rate set as a constant percentage of population size (please clarify in the revision whether this was actually the case, as it was hard to tell from either the manuscript or the Vortex documentation), even though it is conceivable that humans may have continued harvesting a constant number (at least for a while), as it would have been relatively easy to find the birds on their nesting colonies. When run on such basic settings, the PVA comes close to being a deterministic model, and a simple lambda calculation could have yielded the same insight: using life history parameters from Supplementary file 2A and B, lambda can be estimated as ~1.12, and one would conclude that a harvest rate of 12% would clearly be unsustainable in a deterministic manner. Please consider exploring a more realistic suite of settings, and provide some further context to justify your PVA approach.</p><p>b) In general, the life history parameters seem carefully chosen, but it is slightly odd that annual juvenile mortality (13%) is higher than hatchling/fledgling mortality (9%). Can this be justified, or adjusted? Furthermore, estimates for age of first breeding and adult survival probably need amending.</p><p>c) Is there more historical information on harvest rates, such as numbers of birds or eggs taken from a particular nesting colony, that would allow the calculation of site- and time-specific harvest rates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47509.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Study assumptions:</p><p>The reviewers noted that some aspects of the study inevitably remained quite speculative, and felt that this should be better acknowledged throughout.

The changes made are as follows:</p><p>Results: Ocean current data: To evaluate potential reasons for the observed lack of population structure, we sourced data from GPS-equipped drifting capsules that had been deployed in the North Atlantic as part of the “Message in a Bottle” project by Verkís Consulting Engineers. As the great auk was flightless, ocean currents might have influenced its migration patterns. The route taken by the capsules connects some of the main breeding colonies in St Kilda (Scotland), Geirfuglasker/Eldey Island (Iceland), and Funk Island (Canada) (Figure 4). The extrapolation of present-day ocean current data into the past and the interpretation of the data in the context of great auk movements is merely speculative. However, if ocean currents today are comparable to those of past millennia, then the data do at least provide a possible explanation for how great auks travelled across their former range and between breeding colonies (Figure 4). A full description of the routes taken by the capsules is provided in Appendix 1.</p><p>Discussion: We can only speculate what factors may have driven this lack of population structure, but the data collected from the GPS-enabled drifting capsules are consistent with hypotheses put forward by a number of authors. It has been suggested that migrations occurred in both northward and southward directions between breeding and wintering sites, aided by ocean currents such as the East Greenland Current (Brown, 1985; Meldgaard, 1988; Montevecchi and Kirk, 1996). However, as these preliminary data were only available from two GPS-enabled drifting capsules and as ocean currents may have changed significantly over the past few centuries, the conclusions that we can draw from such data are somewhat limited. Furthermore, it is possible that these currents can change throughout the year. Thus, these data must be considered with caution and pending far more detailed studies of ocean currents in the North Atlantic throughout the year. Nevertheless, high vagility of the great auk is further supported by its ability to track its habitat in response to climate change, as evidenced by archaeological records (Bengtson, 1984; Campmas et al., 2010; Meldgaard, 1988; Serjeantson, 2001).</p><p>We hope that this now makes it clear that although the data has been included in the Discussion and used in supporting some of our conclusions, it is from a small, preliminary dataset and should therefore be viewed that way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Genomic analyses:</p><p>The reviewers have raised several issues about the genomic analyses that need addressing.</p><p>a) There is a hint that a Spanish sample may have been differentiated from the Northern ones, and could represent a refugial population.

We have explored this further as good as possible with limited data (see below). Our results suggest that there is no evidence for a refugial population in Spain. Samples from Spain are similarly spread across the tree as samples from other regions. Below, we have summarized the additional analyses we have conducted. However, as they do not show any pattern that is unobserved in the data we use for this publication, we would prefer to leave this section out of the manuscript.

It helps to put our findings from the great auk in context and shows that while the lack of population structure in great auks is surprising, it does not actually appear to be unusual in flightless seabirds. We have now added a paragraph that reads: While all of the great auk’s closest relatives are capable of flight, which would aid population connectivity, a lack of population structure has similarly been report from some penguin species. For example, little or no population structure has been reported for the emperor penguin (<italic>Aptenodytes forsteri</italic>) (Cristofari et al., 2016), chinstrap penguin (<italic>Pygoscelis antarcticus)</italic> (Mura-Jornet et al., 2018), and Adélie penguin (<italic>P. adeliae</italic>) Gorman et al., 2017; Roeder et al., 2001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Related to the previous comment, the manuscript could be improved by a brief comparison, perhaps in the Discussion, with what previous studies have found when analysing temporally sampled mtDNA data across demographic declines (e.g., in either extinct species or species that are critically endangered today). The manuscript does not appear to cite any papers that analysed genetic changes across the time scales explored here (i.e., a few centuries). Perhaps the human-caused decline in the Great Auk was even more rapid than the declines that have been observed in many species during the last century? Do you have enough samples (i.e., power) to detect a decline in genetic diversity in the last 100 years prior to the Great Auk's extinction?</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed an obvious omission in our Discussion. We have now added a section to the first paragraph of the Discussion which discussed this point as follows:</p><p>If the great auk had been at risk of extinction prior to the onset of intensive human hunting, for example as a result of long-term suboptimal habitat or environmental change, we would expect to see genetic evidence of such stress, as for example observed in studies of cave bears (Stiller et al., 2010) and bison (Shapiro et al., 2004). If, on the other hand, the population declined rapidly, for example as a result of extensive hunting, genetic data would have only very limited power to detect such a decline in a long-lived species. Mitochondrial DNA studies of New Zealand moa found no evidence of a population declines prior to extinction (Allentoft et al., 2014; Rawlence et al., 2012) and a study of the endemic Hawaiian Petrel came to a similar conclusion (Welch et al., 2012). In fact, even a recent whole-genome study of two extinct New Zealand songbirds (huia and South Island kõkako), which disappeared after human settlement within 700 years, found no genetic evidence of population decline prior to the disappearance of the species (Dussex et al., 2019). Therefore, our results are consistent with a rapid decline of great auks. It is important to keep in mind, though, that our results simply indicate that the demise of the great auk was beyond the detection limit of genetic data. They do not necessarily confirm whether the rapid demise that must have taken place prior to extinction started before or after the onset of extensive human hunting, nor do the results provide an indication of whether there was more than one population decline. A localised, unexplained decline in great auk numbers on the eastern side of the North Atlantic over the past 2,000 years, for example, which has been inferred from a decline in bone finds in England, Scotland, and Scandinavia (Bengtson, 1984; Best and Mulville, 2014; Grieve, 1885; Hufthammer, 1982; Serjeantson, 2001), does not appear to have been severe enough to leave a genetic signature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Supplementary Figure S4: Please add a higher-resolution version of the TempNet figure as a main figure, instead of as a supplementary item.

These simulations yield a sustainable harvest rate of approximately 40,000 birds a year without any egg harvest. This is likely an underestimation, as the razorbill does have a higher reproductive rate than the great auk, and can therefore tolerate a higher mortality.

Can this be justified, or adjusted?</p></disp-quote><p>The reasoning behind the somewhat odd distribution of mortality rates was that we wanted a rigorous way to decide on rates in the absence of biological information. Hence we decided on the criterium of “lowest rates of any alcid found in the literature”. And the lowest rates we could find for the 0-1 year timeframe are lower than those for the later time frames. We could have increased the 0-1 values, but it would have been arbitrary, so we decided against it. However, we have now also included analyses with the complete razorbill set of mortality rates and higher standard variations to provide a comparison how our simulations would look with less conservative, but still species derived settings. We have also added a further explanation of our reasoning behind the conservative values into the manuscript which reads (Appendix 7):</p><p>“Strictly applying the rule that we use the lowest mortality rate of any alcid species found in the literature leads to some settings that are questionable from a biological perspective. For example, our 0-1 year hatchling mortality is lower than our 1-4 years juvenile mortality. However, as we have no information about actual mortality rates in great auks, any adjustment of these settings would be arbitrary. We therefore chose to strictly use the lowest mortality rates found in the literature for each age class. For comparison, we added a simulation based on known mortality rates of the razorbill, which have a more biological realistic distribution of mortality rates, albeit perhaps somewhat too high for the great auk (see Discussion and Supplementary file 2B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, estimates for age of first breeding and adult survival probably need amending.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done that in our “realistic settings” analyses (see Supplementary file 2A and B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Is there more historical information on harvest rates, such as numbers of birds or eggs taken from a particular nesting colony, that would allow the calculation of site- and time-specific harvest rates?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we could not find such information despite extensive literature searches. This was in fact the main reason why we decided on running the analyses with unrealistically conservative settings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
