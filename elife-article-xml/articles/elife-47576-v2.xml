extensions of transverse-tubules (TT) that increase co-localization of proteins required for store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). Here, we report that SOCE, peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and muscle force production during repetitive stimulation are increased after exercise in parallel with the time course of TT association with SR-stacks. Unexpectedly, exercise also activated constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry coincident with a modest decrease in total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content. Importantly, this decrease in releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content observed after exercise was reversed by repetitive high-frequency stimulation, consistent with enhanced SOCE. The functional benefits of exercise on SOCE, constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and muscle force production were lost in mice with muscle-specific loss of Orai1 function. These results indicate that TT association with SR-stacks enhances Orai1-dependent SOCE to optimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and muscle contractile function during acute exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>store operated calcium entry</kwd><kwd>Orai1 channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR059646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name><name><surname>Protasi</surname><given-names>Feliciano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, University and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN #2015ZZR4W3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Protasi</surname><given-names>Feliciano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alfred and Eleanor Wedd Fund, University of Rochester</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michelucci</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional analyses show that transverse tubule association with stacks of sarcoplasmic reticulum enhances Orai1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and maximize force during exercise.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism activated by depletion of intracellular stores, is mediated by the coupling between stromal interacting molecule-1 (STIM1), a luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roos et al., 2005</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable Orai1 channels in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feske et al., 2006</xref>). In skeletal muscle, SOCE is similarly coordinated by a functional interaction between STIM1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Orai1 in the transverse tubule (TT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurebayashi and Ogawa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lyfenko and Dirksen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stiber et al., 2008</xref>), specialized invaginations of the surface membrane that propagate action potentials to trigger SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. While the precise physiological role(s) of SOCE in muscle remains incompletely defined, SOCE has been proposed to promote myoblast fusion/differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darbellay et al., 2009</xref>) and muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurebayashi and Ogawa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wei-Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrell et al., 2016</xref>), reduce fatigue during periods of prolonged stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wei-Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>), as well as serve as a counter-flux to Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss across the TT system during EC coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koenig et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, mutations in the genes that encode STIM1 and Orai1 underlie an array of disorders with clinical myopathy as central deﬁning component. SOCE dysfunction also contributes to the pathogenesis of several other muscle disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Michelucci et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, SOCE plays an important role in both normal muscle development/function and muscle disease.</p><p>In resting mammalian skeletal muscle, STIM1 proteins are found throughout the I band of the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stiber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wei-Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, Orai1 channels at rest are found almost exclusively at the A-I band junction, in accordance with their localization within the TT membrane of the triad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wei-Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). A modest degree of STIM1-Orai1 co-localization at the A-I band junction at rest has been suggested to explain in part the uniquely rapid activation of SOCE (&lt;1 s) observed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koenig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Launikonis and Ríos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>). However, STIM1 and Orai1 localization in muscle is not static, as acute treadmill exercise drives a significant reorganization of the sarcotubular membranes in the I band of <italic>extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL) fibers of wild type (WT) mice that involves: i) remodeling of the SR into stacks of flat cisternae; ii) elongation of the TT into the I band; and iii) increased co-localization of Orai1 with STIM1 in the I band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). This exercise-induced remodeling leads to the formation of new SR-TT contacts that are structurally distinct from triad junctions in that they are oriented longitudinally at the I band (while triads are transversally oriented at the A-I band junction) and display a junctional gap of only 7–8 nm (while triads exhibit a 12 nm junctional gap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the formation of these junctions following acute exercise correlates with an increased resistance to EDL muscle contractile decline during repetitive stimulation in presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but not under conditions that reduce SOCE (0 Ca<sup>2</sup>, BTP-2, 2-APB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). As the formation of the SR-TT junctions within the I band following acute exercise are coincident with enhanced STIM1-Orai1 co-localization and force production during sustained activity, these structural elements were suggested to function as <italic>Calcium Entry Units</italic> (CEUs).</p><p>In spite of these findings, the stability of CEUs formed following exercise, process for disassembly of the components, and impact on Orai1-dependent SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, and muscle force production remain unknown. In fact, the precise degree to which CEUs formed after exercise promote SOCE, optimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and contribute to the adaptation of muscle function in response to acute exercise is unknown. Here, we addressed these issues using a combination of structural (electron microscopy, EM) and functional (Mn<sup>2+</sup> quench of fura-2 fluorescence, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, and muscle contractility) approaches in EDL muscle and <italic>flexor digitorum brevis</italic> (FDB) fibers from WT and Orai1-deficient mice in the absence of exercise (control) or &lt;1, 6, and 24 hr after acute treadmill exercise. Together, the results support the idea that TT association with SR stacks in the I band promotes Orai1-dependent SOCE needed to replenish releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, maintain SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and maximize contractile force during repetitive stimulation of fast twitch skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SR-stacks increase for up to 6 hr after exercise</title><p>We previously reported that EDL muscle fibers from mice subjected to a single bout of incremental treadmill running exhibit a remodeling of SR membranes into flat, parallel stacks of flat cisternae (<italic>SR-stacks</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). To determine their stability, we quantified SR-stacks in EM cross sections of EDL muscles fixed at different time points (&lt;1, 6 and 24 hr) following acute treadmill exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).

The percentage of fibers with SR-stacks at the I band and the number of SR stacks/100 µm<sup>2</sup> further increased 6 hr after exercise.

To test this idea, we measured total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content in FDB fibers under resting conditions and after delivery of 10 consecutive, high-frequency stimulus trains. Total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content was assessed in fura-FF-loaded fibers by application of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release cocktail consisting of 10 µM ionomycin, 30 µM cyclopiazonic acid, and 100 µM EGTA in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Ringer’s solution (ICE). The results indicate that compared to fibers from control mice, resting total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content was significantly reduced (~25%) in fibers obtained from mice &lt; 1 hr after exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but not in fibers isolated from mice 6 and 24 hr after exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Importantly, both total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content and myoplasmic resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration were increased significantly after 10 stimulus trains in fibers from mice &lt; 1 hr after exercise compared to that observed for fibers from both control mice and mice &lt; 1 hr after exercise in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

To address these possibilities, we compared the kinetics of electrically-evoked twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay in mag-fluo-4-loaded fibers from sedentary mice and mice &lt; 1 hr after exercise before and after delivery of 10 consecutive stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 s). Using this approach, the decay phase of the electrically-evoked transient is well-described by a double exponential fit in which the fast component primarily reflects Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to fast myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers while the slow component is dominated by SERCA-mediated SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capote et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that the stacks of flat-parallel SR cisternae formed after exercise are functionally competent CEUs only when associated with a TT extended from the triad.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47576.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of structural events and functional effects of CEU assembly and disassembly following acute exercise and during recovery.</title><p>Left) In non-exercised or sedentary muscle, the SR is fully replete with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, and the myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is low.

Together, these results show that the functional effects of acute exercise are controlled by association of TTs (containing Orai1 proteins) with SR-stacks (containing STIM1 proteins) in the I band, with an increase of TT/SR contact length that provides a greater surface area for STIM1-Orai1 interaction. The role of SR-SR interfaces that lack a TT element remains unclear. However, SR-stacks containing multiple elements virtually identical to those formed in muscle after exercise, are also observed in non-muscle cells following STIM1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perni et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, both ER-ER contacts in non-muscle cells overexpressing STIM1 and SR-SR contacts in muscle after acute exercise exhibit small electron dense bridges within a similar junctional gap width (~8 nm). These similarities in membrane structure and gap width are consistent with the small electron dense bridges observed in EM images reflecting STIM1 proteins. Similar to the ‘diffusion trap’ model of STIM1-Orai1 coupling in non-excitable cells proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), one possible interpretation of these findings is that STIM1-containing SR-stacks could be needed to efficiently trap Orai1 channels during TT elongation into the I band.</p><p>An unexpected finding of this study was the demonstration of significant Mn<sup>2+</sup> quench in the absence of thapsigargin/cyclopiazonic acid-induced store depletion (constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry) in FDB fibers isolated from mice &lt; 1 hr after treadmill exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in these fibers was rapidly blocked by application of BTP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the constitutive entry in these fibers is unlikely to represent increased susceptibility of fibers to damage shortly after exercise. In support of this idea, the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed &lt;1 hr after exercise is absent in fibers from two separate mouse models deficient in Orai1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest that the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is mediated by Orai1 channels (rather than TrpC or mechano-sensitive channels). D1ER measurements of ‘spatially-averaged’ free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the SR were not significantly different after exercise (though areas of local depletion are possible). It is important to note, however, that D1ER localization studies indicate that the majority of the D1ER signal originated from the triad junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, the D1ER measurements suggest that the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within the triad junction is not different after exercise. Thus, constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed after exercise most likely does not originate from Orai1 channels within the triad junction. Rather, constitutive entry may arise from Orai1 channels in another location, possibly CEUs assembled during exercise in the I band region of the sarcomere that are not well-reflected in the spatially-averaged D1ER signal. These observations support the possibility that CEUs represent the site of constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry after exercise. An alternative explanation is that exercise could produce a signal that directly activates Orai1 independent of store depletion.</p><p>Assuming no changes in the properties of sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux mechanisms, the increase in constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed &lt;1 hr after exercise could explain the elevation in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration observed at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, partial Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion within SR-stacks of the CEU represents one possible mechanism for the constitutive entry observed immediately following exercise. Alternatively, as lower levels of store depletion are sufficient for Stim2 to activate Orai1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thiel et al., 2013</xref>), the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed after exercise could reflect Stim2-mediated activation of Orai1 channels within the CEUs. Thus, it will be important for future studies to more definitively assess SERCA and Stim2 expression within CEUs, determine the relative distribution of the short and long forms of STIM1 within CEUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Michelucci et al., 2018</xref>), and quantitatively model Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and diffusion within and out of these structures.</p><p>Another observation that deserves consideration is the non-linear correspondence between exercise-induced changes in structure (TT/SR contact length increases five fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and SOCE function (~65% increase in maximal rate of Mn<sup>2+</sup> quench; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) in FDB muscle. One possibility is that, as proposed above, CEUs may reflect the subcellular location for the constitutive SOCE observed &lt;1 hr after exercise. However, given that total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content at rest was reduced &lt;1 hr after exercise, it is possible that pre-existing STIM and Orai1 complexes distinct from newly formed CEUs could also contribute to the observed increase in SOCE function.</p><p>We investigated the mechanism by which increased SOCE following acute exercise increases peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude during repetitive, high-frequency stimulation. Conceivably, increased total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and constitutive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) SOCE activity &lt;1 hr after exercise could potentiate peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude either by increasing total releasable SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content or elevating myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels enough to reduce fast buffering. Alternatively, SERCA activity could be inhibited after exercise due to glycogen depletion. Kinetic analysis of twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay before and after 10 stimulus trains in FDB fibers from control and exercised mice did not reveal a significant change in either myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering or SERCA-mediated SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). On the other hand, both total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and resting myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) were significantly increased after 10 stimulus trains in FDB fibers from mice &lt; 1 hr after exercise. Together, these findings are consistent with the observed increase in peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (and force production) after acute exercise resulting, at least in part, from enhanced SOCE activity promoting SR refilling and total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> content to a level sufficient to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux.</p><p>EDL muscles isolated from mice &lt; 1 hr after treadmill exercise exhibit an increased ability to produce sustained force during repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>). Muscle force production shows a rebound increment in peak-specific force (between stimulus trains 2–12), referred to as the <italic>bump-phase</italic> of the repetitive stimulation contraction curve. The following observations are consistent with this <italic>bump-phase</italic> reflecting the contribution of Orai1-dependent SOCE: 1) it is reduced by interventions (BTP-2, 2-APB, 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>) that reduce SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>); 2) it is increased &lt;1 hr after treadmill exercise when SOCE is also increased; 3) it is unaltered 6 and 24 hr after treadmill exercise when SOCE activity has returned to control levels; 4) it is absent in mice lacking Orai1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry both under control conditions and after acute exercise. As some mouse models have been shown to exhibit an increase in basal levels of CEUs similar to those observed immediately following exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boncompagni et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boncompagni et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ko et al., 2011</xref>), it will be important for future studies to determine if muscles from these mice also exhibit an increase in both SOCE and the bump-phase of the repetitive stimulation contraction curve.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings reported here support the idea that CEUs formed after acute exercise represent an adaptive response of skeletal muscle to exercise that augments Orai1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to optimize myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in a manner that limits muscle force decline during sustained activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male wild type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice (4–6 months old) were housed in microisolator cages at 20°C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle while being provided free access to standard chow and water.

EDL muscles were isolated, tied using 4–0 surgical suture, excised, and then attached to a servo motor and force transducer (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) between two platinum electrode plates in a chamber continuously perfused with oxygenated Ringer solution containing (in mM): 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>,10 glucose, and 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Before starting measurements, optimal stimulation level and muscle length (<italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>) were determined using a series of 1 Hz-twitch stimulation trains while stretching the muscle to a length that generated maximal force (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). After establishing <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>, muscles were first equilibrated using three tetani (500 ms, 150 Hz) given at 1 min intervals and then subjected to a standard force frequency protocol (from 1 to 250 Hz). After 3 min of rest, a single sustained high frequency tetanus (150 Hz, 2 s). After an additional 5 min of rest, muscles were then subjected to a repetitive stimulation protocol (40 consecutive, 500 ms duration, 50 Hz stimulus trains delivered every 2.5 s). All muscle contractility experiments were carried out at 30°C. Muscle force was recorded using Dynamic Muscle Control software and analyzed using a combination of both Dynamic Muscle Analysis (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and Clampfit 10.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) software. Specific force was calculated by normalizing the absolute force to the physiological cross sectional area as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boncompagni et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical significance was determined using either Student’s t-test for comparing two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and S3) and a one-way ANOVA followed by <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey test when making multiple comparisons (all other figures). Amplitude histograms of maximal rates of Mn<sup>2+</sup> quench were fit according to a single Gaussian distribution. In all cases, differences were considered as statistically significant at *p&lt;0.05.

Previous work has shown that after exercise the T tubule (TT) invaginations of the plasma membrane elongate and make close appositions to newly formed stacks of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and that the presence of the STIM1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and Orai1 calcium channels at these newly formed junctions may increase the loading of calcium into the SR to promote contractile force. Here the authors provide new evidence for this mechanism, showing that after exercise the appearance and disappearance of new SR stack-TT structures parallels the time course of augmented calcium entry through Orai, SR calcium content and release amplitude, and contractile force. The results thus support a functional link between increased muscle performance following exercise and the operation of store-operated Orai channels at newly formed SR-TT contacts. This work has important implications for understanding muscle function and morphological adaptations to exercise as well as the newly emerging roles of store-operated calcium channels in excitable cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors were asked to provide a plan for revisions before the editors issued a final decision.

This paper extends upon previous work by the authors describing the formation of SR stacks, TT extensions and increased STIM1-Orai1 colocalization (called calcium entry units, or CEUs) in the I band following exercise. The authors previously proposed that the CEUs promote resistance to fatigue during repetitive stimulation. Here the authors provide new functional evidence for this mechanism by showing that the time course of development and reversal of SR stack-TT structures parallels the timing of changes in SOCE, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release transients, and contractile force following exercise. Using knockout mice, the authors also show that Orai1 is required for these changes, presumably through interaction with STIM1 and/or STIM2.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers thought the manuscript is an important extension of your earlier work on muscle calcium entry units (CEUs) formed after exercise. The time course of changes in SR-TT contacts, SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and force production following exercise provides indirect support for the idea that CEUs are involved in exercise-dependent effects on muscle contractility. However, there was also strong agreement that more quantitative experimental data are needed to show how the observed changes in SOCE lead to altered muscle function during exercise. This could occur by several non-exclusive mechanisms, which need to be tested:</p><p>1) An increase in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content leading to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release flux might be responsible. The free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SR needs to be measured during stimulus trains to determine if it is elevated. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> release cocktail method will indicate total stored Ca<sup>2+</sup>, not free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Instead, a ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator such as D1ER should be targeted to the SR to directly measure the free luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> during stimulation.</p><p>2) SOCE may elevate cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> enough to reduce fast buffering and thereby potentiate the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. The effect on buffering could be assessed by a more detailed measurement of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> between individual transients and after stimulus trains in control and exercised mice.</p><p>3) SERCA may be inhibited after exercise due to glycogen depletion. Reduction of SERCA activity could enhance the transient amplitude, as well as contribute to the partial depletion of the SR and tonic SOCE that was observed in resting muscle after exercise. Kinetic analysis of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> twitch transients (fast and slow components) can be used to estimate changes in SERCA activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering from control and exercised mice before and after 10 stimulus trains. Importantly, such measurements may reveal a time-dependent change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling after exercise that is not directly related to the assembly and disassembly of CEUs.</p><p>4) The idea that CEUs are responsible for the constitutive SOCE after exercise is not well supported. In the Discussion section, the authors suggest that the new CEUs can account for the increased tonic SOCE after exercise. The supporting argument is that &quot;non-depletion&quot; quench after exercise (1200 cps) + TG/CPA quench before exercise (1700 cps) = TG/CPA quench rate after exercise (2800 cps). However, the quench after exercise is driven by only partial SR depletion, so TG/CPA should add more than 1200. This argument does not make quantitative sense to me. Unless it can be better substantiated, it should be deleted.</p><p>5) A related issue concerns the idea that CEUs are solely responsible for the SOCE that augments muscle function after exercise. The loss of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content peaks at the same time (&lt;1 hour) as &quot;non-depletion&quot; SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release transients and force production during trains. This complicates things. Because of tonic depletion, it is possible that pre-existing STIM and Orai complexes (activated by tonic store depletion) distinct from the new CEUs are being activated and contribute to augmented function. This possibility needs to be explicitly acknowledged, and the conclusions regarding CEU functions toned down.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transverse tubule remodeling enhances Orai1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in skeletal muscle&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, and the new data have addressed several of the issues that were raised in the original review. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) (Subsection “Total Releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> Store Content is Reduced &lt;1 Hour After Exercise, but Increased Following Repetitive, High-frequency Stimulation” and Discussion section). After exercise, the constitutive SOCE is greatly increased, but the new D1ER measurements show that resting free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SR is not altered. Because STIM1 and SOCE are controlled by free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ER/SR, and not the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, how can Orai activity be increased without a reduction of free SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>? The decrease in total SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was observed cannot explain the appearance of constitutive SOCE. This conundrum needs to be clearly stated and possible explanations provided. While uncertainty in the D1ER measurement might mask a small depletion of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, this is unlikely to be the whole explanation since the SOCE amplitude was so large (i.e., about the same as maximal SOCE from full SR depletion before exercise).</p><p>2) The new twitch analyses are convincing, but it is not clear to anyone but an expert muscle physiologist how these were used to draw conclusions about Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and SERCA activity. In Subsection “Total Releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> Store Content is Reduced &lt;1 Hour After Exercise, but Increased Following Repetitive, High-frequency Stimulation”, the statement that kinetics of twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay do not change needs to be explained; why was this experiment done, and what is the interpretation? In the Discussion section, it would help to discuss the possibilities that were brought up in review, including saturation of buffers and depletion of glycogen and effects on SERCA, and how the new results argue against these alternative explanations. An example of a transient should be shown along with the analysis in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 to illustrate the fast and slow components and how they were fitted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47576.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ plan to address the revisions.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers thought the manuscript was an important extension of your earlier work on muscle calcium entry units (CEUs) that form after exercise.

We also appreciate the question raised regarding how increased SOCE after exercise enhances peak Ca<sup>2+</sup>transients and force during repetitive stimulation. Before describing our plan to address this issue, we would like to reiterate the backstory, motivation and objectives of the current study. Our initial report describing exercise-induced formation of CEUs in muscle (Boncompagni et al., 2017) concluded that CEUs formed following exercise enhance SOCE to optimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>release for muscle force production during repetitive stimulation. However, the implication of CEUs on SOCE and Ca<sup>2+</sup>release was based on indirect evidence (ICC and immuno-gold EM studies showing that exercise increases STIM1-Orai1 localization within CEUs and force production during repetitive stimulation). Direct evidence to support a role for CEUs in promoting Orai1- dependent SOCE and Ca<sup>2+</sup>release were lacking. Thus, a primary objective of the current study was to quantify Orai1-dependent SOCE and myoplasmic calcium transients during repetitive stimulation under conditions that result in CEU formation and disassembly. EM studies (in both EDL and FDB muscles) revealed that CEUs form &lt; 1 hour after exercise and that TTs retract from the CEU earlier than SR stacks disassemble. We took advantage of this time course to assess changes in SOCE (Mn quench), calcium (mag-fluo4), and force (ex vivo EDL contractility) at different times during the assembly/disassembly of CEU component parts. Our results provide the first direct evidence that Orai1-dependent SOCE and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during repetitive stimulation are increased when TTs are associated with SR stacks. Unexpectedly, we found that acute exercise also results in substantial constitutive Orai1-dependent SOCE (with a magnitude similar to of maximal SOCE in control after full store depletion). These findings provide critical needed evidence to support the assertion that acute exercise promotes formation of CEUs to augment Orai1-dependent SOCE in order to optimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and muscle contractility during repetitive stimulation.</p><p>We agree with the Editor and reviewers that the next important question to address is to explain how increased SOCE after exercise optimizes the myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>transient during repetitive stimulation. Since we did not have direct evidence for a specific mechanism, we refrained from speculating on this in the Discussion section of the manuscript. If provided an opportunity to submit a revised version of the manuscript, we would be happy to consider these potential mechanisms and their implications in the Discussion section. We have also initiated new experiments (outlined below) in hopes of being able to provide at least some evidence to support/exclude these possibilities. If successful, we are prepared to include the results on these studies in a revised version of the manuscript. However, given the importance and extent of the results/contributions of the study outlined above (none of which were questioned in the Editor’s summary of reviewer comments), we would hope that publication of our study will not be inexorably linked to our providing compelling evidence for an answer to this question.</p><p>We plan to revise the Discussion section of the manuscript to provide a comprehensive description of potential reasons for how increased SOCE function after acute exercise could result in enhanced peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during repetitive stimulation. Our discussion would include each of the three points below raised by the Editor and reviewers. Provided sufficient time, we also compete the series of experiments below designed to provide supportive evidence for one or more of these explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, several non-exclusive mechanisms could contribute:</p><p>1) An increase in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content leading to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release flux might be responsible but is inconsistent with the 25% reduction in content that was reported.

In addition, the increase in peak Ca<sup>2+</sup>transient amplitude in fibers from exercised mice developed during the time course of each 500 ms stimulus (i.e. the peak was similar at the beginning of the train but larger by the end of the train – see blue trace in Figure 5A, middle). Thus, the evolution of the increase in evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is dynamic, making resting steady state store content measurements irrelevant Ca<sup>2+</sup> regard to SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> available for release at the end of the 10th stimulus train. Thus, one possibility is that in fibers from exercised mice, increased SOCE during each stimulus train enhances store Ca<sup>2+</sup>such that Ca<sup>2+</sup>load is increased to a level sufficient to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup>flux during the 10<sup>th</sup> and subsequent trains. We are planning experiments where we will measure either total C Ca<sup>2+</sup> a store content (using ionomycin/CPA/EGTA or ICE as before) or just RYR1-releasable store content (using 4-chloro-m-cresol) after delivery of 10 stimulus trains. Since the longitudinal SR (with SERCA) and CEU junctions (with STIM1-Orai1) lie outside the triad and lack RYR1 release channels, we expect that the ICE assay will provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of SOCE on total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content. However, it will be interesting to see if the RYR1-releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool following 10 tetani is increased in fibers from exercised mice. Given the extent of SR and amount of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>binding proteins in skeletal muscle, the peak ICE response in experiments is dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>within the SR compartment. Consistent with this, we previously used the Ca<sup>2+</sup>dependent UV absorbance spectra of BAPTA to show that the vast majority (~80%) of total Ca<sup>2+</sup>in EDL muscle resides within the SR (Lambolay, et al., J Gen Physiol, 2015; commented on by Manno and Rios, J Gen Physiol, 2015). In addition, the peak ICE response in fura-2ff-loaded FDB fibers is markedly reduced (~90%) in fibers from CASQ1 KO mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> below). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>within mitochondria and other compartments contributes &lt;10% of the ICE response in these experiments. Nevertheless, we plan to repeat the store content experiments in FDB fibers expressing a low-affinity, SR targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup>probe (D1ER, Reggiani et al., 2010; RCepia1-ER, Suzuki et al., 2014) introduced via electroporation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of calsequestrin type 1 knockout (CASQ1-null) on total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content.</title><p>A) Representative fura-FF ratio traces of total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content elicited during application of ICE in FDB fibers from wild-type (WT) and CASQ1-null mice.

Consistent with our observation of significant constitutive SOCE after exercise, resting Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels were increased in FDB fibers from exercised mice (Figure 5E). Thus, the increased SOCE during repetitive stimulation could further elevate myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels enough to reduce fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering (e.g. parvalbumin) during subsequent stimuli. In fact, this could in part explain the time-dependent increase observed in the peak of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>transient during a given stimulus train in fibers from exercised mice (see blue trace in Figure 5A, middle). To further test this idea, we plan to quantify resting Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels in fibers from control and exercised mice immediately after 10 consecutive high-frequency stimulus trains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, SERCA may be inhibited after exercise due to glycogen depletion. Reduction of SERCA activity could enhance the transient amplitude, as well as contribute to the partial depletion of the SR and tonic SOCE that was observed. SERCA activity should be measured from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay rates at different times following exercise. Importantly, such measurements may reveal a time-dependent change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling after exercise that is not directly related to the assembly and disassembly of CEUs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion that we had not considered previously. To obtain an estimate of SERCA activity in intact fibers from control and exercised mice before and after repetitive stimulation, we will fit the decay phase of electrically-evoked twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup>transients measured using the low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>dye, mag-fluo-4. The decay of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>transient is well-described by a double exponential fit in which the fast component primarily reflects binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>to fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>buffers (e.g. dye, parvalbumin, troponin C; Carroll et al., 1997; Baylor and Hollingsworth, 2003; Capote et al., 2005) while the slow component reflects SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake. The relative contribution of the slow (A<sub>slow</sub>) and fast (A<sub>fast</sub>) amplitudes will be calculated by dividing the absolute value of each component by the sum of the two components (A<sub>slow</sub>/A<sub>total</sub> and A<sub>fast</sub>/A<sub>total</sub>). This kinetic analysis will be completed on twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup>transients measured in FDB fibers from control and exercised mice both immediately before or after delivery of 10 consecutive high frequency stimulation trains. Comparison of the fast and slow amplitudes (absolute and relative) and the time constants of the two kinetic components will provide an index of the effects of exercise and repetitive stimulation on fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>buffering and SERCA activity.</p><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers thought the manuscript is an important extension of your earlier work on muscle calcium entry units (CEUs) formed after exercise. The time course of changes in SR-TT contacts, SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and force production following exercise provides indirect support for the idea that CEUs are involved in exercise-dependent effects on muscle contractility. However, there was also strong agreement that more quantitative experimental data are needed to show how the observed changes in SOCE lead to altered muscle function during exercise. This could occur by several non-exclusive mechanisms, which need to be tested:</p><p>1) An increase in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content leading to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release flux might be responsible. The free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SR needs to be measured during stimulus trains to determine if it is elevated. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> release cocktail method will indicate total stored Ca<sup>2+</sup>, not free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Instead, a ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator such as D1ER should be targeted to the SR to directly measure the free luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> during stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, our measurements of a ~25% reduction in total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content after acute exercise were conducted on resting non-stimulated fibers, whereas the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during repetitive high frequency stimulation was only observed after the seventh stimulation train. In addition, the increase in peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude in fibers from mice &lt;1 hour after exercise developed progressively over time during the stimulation trains (i.e. peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude did not increase significantly until the seventh stimulus train – see original Figure 5B). Thus, the evolution of the increase in evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is dynamic during repetitive stimulation, making resting steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content measurements irrelevant with regard to SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> available for release during repetitive stimulation.</p><p>Thus, one possibility is that in fibers from mice &lt;1 hour after exercise, increased SOCE during each stimulus train progressively enhances total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content such that the total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> load is increased to a level sufficient to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux during the seventh and subsequent stimulus trains. To test this idea, we conducted new experiments in fura-FF-loaded fibers to assess total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content (using ionomycin/CPA/EGTA or ICE as before) after delivery of 10 stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 seconds). Results from these experiments are quite informative as both myoplasmic resting and total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content were increased significantly after 10 stimulus trains in fibers from acutely exercised mice compared to that observed for fibers from both sedentary mice and &lt;1 hour after exercise in the absence of stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude following the seventh stimulation train, resulting at least in part from increased SOCE activity in fibers from mice &lt;1 hour after exercise enhancing total SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content such that releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> load is increased to a level sufficient to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. These new data are included in revised Figure 5D and E (original Figure 5D and E panels are now presented as Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of repetitive, high-frequency stimulation on total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content and resting myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrationin FDB fibers from control and &lt;1 hour after exercise mice.</title><p>A) Quantitative analysis of total Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content elicited during application of ICE (10 µM ionomycin, 30 µM CPA, and 100 µM EGTA) in fura-FF-loaded FDB fibers in the absence (solid bars) and following (shaded bars) delivery of 10 stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 seconds).

Consistent with this, we previously used the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent UV absorbance spectra of BAPTA to show that the vast majority (~80%) of total Ca<sup>2+</sup> in EDL muscle resides within the SR (Lambolay et al., 2015; commented on by Manno and Rios, 2015). Importantly, the peak ICE response in fura-FF-loaded fibers is markedly reduced (~90%) in FDB fibers from calsequestrin-1 knockout (CASQ1-null) mice, as expected since CASQ1 is the primary SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein in muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> within mitochondria and other compartments contributes &lt;10% of the ICE response in these experiments.</p><p>Nevertheless, we conducted experiments using a SR-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup>probe (D1ER). However, it is important to point out upfront that the D1ER probe reports the “free Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentration” within the SR/ER lumen, not the total releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup>content as assessed in our fura-FF studies. For these experiments, the D1ER probe was expressed in FDB fibers via electroporation (Rudolf et al., 2006; Canato et al., 2010). As reported previously, the D1ER probe localizes nicely to both triad junctions and longitudinal extensions of the SR, which are plentiful within the I band of the sarcomere (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Using identical excitation and emission gains, the D1ER YFP/CFP ratio was not significantly different in fibers from control mice and mice &lt;1 hour after exercise both under resting conditions with a full SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> store and after depletion of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> with ICE (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and C). Thus, the spatially-averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within the SR lumen is not significantly altered by acute exercise (though areas of local depletion are possible). These findings are consistent with the strong buffering power in the SR in skeletal muscle and prior observations (e.g. Sztretye et al., 2011; Manno et al., 2013) that the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the SR lumen (~500 μM) remains largely unaltered in face of marked changes in total SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. These results are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) SOCE may elevate cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> enough to reduce fast buffering and thereby potentiate the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.

Importantly, we now show (see panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) that this increase in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> in FDB fibers after acute exercise (where SOCE activity is increased) was even greater immediately after delivery of 10 stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 seconds). Thus, the elevation in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> after acute exercise could conceivably reduce fast buffering enough to potentiate the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. However, detailed quantitative analysis of twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay kinetics before and after 10 stimulus trains does not support a significant change in either fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering or SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake (see Figure 5—figure supplement 3).

We completed the suggested experiments to quantify the kinetics of electrically-evoked twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay using a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye (mag-fluo-4) before and after delivery of 10 consecutive stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 seconds) in FDB fibers from both sedentary mice and mice &lt;1 hour after exercise. Using this approach, the decay phase of the electrically-evoked mag-fluo-4 twitch transient is well-described by a double exponential fit in which the fast component primarily reflects Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers while the slow component is dominated by SERCA-mediated SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake (Carroll et al., 1997; Baylor and Hollingsworth, 2003; Capote et al., 2005). For these experiments, we first recorded 10 electrically-evoked twitch transients (0.5 Hz) in FDB fibers from either sedentary mice or mice &lt;1 hour after exercise before delivery of 10 stimulus trains (500 ms, 50 Hz, every 2.5 seconds). After the 10 stimulus trains, a second set of 10 electrically-evoked twitch transients (0.5 Hz) were recorded. Despite a significant increase in the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude during the 10<sup>th</sup> stimulus train (1.51 ± 0.07) compared to the first stimulus train (1.32 ± 0.09) only in fibers from mice &lt;1 hour after exercise, no significant changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay kinetics were observed compared to that obtained for fibers isolated from sedentary mice. These results are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The idea that CEUs are responsible for the constitutive SOCE after exercise is not well supported. In the Discussion section, the authors suggest that the new CEUs can account for the increased tonic SOCE after exercise. The supporting argument is that &quot;non-depletion&quot; quench after exercise (1200 cps) + TG/CPA quench before exercise (1700 cps) = TG/CPA quench rate after exercise (2800 cps). However, the quench after exercise is driven by only partial SR depletion, so TG/CPA should add more than 1200. This argument does not make quantitative sense to me. Unless it can be better substantiated, it should be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we removed this speculation from the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A related issue concerns the idea that CEUs are solely responsible for the SOCE that augments muscle function after exercise. The loss of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content peaks at the same time (&lt;1 hour) as &quot;non-depletion&quot; SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release transients and force production during trains. This complicates things. Because of tonic depletion, it is possible that pre-existing STIM and Orai complexes (activated by tonic store depletion) distinct from the new CEUs are being activated and contribute to augmented function. This possibility needs to be explicitly acknowledged, and the conclusions regarding CEU functions toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this possibility, which is now explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved, and the new data have addressed several of the issues that were raised in the original review. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) (Subsection “Total Releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> Store Content is Reduced &lt;1 Hour After Exercise, but Increased Following Repetitive, High-frequency Stimulation” and Discussion section). After exercise, the constitutive SOCE is greatly increased, but the new D1ER measurements show that resting free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SR is not altered. Because STIM1 and SOCE are controlled by free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ER/SR, and not the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, how can Orai activity be increased without a reduction of free SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>? The decrease in total SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was observed cannot explain the appearance of constitutive SOCE. This conundrum needs to be clearly stated and possible explanations provided. While uncertainty in the D1ER measurement might mask a small depletion of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, this is unlikely to be the whole explanation since the SOCE amplitude was so large (i.e., about the same as maximal SOCE from full SR depletion before exercise).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point.</p><p>The D1ER measurements indeed show that the “spatially-averaged” free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the SR measured with this probe is not significantly altered after exercise (though areas of local depletion are possible). It is important to note, however, that our D1ER localization results indicate that the majority of the D1ER signal is in the triad junction (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Thus, the D1ER data primarily reflect the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within the triad junction, which is not different after exercise. These results suggest that the constitutive SOCE observed after exercise does not originate from Orai1 channels in the triad junction. Rather, the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry more likely arises from Orai1 channels localized in the elongated TT within the I band region of the sarcomere that couples with SR-stack membranes forming CEUs, that are not well-reflected in the spatially-averaged D1ER signal. These observations support the idea that CEUs represent the site of constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry after exercise. An alternative explanation is that exercise could produce a signal that directly activates Orai1 independent of store depletion (even within the triad).</p><p>While admittedly too superficial, we attempted to address this issue in the following sentence from the Discussion section of the prior version of the revised manuscript:</p><p>&quot;Thus, the constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry could be due to either a fraction of the SR store being partially depleted (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) or generation of a direct activator of Orai1 channels after exercise.&quot;</p><p>By “fraction of the SR being partially depleted” we were indirectly referring to CEUs formed after exercise. We also left open the possibility that exercise could produce a direct activator of Orai1 that does not require a reduction in the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. However, we appreciate the reviewers point and realize that our attempt at brevity missed several important salient points (discussed above). Therefore, we further revised this part of the Discussion section to more explicitly consider these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The new twitch analyses are convincing, but it is not clear to anyone but an expert muscle physiologist how these were used to draw conclusions about Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and SERCA activity. In Subsection “Total Releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> Store Content is Reduced &lt;1 Hour After Exercise, but Increased Following Repetitive, High-frequency Stimulation”, the statement that kinetics of twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay do not change needs to be explained; why was this experiment done, and what is the interpretation? In the Discussion section, it would help to discuss the possibilities that were brought up in review, including saturation of buffers and depletion of glycogen and effects on SERCA, and how the new results argue against these alternative explanations. An example of a transient should be shown along with the analysis in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 to illustrate the fast and slow components and how they were fitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing a clear rationale in the Results section for why the twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay kinetics were analyzed (the rationale was presented in the Methods section). We revised the manuscript to include this rationale in the Results section, just before these data are presented (subsection “Total Releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> Store Content is Reduced”). As suggested, we also now include example twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces with superimposed two-exponential fits in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. We now also discuss potential effects of saturation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, depletion of glycogen and SERCA activity in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
