Complex genome modifications such as knockin (KI) might bypass compensation, though difficult to practice due to low efficiency. Moreover, no ‘two-in-one’ KI strategy combining conditional knockout (CKO) with fluorescent gene-labeling or further allele-labeling has been reported. Here, we developed a dual-cassette-donor strategy and achieved one-step and efficient generation of dual-function KI alleles at <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>kctd10</italic> loci in zebrafish <italic>via</italic> targeted insertion. These alleles display fluorescent gene-tagging and CKO effects before and after Cre induction, respectively. By introducing a second fluorescent reporter, geno-tagging effects were achieved at <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> loci, exhibiting CKO coupled with fluorescent reporter switch upon Cre induction, enabling tracing of three distinct genotypes. We found that LiCl purification of gRNA is critical for highly efficient KI, and preselection of founders allows the efficient germline recovery of KI events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/cas</kwd><kwd>NHEJ</kwd><kwd>targeted insertion</kwd><kwd>knockin</kwd><kwd>conditional knock out</kwd><kwd>gene-labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0801000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0100500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB942803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81371264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007937</institution-id><institution>Peking University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Qidong-SLS Innovation Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditional gene knockout in combination with fluorescent labeling of different alleles can be achieved with high efficiency in zebrafish through NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion using a CRISPR/Cas system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Targeted genome modifications <italic>via</italic> customizable endonucleases such as TALENs or the CRISPR/Cas system have revolutionized the technology of genome editing, through which gene knockouts can be easily generated through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-induced indel mutations in many species, including zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2011</xref>;

However, indel mutations have been reported to be able to evoke transcriptional adaptation-derived genetic compensation, triggered by mutations bearing a premature termination codon (PTC), leading to complications and confusion in the study of gene functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, advanced genome engineering, including conditional knockout (CKO) and gene tagging approaches, which rely on targeted knockin (KI) to introduce exogenous DNA sequences (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>loxP</italic> or fluorescent reporter genes) into a target site, might bypass the interference of the unwanted genetic compensation by adopting properly designed strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). However, these strategies are difficult in practice due to their low efficiency and the need for extensive screening, especially when dealing with multicellular organisms without developed embryonic stem (ES) cell technology. In addition, a ‘two-in-one’ dual-function KI strategy for achieving CKO coupled with gene tagging has rarely been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the target gene is usually labeled by a single fluorescent reporter, and the concept and method for discriminating different alleles (normal <italic>vs</italic> defective) of the same target gene have not been established.</p><p>In zebrafish, KI is generally mediated by either homologous recombination (HR) or the NHEJ pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), and NHEJ-based targeted insertion is more efficient, though less precise, than the HR-based strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hagmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2010</xref>). However, current NHEJ-based KI methods are feasible for gene labeling but cannot be used to generate CKO alleles through a one-step single insertion since two <italic>loxP</italic> sequences have to be inserted at two separate locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burg et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, conditional gene inactivation or in combination with gene tagging can be achieved via various designs of gene-trap cassettes in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sivasubbu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trinh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grajevskaja et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, CKO and gene labeling are usually achieved through separate experiments, since they typically use different designs of donor DNA, and dual-function CKO alleles coupled with fluorescent gene labeling generated through targeted insertion have not been described. The combination of CKO and gene/cell labeling within the same allele or even CKO together with genotype/allele labeling, allowing researchers to easily distinguish defective alleles from normal ones by using different fluorescent reporters, could be particularly useful for mosaic analysis and cell fate tracing, especially for zebrafish research due to the superiority of the live imaging of embryogenesis in this animal model.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a highly efficient method for achieving one-step heritable generation of dual-function alleles in zebrafish through targeted insertion induced by the Cas9/gRNA system, based on the special design of a dual-cassette-donor. The feasibility of this strategy was first demonstrated at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>kctd10</italic> loci, resulting in a germline transmission efficiency as high as 56% after the preselection of F<sub>0</sub> embryos showing correct expression of a fluorescent reporter. Under normal conditions, these KI alleles enable simultaneous expression of a fluorescent reporter together with the target gene, displaying a gene-labeling effect. After the injection of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA, the expression and function of the target gene as well as the reporter gene were disrupted, and conditional knockout was successfully achieved. We further improved our strategy by introducing a second fluorescent reporter into the dual-cassette donor, which could be used to conditionally generate and distinguish different alleles (normal <italic>vs</italic> defective) by using different fluorescent reporters and, further, to distinguish different cells with different genotypes (homozygous normal, heterozygote, and homozygous mutant/defective), allowing real-time mosaic analysis within the same tissue. This allele-tagging or geno-tagging strategy was demonstrated at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rationale of our dual-cassette-donor strategy for the one-step generation of ‘two-in-one’ dual-function KI alleles through targeted insertion</title><p>To generate a dual-function allele through a single step of NHEJ-mediated KI, we developed a novel strategy based on the special design of a dual-cassette donor, in which CKO and gene labeling can be established simultaneously through one-step targeted insertion of the donor vector into an intron of the target gene <italic>via</italic> the NHEJ pathway activated by the CRISPR/Cas system. For this purpose, the initial donor was designed to contain two functional cassettes, a positive one and a negative one and is therefore called a PoNe (positive-negative) donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The positive cassette (Po-cassette) was designed to be able to maintain the correct expression/splicing and function of the target gene after the integration of the PoNe donor into the target site, and additionally to track target gene expression through the incorporation of a 2A-linked fluorescent reporter gene. For this purpose, the first part of the Po-cassette was designed to retain the integrity of the cDNA of the target gene by cloning the sequence of the intron, including the splice acceptor site, downstream of the target site as well as all the rest of the downstream coding sequence of the wild-type target gene into the donor. For gene labeling and the visualization of target gene expression, the second part of the Po-cassette was composed of a fluorescent reporter fused in-frame upstream of the stop codon of the target gene cDNA in the donor, separated by a 2A peptide coding sequence. The whole sequence described above was flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites, so that it can be removed to generate conditional mutations in response to Cre recombinase. The negative cassette (Ne-cassette) was designed to ensure complete disruption of target gene expression and function after removal of the Po-cassette by Cre-induced recombination. This is achieved by two levels of interruption of gene expression, leading to the early termination of either transcription or translation. For this purpose, the initial Ne-cassette consisted of two transcription termination signals (TTSs), the SV40 polyA (<italic>PA</italic>) sequence followed by BGH <italic>PA</italic>, which were followed by the sequence of the same splice acceptor site as in the Po-cassette and the exon immediately after the target intron, but engineered to contain a nonsense mutation (<italic>mutExon</italic>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48081.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of CKO coupled with gene labeling dual-function alleles through targeted insertion in zebrafish at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the KI strategy based on the dual-cassette PoNe donor <italic>tbx5a-T2A-tdTomato floxP 2PA-mutExon</italic> (the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne donor), consisting of a Po-cassette and a Ne-cassette (highlighted by pink and yellow shadows, respectively).

Under normal conditions, that is in the absence of Cre recombinase, this locus serves a gene-tagging function, and the expression and function of the target gene remain normal; a wild-type protein and a fluorescent reporter protein will be produced concurrently, with the fluorescent reporter recapitulating the expression pattern of the endogenous target gene. After Cre/<italic>loxP</italic>-mediated removal of the Po-cassette, the two polyA signals (<italic>2PA</italic>) in the Ne-cassette could prematurely stop the transcription of the target gene, resulting in a short transcript encoding a truncated and nonfunctional protein, thus achieving CKO. If there is leaky transcription after the polyA signals, the <italic>mutExon</italic> sequence in the Ne-cassette will be transcribed and spliced into the mature mRNA, again resulting in the disruption of the function of the target gene, due to the existence of the premature stop codon in this exon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Efficient generation of a dual-function KI allele at the zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus</title><p>The feasibility of this dual-cassette-donor strategy was first evaluated at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrity et al., 2002</xref>) in zebrafish.

Surprisingly, we found that the purification methods applied to the gRNAs after in vitro transcription, especially the gRNA targeting the donor plasmid (the <italic>hEMX1</italic> target site), dramatically affected KI efficiency in our experimental settings. In our initial attempts, we employed ethanol precipitation to purify both gRNAs used for injection and found no <italic>tdTomato</italic> expression in any injected embryos. In contrast, when injected with LiCl-purified gRNAs, more than 10% of the embryos showed the expected red fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

However, no fluorescent signal could be detected with the other combination, that is the donor gRNA purified by ethanol precipitation and the <italic>tbx5a</italic>-targeting gRNA purified by LiCl precipitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These observations indicate that the gRNA targeting the donor plasmids is more sensitive to the purification method, and suggest that the purity or configuration of this gRNA may influence the efficiency of donor linearization in the zebrafish embryos, while the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be investigated in the future. Nevertheless, in the following experiments, we adopted all LiCl-purified gRNAs for injection.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48081.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>KI efficiency using different gRNA purification methods</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><italic>hEMX1</italic> gRNA purification</th><th><italic>tbx5a I2</italic> gRNA purification</th><th>Ratio of fluorescence- <break/>positive F<sub>0</sub> embryos</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">LiCl</td><td valign="top">LiCl</td><td valign="top">18/119 (15.1%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">LiCl</td><td valign="top">Ethanol</td><td valign="top">8/103 (7.8%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ethanol</td><td valign="top">LiCl</td><td valign="top">0/94 (0.0%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ethanol</td><td valign="top">Ethanol</td><td valign="top">0/43 (0.0%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Germline transmission and evaluation of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> KI allele</title><p>After the injection of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne donor together with the Cas9/gRNA system into approximately 100 one-cell stage embryos, red fluorescent signals could be detected in 18 of the embryos.

As expected, the results showed no significant difference in the expression of the <italic>kctd10</italic> locus between the wild-type and <italic>kctd10<sup>+/PoG-Ne-1</sup></italic> heterozygous embryos, while its expression was significantly reduced by approximately 50% in the <italic>kctd10<sup>+/PoG-Ne-1</sup></italic> embryos after <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA injection due to the efficient conversion of the <italic>kctd10<sup>PoG-Ne-1</sup></italic> alleles into the <italic>kctd10<sup>Ne-1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2L</xref>).

Using such donors, we were able to isolate stable integrations at the <italic>kctd10</italic> locus and observed the correct expression pattern of <italic>tdGFP</italic>. However, after <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA injection, all the injected embryos resulting from the incrosses of such heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> fish developed normally, although the green fluorescent signal was no longer detectable in most of the embryos, indicating the successful and efficient removal of the Po-cassette. These results suggest that the single SV40 <italic>PA</italic> signal might not be strong enough to efficiently stop target gene transcription; thus, either multiple copies of the transcription termination sequences are necessary, or the modified exon (<italic>mutExon</italic>) following the <italic>PA</italic> sequence might be indispensable for efficiently disrupting target gene expression in our strategy (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Improving the dual-cassette donor strategy to achieve a geno-tagging effect</title><p>The above results demonstrated the unique advantages of our dual-cassette donor strategy for efficiently generating dual-function alleles and achieving CKO coupled with gene labeling in zebrafish <italic>via</italic> one-step targeted insertion. To further improve our strategy and achieve more complex applications of genome editing, we developed a novel technique by designing a conditional dual-fluorescence reporter donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), an advanced version of our original PoNe donor, in which Cre-mediated excision of the Po-cassette could simultaneously trigger conditional knockout and the fluorescent reporter switch, resulting in allele tagging instead of gene tagging, so that different alleles (<italic>i.e</italic>., normal/positive alleles <italic>vs</italic> defective/negative alleles) can be labeled with different fluorescent proteins. This goal was achieved by adding a different fluorescent reporter in the original Ne-cassette following the sequence containing the intron (including the splice acceptor site) plus a partial exon immediately downstream of the intron target site, and linked by a 2A peptide, as in the Po-cassette. After the removal of the Po-cassette containing the first fluorescent reporter by the Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> system, the second fluorescent reporter in the Ne-cassette will be transcribed together with the preceding intron and exon sequences and spliced into the incomplete mRNA of the target gene, thus achieving both target gene mutation (due to the incomplete coding sequence) and labeling of the mutated allele, simultaneously leading to the destruction of the target gene’s function and the allele-tagging switch. Under this strategy, the functionally normal and defective alleles can be easily distinguished by using two different fluorescent reporters. Note that the wild-type exon sequence was used in the Ne-cassette in this case since we would like to maintain normal transcription and translation of the fusion mRNA, which contains the incomplete target gene cDNA followed by a 2A-linked complete sequence encoding the fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast to the previous strategy, which was based on a single fluorescent reporter, we designated this advanced strategy geno-tagging, since it can label different alleles with different fluorescent reporters, and the genotype of each cell is easily distinguishable by its fluorescent signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48081.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Generation of geno-tagging alleles by improving the dual-cassette donor strategy at the zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the KI strategy for geno-tagging based on the <italic>tbx5a-T2A-tdT-2PA floxP tdG-2PA</italic> donor (or abbreviated as <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG donor).

This vector was referred to as the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG donor. In the generation of the previous <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-Ne</sup></italic> KI allele, we showed that the preselection of F<sub>0</sub> embryos according to the fluorescent signal largely ensured the successful identification of the germline transmission of the KI events. However, preselection of F<sub>0</sub> embryos according to fluorescent signals is only feasible for certain genes and could be difficult to apply for many other genes, such as those showing late, low or little embryonic expression. To solve this problem, we aimed to establish a more universal method for the enrichment of the germline transmission of KI events. Therefore, during the generation of geno-tagging alleles at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus, we evaluated the potential correlation of KI events in germline transmission with the KI efficiency in F<sub>0</sub> adult somatic tissues such as caudal fins. After the injection of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> geno-tagging donor (PoR-NeG donor) together with the <italic>zCas9</italic> mRNA and corresponding gRNAs, red fluorescent signals could be detected in 16 of 124 normally developed F<sub>0</sub> embryos. The ratio of embryos showing red fluorescent signals was comparable with that in the previous <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne donor KI experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, we did not select the embryos according to their fluorescent signals and raised all the F<sub>0</sub> embryos together to adulthood in this case. Then, junction PCR analysis was performed using genomic DNA isolated from caudal fin clips from 48 F<sub>0</sub> adult fish, and the expected 5’ junction and/or 3’ junction amplicons were detected in six F<sub>0</sub> adults (#1, #2, #9, #11, #24 and #42), indicating the successful integration of the donor in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). F<sub>1</sub> progeny were obtained from the outcrossing of five such F<sub>0</sub> individually with wild-type zebrafish (F<sub>0</sub> #24 failed to produce offspring), and germline transmission of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG donor geno-tagging alleles was detected and confirmed in two F<sub>0</sub> individuals (#2 and #42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In contrast, no germline transmission events were detected in the F<sub>1</sub> progeny from 20 F<sub>0</sub> fish from the junction PCR-negative group. These results indicate a strong correlation between the germline transmission of KI events and adult somatic tissue integration of the donor, and provide an alternative efficient method for the enrichment of germline transmission events.</p><p>We chose positive founder #42 for the following experiments and designated the corresponding geno-tagging allele <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic>.

Note that the 3’ junction does not change after <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To evaluate the geno-tagging effect, we crossed a <italic>tbx5a<sup>+/PoR-NeG</sup></italic> heterozygote with a previously identified <italic>tbx5a<sup>+/PoR-Ne</sup></italic> heterozygote and divided the embryos into three groups: Group I was injected with 100 pg of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA at the one-cell stage, Group II was injected with 25 pg of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA in a single cell at the 2–8 cell stage, and Group III remained untreated as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). No tdTomato signal could be detected in any of the Group I embryos, indicating efficient switching of the fluorescent reporters in all the geno-tagging alleles. Among these embryos, 27.4% (29/106) showed the typical <italic>tbx5a</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and all of these defective embryos were positive for the green fluorescent signal, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Among the Group II embryos, 11.6% (8/69) also showed obvious developmental defects in the heart and fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and not surprisingly, all of these defective embryos showed dominant or exclusive green fluorescent signals compared with the red fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, all the embryos from Group III appeared normal during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and only <italic>tdTomato</italic> expression was observed, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>To verify that tissue and temporal control of Cre-induced recombination events can be achieved for this geno-tagging allele, we generated a transgenic line, <italic>Tg(cmlc2:zCreER<sup>T2</sup>-2A-ECFP</italic>), showing heart-specific expression of both <italic>ECFP</italic> and 4-hydroxyltamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible zebrafish codon-optimized <italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>.

We began <italic>sox10</italic> geno-tagging experiments before the work on <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>kctd10</italic> was completed. Because of concern that the double SV40/BGH polyA signals may be insufficient to achieve complete transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), we constructed a vector with eight tandem repeats of SV40 pA (<italic>8xPA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, since the <italic>hEMX1</italic> gRNA targeting the previous donors needs to be purified by LiCl precipitation for efficient KI, we used another highly efficient gRNA target site known as <italic>lamGolden</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zu et al., 2016</xref>) for the linearization of the <italic>sox10</italic> geno-tagging donor. However, similar to the case of <italic>hEMX1</italic>, the gRNA targeting the <italic>lamGolden</italic> site also needed to be purified with LiCl for successful knockin; otherwise, knockin events were scarcely detectable in F<sub>0</sub> embryos (data not shown). We first coinjected the <italic>sox10</italic> geno-tagging donor with the <italic>zCas9</italic> system into one-cell-stage zebrafish embryos, after which approximately half of the embryos were injected again with 25 pg of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA in a single cell at the 4 cell stage.

In some cells, colocalization of the tdGFP and tdTomato signals could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that these cells were most likely to be <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG/NeG</sup></italic> heterozygous.

NHEJ-mediated knockin and Cre-induced recombination events were further confirmed by junction PCR and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The 103 founder embryos showing red fluorescent signals were raised to adulthood, and germline screening was conducted outcrossed with wild-type zebrafish.

To test the functionality of the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> allele, the F<sub>2</sub> progeny from an incross of the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes were injected with 100 pg <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA per embryo at the one-cell stage. An efficient switch of the fluorescent signals from red (tdTomato) to green (tdGFP) was observed in all the injected fluorescent embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating successful high-effciency deletion of the positive cassettes of the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> alleles in response to Cre recombinase. Furthermore, 24.6% (56/228) of the injected embryos exhibited extensive loss of pigmentation at 48 hpf, recapitulating the phenotype reported previously for the <italic>sox10</italic> mutant <italic>colourless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutton et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutton et al., 2001b</xref>), and all these defective embryos exclusively showed green fluorescent signals, indicating that they were most likely homozygous for the <italic>sox10<sup>NeG</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Genotyping results confirmed that all the abnormal embryos were <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG/PoR-NeG</sup></italic> homozygotes before <italic>Cre</italic> injection and that all the normal embryos contained at least one wild-type <italic>sox10</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). qRT-PCR experiments were performed to further evaluate the expression of the <italic>sox10</italic> geno-tagging allele.

Three levels of complex genome modifications could be achieved in zebrafish by using this method: (i) one-step generation of conditional knockout alleles through targeted insertion; (ii) simultaneous fluorescent labeling of CKO alleles to achieve a gene tagging effect as well as labeling of the cells expressing the target gene, through the incorporation of an in-frame fluorescent reporter gene (<italic>tdTomato</italic> or <italic>tdGFP</italic>) in the positive-cassette of the donor (the feasibility of this dual-function ‘two-in-one’ KI allele strategy was demonstrated at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>kctd10</italic> loci); (iii) differential labeling of two different alleles (normal <italic>vs</italic> defective) to achieve a geno-tagging effect via the differential labeling of the two cassettes (Po- <italic>vs</italic> Ne-cassette) in the donor with two different fluorescent reporters. This advanced strategy enables the conditional switching of the fluorescent reporters and, thus, the discrimination of cells with three different genotypes (homozygous normal, heterozygote, and homozygous mutant/defective). We successfully generated such conditional coupled geno-tagging alleles at the <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> loci in zebrafish and demonstrated the fluorescent reporter switch in response to Cre recombinase treatment. As the activity of Cre recombinase can easily be manipulated (<italic>e.g</italic>., by using inducible CreER<sup>T2</sup>), genetic mosaicism of target tissues could be generated through conditional knockout. However, previously reported KI techniques usually cannot distinguish cells or tissues with different genotypes, which limits the in-depth study of gene functions. With simple modifications of our dual-cassette donor system, we have established a novel geno-tagging technique that allows conditional knockout and geno-tagging switching to occur simultaneously in the same allele. Fluorescence label switching, together with conditional gene knockout, not only allows the real-time labeling and discrimination of knockout cells or tissues from normal ones to trace and compare their fates in vivo but can even go further, potentially labeling different alleles with different fluorescent reporters. In this manner, one can easily determine and follow the genotype of each allele and each cell.</p><p>In addition, there is another potential advantage of the geno-tagging strategy due to the special design of the Ne-cassette in the donor. While the original single-fluorescent-reporter version of the dual-cassette donor might trigger genetic compensation since it contains a <italic>mutExon</italic> bearing a premature stop codon in its Ne-cassette, the mutant alleles produced through the geno-tagging KI strategy, which does not contain a premature stop codon to disrupt the target gene, are likely exempted from the disturbance caused by the genetic compensation response, thus simplifying as well as consolidating subsequent phenotype analyses. Therefore, we recommend the use of the geno-tagging donor for the generation of CKO alleles coupled with gene or allele labeling effects. Regarding polyA signals, in principle, more polyA signals seem to be more effective for efficient termination of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). Although <italic>2PA</italic> was satisfactory for the generation of the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> geno-tagging allele in the present study, we adopted eight tandem repeats of SV40 polyA signals (<italic>8xPA</italic>) for stronger transcriptional termination for the <italic>sox10</italic> locus. However, there are potential disadvantages of employing two <italic>8xPA</italic> sequences, each containing eight tandem repeats of the ~160 bp polyA signal sequence, concerning stability. The repeats within each <italic>8xPA</italic> sequence might be reduced during expansion and/or passaging to the next generations of the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> allele; on the other hand, the sequence flanked by the two <italic>8xPA</italic> sequences (containing the downstream <italic>loxP</italic> and Ne-cassette) might be lost due to occasional recombination of the two <italic>8xPA</italic> sequences, leading to the abolition of the CKO and fluorescence-switch effects. Practically, since different target genes may have very different expression patterns and regulation properties, for each particular target gene, we recommend beginning with the construction of the donor with <italic>2PA</italic>, then testing its effect in founder embryos to determine whether this is sufficient to stop the expression of the second fluorescent reporter, and introducing more polyA signals when necessary.</p><p>Germline transmission is crucial for the successful establishment of stable KI transgenic fish lines. Interestingly, our results indicate a strong correlation between the efficient germline transmission and correct insertion of KI donors in somatic tissues. We observed high-efficiency germline recovery of the KI events after preselection for mosaic founders that acquired the correct donor insertions in somatic tissues by selecting either embryos on the basis of fluorescent reporter signals or adult fish on the basis of fin clip junction PCR. During the construction of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne KI fish line, approximately 15% of F<sub>0</sub> embryos showed the expected <italic>tdTomato</italic> expression after the injection of the donor together with the Cas9/gRNA system. More than 50% (5/9) of these fluorescent reporter-positive F<sub>0</sub> fish successfully transmitted the KI alleles to their progeny. In contrast, no germline transmission events were identified in the 40 founders negative for the somatic cell expression of <italic>tdTomato</italic>. Similarly, approximately half (10/21) of the embryonic stage preselected founders showed germline transmission of the <italic>sox10</italic> geno-tagging KI alleles. For the screening of <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG geno-tagging KI fish, we preselected adult fish for somatic cell integration by junction PCR of fin clips and found that 6 out of 48 founders were positive for donor insertions in this somatic tissue. Among these founders, 2 out of 5 positive founders were also positive for germline transmission. Not surprisingly, we also screened for germline transmission in 20 founders negative by fin clip junction PCR and found that none of them transmitted a KI donor to their offspring. In summary, to achieve efficient recovery of germline-transmissible KI alleles, we strongly recommend the preselection of F<sub>0</sub> embryos according to fluorescent signals or adults on the basis of fin clip junction PCR and then screening only these founders in germline transmission analysis.</p><p>Compared with traditional KI strategies, which generally adopt donors containing a single functional cassette, our dual-cassette donor design provides more flexibility to achieve complex genome manipulation, enabling a variety of applications. In addition to coupling conditional knockout with gene-labeling or geno-tagging, this dual-cassette donor system could theoretically be expanded to other applications after further modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), such as to simulate precise genome modifications, achieve conditional gene rescue or differentiate and analyze maternal, zygotic and paternal gene expression and activity. For example, the Ne-cassette can be engineered to contain a coding sequence with a precise mutation (such as a disease-causing point mutation) so that the deletion of the Po-cassette could conditionally simulate the precise mutation. On the other hand, conditional gene rescue can be achieved by swapping the Po-cassette and Ne-cassette. This strategy may also be utilized to study cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous gene functions. Furthermore, our dual-cassette donor knockin strategy could theoretically be customized for use in other model systems, such as mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, or adapted for medical research, including the establishment of disease models for drug screening and mechanism dissection or the tracing of cancer cell transformation and metastasis to provide new insights into carcinogenesis and cancer therapy.</p><p>Nevertheless, our current dual-functional donor KI strategy has certain limitations and is open to further improvement. To simplify donor design and construction and reduce the size of the donor plasmids as much as possible, we have omitted most intron sequences downstream of the Cas9/gRNA target sites as well as the endogenous 3’-UTRs, and mainly relied on the downstream coding sequence from the cDNA to rescue the correct expression of the target gene. This approach may alter the expression pattern and/or regulation of the target gene, so we suggest careful evaluation of the reporter gene expression and comparison of the result with the endogenous gene characteristics before performing further experiments, such as conditional knockout or lineage tracing. Of course, one can easily include introns and 3’-UTRs in the donor design when necessary. On the other hand, since only one form of the downstream intronless cDNA sequence is inserted into the final KI allele to complement the disruption of endogenous genes, this approach may not be applicable to genes with multiple alternative splicing isoforms or genes regulated by RNA splicing. However, this limitation may be avoided by including all the downstream introns in the Po-cassette of the donor. In addition, this limitation sometimes might be considered a unique advantage, through which KI alleles with different alternative splicing isoforms could be purposely designed and generated separately, facilitating specific and detailed investigation as well as the comparison of different isoforms. In addition to the disadvantages in the design of the rescue sequences in the Po-cassette, another concern is that all the current KI alleles retain the plasmid backbone sequence at the insertion site in the genome, which might induce DNA methylation and silencing of transcription, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). In the future, we will try to improve the donor by introducing another recombination system, such as Flp/<italic>FRT</italic>, <italic>attB</italic>/<italic>attP</italic>, or Dre/<italic>Rox</italic> to flank the unwanted backbone and then delete it after successful knock in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al.

(2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park and Leach, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney and Mosimann (2018)</xref>, or by introducing two Cas/gRNA target sites in the donor, flanking the unwanted backbone to separate it from the functional cassettes during targeted insertion, or by using minicircle DNA to minimize the unwanted backbone sequence.</p></sec><sec

Each primer pair was designed to span the KI donor integration site, and <italic>gapdh</italic> was used as the internal reference gene. qRT-PCR primer information is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. qRT-PCR experiments were performed in a Roche LightCycler 96 instrument or BioRad CFX96 using EvaGreen 2x qRT-PCR Mastermix (Applied Biological Materials) and a 500 nM final primer concentration. Fold changes were calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method, and p&lt;0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Yulong Li for providing us with the <italic>pMD18T-tdGFP</italic> vector.

The mutagenesis vectors you have developed offer a key advantage over existing tools: the ability to track homozygous wild type, heterozygous mutant or homozygous mutant status of every cell using fluorescent reporters. Together with well-documented amenability of zebrafish embryos and larvae to high-resolution imaging, these tools should enable tremendous advances in genetic analysis of developmental processes. Furthermore, the ability to unequivocally assign mutant, heterozygous or wild type genotypes to every cell in a mosaic tissue should be of high interest to those studying genetic control of post-embryonic processes such as regeneration. The apparent ease with which your vectors can be integrated into the genome (using non-homologous end joining instead of less efficient but more precise homology directed repair) should make the methodology readily accessible to a large number of laboratories.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;One-step efficient generation of dual-function conditional knockout and geno-tagging allele in zebrafish&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Grunwald (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues describes a novel conditional mutagenesis system for the zebrafish. The system uses non-homologous end joining pathway to integrate dual function transgenes into the genome with very high efficiency. The &quot;rescue&quot; component of the integrated transgene contains the cDNA coding for exons downstream of the integration site co-translationally linked to a fluorescent reporter. The &quot;rescue&quot; cassette is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites for Cre-mediated excision. The second part of the integrated transgene contains transcriptional terminators and splice acceptors for mutagenesis using the gene trap principle. Authors demonstrate efficient transgene integration and Cre-dependent mutagenesis of <italic>tbx5a, sox10</italic> and <italic>kcdt10</italic> genes.</p><p>While several recent papers have described conditional mutagenesis methods for zebrafish, they have not yet been broadly employed by other laboratories. The approach described in this manuscript is made particularly attractive by the ability to pre-screen using fluorescence, resulting in very high apparent transgenesis rates. The ability to use fluorescence to track mutant and wild type alleles built into the PoR-NeG vectors may be of particular interest for mosaic analysis. An additional advantage, shared with another method recently published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Sugimoto et al., 2017), is that downstream exons of the mutated gene are not expressed, which should help avoid genetic compensation.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript by Zhang et al. represents an important step developing a highly sought-after technique of conditional mutagenesis for the zebrafish.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The described method of conditional mutagenesis is very likely to be refractive to genetic compensation (with the caveat that the <italic>mutExon</italic> in the PoNe donor may induce NMD and genetic compensation if expressed). This compelling hypothesis can only be tested by mutating a gene known to be subject to genetic compensation. To our knowledge, <italic>tbx5a, sox10</italic> and <italic>kcdt10</italic> loci selected for mutagenesis are not subject to genetic compensation, making them unsuitable for testing the non-compensation hypothesis. Thus, authors must either provide data demonstrating lack of genetic compensation or text sentences describing genetic compensation to the Discussion section, clearly indicating speculative nature of such statements. Furthermore, the possibility that <italic>mutExon</italic> in PoNe donor may induce compensation needs to be discussed.</p><p>2) Expression of insertionally mutated loci has to be quantified in &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states. It can be done by qRT-PCR using primers in exons upstream and downstream of the integration site, as is common for gene traps. The need to analyze expression in the &quot;on&quot; state is justified because the gene is expressed from intron-less cDNA with a non-native 3' UTR. It is important to analyze expression in the &quot;off&quot; state because all the coding sequences are present in the genome and mutagenicity relies on the efficiency of splicing and transcriptional termination modules within the inserted transgene.</p><p>3) A thorough breakdown of transgenesis efficiency must be provided, starting with numbers of injected embryos (if available), embryos screened for fluorescence, percentage/numbers of embryos selected for raising and so forth.</p><p>4) A better explanation for different components used in different vectors must be provided. Specifically, why was <italic>mutExon</italic> not retained PoR-NeG vectors, why different transcriptional terminators are used in PoR-NeG vectors integrated into <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> loci? Stability of constructs and transgenes containing two 8X terminators should be discussed. In simplest terms, which vector would you recommend for other labs to use?</p><p>5) Since rescue function is provided by partially intronless cDNA, this approach may not be applicable to genes with multiple alternatively spliced isoforms or genes regulated at the level of RNA splicing. This limitation should be discussed.</p><p>6) Higher resolution images of transgenes must be included for all figures, especially Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Li et al., &quot;One-step efficient generation of dual-function conditional knockout and geno-tagging allele in zebrafish&quot;, describes the authors successful attempts in generating dual functional alleles in zebrafish using NHEJ-mediated insertion targeted by Cas9/gRNA. This gene-trap approach uses two functional units in the vectors. The first unit confers cis-complementation of the mutagenic effect and expression of a fluorescent protein. It consists of the native splice acceptor, the remaining downstream coding sequence, and the coding sequence of a fluorescent protein. The unit is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites to allow Cre-dependent removal. The second unit confers transcriptional termination. In the basic vector, it consists of two or more pA signals (SV40 pA and BGH pA) followed by a mutant native exon with a premature stop codon. In the more advanced version, the second unit consists of a traditional gene-trap that could lead to the expression of a different fluorescent protein. The authors inserted the cassettes at 3 different loci (<italic>tbx5a, kctd10</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic>) and demonstrated germline transmission in 5-50% founders. They showed the conditionality of these alleles and the utility of alleles generated by the advanced cassette in revealing the genotypes of individual cells. The results are of good quality and the writing is fair. Efficient generation of conditional alleles is a sought-after technique in the zebrafish field. The manuscript therefore addresses an unmet need and should be of interest to scientists in the zebrafish community and beyond. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed, both in the experiments and in the writing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no quantitative evaluation of the effects of the KI alleles on gene expression. The authors only qualitatively assessed the KI alleles by comparing the expression patterns of the fluorescent protein(s) and the major phenotypes of the homozygous mutants. Quantitative evaluation of such alleles in &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;defective&quot; state at the mRNA level is a norm and should be done here. It is important to know how normal is &quot;normal&quot; and how defective is &quot;defective&quot;.</p><p>2) The cassette design seems random, not systematic. The authors used 3 different designs. They discussed potential benefits of each feature but often without strong experimental evidence. When adding more features to the more advanced cassettes, they also dropped certain presumably important feature without rationale. For example, the authors argument that the mutant exon with premature termination codon in the cassette may be indispensable for effective gene disruption, but there is no direct evidence. They then dropped the mutant exon in the more advanced cassettes. Although the authors argued that <italic>2PA</italic> is highly effective as the transcriptional terminator, they replaced it with <italic>8PA</italic> in the last cassette. The stability of two tandem <italic>8PA</italic> needs to be evaluated.</p><p>3) The authors argued that one of the main advantages of the described alleles is that they may bypass transcriptional adaptation elicited by a premature termination codon. Yet they included a premature termination codon in their cassette.</p><p>4) All the alleles also retain the backbone sequence of the vector at the insert site. It has been reported that such extraneous sequence can induce DNA methylation and silencing. This needs to be discussed.</p><p>5) The resultant &quot;normal&quot; alleles have reduced intron number, which may alter the expression, or eliminate certain alternative spliced forms. This needs to be discussed as potential disadvantage.</p><p>6) The necessity of LiCl precipitation of gRNA is confusing. Although the observation is intriguing, but it is only true for the <italic>emx1</italic> gRNA. It is unclear whether the <italic>lamGolden</italic> gRNA also requires LiCl precipitation for activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the present report by Li et al. the authors describe a genetic method to generate conditional knock out alleles in zebrafish based on the Cre/Lox system and CRISPR/CAS9 mediated NHEJ. With this technique the authors generate specific alleles in few target loci (<italic>tbx5a, kctd10</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic>). In each case they developed reporter alleles that were tagged with fluorescent proteins and could be inactivated by Cre mRNA injection.</p><p>The use of NHEJ manipulate endogenous loci in zebrafish with high efficiency was previously reported in various papers. In particular a strategy to tag endogenous proteins at the C-terminus in zebrafish was previously reported by Li et al., 2015. The present manuscript is an improvement of the current methods that consists basically in the design of two <italic>loxP</italic> sites around the artificial tagged exon that is inserted by NHEJ.</p><p>The authors claim that their strategy will offer novel advantages including the avoidance of genetic compensation mechanisms and the possibility to generate conditional knock out alleles. Although I agree in principle with these statements these are not shown in the current paper.</p><p>In particular the authors should use their method to silence a known locus that is triggering genetic compensation when inactivated with the insertion of classical indel mutations (as described in the recent literature).</p><p>In addition, it is important to test their floxed alleles, crossing them with Cre expressing lines in specific tissues (for instance the heart primordium) to show that tissue and temporal control of the recombination event can be achieved.</p><p>Without these experiments the paper shows only a very limited advancement in designing clever targeting plasmid but fails to proof the real power of this approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Li et al. introduce a new method for creating conditional knockout alleles in the zebrafish. The method generates a wildtype allele translationally linked to a fluorescent protein so that cells expressing the wildtype allele can be identified. Cre activity leads to excision of the wildtype-fluorescent reporter sequences and leads to expression of a different reporter protein so that the loss-of-function allele is tagged. It is a very nice idea and it will be very useful. The method is not perfect in that the wildtype activity is supplied by a cDNA sequence and the claim is that the mutant allele will not trigger transcription compensation, which is not tested and may or may not be true, but this method is a true advance in the field and will be implemented by others. The method deserves to be published.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is very well written. Nevertheless, the manuscript has a number of areas that require clarification. At present, a number of the experiments presented in the figures are difficult to interpret. The paper will make a much bigger impact if the reader has an easy time understanding the experiments and the results.</p><p>1) The authors do not correctly describe the efficiency rates of generating insertions or the efficiency with which germline insertions are made or recovered. This is a very important point and <italic>must</italic> be corrected. The authors claim throughout the paper that they have improved the efficiency of insertion or of generating insertions that will be transmissible through the germline. This is not correct. They have created a method that allows for the efficient recovery of germline transmissible modified alleles. They have made a wonderful advance but it is not the same as improving recombination rates. The authors have come up with a wonderful method for pre-selecting embryos that have acquired insertions in somatic tissue, because integration in the correct orientation leads to expression of a fluorescent reporter under control of the targeted gene. A low percentage of injected embryos grow into normal-looking embryos with reporter expression (subsection “High efficient generation of a dual-function KI allele at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus” claims 10% in one experiment). Then among those animals pre-selected for the presence integration events, a reasonable and varied fraction will transmit the edited allele to the next generation. Therefore, it is simply false for the authors to write &quot;The feasibility of this strategy was demonstrated at <italic>tbx5a</italic> and <italic>kctd1</italic> loci, with germline transmission efficiency as high as 56%.&quot; Such a statement would be interpreted by readers as indicating that they had greatly advanced targeting efficiency so that 56% of injected animals will transmit an edited allele. Similarly, in the Discussion, the authors claim: &quot;As high as 50% of the F<sub>0</sub> fish could transmit the integrated donor construct to their offspring, which is much higher in germline transmission efficiency than previously reported HR-mediated gene knock-in.&quot; Instead, the authors should say they have developed a clever method that makes recovery of conditional alleles very efficient. This method involves first preselecting embryos that have mosaically acquired the conditional allele, and then only screening the preselected transgenic animals for the ability to transmit the alleles through the germline. Under these conditions, up to 56% of the pre-selected founders may transmit edited alleles. The authors should make this clear in the Abstract also.</p><p>2) It is difficult to reconstruct and to figure out the actual numbers that describe the recovery of germline transmissible alleles. For example, let's look at the section that begins subsection &quot;Generation and evaluation of geno-tagging alleles at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus&quot;. The authors write: &quot;After injection and screening, integration of this donor and germline transmission of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG donor geno-tagging alleles were detected and confirmed in 2 out of 48 adult F<sub>0</sub>&quot;. I can't understand where the number &quot;48&quot; comes from – was this all the F<sub>0</sub> adults from an injection? Was it 48 F<sub>0</sub> selected on the basis of fluorescent reporter expression? In Table 2, row 3 it appears that 16/124 injected embryos had reporter expression – so where did the 48 come from?</p><p>3) The authors create conditional alleles that can be switched from WT red to mutant green. They call these PoR-NeG alleles for Positive Red to Negative Green. They also seem to call these geno-tagged alleles. They sometimes breed these to animals with another type of condition allele that switches from a WT-fluorescent reporter to a mutant-no reporter allele. They call these alleles PoNe, positive to negative. It would make the reading much easier if they always labeled an allele that co-expressed a fluorescent reporter. In other words, when the wildtype allele is marked by expression of tdTomato and the mutant allele is not marked by reporter expression, maybe call it PoR-Ne. In addition, they place these PoNe alleles on backgrounds that express a heart reporter (<italic>cmcl2:EGFP</italic>). As a result, if the WT allele were clearly marked as PoR-Ne then it would be easy to tell which is the heart marker and which is the tagged gene. In general: please use consistent nomenclature.</p><p>4) The figures need some work. The easiest suggestion is that the lettering needs to be larger or at higher resolution – especially for the line drawings – when I expanded it on my screen it became very pixelated. For example, try enlarging Figure 4—figure supplement 1F.</p><p>5) Figure 2A and C: I find these very hard to interpret – I think the authors are visualizing fluorescent markers in three embryo siblings generated from a single cross some of which have been injected with Cre mRNA. The patterns of fluorescence reporter expression differ and I believe the results are to be interpreted as being derived from embryos with different genotypes. Would it be possible for the authors to tell us the presumed genotypes of each row before Cre exposure? I feel this would make the interpretation easier for the reader. I don't understand Figure 2C – it looks like each embryo has a green heart but I think the authors want us to focus on differences. These need to be spelled out perhaps in the figure legend? For Panel E please explain in the figure legend this experiment. Explain the cross and what Normal and Defective embryos are. Explain what &quot;before injection&quot; means.</p><p>6) Figure 3B: I suspect the markers on the gel are mistakenly labeled. For example, the experimental band of 380 bp is larger than the marker of 500 bp and the experimental band of 820 bp is smaller than the marker of 750 bp. Also, in Panel B, the gel of the 3' junctions: I don't understand how amplification from the donor shown in Panel A with T5F2 and T5R1 would give a band – is there some mistake here?</p><p>7) In Figure 3C, I believe the images of dorsal view and ventral view have been reversed. I think the first column and bottom row picture is a ventral view. Please check – I may be wrong. I think the cross that produced the embryos in Panel C needs to be clearly explained and how to interpret the genotypes should be clearly explained. The images are difficult to interpret – what are we supposed to look at in the boxed insets? Explain in the legend please.</p><p>8) The images in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are difficult to interpret. Again I suspect that if the authors told us the predicted genotypes and told us what we are supposed to be seeing in the outlined boxed areas, then it would be clearer.</p><p>9) Subsection “Generation and evaluation of dual-function alleles showing CKO with gene labeling effect at zebrafish <italic>kctd10</italic> locus”: it the sentence beginning “Interestingly, in the initial design of the <italic>kctd10</italic> PoNe donor…” might be easier to read if you re-phrased this sentence something like: &quot;In initial experiments, we used only a donor with a single SV40pA termination signal sequence without the modified exon (<italic>mutExon</italic>). With such donors we were able to isolate stable integrations at the <italic>kctd10</italic> locus and observed the correct expression pattern of <italic>tdGFP</italic>.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;One-step efficient generation of dual-function conditional knockout and geno-tagging allele in zebrafish&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The revised manuscript is much improved, and additional data demonstrating feasibility of fully conditional knockout using the new cmlc2:CreERT2 line. However, one major issue remains. It is common practice to measure the expression of targeted loci in the &quot;off&quot; state in homozygotes. Data can be displayed in several different ways, exemplified by Figure 2 in Ni et al., 2012 reference and Figure 1D in the Grajevskaja et al., 2018. Figure 1A in Sugimoto et al., 2017 serves as a directly relevant example of from a recently published <italic>eLife</italic> paper describing a conditional knock-in allele. This is very important. As one can appreciate from error bars in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, Figure 2—figure supplement 2L, Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, it is impossible to distinguish between 90% and 99% mutagenesis efficiency in heterozygotes (55% vs. 51% of read-through transcript remaining in heterozygotes). In contrast, the difference between 10% and 1% levels of remaining wild-type transcript should be quite straightforward to reliably quantify in homozygotes. Results of such quantitative analysis may have an impact on the choice between your described polyA cassettes (tandem SV40/GBH vs. 8xSV40). Thus, qRT-PCR analyses must be performed on embryos homozygous for Cre-excised alleles.</p><p>2) A second issue somewhat detracting from the overall quality of the work is occasionally difficult-to-read English. I would simply recommend that the final submission should be edited with the help of a professional editor.</p><p>3) Sequences of primers used for qRT-PCR should be included, along with other primers, in Supplementary file 7.</p><p>4) Why is <italic>kctd10</italic> deleted from the Abstract?</p><p>5) Subsection “High efficient generation of a dual-function KI allele at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus”: Need to show <italic>hEMX1</italic> target site on the vector in Figure 1A, and corresponding sites in vector diagrams in subsequent figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48081.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The described method of conditional mutagenesis is very likely to be refractive to genetic compensation (with the caveat that the mutExon in the PoNe donor may induce NMD and genetic compensation if expressed). This compelling hypothesis can only be tested by mutating a gene known to be subject to genetic compensation. To our knowledge, tbx5a, sox10 and kcdt10 loci selected for mutagenesis are not subject to genetic compensation, making them unsuitable for testing the non-compensation hypothesis. Thus, authors must either provide data demonstrating lack of genetic compensation or text sentences describing genetic compensation to the Discussion section, clearly indicating speculative nature of such statements. Furthermore, the possibility that mutExon in PoNe donor may induce compensation needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion in our statements about genetic compensation. We have tried to generate CKO+gene-labeling and geno-tagging alleles for the <italic>egfl7</italic> locus, to evaluate the possibility of eliminating genetic compensation by our method. Unfortunately, we have not identified satisfactory high-efficient Cas9/gRNA target sites in the introns of this gene so far, preventing us from generating KI lines for the evaluation.

It can be done by qRT-PCR using primers in exons upstream and downstream of the integration site, as is common for gene traps. The need to analyze expression in the &quot;on&quot; state is justified because the gene is expressed from intron-less cDNA with a non-native 3' UTR. It is important to analyze expression in the &quot;off&quot; state because all the coding sequences are present in the genome and mutagenicity relies on the efficiency of splicing and transcriptional termination modules within the inserted transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have designed primers flanking the insertion sites and performed qRT-PCR experiments to quantify the “on” and “off” states of the PoNe and geno-tagging alleles of <italic>tbx5a, kctd10</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> loci, in 72 hpf embryos obtained from outcross of respective KI homozygous fish with a wild-type one, with or without <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA injection. As an example (subsection “Conditional knock out could be achieved for the <italic>tbx5a</italic> KI allele”), the results from the <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne donor KI fish showed that the mRNA transcription level of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus in the <italic>tbx5a<sup>+/PoR-Ne</sup></italic> embryos before <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA injection was comparable with that of wild-type control embryos, indicating normal expression of the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-Ne</sup></italic> allele (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).

We have provided more detailed information about these process in the revised manuscript, as the following:</p><p>1) An extract from subsection “Germline transmission and evaluation of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> KI allele”: “To generate <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne KI zebrafish, about 100 one-cell stage embryos were injected, and red fluorescent signals could be detected in 18 of them (Supplementary file 2). […] In contrast, no red fluorescent signal was detected in any F<sub>1</sub> progeny from outcross of 40 adult F<sub>0</sub> raised from tdTomato-negative embryos, indicating a positive correlation of reporter gene expression in founder embryos with successful as well as efficient germline transmission of the KI events.”</p><p>2) An extract from subsection “Generation and evaluation of dual-function alleles showing CKO with gene labeling effect at zebrafish <italic>kctd10</italic> locus”: “For the generation of <italic>kctd10</italic> PoG-Ne KI fish line, we injected about 100 one-cell stage embryos and observed the mosaic expression of tdGFP in 22 F<sub>0</sub> embryos (Supplementary file 2).

In simplest terms, which vector would you recommend for other labs to use?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. The key to the success of our dual-function KI strategy relies on the special design of the dual-cassette donor. In order to refine our method, we have tried slightly different designs on certain components in different KI experiments, on the premise of keeping the Po- and Ne-cassettes intact and functional. Since polyA signals are generally not 100% efficient for the termination of transcription, a <italic>mutExon</italic> (including its preceding splice acceptor sequence) bearing a premature stop codon was included in the Ne-cassette, following the 2X <italic>PA</italic> terminators, of the initial version of the PoNe donor, where only a single fluorescent reporter gene (<italic>tdTomato</italic> or <italic>tdGFP</italic>) was incorporated into the Po-cassette. In case there is leaky transcription after the 2X <italic>PA</italic>, this <italic>mutExon</italic> will be transcribed and spliced into the mature mRNA, ensuring disruption of the function of the target gene. This type of donor was used to generate the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-Ne</sup>, kctd10<sup>PoG-Ne-1</sup></italic> and <italic>kctd10<sup>PoG-Ne-2</sup></italic> alleles. However, since the presence of <italic>mutExon</italic> will disrupt the translation of the fluorescent reporter in the Ne-cassette (of the PoR-NeG donor), and on the other hand, it might trigger genetic compensation, in the design of geno-tagging PoR-NeG donor, the advanced version of the original PoNe donor, we replaced the <italic>mutExon</italic> with its wild-type counterpart, to ensure normal expression of the fluorescent reporter in the Ne-cassette after Cre-induced removal of the Po-cassette, as well as to bypass the unwanted genetic compensation response.</p><p>In addition to avoiding the <italic>mutExon</italic> for the design of PoR-NeG geno-tagging donor, another concern is the efficiency of transcriptional termination of the Po-cassette, since its leaky transcription might lead to unwanted expression of the fluorescent reporter in the Ne-cassette before Cre-induction. It has been reported that the efficiency of transcriptional termination correlates with the number of polyA signals (Ni et al., 2012). Although we have obtained satisfactory results with the original 2X <italic>PA</italic> for the generation of <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> geno-tagging allele, we decided to try more polyA signals for the <italic>sox10</italic> locus, concerning that the expression of <italic>sox10</italic> is more ubiquitous and seems also stronger than that of <italic>tbx5a</italic>. Therefore, to be on the safe side, we expanded the original single SV40 polyA signal into eight tandem repeats (<italic>8xPA</italic>) for stronger transcriptional termination in the Po-cassette, and also used this 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequence for the transcriptional termination of the Ne-cassette. Indeed, there are potential disadvantages for the employment of two 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences, each containing eight times tandem repeats of the ~160-bp polyA signal sequence, in the <italic>sox10</italic> PoR-NeG geno-tagging donor as well as the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> allele, when concerning the stability. On one hand, the repeats within each 8X <italic>PA</italic> might be reduced during expansions and/or passages to next generations of this allele; On the other hand, the sequence flanked by the two 8X <italic>PA</italic> (containing the downstream <italic>loxP</italic> and the Ne-cassette) might be lost due to occasional recombination of the two 8X PA, leading to abolishment of the CKO and fluorescence-switch effect. Unfortunately, at present we have’t been able to assess the situation of these 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences in the transgenic fish by PCR amplification and sequencing, due to its highly repetitive nature. However, so far, the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> allele behaves normally, considering the observation that the F<sub>2</sub> embryos displayed expected expression of <italic>tdTomato</italic> signal under normal condtions and also showed expected switch to <italic>tdGFP</italic> expression upon treatment with Cre recombinase, indicating that the two 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences are still functional. In the future, we will keep tracking the inheritance and stability of this allele, and also will try to establish a method to evaluate the situation of the 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences in the transgenic fish.</p><p>Taking into account of all the above concerns for the donor design, we recommend to use the geno-tagging donor for the generation of CKO allele coupled with gene or allele labeling effect, beginning with constructing the donor with 2X <italic>PA</italic>, and then testing its effect in founder embryos to see whether it is enough to stop the expression of the second fluorescent reporter, and introducing more polyA signals when necessary.</p><p>We have clarified this issue by including the above explanations and discussions in the sections of both Results section and Discussion section in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Since rescue function is provided by partially intronless cDNA, this approach may not be applicable to genes with multiple alternatively spliced isoforms or genes regulated at the level of RNA splicing.

Unfortunately, at present we have’t been able to assess the situation of these 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences in the transgenic fish by PCR amplification and sequencing, due to its highly repetitive nature. However, so far the <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> allele behaves normally, considering the observation that the F<sub>2</sub> embryos displayed expected expression of <italic>tdTomato</italic> signal under normal condtions and also showed expected switch to <italic>tdGFP</italic> expression upon treatment with Cre recombinase, indicating that the two 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences are still functional. In the future, we will keep tracking the inheritance and stability of this allele, and also will try to establish a method to evaluate the situation of the 8X <italic>PA</italic> sequences in the transgenic fish.</p><p>Taking into account of all the above concerns for the donor design, we recommend to use the geno-tagging donor for the generation of CKO allele coupled with gene or allele labeling effect, beginning with constructing the donor with 2X <italic>PA</italic>, and then testing its effect in founder embryos to see whether it is enough to stop the expression of the second fluorescent reporter, and introducing more polyA signals when necessary.</p><p>We have clarified this issue by including the above explanations and discussions in the sections of both Results section and Discussion section in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argued that one of the main advantages of the described alleles is that they may bypass transcriptional adaptation elicited by a premature termination codon. Yet they included a premature termination codon in their cassette.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. Yes, we indeed included a <italic>mutExon</italic> bearing a premature stop codon in the Ne-cassette of the original single fluorescent reporter version of the PoNe donor, as seen in the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-Ne</sup>, kctd10<sup>PoG-Ne-1</sup></italic> and <italic>kctd10<sup>PoG-Ne-2</sup></italic> alleles, which are still prone to genetic compensation or transcriptional adaptation. This is one of the reasons for us to improve the design and came up with the advanced geno-tagging PoR-NeG donor, as represented by the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> and <italic>sox10<sup>PoR-NeG</sup></italic> alleles, where the <italic>mutExon</italic> was replaced by its wild-type counterpart and another fluorescent reporter, which theoretically could be exempted from transcriptional adaptation. We have clarified this issue by adding the corresponding descriptions and discussions in our revised manuscript (subsection “Improving the dual-cassette-donor strategy to achieve geno-tagging effect”, Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All the alleles also retain the backbone sequence of the vector at the insert site. It has been reported that such extraneous sequence can induce DNA methylation and silencing. This needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. We have discussed this concern and also provided potential solutions in our revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The resultant &quot;normal&quot; alleles have reduced intron number, which may alter the expression, or eliminate certain alternative spliced forms. This needs to be discussed as potential disadvantage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this potential disadvantage. We have clarified this issue by adding a new paragraph in the Discussion, discussed the limitations of our current strategy, including the concerns about potential alteration of gene expression as well as splicing regulation, and also gave some suggestions of potential solutions to these problems (subsection “Geno-tagging effect achieved for zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> gene”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The necessity of LiCl precipitation of gRNA is confusing. Although the observation is intriguing, but it is only true for the emx1 gRNA. It is unclear whether the lamGolden gRNA also requires LiCl precipitation for activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. We have compared the effect of LiCl precipitation with ethanol for the <italic>lamGolden</italic> gRNA and found similar result as <italic>hEMX1</italic> gRNA, where only LiCl precipitation gave satisfactory KI efficiency.

In each case they developed reporter alleles that were tagged with fluorescent proteins and could be inactivated by Cre mRNA injection.</p><p>The use of NHEJ manipulate endogenous loci in zebrafish with high efficiency was previously reported in various papers. In particular a strategy to tag endogenous proteins at the C-terminus in zebrafish was previously reported by Li et al., 2015.

We have tried to generate CKO+gene-labeling and geno-tagging alleles for the <italic>egfl7</italic> locus, to evaluate the possibility of eliminating genetic compensation by our method. Unfortunately, we have not identified satisfactory high-efficient Cas9/gRNA target sites in the introns of this gene so far, preventing us from generating KI lines for the evaluation. We have modified our statements about genetic compensation, indicating speculative nature of the non-compensation claims for our method, and moved the corresponding sentences to Discussion section.</p><p>In order to prove that tissue and temporal control of Cre-induced recombination events can be achieved in our KI transgenic zebrafish, we generated a heart specific <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic line <italic>Tg(cmlc2:zCreERT2-2A-ECFP)</italic> showing expression of both ECFP and 4-hydroxyltamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible CreER<sup>T2</sup>. This line was crossed with the <italic>tbx5a<sup>PoR-NeG/PoR-NeG</sup></italic> geno-tagging adult fish, and the embryos were treated with 4-HT from 5 hpf to 48 hpf. As expected, green fluorescent signals were clearly detected in the ECFP-positive embryos but not in the un-treated control group, indicating successful switching of tdTomato to tdGFP expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We have included this new result in our revised manuscript (subsection “Generation and evaluation of geno-tagging alleles at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall the manuscript is very well written. Nevertheless, the manuscript has a number of areas that require clarification. At present, a number of the experiments presented in the figures are difficult to interpret. The paper will make a much bigger impact if the reader has an easy time understanding the experiments and the results.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1) The authors do not correctly describe the efficiency rates of generating insertions or the efficiency with which germline insertions are made or recovered. This is a very important point and</italic> must <italic>be corrected. The authors claim throughout the paper that they have improved the efficiency of insertion or of generating insertions that will be transmissible through the germline. This is not correct. They have created a method that allows for the efficient recovery of germline transmissible modified alleles. They have made a wonderful advance but it is not the same as improving recombination rates. The authors have come up with a wonderful method for pre-selecting embryos that have acquired insertions in somatic tissue, because integration in the correct orientation leads to expression of a fluorescent reporter under control of the targeted gene. A low percentage of injected embryos grow into normal-looking embryos with reporter expression (subsection “High efficient generation of a dual-function KI allele at zebrafish tbx5a locus” claims 10% in one experiment). Then among those animals pre-selected for the presence integration events, a reasonable and varied fraction will transmit the edited allele to the next generation. Therefore, it is simply false for the authors to write &quot;The feasibility of this strategy was demonstrated at tbx5a and kctd1 loci, with germline transmission efficiency as high as 56%.&quot; Such a statement would be interpreted by readers as indicating that they had greatly advanced targeting efficiency so that 56% of injected animals will transmit an edited allele. Similarly, in the Discussion, the authors claim: &quot;As high as 50% of the F<sub>0</sub> fish could transmit the integrated donor construct to their offspring, which is much higher in germline transmission efficiency than previously reported HR-mediated gene knock-in.&quot; Instead, the authors should say they have developed a clever method that makes recovery of conditional alleles very efficient. This method involves first preselecting embryos that have mosaically acquired the conditional allele, and then only screening the preselected transgenic animals for the ability to transmit the alleles through the germline. Under these conditions, up to 56% of the pre-selected founders may transmit edited alleles. The authors should make this clear in the Abstract also.</italic></p><p>Sorry for the confusion in the descriptions about the KI efficiency. We have clarified this issue throughout the section of Results and emphasized the importance of pre-selection of founders to achieve successful germline transmission of KI events in the section of Discussion in our revised manuscript (Results subsections “High efficient generation of a dual-function KI allele at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus” and “Improving the dual-cassette-donor strategy to achieve geno-tagging effect”, and the Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is difficult to reconstruct and to figure out the actual numbers that describe the recovery of germline transmissible alleles. For example, let's look at the section that begins subsection &quot;Generation and evaluation of geno-tagging alleles at zebrafish tbx5a locus&quot;. The authors write: &quot;After injection and screening, integration of this donor and germline transmission of the tbx5a PoR-NeG donor geno-tagging alleles were detected and confirmed in 2 out of 48 adult F<sub>0</sub>&quot;. I can't understand where the number &quot;48&quot; comes from – was this all the F<sub>0</sub> adults from an injection? Was it 48 F<sub>0</sub> selected on the basis of fluorescent reporter expression? In Table 2, row 3 it appears that 16/124 injected embryos had reporter expression – so where did the 48 come from?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion in the descriptions of our experimental procedures. We have clarified this issue by providing more detailed information about the injection and screening process throughout the section of Results (as summarized in the following) and summarized and discussed the results in the section of Discussion in our revised manuscript. The following is a brief summary:</p><p>1) An extract from subsection “Germline transmission and evaluation of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> KI allele”: “To generate <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne KI zebrafish, about 100 one-cell stage embryos were injected, and red fluorescent signals could be detected in 18 of them (Supplementary file 2). […] In contrast, no red fluorescent signal was detected in any F1 progeny from outcross of 40 adult F<sub>0</sub> raised from tdTomato-negative embryos, indicating a positive correlation of reporter gene expression in founder embryos with successful as well as efficient germline transmission of the KI events.”</p><p>2) An extract from subsection “Generation and evaluation of dual-function alleles showing CKO with gene labeling effect at zebrafish <italic>kctd10</italic> locus”: “For the generation of kctd10 PoG-Ne KI fish line, we injected about 100 one-cell stage embryos and observed the mosaic expression of tdGFP in 22 F<sub>0</sub> embryos (Supplementary file 2). We raised all the F<sub>0</sub> embryos without pre-selection to adulthood, and found 2 of 42 (4.8%) displayed germline transmission screening of 42 F<sub>0</sub> adults, only two of them displayed germline transmission of the kctd10 PoG-Ne donor KI events (Supplementary file 4).”</p><p>3) An extract from subsection “Generation and evaluation of geno-tagging alleles at zebrafish <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus”: “To generate <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-NeG geno-tagging zebrafish, about 100 one-cell stage embryos were injected, and 16 of them showed mosaic expression of red fluorescent signals (Supplementary file 2), whose ratio is comparable with the previous <italic>tbx5a</italic> PoR-Ne donor KI experiment. […] These results indicate a strong correlation between germline transmission of KI events and adult somatic tissue integration of the donor, and provide another efficient method for the enrichment of germline transmission events.”</p><p>4) An extract from subsection “Geno-tagging effect achieved for zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> gene”: “To generate the heritable <italic>sox10</italic> PoR-NeG geno-tagging allele, about 150 one-cell stage embryos were injected with the KI system (without Cre mRNA), and the tdTomato fluorescent signals were observed in 103 F<sub>0</sub> embryos (Supplementary file 2). The positive founder embryos showing fluorescent signals were raised to adulthood and germline transmission screening was conducted by outcross with wild-type zebrafish. Correct red fluorescent patterns in F1 embryos were observed in 10 out of 21 founders (Supplementary file 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors create conditional alleles that can be switched from WT red to mutant green. They call these PoR-NeG alleles for Positive Red to Negative Green. They also seem to call these geno-tagged alleles. They sometimes breed these to animals with another type of condition allele that switches from a WT-fluorescent reporter to a mutant-no reporter allele. They call these alleles PoNe, positive to negative. It would make the reading much easier if they always labeled an allele that co-expressed a fluorescent reporter. In other words, when the wildtype allele is marked by expression of tdTomato and the mutant allele is not marked by reporter expression, maybe call it PoR-Ne. In addition, they place these PoNe alleles on backgrounds that express a heart reporter (cmcl2:EGFP). As a result, if the WT allele were clearly marked as PoR-Ne then it would be easy to tell which is the heart marker and which is the tagged gene. In general: please use consistent nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion and thank you for the suggestion. We have clarified this issue as suggested in our revised the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figures need some work. The easiest suggestion is that the lettering needs to be larger or at higher resolution – especially for the line drawings – when I expanded it on my screen it became very pixelated. For example, try enlarging Figure 4—figure supplement 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we have found a better method to preserve high resolution of our figures, and we believe that the new figures are satisfactory in quality and could display clear details after enlargement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2A and C: I find these very hard to interpret – I think the authors are visualizing fluorescent markers in three embryo siblings generated from a single cross some of which have been injected with Cre mRNA. The patterns of fluorescence reporter expression differ and I believe the results are to be interpreted as being derived from embryos with different genotypes. Would it be possible for the authors to tell us the presumed genotypes of each row before Cre exposure? I feel this would make the interpretation easier for the reader. I don't understand Figure 2C – it looks like each embryo has a green heart but I think the authors want us to focus on differences. These need to be spelled out perhaps in the figure legend? For Panel E please explain in the figure legend this experiment. Explain the cross and what Normal and Defective embryos are. Explain what &quot;before injection&quot; means.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion and thank you for the suggestion. We have clarified these issues by editing the figure and revising the legend as suggested in our new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3B: I suspect the markers on the gel are mistakenly labeled. For example, the experimental band of 380 bp is larger than the marker of 500 bp and the experimental band of 820 bp is smaller than the marker of 750 bp. Also, in Panel B, the gel of the 3' junctions: I don't understand how amplification from the donor shown in Panel A with T5F2 and T5R1 would give a band – is there some mistake here?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion due to our negligence in gel labeling. We have re-labeled the markers carefully, ensuring they are assigned at the correct position. Regarding the PCR result of the 3' junctions in Panel B, the sequences of both T5F2 and T5R1 primers indeed exist in the donor, flanking the upstream <italic>loxP</italic> site, therefore a 730-bp product could be amplified in the lane with the donor as the template. We have edited the figure and revised the legend to clarify this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3C, I believe the images of dorsal view and ventral view have been reversed. I think the first column and bottom row picture is a ventral view. Please check – I may be wrong. I think the cross that produced the embryos in Panel C needs to be clearly explained and how to interpret the genotypes should be clearly explained. The images are difficult to interpret – what are we supposed to look at in the boxed insets? Explain in the legend please.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion and thank you for the suggestion. We have carefully examined our original microscopic images and confirmed that the dorsal and ventral labeling are correct. We have indicated the expected genotypes in the figure and revised the legend in our new manuscript, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The images in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are difficult to interpret. Again I suspect that if the authors told us the predicted genotypes and told us what we are supposed to be seeing in the outlined boxed areas, then it would be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion and thank you for the suggestion. We have clarified these issues by editing the figure and revising the corresponding legend in our new manuscript, as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The revised manuscript is much improved, and additional data demonstrating feasibility of fully conditional knockout using the new cmlc2:CreERT2 line. However, one major issue remains. It is common practice to measure the expression of targeted loci in the &quot;off&quot; state in homozygotes. Data can be displayed in several different ways, exemplified by Figure 2 in Ni et al., 2012 reference and Figure 1D in the Grajevskaja et al., 2018. Figure 1A in Sugimoto et al., 2017 serves as a directly relevant example of from a recently published eLife paper describing a conditional knock-in allele. This is very important. As one can appreciate from error bars in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, Figure 2—figure supplement 2L, Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, it is impossible to distinguish between 90% and 99% mutagenesis efficiency in heterozygotes (55% vs. 51% of read-through transcript remaining in heterozygotes). In contrast, the difference between 10% and 1% levels of remaining wild-type transcript should be quite straightforward to reliably quantify in homozygotes. Results of such quantitative analysis may have an impact on the choice between your described polyA cassettes (tandem SV40/GBH vs. 8xSV40). Thus, qRT-PCR analyses must be performed on embryos homozygous for Cre-excised alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We have measured the expression of all the four targeted loci in the “off” state from their corresponding homozygous mutant embryos by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the wild-type transcripts displayed at least a 12.5-fold reduction in the homozygous mutant embryos for each targeted allele. More precisely, their transcription level decreased to about 6.4%, 0.3%, 7.9% and 4.1% for <italic>tbx5a<sup>Ne/Ne</sup></italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F; subsection “Conditional knockout could be achieved for the <italic>tbx5a</italic> KI allele”), <italic>kctd10<sup>Ne-1/Ne-1</sup></italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2M; subsection “Generation and evaluation of dual-function alleles showing CKO with a gene labeling effect at the zebrafish <italic>kctd10</italic> locus”), <italic>tbx5a<sup>NeG/NeG</sup></italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; subsection “Geno-tagging effect achieved for the zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> gene”), and <italic>sox10<sup>NeG/NeG</sup></italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H; Discussion section), respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second issue somewhat detracting from the overall quality of the work is occasionally difficult-to-read English.
