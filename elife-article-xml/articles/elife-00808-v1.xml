X-chromosome transcripts. The mechanism in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been elusive due to improperly annotated transcription start sites (TSSs). Here we define TSSs and the distribution of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide in wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals to dissect this regulatory mechanism. Our TSS-mapping strategy integrates GRO-seq, which tracks nascent transcription, with a new derivative of this method, called GRO-cap, which recovers nascent RNAs with 5′ caps prior to their removal by co-transcriptional processing. Our analyses reveal that promoter-proximal pausing is rare, unlike in other metazoans, and promoters are unexpectedly far upstream from the 5′ ends of mature mRNAs. We find that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> equalizes X-chromosome expression between the sexes, to a level equivalent to autosomes, by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes using a chromosome-restructuring condensin complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00808.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00808.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00808.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many species, including humans, females have two X chromosomes whereas males have only one. To ensure that females do not end up with a double dose of the proteins encoded by genes on the X chromosome, animals employ a strategy called dosage compensation to control the expression of X-linked genes.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying dosage compensation vary between species, but they typically involve a regulatory complex that binds to the X chromosomes of one sex to modify gene expression. In the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>—which consists of hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO)—this regulatory complex, called the dosage compensation complex (DCC), binds to both X chromosomes of XX individuals, reducing gene expression from each by 50%. DCC shares many subunits with a protein complex called condensin, which regulates the structure of chromosomes to achieve proper chromosome segregation. However, it is unclear exactly how the DCC controls the expression of X-linked genes.</p><p>For a gene to be expressed, an enzyme called RNA polymerase II must bind to the gene’s promoter—a stretch of DNA upstream of the protein-coding part of the gene—so that it can begin transcribing the DNA into RNA. Promoters have been difficult to define in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but Kruesi et al. devised a strategy to map transcription start sites, and hence promoters, throughout the worm genome. The strategy integrates the results of two methods: One measures the extent and orientation of each gene’s transcribed region, and the other locates the distinctive cap structures that mark the true 5′ ends of newly made RNAs.</p><p>Using this new promoter information, coupled with genome-wide measurements of the levels of newly synthesized transcripts from wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals, they showed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> achieves dosage compensation by reducing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of X-linked genes in XX individuals.</p><p>Kruesi et al. also identified a second regulatory mechanism that acts in both sexes to increase the level of transcription of genes on the X chromosome. This ensures that after dosage compensation, genes on the X chromosome are expressed at a similar level to those on the autosomes (all chromosomes other than X and Y).</p><p>As well as shedding light on the mechanism by which dosage compensation occurs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the study by Kruesi et al. provides a valuable data set on transcription start sites in the worm, and puts forward a general strategy that could be used to map these sites in other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00808.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00808.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dosage compensation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>X-chromosome</kwd><kwd>transcription start site identification technology</kwd><kwd>X chromosome</kwd><kwd>autosome balance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM30702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruesi</surname><given-names>William S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM25232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lis</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG004845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lis</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>C. elegans</italic> equalizes the expression of X-chromosome genes between the sexes by reducing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters of X-linked genes in hermaphrodites, using a chromosome-restructuring complex called condensin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The essential, X-chromosome-wide regulatory process called dosage compensation ensures that males (XO or XY) and females (XX), from worms to humans, express equivalent levels of X-chromosome products despite their unequal dose of X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelbart and Kuroda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeon et al., 2012</xref>). The failure to dosage compensate is lethal. Dosage compensation strategies differ across species, but invariably a regulatory complex is targeted to the X chromosomes of one sex to modulate transcription along the entire X. The molecular mechanisms by which these complexes regulate gene expression remain elusive. Here we analyzed X-chromosome dosage compensation in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to determine the step of transcription controlled by its dosage compensation complex (DCC). The DCC binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to reduce transcription by half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>). Sequence-specific DNA binding sites recruit the DCC to X and facilitate its spreading along X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>). The DCC shares subunits with condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Csankovszki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mets and Meyer, 2009</xref>), a protein complex required for the compaction, resolution, and segregation of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that DCC-dependent changes in chromosome structure facilitate transcription regulation. In principle, the DCC could control any step of transcription: recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the gene promoter, initiation of transcription, escape of Pol II from the promoter or proximal pause sites, elongation of RNA transcripts, or termination of transcription.</p><p>To understand the mechanism of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> dosage compensation, we first developed a procedure to map the position, density, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged Pol II genome-wide in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and then devised a strategy to identify the transcription start sites (TSSs). Nascent RNA transcripts from approximately 70% of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genes undergo a rapid co-transcriptional processing event in which the 5′ end is replaced by a common 22-nucleotide leader RNA (SL1) through a trans-splicing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumenthal, 2012</xref>). Because trans-splicing removes information about Pol II initiation from nascent RNAs, TSSs have been difficult to identify from accumulated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morton and Blumenthal, 2011</xref>). The paucity of annotated promoters has made transcription regulation a challenge to study in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. By comparing the quantity, location, and direction of engaged Pol II from wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective embryos relative to TSSs, we determined the step of transcription controlled by the DCC.</p><p>Our work establishes a general strategy for TSS mapping in any organism and provides an invaluable TSS data set for dissecting <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> gene regulation. We show that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> equalizes X-chromosome-wide gene expression between the sexes by reducing Pol II recruitment to the promoters of X-linked genes in XX embryos via a mechanism that utilizes a chromosome-restructuring complex. We also show that a separate regulatory mechanism functions in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to elevate the intrinsic level of transcription from the X chromosomes of both sexes, so that after dosage compensation, X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes have equivalent expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide mapping of transcriptionally engaged Pol II and transcription start sites reveals promoters to be far upstream of mature mRNA 5′ ends</title><p>To map the distribution of transcriptionally engaged Pol II genome-wide, we performed global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) experiments using nuclei from three stages of wild-type animals (embryos, starved L1 larvae, and L3 larvae) and dosage-compensation-defective embryos.

They required that clusters of scRNA signal (labeled as ‘TICs’ and shown in red or blue) be within 200 bp of the WormBase (WB) start to be annotated as a new TSS. They then classified as enhancers (shown in yellow) the scRNA clusters that are not associated with a gene, have specific chromatin modifications not associated with promoters, and overlap with transcription factor binding sites. Shown is a panel from their Figure 6A (© Genome Research, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Our GRO-seq and GRO-cap (TAP+ minus TAP−) data from mixed-stage embryos are shown for the same genomic region upstream of the <italic>tol-1</italic> gene as in Figure 6A. Our data and their data are precisely aligned. In this example, spikes of GRO-cap signal correspond with TICs, and several GRO-cap spikes correspond to their newly annotated enhancers. Continuous ChIP-chip signal for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II (8WG16 antibody, modENCODE_3545) and continuous GRO-seq signal occur from the most upstream enhancer to the WB start. The GRO-seq signal increases in intensity as it passes GRO-cap spikes and TICs, suggesting that each transcription initiation event contributes to the cumulative Pol II signal, which stops increasing in intensity once it reaches the WB start.

Of particular importance to this study, GRO-cap permits analysis of RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing, which replaces true transcription start sites (TSSs) with trans-spliced leader RNAs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. GRO-seq run-ons have been tuned to extend the length of nascent RNAs by only 100 nucleotides on average, thus minimizing any possibility that independent transcription units might been artifactually linked. In GRO-cap, nuclei are isolated and RNA polymerases are allowed to transcribe briefly in a run-on reaction in the presence of Br-UTP, as in GRO-seq. RNA is isolated but the base-hydrolysis step of GRO-seq is omitted to increase the probability of capturing nascent RNA molecules with a 5′ 7-methyl-GTP cap. BrU-RNAs made during the run-on reaction are enriched by selection with anti-BrdU beads to ensure the identification of true TSSs from capped nascent RNAs rather than 5′ ends from RNAs that received post-transcriptional capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fejes-Toth et al., 2009</xref>). A 3′ RNA adapter (red) is ligated to the RNAs, followed by another round of bead enrichment. Selection against 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs that do not represent capped RNAs (and any carry-through 5′ RNA adapters) is achieved by sequential enzymatic treatment with Terminator exonuclease to degrade 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs and then alkaline phosphatase to remove 5′ phosphates from 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs resistant to the exonuclease. Half of the nuclear run-on (NRO) RNA pool is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP+) to remove the 5′ cap from the RNA, thereby exposing a 5′ mono-phosphate. The other half is left untreated (TAP−) to provide a control population of residual 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs that never had 5′ caps. The 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs are ligated to 5′ RNA adapters (blue). The TAP+ and TAP− samples are prepared for Illumina sequencing as in GRO-seq by reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and then amplification of DNA from 5′ and 3′ adapter regions. We note that transcripts &lt;500 bp are captured most efficiently on Illumina sequencing platforms. The enriched TSS regions are identified by mapping the 5′ ends of the sequence reads back to the genome and comparing the TAP+ and TAP− sites to eliminate false TSSs. Comparing the GRO-cap candidate TSSs to the 5′ ends of transcription units defined by GRO-seq permits reliable assignment of TSSs to transcription units.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00808.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00808.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00808-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>For genes that lack trans-splicing, the site of maximum GRO-cap signal was coincident with both the 5′-most GRO-seq signal and the WB-annotated start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that GRO-cap and GRO-seq together permit high-confidence mapping of TSSs.

Fully 59% of outrons are longer than 200 bp, 21% are longer than 1 kb, and 2.3% are longer than 5 kb (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A–C</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the GRO-seq signal between newly called TSSs and previously identified TSAs reflects legitimate outrons rather than independent overlapping upstream transcripts. First, 3′ UTRs or polyA signals are rare in outrons of &gt;1 kb in length, indicating the engaged Pol II is not from independent polyadenylated transcripts. From 565 such outrons, only 1.4% had an identified 3′ UTR in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jan et al.

Furthermore, only 3.5% had a polyA site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangone et al., 2010</xref>). Second, regions corresponding to long outrons have a continuous ChIP-chip signal from antibodies enriched for either the ser2 phosphorylated form of Pol II or the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A–C</xref>). These results and the restricted run-on length of ∼100 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2008</xref>) indicate that the GRO-seq signal corresponds to bound Pol II in vivo and is not an artifact of the nuclear run-on (NRO) reactions in vitro extending beyond the 3’ ends defined in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Third, a heat map of individual genes showing the GRO-cap signal relative to TSSs reveals that a dominant TSS contributes the majority of the vast GRO-cap signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

First and middle genes in an operon require two forms of co-transcriptional RNA processing at the 3′ end to generate monocistronic mRNAs, polyadenylation of the upstream gene, and trans-splicing of the downstream gene, while the terminal gene requires only polyadenylation at the 3′ end.

For tRNAs, expression values were calculated from the beginning of the ‘mature transcript’ to 50 bp downstream of the stop. Because tRNAs are highly repetitive and transcription of highly transcribed tRNAs continues downstream of the stop, the extra 50 bp was included to increase the unique mappability of each tRNA. For a gene to be considered for analysis, it had to have at least 25 bp of uniquely mappable DNA, and to have an average expression of at least 1 RPKM in both control RNAi and <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant embryos. The median and mean <italic>sdc-2</italic>/control expression levels show that X-linked microRNAs are more susceptible to dosage compensation than autosomal microRNAs.

First, re-analysis of our previous genome-wide ChIP-chip analysis of Pol II binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>) relative to the new TSSs showed an approximately twofold increase in the occupancy of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at the promoters of X-linked genes in <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant vs control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). DNA-bound hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at promoters is enriched for non-initiated Pol II. The increase in Pol II occupancy at promoters of mutants (measured by ChIP) was nearly equivalent to the increase in post-initiated Pol II (measured by GRO-seq), indicating that Pol II promoter recruitment is rate-limiting when dosage compensation is active.</p><p>Second, in <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutants, the levels of sense and upstream divergent transcription were elevated coordinately at promoters on X lacking upstream divergent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>). At those promoters, the level of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II was also elevated about twofold in mutant vs control embryos, as assayed by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Since we found increased Pol II occupancy in mutants and observed virtually no promoter-proximal pausing in control embryos, escape from pausing into productive elongation, or any other form of post-initiation regulation, cannot be the cause of elevated transcription at the divergent promoters in <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutants.

The answer to this question has been controversial, although evidence has mounted in favor of a mechanism to balance total expression between X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes based on measurements of accumulated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Disteche, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jue et al., 2013</xref>).

A major obstacle towards attaining this goal for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> had been the lack of properly annotated transcription start sites for the majority of its genes. We therefore initiated our studies by developing a general and efficient strategy to map TSSs for Pol II-regulated genes with nucleotide resolution. This method, called GRO-cap, utilized purified nascent transcripts from the NRO reactions developed for GRO-seq and employed redundant enzymatic steps to capture RNAs with 5′ caps. GRO-cap tracks RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing. This approach was critical for our analysis because co-transcriptional processing removes TSSs from the transcripts of most nematode genes, including protein-coding genes and small non-coding RNA genes.</p><p>We found TSSs for protein-coding genes to be unexpectedly far upstream from the 5′ ends of mature mRNAs. True TSSs were as far as 14 kb upstream of previously annotated 5′ ends (typically the trans-spliced acceptor sites), and 59% of TSSs were &gt;200 bp upstream and 21% &gt;1 kb upstream. GRO-cap was also effective at identifying TSSs for the majority of small processed RNAs, including microRNAs, tRNAs, snoRNAs, and 21 U-RNAs.</p><p>To determine the step of transcription controlled by the DCC, we compared the genome-wide distribution of transcriptionally engaged Pol II (from GRO-seq) relative to the newly defined TSSs (from GRO-cap) in wild-type vs dosage-compensation-defective XX embryos. We found 5′ promoter-proximal pausing to be rare, unlike in other metazoans, and not likely to be the target of dosage compensation. Instead, dosage compensation reduces recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes, thereby decreasing transcription from the two X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to the level of transcription from the single X chromosome of males. A separate regulatory mechanism elevates the intrinsic level of transcription from X chromosomes of both sexes so that after dosage compensation total expression from X chromosomes and autosomes is equivalent.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Advantages of GRO-cap</title><p>GRO-cap has advantages over TSS mapping strategies that use total accumulated RNA or short-capped (sc) RNA as the starting material. The use of nascent RNAs without base hydrolysis or size selection, as in GRO-cap, enriches the proportion of 5′ capped RNAs within the starting RNA population, reduces the level of false TSS calls from RNAs that are capped post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fejes-Toth et al., 2009</xref>), and increases the probability of identifying TSSs from promoters that are transcribed at low levels. Most importantly, the GRO-cap strategy permits reliable assignment of TSSs by pairing TSS calls with uninterrupted GRO-seq signal for transcriptionally engaged Pol II between the GRO-cap TSS and the previously annotated 5′ end. Multiple lines of evidence showed that GRO-cap signal combined with continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines true TSSs.</p><p>Two reports of nematode TSSs have recently been published. The first used two approaches to identify the transcription starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). The first, called CapSeq, used total accumulated RNA as the starting material for the enzymatic enrichment of RNAs with 5′ caps and set the cutoff for TSS calls to be within 1 kb upstream and 100 bp downstream from previously annotated 5′ ends. As a consequence, CapSeq did not identify TSSs for a large class of protein-coding genes. TSSs of small processed non-coding RNAs were also difficult to identify by CapSeq. The second approach, called CIP-TAP, used scRNAs and was equivalently effective as GRO-cap for identifying TSSs of small non-coding RNAs.</p><p>The second report also used scRNAs to map TSSs and set the cutoff for TSS calls to be no greater then 200 bp upstream of the previously annotated 5′ ends, thereby also not defining TSSs for a large class of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The authors found numerous clusters of Pol II initiation upstream of their calls and classified many of these initiation events as enhancer-like chromatin signatures based on overlap with bound transcription factors. Based on comparison with our data (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12A,B</xref>), we propose that a proportion of the upstream enhancer-like signatures are TSSs giving rise to full-length transcripts. Two clear examples of genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12B,C</xref>, where the single TSS (either 2534 bp or 2878 bp upstream of the WB start) called from GRO-cap and GRO-seq data was classified as an enhancer by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al.

However, in L1 larvae deprived of food, we found 5′ pausing at 7.7% of genes with TSS calls. A prior study using ChIP-seq discovered the accumulation of Pol II at promoters of starved larvae and proposed that 5′ promoter-proximal pausing was responsible for Pol II accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>). Our results confirm that interpretation. Two factors promote 5′ pausing in metazoans, negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), although the relative contribution of each is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> appears to lack NELF, suggesting either that DSIF is sufficient in the infrequent cases of pausing or that the core promoter complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>) or another not-yet identified negative elongation factor participates.</p><p>The 3′ accumulation of Pol II has been documented previously in flies and humans using GRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2012</xref>). We found 3′ Pol II accumulation to be more extensive in nematodes than flies. Pol II 3′ accumulation is likely caused by slow 3′ end formation and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gromak et al., 2006</xref>). Because <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has numerous polycistronic operons requiring extensive RNA processing to produce monocistronic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumenthal, 2012</xref>), we were able to discover a strong positive correlation between the amount of 3′ Pol II accumulation and the amount of RNA processing. Curiously, though, even genes that were not part of operons exhibited greater 3′ accumulation than genes in flies. This observation raises the question of whether RNA processing in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> is generally slower than that in other organisms to accommodate extensive trans-splicing, or whether <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> accommodates operons by imposing additional regulation on Pol II to enhance its 3′ pausing at all genes to assess whether to halt transcription or continue elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation controls RNA Pol II recruitment</title><p>Gene expression in metazoans is controlled by diverse regulatory mechanisms that function over widely different distances. Some mechanisms act locally on individual genes, while others such as dosage compensation function across large chromosomal territories or along entire chromosomes to regulate a large set of genes coordinately. In general, the step of transcription controlled by long-range mechanisms is not understood. In our study, multiple lines of evidence supported the conclusion that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> dosage compensation regulates gene expression along X primarily by reducing the recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes.</p><p>First, regulation of 5′ promoter-proximal pausing cannot be the mechanism underlying <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> dosage compensation. If the DCC reduced X-chromosome gene expression by increasing 5′ promoter-proximal pausing, numerous genes on X would be paused in wild-type embryos, and disruption of dosage compensation would reduce the level of pausing. GRO-seq experiments showed instead that 5′ promoter-proximal pausing is rare in wild-type XX embryos. The few genes that exhibited 5′ pausing were not enriched on X chromosomes relative to autosomes, and the level of pausing was not decreased in dosage-compensation defective mutants.</p><p>Second, Pol II-mediated transcription elongation is not preferentially affected by the DCC. The ratios of elongation density indices (average GRO-seq signal in last 75% of a gene/average GRO-seq signal in first 25% of a gene) calculated for genes on X chromosomes and autosomes in control vs dosage-compensation-defective embryos were not significantly different between X-linked and autosomal genes, indicating that Pol II-mediated transcription elongation is not selectively changed on X chromosomes of mutants.</p><p>Third, the level of transcriptionally engaged Pol II assayed genome-wide by GRO-seq in control vs dosage-compensation-defective XX embryos revealed a uniform increase in engaged Pol II across the entire length of X-chromosome genes, but not autosomal genes, in mutants. Hence, the DCC controls X-chromosome gene expression in XX animals by reducing either the recruitment or initiation of Pol II. This conclusion was validated both by metagene analysis and by analysis of hundreds of individual X-linked genes showing different levels of de-repression in dosage-compensation-defective mutants.</p><p>Fourth, genome-wide quantification of Pol II occupancy by ChIP plotted relative to the new TSSs showed an increase in the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II at promoters of dosage-compensation-defective embryos vs control embryos that was equivalent to the increase in post-initiated Pol II measured by GRO-seq. Since DNA-bound hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at promoters is enriched for non-initiated Pol II, these results indicate that Pol II promoter recruitment is rate limiting when dosage compensation is active.</p><p>Our combined experiments reveal that the primary mechanism by which the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> dosage compensation process reduces X-chromosome gene expression by half in XX embryos is to limit Pol II recruitment to promoters of X-linked genes. Our study does not eliminate the possibility of a minor repressive influence acting through another step of transcription or through a post-transcriptional mechanism such as RNA stability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DCC function</title><p>How might condensin reduce Pol II recruitment to the promoters of X-linked genes by approximately twofold? Our current and prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jans et al., 2009</xref>) studies showed that DCC binding to the promoter of a gene is neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit repression of the gene. Hence, the DCC influences gene expression over long distance, likely by imposing changes in higher-order chromosome structure. Clues to such a DCC function were suggested originally by the simultaneous discovery of the DCC and condensin’s biochemical properties in vitro as an ATPase that alters DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimura and Hirano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piazza et al., 2013</xref>) and its canonical roles in vivo of compacting and resolving mitotic and meiotic chromosomes for proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piazza et al., 2013</xref>). However, mechanisms of DCC function are perhaps best deduced from its non-canonical roles in vivo of regulating interphase chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>) and meiotic crossover recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mets and Meyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragon et al., 2013</xref>). Condensin II in <italic>Drosophila</italic> induces axial compaction of interphase chromosomes, globally disrupts inter-chromosomal interactions, and promotes dispersal of peri-centric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). These activities serve to compartmentalize the interphase nucleus into discrete chromosomal territories. Furthermore, nematodes carrying mutations that disrupt condensin I, which shares four subunits with the DCC, display elongated chromosomal axes during meiotic prophase and exhibit chromosome-wide changes in the distribution of double strand breaks and crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mets and Meyer, 2009</xref>), providing strong evidence that DCC subunits control intra-chromosomal structure.</p><p>These cytological, biochemical, and genetic observations of condensin function suggest that chromosome structure might affect Pol II recruitment in several ways, which are not mutually exclusive. Chromosome compaction and associated topological changes in DNA could broadly affect promoter accessibility of Pol II and the regulatory factors that recruit or stabilize it, thereby reducing Pol II recruitment in a quantitatively similar manner at different sites. Compaction of interphase chromosomal territories could reduce the local concentration of bound transcription activators and hence bound Pol II. Changes in intra-chromosomal interactions could alter the relationships between distal regulatory regions and their target promoters, thereby limiting Pol II recruitment. These and other models are topics of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Dosage compensation mechanisms differ between nematodes and flies</title><p>Dosage compensation strategies differ across species.

A central question is whether the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse forms of chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation are the same or different.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, dosage compensation is achieved by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex that binds along the single X chromosome of males to double transcription of X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelbart and Kuroda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>). The complex contains two long non-coding RNAs and five proteins, including the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase MOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilfiker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2012a</xref>) and the H2BK34 ubiquitin ligase MSL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). The MSL complex was proposed to regulate gene expression by controlling transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). This model was subsequently supported by genome-wide mapping of MSL proteins and MSL-dependent H4K16ac to the bodies of male X-linked genes, with a bias toward 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilfillan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Legube et al., 2006</xref>), and GRO-seq experiments in S2 cells with or without RNAi of the <italic>msl2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larschan et al., 2011</xref>). While a recent study analyzing genome-wide Pol II occupancy in males and females by ChIP-seq experiments suggested an alternative view that fly dosage compensation operates at the level of Pol II recruitment or initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conrad et al., 2012b</xref>), a mathematical computation error discovered in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Straub and Becker, 2013</xref>) rendered the results insufficient to distinguish between the competing models. The elongation model received recent further support from the discovery that dosage compensation is disrupted by impairing the function of SPT5, a transcription elongation factor that co-localizes with the MSL complex on male X chromosomes and interacts physically with the MSL complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prabhakaran and Kelley, 2012</xref>). Thus, the weight of evidence strongly favors enhancement of transcription elongation as the primary mechanism of fly dosage compensation.</p><p>Not only does the overall dosage compensation strategy differ between worms and flies, the underlying molecular mechanism appears to differ as well. In worms, reduction in X-chromosome gene expression is primarily achieved by reducing recruitment of Pol II to promoters, while in flies, elevation in X-chromosome gene expression is primarily achieved by facilitating Pol II transcription elongation.

X-chromosome dosage compensation strategies such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> strategy solved both problems by doubling transcription of the single male X chromosome. An alternative solution would be to co-evolve two mechanisms, one to increase expression of X chromosomes in both sexes, thereby preventing hypo X expression in males, and a second to decrease total expression from female X chromosomes to prevent hyper X expression relative to female autosomes and male X chromosomes. Nematodes and mammals evolved the second strategy for equalizing X-chromosome expression between the sexes. It has been controversial whether these organisms also evolved a strategy to elevate X expression in both sexes and thereby balance expression between X chromosomes and autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Disteche, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jue et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The bulk of evidence now favors the presence of a mechanism to up-regulate X-chromosome expression in males and females of both organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jue et al., 2013</xref>), and our results provide the most compelling evidence to date for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans.</italic> Our approach of examining nascent transcripts in mixed-stage embryos by GRO-seq conferred three advantages.

Reads were required to have passed the CASAVA 1.8 quality filtering to be considered further. To remove reads containing the RT-PCR adapter, we used cutadapt version 0.9.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/">http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/</ext-link>) with the following command (cutadapt -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG -a AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -z -O 15 -e .1 --minimum-length=30). The remaining reads were trimmed to 30 bp in length and aligned uniquely to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> WS230 genome using bowtie’s default settings (version 0.12.7), which permit two mismatches in the first 28 bp.</p><p>Because the 5’ base in each read most closely identifies the location of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase prior to the run-on, we created pile-ups using only the first base of each read. For GRO-seq, the pile-up of reads mapping to both strands was normalized by the number of millions of reads that mapped uniquely to the genome and was multiplied by 1000 to obtain RPKM (reads per kilobase per million). For GRO-cap, reads were normalized by the same method but were not multiplied by 1000, hence RPM (reads per million). As expected, the GRO-cap signal is enriched at TSSs compared to the GRO-seq signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Evaluation of GRO-seq normalization</title><p>Further analysis of our GRO-seq data using an alternative normalization strategy confirmed that X-linked genes are increased in expression, and autosomal genes are decreased in expression in the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant. This new analysis evaluated the original normalization strategy. Because expression of genes on the X chromosome is elevated in <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutants, it is difficult to determine whether the autosomes are changed in expression in the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant. The proportion of autosomal reads relative to total reads per experiment is lower in the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant (75.9%) than in the control RNAi (85.7%). To normalize the autosomal expression between the two conditions, we divided the average expression of all genes in the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant by the scaling factor of this difference (75.9%/84.715% = 0.885). We then investigated changes in the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant compared to the control for our most inclusive gene set: WB WS230 genes that are &gt;250 bp in length (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). With this alternative normalization, the median <italic>sdc-2</italic>/control gene expression ratios increase for both X (1.67 becomes 1.88) and autosomes (0.81 becomes 0.91). This procedure changed the proportion of X-linked genes that are more highly expressed in the mutant (genes increased in expression by 1.5-fold or greater) from 64.9% to 78.4%. The original normalization showed that fewer autosomal genes increase by 1.5-fold than decrease by 1.5-fold (5.2% compared to 26.7%, respectively), and the alternative normalization shows the same trend (8.4% compared to 16.5%). Therefore, the same conclusions about X and autosomal gene expression can be made with either normalization strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Creation of the unique mappability track</title><p>We computationally identified all 30mers in the WS230 genome.

We calculated TSSs in wild-type embryos, starved L1s, L3s, and <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant embryos independently. To do this, we utilized both our GRO-cap and GRO-seq data with the assumption that a true TSS would be supported by a continuous GRO-seq signal extending upstream from the WB start to the newly annotated TSS. To correct for background noise in the TAP+ GRO-cap signal, we subtracted the TAP− control GRO-cap signal from the TAP+ GRO-cap signal. The Z-score was calculated at each position on a chromosome using the standard deviation and mean calculated for that individual chromosome, ignoring the top 0.005% of scores as outliers. Removing these outliers was required so that the locations with the strongest GRO-seq signal did not markedly affect the standard deviation and Z-score. To prevent biasing TSS calls to only those genes in which transcription began at only one base pair, we averaged the Z-score data in a 10 bp moving window with a 1 bp step.</p><p>Because the true location of most TSSs are unknown, we searched for TSSs of protein coding genes in a window that began 250 bp downstream of the WB WS230 start and continued upstream until the beginning of the closest transcript (protein coding, microRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, tRNA, or rRNA) on the opposite strand or until 100 bp away from the end of the closest gene on the same strand. If the TSS of a gene was contained within the transcript of another gene or had another protein coding gene within it on the same strand, we did not consider it. This reduced our possible gene list from 20,516 genes to 20,008 genes. Within these genes, we searched for the highest 10 bp Z-score average in the upstream window and concurrently calculated GRO-seq signal across a 200 bp sliding window with a 1 bp step. If the average GRO-seq signal dropped below 1 RPKM, we did not proceed further upstream to identify a TSS. This step was necessary to eliminate TSS calls that were clearly not supported by GRO-seq data. After identifying the highest 10 bp Z-score average, we mapped the highest 1 bp Z-score within the 10 bp window to be called as the TSS position.</p><p>To determine both the correct 10 bp Z-score average to use as a cutoff for calling TSSs and the effectiveness of the script at calling TSSs, we visually inspected all TSS calls across the X chromosome and determined whether the GRO-cap and GRO-seq signal supported the call. For each stage, we selected a Z-score cutoff for which &gt;90% of TSS calls were verified by visual inspection (wild-type embryo &gt;4.5, <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant embryo &gt;4.725, wild-type starved L1 &gt;4.764, wild-type L3 &gt;5.01). To confirm these cutoffs held true across the genome, a random set of 250 autosomal genes with a 10 bp Z-score average greater than the 90th percentile was investigated visually for the wild-type embryo data set. These genes had &gt;90% agreement for TSS calls, confirming that the same cutoffs could be used for genes on both the X and autosomes. For TSS calls that differed by more than 2 kb upstream from the WB start, we inspected each gene visually to eliminate any TSS calls due to such complications as unannotated transcripts. In addition, for all genes that had an overlapping gene on the opposite strand, we verified each TSS visually. If no TSS had been called, but one could be identified visually with ease, we annotated the TSS. In a few cases, visual inspection allowed us to find a TSS significantly downstream of the WB-annotated start. The criteria used to accept the downstream TSS included a strong GRO-cap signal, no GRO-seq signal upstream of the GRO-cap signal, and no contradicting GRO-cap signal in any worm stage.</p><p>In total, we identified a TSS in at least one developmental stage for 31.7% (6353 genes) of all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> protein coding genes. Not all TSS calls could be made from each stage. We called TSSs for 4246 genes in wild-type embryos, 2443 genes in wild-type starved L1, 4513 genes in wild-type L3, and 2809 genes in DCC mutant embryos. Of these calls, 875 were unique to wild-type embryos, 290 to wild-type starved L1, 1039 to wild-type L3, and 149 to DCC mutant embryos.</p><p>For many analyses, GRO-seq signal and GRO-cap signal were only analyzed across genes for which a TSS had been identified in that stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5 fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 5–7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). For other analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the genes had to have a TSS call from each of the three wild-type stages, and the distances between TSSs among the different stages could not exceed 100 bp. The TSS position was used from the stage that had the highest 10 bp Z-score. For dosage compensation comparisons, a total of 4547 TSS calls was used (4246 TSS calls from wild-type embryos and the 301 TSS calls from <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant embryos not in the wild-type embryos).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Non-coding RNAs</title><p>Upon obtaining GRO-seq and GRO-cap data, we found that the WB gene models (WS225 models with their coordinates converted to WS230) for many small RNAs, including microRNAs and snoRNAs, lack properly annotated TSSs.

We utilized the protein coding gene strategy outlined above to identify likely TSS positions for these ncRNAs. As relatively few of these small ncRNAs exist in the genome, we examined the predicted TSS of each ncRNA gene visually to confirm or deny the computational TSS or to call a TSS.

There is little overlap between our set of genes paused during L1 arrest and those reported to have 5′ accumulation of Pol II.

We calculated the average GRO-seq signal across the last 75% of the gene and divided it by the average GRO-seq signal across the first 25% of the gene, excluding the first and last 500 bp of the gene from this calculation. To ensure that we averaged the GRO-seq signal over a sufficiently large number of bases, we required that genes be ≥2 kb in length. To avoid outlier ratios that can result from a low number of reads, genes with an average RPKM &lt;1 in the first 500 bp, or the first 25% or last 75% of the remaining gene were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the possibility that the elongation density index was influenced by the 3′ accumulation of Pol II of an upstream gene, we required that genes lack another gene on the same strand within 1 kb of the TSS. We analyzed 481 X-linked genes and 1861 autosomal genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Creating metagene profiles</title><p>To compare GRO-seq signal across genes, we scaled genes to be the same length, allowing us to average the GRO-seq signal across them. To avoid small genes that could affect the sensitivity of our analyses, we required that genes be ≥1.5 kb in length. These genes were scaled to the same length as follows: the 5′ end (1000 bp upstream to 500 bp downstream of the TSS) and the 3′ end (500 bp upstream to 1000 bp downstream of the WB stop site) were not scaled, and the remainder of the gene was scaled to a length of 2 kb. We predicted that leaving the ends of the gene unscaled might allow us to better identify any effects that occurred at the ends of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Calculation of average GRO-seq signal</title><p>To investigate GRO-seq trends surrounding the TSS or across scaled metagenes, we plotted the average GRO-seq signal across these regions of interest. To do so, we totaled the strand-specific GRO-seq signal for every gene in the gene list at each base pair in the region. We then divided the total GRO-seq signal at each base pair by the number of genes that are uniquely mappable at that base pair. We then took a 25 bp moving window average of this average GRO-seq signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Heat maps</title><p>We used the <italic>Python</italic> package matplotlib to produce heat maps showing the GRO-seq expression of the TSSs of all genes, and the difference in expression between DCC mutant and control RNAi embryos. To show the GRO-seq signal at either the empirically determined TSS or WB start, the signal from each gene with a TSS call was plotted, one gene per row, and the GRO-seq signal was averaged across 15 bp windows. Genes were ordered from top to bottom with increasing distance between the WB start and the TSS called from GRO-cap. To show expression changes in the DCC mutant, we scaled each gene ≥1.5 kb to the same length as described above. We then totaled the GRO-seq signal from the DCC mutant embryos and separately from control RNAi embryos across 100 bp windows and calculated an average. The log<sub>2</sub> of the ratio was plotted for every 100 bp bin across the length of the metagene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Calculation of upstream divergent transcription</title><p>To calculate the relative level of upstream divergent transcription for each gene, we determined the maximum sense and antisense transcription in a 150 bp window within 500 bp of the TSS. Upstream divergent transcript data from Human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Core et al., 2012</xref>). We used R to plot kernel density estimations of the log<sub>2</sub> (sense/antisense) ratio for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, Human, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To determine how far upstream the closest upstream divergent gene was to each TSS, we searched for the closest transcript (protein coding, non-coding RNA, tRNA, or rRNA) upstream and antisense to the TSS. Prior to the search, the 6353 protein coding genes with new TSS calls were re-annotated with the most upstream TSS identified. To determine the upstream distance between the TSS and the start of upstream divergent transcription, we searched 500 bp upstream of the TSS to identify the position with the highest level of GRO-cap TAP+ minus the TAP− signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>DCC ChIP-seq</title><p>Wild-type N2 animals were grown on NG agar plates with HB101 bacteria. Mixed-stage embryos were harvested from gravid hermaphrodites, and cross-linked with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min. Cross-linked embryos were resuspended in 3 ml of FA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail) for every 1 g of embryos. This mixture was frozen on liquid nitrogen, then ground under liquid nitrogen by mortar and pestle. Chromatin was sheared by the Covaris S2 sonicator (20% duty factor, power level 8, 200 cycles per burst) for a total of 30 min processing time (60 s ON, 45 s OFF, 30 cycles).</p><p>To perform the ChIP reactions, extract containing approximately 2 mg of protein was incubated in a microfuge tube with 6.6 μg of anti-DPY-27 or random IgG antibodies overnight at 4°C. A 25 μl bed volume of protein A Sepharose beads was added to the ChIP for 2 hr. ChIPs were washed for 5 min at room temperature twice with FA buffer (150 mM NaCl), once with FA buffer (1 M NaCl), once with FA buffer (500 mM NaCl), once with TEL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and twice with TE buffer. Protein and DNA were eluted twice with 1% SDS, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA at 65°C for 15 min. After elution, sequencing libraries were prepared as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>) with minor changes: sequencing adapters were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefrancois et al., 2009</xref>) and adapters were ligated using the NEB Quick Ligation Kit (M2200).</p><p>Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GA2 platform. After barcode removal, 32 bp reads were aligned uniquely to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> WS190 genome using bowtie. MACS (version 1.4) was used to call peaks and create pileups with DPY-27 ChIP as the treatment and random IgG ChIP as the control. To account for read depth, the ChIP signal was normalized to the total number of millions of reads that uniquely aligned to the genome. To correct for non-specific binding, the IgG signal was subtracted from the DPY-27 signal. The resulting ChIP-seq signal from two biological replicates was averaged at each base pair genome-wide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Re-analysis of RNA polymerase II ChIP-chip</title><p>Raw RNA Pol II ChIP-chip data from experiments using 8WG16 antibody (raised against the hypo-phosphorylated Pol II C-terminal domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>) was obtained from GEO (accession numbers GSM634580 and GSM634582). The ChIP signal was normalized to the GC content of individual probes using MA2C (Song et al., 2007). The average ChIP-chip signal surrounding the TSS was calculated using the sitepro script within the CEAS package version 1.0.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/CEAS">http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/CEAS</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>DNA motif searches</title><p>To determine whether <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genes contain known core promoter motifs such as the TATA-box and Initiator element (Inr), we performed motif searches using MEME (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.ebi.edu.au/meme/intro.html">http://meme.ebi.edu.au/meme/intro.html</ext-link>). To identify a worm TATA-box, we searched for strand-specific motifs within a region 15–45 bp upstream of the TSS. To identify a worm Inr, we searched for strand-specific motifs within 10 bp of the TSS in either direction. These searches identified a TATA consensus of TATAWAWR, compared to TATAWAWR for yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>), and an Inr consensus of YCAYTY, compared to YYANWYY in humans and TCAYTY in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</xref>). To determine where these motifs lie, we calculated their distance from the TSS. For TATA, we calculated how far upstream the most 5′ base lies. For the Inr, we calculated how far the adenine lies from the TSS. In other organisms the adenine has been shown to be the +1 nucleotide in transcription; the location of the worm Inr relative to the TSS suggests that this is true in <italic>C</italic>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study describes the development of a new technique for mapping nascent TSS;GRO-cap. This powerful new technique has been applied to two aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcriptional regulation: mapping the nascent TSS of outrons and transcriptional regulation of X-chromosome inactivation. Both of these applications are important and publishable. However the first application needs further work/clarification.</p><p>1) Our main concern is the authors’ claim that a combination of GRO-seq and GRO-cap allows unequivocal assignment of new upstream TSS for <italic>C. elegans</italic> outrons (5’ end of mature mRNA is formed by SL1 trans-splicing and so doesn’t define gene TSS). For example, in the Discussion section, the authors state that they assign upstream TSS “by requiring that TSS calls be supported by uninterrupted GRO-seq signal for transcriptionally engaged Pol II between the GRO-cap TSS and the previously annotated 5’ end”. GRO-seq shows the presence of active polymerases, and hence, uninterrupted signal does not rule out the possibility of signal arising from multiple, partially overlapping transcripts. For example, if two tandem transcriptional units were located in close proximity, GRO-seq signal could appear continuous (especially as run-on can proceed after the TTS). This could explain the differences with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al (2013)</xref> data, which proposes that separate transcription units may exist upstream of outrons that could be enhancer derived transcripts (eRNAs).</p><p>Since this is a key issue we recommend further analysis on this point. To distinguish between these two possibilities, it would be necessary to analyse secondary promoters detected by GRO-cap and confirm that there are no 3’ ends at these positions (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20522740">20522740</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085120">21085120</ext-link>) that would break these very long outrons into two independent units.</p><p>Specific comments related to point 1: A) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, one can observe a secondary TSS in the position of the annotated WB start, in addition to the one described by the authors. Specifically, in the right panel (where the reads are centered on the GRO-cap determined TSS), a clear white line moving towards the right is apparent. To be able to appreciate how important this secondary TSS (located in the WB defined position) is with respect to the new ones defined by the authors, it would be useful make the same plot but using the GRO-cap data.</p><p>B) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1–figure supplement 11</xref>: the fact that GRO-seq signal increases as it passes GRO-cap spikes does not prove that they are continuous transcripts with different 5’ UTRs. Partially overlapping tandem eRNA with lower expression level than the main transcript could produce the same pattern.</p><p>C) It seems to us that there is one limitation for the GRO-cap method that the authors did not discuss. Only elongating polymerases in the proximity of the TSS (e.g., &lt;500bp?) will have a nascent RNA short enough to produce a sequencing library compatible with Illumina technology. Although that does not alter the discussed results in this case, this limitation should be stated for future users of the technique.</p><p>2) A way to further strengthen the argument that authentic TSS of outrons in many cases is distant to the mature mRNA 5’ end would be ChIP based analysis using Pol II CTD ser5 and ser2 specific antibodies. Thus could be performed on a few selected transcription units with amplicons covering the outron and 5’ half of the coding region.</p><p>3) Regarding the accumulation of Pol II at the 3’ end of genes. The authors suggest that extensive pausing at the 3’ end of genes may be linked to trans-splicing. In this context, it would be beneficial if the “not in operon genes” in the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> were further subdivided into monocistronic trans-spliced genes and non-trans-sliced genes. It would be interesting to see if non-trans-spliced genes also show Pol II accumulation at the 3’ end. In addition they should comment on the possibility that the high U content in the intergenic regions within operons (ur element that direct trans-splicing) and perhaps also at the 3’ end of genes could create a partial bias during GRO-seq and so skew the results for these regions.</p><p>4) The effect of <italic>scd2</italic> mutant on dosage compensation and consequent effects on transcription uncovers that dosage compensation also affects small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs). Are there more miRNA affected by dosage compensation? What do they have in common? Do they regulate a group of genes with similar function?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00808.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Our main concern is the authors’ claim that a combination of GRO-seq and GRO-cap allows unequivocal assignment of new upstream TSS for C. elegans outrons (5’ end of mature mRNA is formed by SL1 trans-splicing and so doesn’t define gene TSS).

Although that does not alter the discussed results in this case, this limitation should be stated for future users of the technique</italic>.</p><p>The main concern of the reviewers was our claim that the combination of GRO-cap and GRO-seq permits accurate assignment of new upstream TSSs for <italic>C. elegans</italic> outrons. The reviewers were specifically concerned with our procedure of “requiring that TSS calls be supported by uninterrupted GRO-seq signal for engaged Pol II between the GRO-cap TSS and the previously annotated 5’ end.” They felt that GRO-seq shows the presence of active polymerases and therefore uninterrupted signal does not rule out the possibility of signal arising from multiple, partially overlapping transcripts. The example given was that “if two tandem transcription units were located in close proximity, GRO-seq signal could appear continuous (especially as run-on can proceed after the TTS.” They felt that such overlapping transcripts could explain the difference between our work and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al. (2013)</xref>, which proposes that separate transcription units may exist upstream of outrons and could be enhancer derived transcripts. The reviewers asked for further analysis to distinguish between these possibilities. The first request was to analyze the outron regions for 3’ ends as defined in two separate studies, Jan et al., 2011 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangone et al., 2010</xref>.</p><p>We performed this analysis and found 3’ UTRs and polyA signals to be rare in outrons of greater than 1 kb in length. From 565 such outrons, only 1.4% had an identified 3’ UTR in the Jan et al. (2011) study, and 0.7% had a 3’ UTR in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangone et al. (2010)</xref> study. Furthermore, only 3.5% had a polyA site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangone et al., 2010</xref>). This analysis strongly supports the view that the engaged Pol II signal is not from independent transcription units. Furthermore, in the long outrons, we failed to find the typical GRO-seq signature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> 3' ends: a spike of high Pol II accumulation at the 3’ cleavage and polyadenylation site.</p><p>Relevant to this first concern, the reviewers commented that in the heat maps of the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), they saw a clear white line moving towards the right and interpreted it as secondary TSSs. The reviewers asked that we plot GRO-cap signal relative to our called TSSs to see whether we could find secondary TSSs.</p><p>The idea of the plot was helpful and the plot itself was revealing. The heat map of individual genes displaying GRO-cap signal relative to TSSs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) showed that a dominant TSS contributes the majority of the vast GRO-cap signal and thereby supports our claim about the correct identification of TSSs. In addition, we have an alternative interpretation of the light line. It reflects reduced GRO-seq signal caused by trans-splicing near the Wormbase start sites (the sites for the trans-splice acceptor site).</p><p>When we first submitted our paper for review, the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al. (2013)</xref> were not available for comparison. For that reason we could only comment on their enhancers for the single gene shown in one of their figures (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1–figure supplement 11</xref>). We found strong overlap between the regions they called enhancers and our TSS calls. That gene was particularly complex for such a comparison because it appears by our analysis to have multiple, alternative TSSs. The interpretation of multiple TSSs rather than independent upstream transcription units has subsequently been supported by finding no evidence of 3’ UTRs or polyA sites from the data of Jan et al. (2011) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangone et al (2010)</xref>, and continuous ChIP signal for the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1–figure supplement 12A</xref>).</p><p>Since the Chen et al. data became available, we found other specific genes to compare. Particularly informative are genes for which Chen et al. call a single upstream enhancer and we called a single strong TSS at exactly the same position as the enhancer. An example is in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1–figure supplement 12B</xref>. It shows a gene with a single called TSS (2534 bp upstream of WB start) that corresponds with the single called enhancer. Continuous ChIP signal of hyper-phosphorylated Pol II was found between the TSS and the WB start, and no 3’ UTRs or polyA signals were found. This and other similar examples strongly support the view that (1) some regions called enhancers by Chen et al. are actual TSSs and (2) GRO-cap signal paired with continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines authentic TSSs. That said, many of the enhancers they mapped do not correspond to outron TSSs, and we are not dismissing the general enhancer mapping performed by Chen et al. A relevant example illustrating this point is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1–figure supplement 12C</xref>, which shows a strong TSS overlapping one of the two called enhancers. On balance, though, we do think the enhancer mapping of Chen et al. needs to be corrected in light of our TSS mapping. The revised text now reflects a more balanced assessment of the Chen et al. analysis as it relates to our TSS mapping based on the newly available data.</p><p><italic>2) A way to further strengthen the argument that authentic TSS of outrons in many cases is distant to the mature mRNA 5’ end would be ChIP based analysis using Pol II CTD ser5 and ser2 specific antibodies. Thus could be performed on a few selected transcription units with amplicons covering the outron and 5’ half of the coding region</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this point by reanalyzing ChIP data from our prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>) and those of modENCODE. In general, we found that regions corresponding to long outrons have continuous ChIP-chip signal from antibodies enriched for either the ser2 phosphorylated form of Pol II or the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1–figure supplement 8A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results and the restricted run-on length of ∼100 nucleotides that is typical of GRO-seq reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2008</xref>) indicate that GRO-seq signal corresponds to bound Pol II in vivo and is not an artifact of the nuclear run-on reactions in vitro extending beyond the 3’ ends defined in vivo<italic>.</italic> We now emphasize in the protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that GRO-seq run-ons have been tuned to only extend the length of nascent RNAs by 100 bases on average, thus minimizing the concern that independent transcription units have been artifactually linked.</p><p>In summary, our paper now provides multiple lines of evidence showing that the GRO-seq signal between newly called TSSs and previously identified TASs represents legitimate outrons rather than independent overlapping upstream transcripts.</p><p>A final issue raised by reviewers about our GRO-cap method is the following: ”It seems to us that there is one limitation for the GRO-cap method that the authors did not discuss. Only elongating polymerases in the proximity of the TSS (e.g., &lt;500bp?) will have a nascent RNA short enough to produce a sequencing library compatible with Illumina technology. Although that does not alter the discussed results in this case, this limitation should be stated for future users of the technique.”</p><p>We responded to this request by adding the following comment to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which describes the protocol in detail: “We note that transcripts &lt; 500 bp are captured most efficiently on Illumina sequencing platforms.”</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the accumulation of Pol II at the 3’ end of genes. The authors suggest that extensive pausing at the 3’ end of genes may be linked to trans-splicing. In this context, it would be beneficial if the “not in operon genes” in the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> were further subdivided into monocistronic trans-spliced genes and non-trans-sliced genes. It would be interesting to see if non-trans-spliced genes also show Pol II accumulation at the 3’ end. In addition they should comment on the possibility that the high U content in the intergenic regions within operons (ur element that direct trans-splicing) and perhaps also at the 3’ end of genes could create a partial bias during GRO-seq and so skew the results for these regions</italic>.</p><p>The third request made by the reviewers relates to the accumulation of Pol II at the 3' end of genes. In response to the reviewers, we analyzed 3’ Pol II accumulation in monocistronic genes with and without trans-splicing and presented the results in the text and in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A</xref>. We found that first and middle genes in operons had the highest 3’-pausing ratio. Monocistronic genes with trans-splicing had a slightly higher 3’-pausing ratio than terminal genes in operons. Monocistronic genes with trans-splicing had a higher 3’-pausing ratio than monocistronic genes lacking trans-splicing (Mann-Whitney-U p&lt;e-10). The 3’-pausing ratios for genes in all classes were greater than for Drosophila genes. These results further support our proposal that pausing at 3’ ends is linked to trans-splicing.</p><p>Regarding the relationship between U content and 3’ end pausing, we found that Pol II accumulation at 3’ ends does not overlap with U-rich regions at 3’ ends. Therefore, the high GRO-seq signal is not due to selective enrichment of U-rich RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The effect of</italic> scd2 <italic>mutant on dosage compensation and consequent effects on transcription uncovers that dosage compensation also affects small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs). Are there more miRNA affected by dosage compensation? What do they have in common? Do they regulate a group of genes with similar function</italic>?</p><p>The fourth request from the reviewers concerned the effect of the <italic>sdc-2</italic> dosage compensation mutation on the expression of X-linked microRNAs. We found most embryonically expressed X-linked microRNAs to be dosage compensated. The targets of these microRNAs have not been determined experimentally and the predicted targets do not represent groups of genes with similar functions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
