We report that HTT forms a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) complex with RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), ataxin-3, the DNA repair enzyme polynucleotide-kinase-3'-phosphatase (PNKP), and cyclic AMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein (CBP). This complex senses and facilitates DNA damage repair during transcriptional elongation, but its functional integrity is impaired by mutant HTT. Abrogated PNKP activity results in persistent DNA break accumulation, preferentially in actively transcribed genes, and aberrant activation of DNA damage-response ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling in HD transgenic mouse and cell models. A concomitant decrease in Ataxin-3 activity facilitates CBP ubiquitination and degradation, adversely impacting transcription and DNA repair. Increasing PNKP activity in mutant cells improves genome integrity and cell survival. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism of how mutant HTT activates DNA damage-response pro-degenerative pathways and impairs transcription, triggering neurotoxicity and functional decline in HD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42988.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our DNA encodes the instructions to make proteins, which then go on to perform many crucial roles in the cell. Breakages and damage to DNA occur over time, and if uncorrected, they can make the instructions illegible or incorrect. A build-up of damages can be harmful â for example, DNA damage from excessive UV light exposure can cause skin cancer. Luckily, cells contain DNA repair complexes, protein machines that surveil DNA and correct errors or breakages.</p><p>An accumulation of DNA breakages is thought to contribute to the development of Huntingtonâs disease, a devastating and currently incurable condition where brain cells slowly die. The immediate cause of Huntingtonâs disease is well known: Huntingtonâs patients have an abnormal, mutant version of a protein called huntingtin. However, it is still unclear how the mutant huntingtin causes the symptoms of the disease and participates in cell death.</p><p>Gao et al. carefully studied the proteins that huntingtin physically interacts with. The experiments revealed that huntingtin is part of a newly identified DNA repair complex that fixes breakages in DNA as the molecule is âreadâ by the cell. The presence of the normal huntingtin protein promoted DNA repair. However, when the healthy huntingtin was replaced with the mutant version found in Huntingtonâs disease, the activity of the DNA repair complex was greatly reduced. This resulted in a build-up of DNA errors, triggering a series of events that ultimately led to cell death. In addition, in mice engineered to produce the mutant version of huntingtin, the accumulation of DNA damage was particularly important in two brain regions that are severely damaged in patients with Huntingtonâs disease.</p><p>There is currently no effective treatment for Huntingtonâs disease. However, understanding how the mutant huntingtin damages brain cells may provide new targets for future therapies. More broadly, several other brain disorders share similarities with Huntingtonâs disease, and it remains to be seen whether the same mechanisms could be at work in all these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Huntington's disease</kwd><kwd>polyglutamine</kwd><kwd>Transcription-Coupled DNA Repair</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>DNA

neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in exon 1 of the <italic>HTT</italic> gene that is translated into polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences in the huntingtin (HTT) protein which leads to progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor functions (The Huntingtonâs DiseaseÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MACDONALD, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998</xref>]). The polyQ expansion in the mHTT protein leads to progressive degeneration most overly affecting Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing striatal neurons and glutamatergic cortical neurons, although neuronal dysfunction and tissue atrophy in other brain regions is also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>). Altered conformation of the mutant protein is reported to reduce normal function of the protein as well as facilitate aberrant protein-protein interactions or subcellular localization, leading to neurotoxicity. Among the numerous molecular interactions and signaling pathways implicated in HD pathomechanism, transcriptional dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jimenez-Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valor, 2015</xref>), mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shirendeb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siddiqui et al., 2012</xref>), DNA strand break accumulation, and atypical ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) pathway activation, involved in the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giuliano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Illuzzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xh et al., 2014</xref>), have emerged as key players in HD-related neuronal dysfunction. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of ATM activity to ameliorate the consequence of aberrant ATM activation decreased neurotoxicity in HD animal models and HD induced pluripotent stem cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xh et al., 2014</xref>), supporting the emerging view that inappropriate and chronic DNA damage-response (DDR) pathway activation is a critical contributor to HD pathogenesis. Although, recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies and genetic data from other sources suggest that DNA damage and repair pathways are central to the pathogenesis of HD and other diseases associated with CAG repeat expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettencourt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), the perplexing questions that remain to be elucidated include how polyQ expansion induces DNA strand breaks, activates the DDR pathway, and disrupts transcription. It is also unclear whether transcriptional dysregulation and atypical ATM activation are mechanistically interconnected. We recently reported that the wild-type (wt) form of the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin-3 (wtATXN3) enhances the activity of polynucleotide kinase-3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional DNA repair enzyme with both 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase activities that processes unligatable DNA ends to maintain genome integrity and promote neuronal survival. In contrast, mutant ATXN3 (mATXN3) abrogates PNKP activity to induce DNA strand breaks and activate the DDR-ATMâp53 pathway, as observed in spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we recently reported that PNKP plays a key role in transcription-coupled base excision repair (TC-BER) and transcription-coupled double strand break repair (TC-DSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here our data demonstrate that wtHTT is a part of a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) complex formed by RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), basic transcription factors, PNKP, ATXN3, DNA ligase 3 (LIG 3), cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein (CBP, histone acetyltransferase), and this complex identifies lesions in the template DNA strand and mediates their repair during transcriptional elongation. The polyQ expansion in mHTT impairs PNKP and ATXN3 activities, disrupting the functional integrity of the TCR complex to adversely impact both transcription and DNA repair. Low PNKP activity leads to persistent accumulation of DNA lesions, predominantly in actively transcribing genes, resulting in unusual activation of the ATM-dependent p53 signaling pathway. Increased PNKP activity in mutant cells improved cell survival by substantially reducing DNA strand breaks and restricting ATMâp53 pathway activation. Likewise, low ATXN3 activity increases CBP ubiquitination and degradation thereby negatively influencing CREB-dependent transcription. These findings provide important mechanistic insights that could explain how mHTT may trigger neurotoxicity in HD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HTT is part of a TCR complex</title><p>Both wtHTT and mHTT interact with transcription factors and co-activators including CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCampbell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nucifora et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steffan et al., 2000</xref>), TATA-binding protein (TBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 1998</xref>), p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steffan et al., 2000</xref>), the general transcription factors TFIID and TFIIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhai et al., 2005</xref>), and specificity protein 1 (Sp1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunah et al., 2002</xref>).

It is hypothesized that wtHTT, which shuttles into the nucleus, assists in the assembly of transcription factor and co-activator complexes to regulate target gene expression, and that polyQ expansion perturbs the functional integrity of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luthi-Carter and Cha, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>). How mHTT disrupts the activities of specific promoters and whether mHTT-mediated transcriptional dysregulation is linked to DNA damage accumulation and aberrant DDR pathway activation remains unknown.</p><p>Given that HTT interacts with huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 1995</xref>), while ATXN3 interacts with HAP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takeshita et al., 2011</xref>) and PNKP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), we asked whether ATXN3 and PNKP might interact with HTT to form a TCR complex and if this is affected by polyQ expansion. We isolated nuclear protein extract (NE) and cytosolic protein extract (CE) from SH-SY5Y cells and the fractions were analyzed by western blot (WB) to determine purity of nuclear protein fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We immunoprecipitated (IPâd) endogenous wtHTT from the NE of SH-SY5Y cells, and WBs of the immunocomplexes (ICs) showed the presence of HAP-1, ATXN3, CBP, TAFII 130 (TAF4), POLR2A, PNKP, and LIG 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Finally, IP of PNKP from NEs confirmed that they were also present in the PNKP-IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). To verify the specificity of these interactions in vivo, we analyzed the ICs for the presence of apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), another critical DNA base excision repair (BER) enzyme that works independently of PNKP-mediated BER pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiederhold et al., 2004</xref>). APE1 was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to D), suggesting interaction specificity and selectivity. Finally, IP of POLR2A again revealed these proteins in the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). For further confirmation, we IPâd Myc-tagged HTT from the NEs of PC12 cells expressing Myc-tagged FL-wtHTT-Q23 or FL-mHTT-Q148. WB confirmed the presence of ATXN3, PNKP, POLR2A, CBP, and LIG three but not APE1 in the Myc-IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>), suggesting that HTT, POLR2A, CBP, ATXN3, LIG 3, and PNKP form a multiprotein TCR complex. Proximity ligation assays (PLAs) were then performed to verify interaction specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). The reconstitution of fluorescence in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> to M) and postmortem human brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>) suggested substantial interaction among these proteins. Importantly, the majority of the PLA signals was from the nuclei but substantial amount of signals were from the periphery or cytoplasm. Immunostaining the cells with mitochondrial markers suggested that HTT forms similar complexes in the mitochondria (data not shown). Importantly, about 60â70% of the PLA signal was nuclear in control brain, while the complexes were predominantly in the perinuclei or cytoplasm of HD brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Since PNKP and HTT are present in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orr et al., 2008</xref>), the extranuclear signals detected in the control subjects are presumably from mitochondrial HTT-ATXN3-PNKP complexes. WB analysis of subcellular protein fractions from neuronal cells show the presence of HTT, ATXN3 and PNKP in mitochondria (data not shown). Moreover, co-staining the cells or brain sections with mitochondrial markers suggested presence of HTT, ATXN3 and PNKP in mitochondria (data not shown).

Although these data suggest that the N-terminal of mHTT interacts with PNKP, these experiments do not inform the relative strengths of interaction between these peptides. Nonetheless, the IP and BIFC studies suggest that the truncated-N-terminal fragments of both WT and mHTT interact with the C-terminal catalytic domain of PNKP. The interaction of these peptides with the PHOS-KIN domain of PNKP is relatively stronger than with the PHOS domain alone. However, more rigorous structural and biophysical measurements using purified proteins/peptides will be required to understand the true nature of these protein-protein interactions, the relative binding efficacies and to identify the direct interacting partners in this complex.

We found that in HTT-depleted cells, PNKP activity was reduced byÂ &gt;70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref> to G), suggesting that wtHTT plays key roles in stimulating PNKP activity, maintaining the functional integrity of the TCR complex, and repairing DNA damage.

To test if mHTT specifically blocks PNKP activity rather than interfering with DNA repair per se, we examined how it modulated the repair of two nicked DNA duplexes: one without a 3'-phosphate end that requires DNA polymerase and ligase activities but not PNKP activity for repair, and another duplex with a 3'-phosphate end that requires PNKP and DNA polymerase and ligase activities for complete repair. We observed that NEs from cells expressing mHTT or from zQ175 mouse brain did not hamper repair of the duplex that required DNA polymerase and ligase activities but did not require PNKP activity. In contrast, NEs from these cells and mice did abrogate repair of the duplex that requires PNKP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> to J), suggesting that mHTT specifically blocks PNKP activity but does not interfere with the activities of other repair enzymes in the TCR complex. In response to DNA strand break accumulations, ATM is activated by phosphorylation which phosphorylates p53, which in turn activates pro-apoptotic gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chipuk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oda et al., 2000</xref>).

Since mHTT abrogates the activity of PNKP, a key component of the TCR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>), we compared the associations of HTT and TCR proteins with transcriptionally active versus inactive genomes and asked whether the former accumulates more strand breaks in the HD brain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed significantly higher HTT occupancy on actively transcribing genes in the brain (e.g., neuronal differentiation factor 1 and 2 [Neurod1 and Neurod2], neurogenic basic-helix-loop-helix protein neurogenin 1 [Neurog1], tubulin beta three class III [Tubb3], neuron-specific enolase 2 [Eno2Î³], and DNA polymerase beta [Pol b]) over genes that are not transcribed in the brain but actively transcribed in skeletal or cardiac muscle (e.g., myogenic differentiation factor 1 [Myod1]; myogenic factor 4; myogenin [Myog]; and myosin heavy chain 2, 4, 6, or 7 [Myh2, Myh4, Myh6, or Myh7]; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A &amp; B</xref>). Increased association between HTT with the transcriptionally active genome and mHTT-mediated abrogation of PNKP activity indicate that the wtHTT-TCR complex repairs lesions during transcriptional elongation, but polyQ expansion might impair the TCR and facilitate DNA damage accumulation. To test this theory, we performed Long-amplicon quantitative polymerase chain reaction (LA-qPCR) analysis, a versatile technique to measure nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santos et al., 2006</xref>) to assess DNA strand breakage in actively transcribing and non-transcribing genes in the transgenic mouse cortex (CTX). The results revealed 60â70% lower PCR-amplification of actively transcribing genes in asymptomatic (seven wks) zQ175 mouse CTX compared to age-matched WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C &amp; D</xref>). In contrast, the amplification efficacy for non-transcribing genes in the zQ175 CTX was only marginally (10â15%) reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E &amp; F</xref>), indicating less DNA damage accumulation. Consistent with the levels of PNKP activities observed in the striatum (STR) and cerebellum (CRBL), the LA-qPCR analysis revealed substantial DNA damage accumulation in STR but negligible DNA damage accumulations in the CRBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, immunostaining of the HD patientsâ brain and HD transgenic mouse brain sections with anti-phospho-53BP1 antibody, a DNA damage marker, showed increased presence of DNA damage as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

To explore this possibility, we examined whether mHTT stimulates ubiquitination and degradation of specific TCR complex proteins. WB analyses of NEs from HD and control iPSC-derived primary neurons revealed a significant decrease in soluble CBP protein levels in HD neurons, whereas ATXN3, PNKP, POLR2A, and CREB levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A &amp; B</xref>). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses did not show a significant change in CBP mRNA levels upon mHTT expression (data not shown), suggesting that mHTT does not interfere with the expression of CBP in HD. This finding indicates that CBP might be degraded more in HD. However, an alternative possibility is that CBP becomes insoluble when post-translationally modified. Substantially reduced levels of CBP was also observed in the soluble fraction of proteins from cells expressing exogenous mHTT (data not shown). To determine whether abrogating ATXN3 activity causes reduced CBP levels, we measured TCR protein levels in ATXN3-depleted cells. Similar to HD iPSC-derived primary neurons, markedly lower CBP levels were observed in the soluble protein extract from the ATXN3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C &amp; D</xref>). Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>), CBP levels were dramatically (~80%) reduced in the zQ175 CTX but only marginally (~20%) decreased in the CRBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E &amp; F</xref>). To test whether ATXN3 interacts with CBP, we co-expressed Myc-ATXN3 and FLAG-CBP and IPâd Myc-ATXN3 from the NEs. WBs showed CBP in the Myc-IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Conversely, IP of the FLAG-CBP and subsequent WB revealed ATXN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The PLA results also suggested intracellular interaction between ATXN3 and CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Confocal microscopy showed distinct colocalization of ATXN3 and CBP in HD and control brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, arrows). A recent study also showed significantly increased ubiquitination and reduced level of CBP in Hdh<sup>Q7/Q111</sup> HD transgenic mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giralt et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether mHTT expression increases CBP ubiquitination in zQ175 mouse brain, we IPâd CBP from the NE of zQ175 and control mouse brain. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giralt et al., 2012</xref>), WBs of the CBP IC showed increased CBP ubiquitination in the transgenic brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>; lower panel). These data suggest that decreased ATXN3 activity due to its interaction with mHTT in the TCR complex may increase ubiquitination, and increased ubiquitination of CBP may cause aberrant localization of CBP, negatively impacting its solubility in HD. It is also possible that increased ubiquitination may facilitate degradation of CBP in HD.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42988.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>mHTT facilitates CBP degradation by inactivating ATXN3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nuclear extracts (NEs) isolated from control primary neurons (Q18 and Q28) and HD neurons (Q53 and Q109) were analyzed by WBs to measure PNKP, ATXN3, POLR2A, CBP, and CREB levels; HDAC2 was the loading control.

A significant association of wtHTT with PNKP, ATXN3, POLR2A and associated transcription factors suggest that wtHTT may act as a scaffold factor to assemble various core components of the TCR complex. Our data suggest that formation of this functional TCR complex with wtHTT is essential for sensing and editing DNA lesions in the template strand during transcriptional elongation in post-mitotic differentiated neurons and may contribute in maintaining genome integrity and neuronal survival. Our results further indicate that interaction of PNKP with wtHTT stimulates its DNA end-processing activity to facilitate neuronal DNA repair. The role of wtHTT in maintaining TCR complex functionality and genome integrity is further validated by the fact that depletion of endogenous wtHTT protein dramatically depletes PNKP activity with a concurrent increase in DNA damage accumulation. In contrast, mHTT with polyQ expansions interacts with several key components of the complex but abrogates the activities of PNKP and ATXN3, thereby disrupting DNA repair and transcription leading to a possible early trigger for neurotoxicity and functional decline in HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42988.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism by which mHTT triggers neurotoxicity in HD.</title><p>Schematic diagram of our hypothesized mechanism by which polyQ expansions in mHTT compromise the functional integrity of the TCR complex. Normal HTT forms a multiprotein TCR complex with POLR2A, ATXN3, PNKP, CBP, and additional DNA repair enzymes, and this structure monitors and edits DNA strand breaks/damage during transcriptional elongation, preserving genome integrity, transcription and neuronal survival. In HD, polyQ expansions in mHTT impair the normal function of the TCR complex; mHTT-mediated inactivation of PNKP activity impairs DNA repair, which leads to the persistence of DNA strand breaks and chronic activation of ATM-p53 pro-apoptotic signaling. Additionally, mHTT-mediated inactivation of ATXN3âs deubiquitinating activity facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of CBP, impairing CBP-CREB-regulated gene transcription and further amplifying pro-degenerative output in the HD brain. PolyQ expansion in mHTT thus adversely impacts DNA repair and transcription and neural function and survival, triggering neurotoxicity and functional decline in HD.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42988-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our data demonstrate that mHTT interaction with PNKP and the resultant decline in PNKPâs enzymatic activity was evident in CTX and STR of HD transgenic mouse models but insignificant in the CRBL. Consistent with these findings, CTX and STR, the most affected brain regions in HD displayed extensive DNA strand breaks with impaired DNA repair capacity. In contrast, PNKP activity and genome integrity was marginally affected in CRBL, the brain region that is reported to be relatively unaffected in HD. However, no alterations in the steady-state levels of PNKP, ATXN3 and other key TCR components were observed between CRBL vs. CTX or STR. Our present data do not explain why mHTT expression specifically impacts PNKP activity and genome integrity in the CTX and STR but spares CRBL. Further investigation is required to understand region-specific decreases in PNKP activity and DNA break accumulation in the HD brain. Complete characterization of the TCR complex in different brain regions may provide valuable insight into the selective neuronal vulnerability to mHTT-mediated toxicity. It will be interesting to understand the mechanism that imparts protection to CRBL against mHTT and could provide another node in the signaling pathway that could potentially be developed as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, more rigorous biophysical and structural studies are necessary with purified peptides/proteins to characterize the true nature of the protein-protein interactions and interacting partners to understand how this putative HTT-RNA polymerase complex maintains neuronal genome integrity and survival.</p><p>It is notable that the HTT-TCR complex preferentially associates only with the transcriptionally active genome both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that the complex could be actively involved in repairing lesions in the template DNA strand during transcription and thus maintaining sequence integrity of the transcriptionally active genomes over the non-transcribing genome. This HTT-TCR complex may provide an additional layer of protective mechanism to maintain the sequence integrity of highly transcriptionally active genes in post-mitotic neurons. Depletion of PNKP activity by mHTT and subsequent accumulation of DNA strand breaks in the transcriptionally active genome extends our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that polyQ expansions in HTT result in the preferential accumulation of strand breaks in the transcriptionally active genome. Persistent DNA strand breaks in the actively transcribing genes may stall or impair transcription elongation, preventing adequate expression of a wide variety of neuronal genes and may contribute to the complexity and variability of HD pathology. Moreover, unrepaired lesions may further induce chronic activation of ATMâp53 signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX, and p53 in the HD brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Chronic ATM-p53 pathway activation resulted in an increased expression of several of the p53 target genes may facilitate neuronal apoptosis in HD. These data support the hypothesis that decreased PNKP activity could be an important proximal event that triggers early neurotoxicity in HD; however, it remains to be tested whether restoration of PNKP activity and DNA repair efficiency can rescue genome integrity and structural and behavioral defects in HD models.</p><p>Our results provide evidence that ATXN3 is another key regulatory component of the TCR complex. Our data suggest that the mHTT-mediated decrease in ATXN3 activity either enhances degradation of specific TCR complex components or prevents appropriate formation of the TCR complex in HD. We propose that abrogating ATXN3 activity is a potential mechanism by which mHTT decreases CBP activity and thus adversely impacts the transcription of CREB-dependent genes in HD. ATXN3 binds and deubiquitinates both mono- and polyubiquitin chains in target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chai et al., 2004</xref>). ATXN3 inactivation in mice increases protein ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitt et al., 2007</xref>), so diminished ATXN3 activity could influence CREB-regulated gene expression as described in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wyttenbach et al., 2001</xref>). Since disruption of CREB activity in the brain triggers neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantamadiotis et al., 2002</xref>), mHTT-mediated decreases in ATXN3, CBP, and CREB activities might compromise neuronal function and trigger neurotoxicity, further amplifying pro-degenerative output in HD. The identification of HTT, CBP, PNKP, and ATXN3 as key regulatory components of the TCR complex and our description of how polyQ expansions disrupt the complexâs functional integrity provide important insight into how mHTT could coordinately disrupt CREB-mediated transcription, increases DNA strand breaks, and activates ATMâp53 signaling. Collectively, these events compromise neuronal survival in HD. We hypothesize that POLR2A-mediated transcription might temporarily pause at DNA lesions, leading to mono-ubiquitination of specific TCR complex components, which signals complex assembly to stimulate and/or coordinate lesion repair in normal cells. ATXN3 deubiquitinates the components after repair, and normal transcription resumes. In contrast, the TCR complex stalls at strand breaks in mHTT-carrying cells, and due to reduced ATXN3 activity, specific complex component (s) are polyubiquitinated and accumulate aberrantly in polyQ inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that mHTT-mediated ATXN3 inactivation might impair CBP/CREB-dependent transcription, while reduced PNKP activity might result in DNA break accumulation and DDR pathway activation. The combination of chronic DDR signaling and dysregulation of CREB-dependent genes could trigger selective neuronal degeneration, a hallmark of HD. Defective DNA repair in post-mitotic neurons is an emerging causative factor of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madabhushi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madabhushi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rass et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with our findings, point mutations in PNKP result in microcephaly and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2010</xref>), whereas a frame-shift mutation in the PNKP gene was identified in a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulton et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, mHTT-mediated ablation of PNKP activity could lead to impaired DNA repair, persistent accumulation of DNA strand breaks that may in part contribute to neurotoxicity and neuronal dysfunction in HD.</p><p>This study provides multiple lines of evidence suggesting that mHTT-mediated loss of DNA repair and deubiquitinating activity could possibly be critical proximal events that impair the TCR. This could provide a mechanistic link between transcriptional dysregulation leading to aberrant activation of ATM-dependent pro-degenerative pathways and early neurotoxicity in HD. Although the final biological output triggered by impaired TCR and unrepaired DNA strand breaks in HD remains to be fully described, the present data indicate a potential mechanism by which polyQ expansions in mHTT could disrupt the functional integrity of TCR complex and compromises transcriptional regulation and genomic integrity in post-mitotic neurons. Molecular strategies that interfere with the interaction of mHTT with the TCR complex could reduce neurotoxicity and slow functional decline in HD. Alternatively, molecular approaches to stimulate PNKP activity could be a reasonable way to combat transcriptional dysregulation and inappropriate activation of pro-apoptotic signaling in HD. Our findings could help elucidate the cell type-specific pattern of pathology in HD. We propose the possibility that the compromised TCR efficiency in the basal ganglia or cortex could render these neuronal populations more vulnerable. Collectively, our findings suggest an intriguing molecular mechanism that could explain how mHTT expression in HD could compromise genome integrity and neuronal survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The construction of plasmids expressing the N-terminal fragment of HTT (exon1: NT-HTT-Q23 and NT-HTT-Q148) and full-length HTT (FL-HTT-Q23 and FL-HTT-Q148) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>).

In all cases, p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by a Mitchell Center Grant (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston TX) and National Institutes of Health grants RO1 NSO79541-01 to PSS and TKH and R01 EY026089-01A1 to PSS; 2R01 NS073976 grant to TKH, R01-NS100529 to LME; R01s AG033082 and R01 NS065874 to ARL, R01s NS089076 and NS090390 to LMT and Hereditary Disease Foundation Fellowship to CG.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutant huntingtin impairs PNKP and ATXN3, disrupting DNA repair and transcription&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Harry T Orr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hayley McLoughlin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission, which should require no additional experiments.</p><p>This work investigates a novel transcription-coupled DNA repair complex that includes PNKP, ATXN3 and HTT across many models and through multiple approaches. In the presence of expanded Htt, altered PNKP activity in cells and tissues expressing mutant huntingtin and evidence that transcriptionally active genes contain more strand breaks in HD mouse models were found. These observations suggest hypotheses that are worthy of continued study. However, there are currently insufficient data to support the conclusions of the study and the model put forward by the authors. The conclusions and tone need to be scaled back considerably, including, importantly, statements made in the Abstract and in the Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the revised manuscript it is essential that conclusions be dampened considerably. Rather than supporting a model based on the existence of an Htt, ATXN3, PNKP complex having a role in transcription as well as DNA repair, reviewers feel strongly the data, as it exists supports the exciting hypotheses that form the basis of important continued study. In addition, it is critical that data be described in a more rigorous manner such that they can be properly interpreted, including a discussion of data that may not align with the principle hypothesis being put forward.</p><p>Specific points to essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>- There are no QC data to show the quality/purity of the nuclear extracts used in the IPs. This needs to be documented. In particular this brings up the association with HAP-1 that is not typically characterized as a nuclear protein.</p><p>- The western blot strips are hard to interpret without any other information, e.g. position of MW markers and in isolation of the rest of the gel(s). It would be helpful to include more extensive western blot data gels as part of supplementary information.</p><p>- There appear to be two ATXN3 bands in panel E (also more weakly in F?) showing different intensities in input and IP. Is this real?</p><p>- Much of the PLA signal is extranuclear? How does this reconcile with the co-IPs in the nuclear extracts? Notably, the PNKP/ATXN3 PLA signal looks very different here compared to that shown in the Chatterjee 2014 paper where the fluorescent puncta are nuclear with no cytoplasmic signal. In the present manuscript the signal appears mostly cytoplasmic.</p><p>- Qualitatively, the nature of the PLA signal is different depending on the pairs. E.g. HTT and ATXN3 compared to HAP1 and ATXN3. This might suggest that these proteins are part of different complexes, depending on their subcellular localization.</p><p>More detail/QC needed in Materials and methods and/or figure legends in order to interpret results:</p><p>- Overall, the figure legends lack sufficient detail to understand exactly what is being shown. Without detailing every figure, general comments are that the nature of the replicate experiments is not clear. i.e. whether they are biological or technical/how many replicates are performed/what the error (SD or SE) in the data actually represents. Pooling of tissues for animal experiments needs to be clarified. e.g. For the data in Figure 5D-J, where it is stated that 4-5 animals are pooled.. do the error bars then represent technical replicates? Are 4-5 animals pooled for the western blot in panel F? Are G and H data from mice or from human neurons?</p><p>- While N-terminal and full-length HTT constructs are specified most of the time, in some cases the &quot;NT&quot; or &quot;FL&quot; designation is omitted and it is not clear what experiment was performed.</p><p>- PLA: Figure 1âfigure supplement 7 shows a lot of red signal other than that indicated by arrows as &quot;PLA signals&quot;, including what appears to be extracellular. It is unclear if this signal is from interacting proteins or is non-specific background. Additional QC in the supplementary figure would be important, as would including the antibody concentrations used.</p><p>- PHKP phosphatase activity assay: This needs to be described with some level of detail, not just referring to the authors' previous paper using this method (in which the reader is then referred back to other papers). At least the basic principle of the assay and an explanation of why the phosphatase activity can be specificity ascribed to PHKP in the nuclear extracts.</p><p>- Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A, B, C: what are the relative levels of mutant and WT HTT expression in the nuclear extracts that provide the phosphatase activity?</p><p>- Neuronal differentiation can be very variable. Additional documentation of the characterization of the human neurons is needed. e.g.% neuron vs. glia,% MSNs.</p><p>- Rescue data in Figure 5âfigure supplement 5: The data showing rescue of altered ATM signaling/DDR with PNKP overexpression are unclear as presented. Figure 5âfigure supplement 5F is labeled &quot;mHTT&quot;. Is this full-length or N-terminal fragment? Same construct as in Panel D? It is impossible to compare directly the data in panels D and F â the DOX time-course with and without PNKP needs to be carried out in the same experiment to compare protein levels between the two conditions. This is a single western, without quantification and as the data stand it is unclear that the aberrant ATM signaling is being rescued.</p><p>Description of HD postmortem brains/Figure 1âfigure supplement 7/Figure 2:</p><p>- More details are needed: where were the brains obtained from? What are CAG lengths/ages of the HD brains and ages of the control brains? What is the pathological grade (if known)? Ideally the CAG length(s), as genotyped, should be reported. N=4 HD brains are reported in the Materials and methods, but the data on these 4 brains are unclear â only two appear to be specifically mentioned in the Results.</p><p>- In Figure 1âfigure supplement 7 and Figure 2- &quot;brain sections&quot; is very vague. What are the actual brain regions analyzed?</p><p>- Which brains are shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 7?</p><p>- The brains shown in Figure 2 are designated as Q94 and Q82. It should be pointed out by the authors that these repeat lengths are associated with juvenile-onset HD. Were any adult onset cases examined?</p><p>- It is not accurate to report the colocalization data in the brains (Figure 2) as test or evidence of interaction.</p><p>Huntingtin-PNKP interaction data:</p><p>- Data in support of increased interaction of PNKP PHOS+KIN domain with Myc-NT-mHTT-Q97 relative to Myc-NT-HTT-Q23 (Figure 4C+D): The quality of the western blot in Figure 4C is very poor. Essentially, this is the only piece of data supporting an increased interaction of any form of mutant huntingtin with PNKP, and the data need to be much clearer to support this. Increased binding of the mutant N-terminal fragment to PNKP PHOS+KIN is not obviously supported by the BiFC data (Figure 4E). There does not seem to be an altered interaction of the N-terminal fragments with FL-PNKP (Figure 4C+D); what does this mean for the complex in vivo that presumably contains full length PNKP? When full length HTT is overexpressed (Figure 3 D and E), there also does not seem to be a stronger interaction either of PHOS+KIN of FL-PNKP with Myc-FL-HTT-Q148 relative to Myc-FL-HTT-Q23. This is not commented on/taken into account in the interpretation of the data. Is there any evidence for differences in interaction between mutant and WT HTT with PNKP outside of N-terminal fragment overexpression?</p><p>- Figure 4A shows relatively more co-IP of PNKP in GFP-NT-mHTT-Q97 expressing cells relative to GFP-NT-mHTT-Q23 (Figure 4A). This effect is not apparent in a comparison of the IPs from Myc-NT-HTT-Q23 and Myc-NT-mNTT-Q148 (Figure 4B). These observations are not discussed and their significance and the apparent difference between them are not clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42988.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the revised manuscript it is essential that conclusions be dampened considerably.

Absence of hnRNPC1/C2 protein in cytosolic fraction and GAPDH in nuclear fraction clearly demonstrate that these fractions are enriched and free of any cross-contamination (Figure 1A in the revised version).

The original western blots for the processed immuno-precipitation (IP) experiments shown in Figure 1 are now compiled in Figure 1âfigure supplements 1-6. Different sections of the blotting membrane was probed with variety of antibodies to analyze the components of the molecular protein complex. Electrophoretic gels from at least two independent IP experiments were run in duplicates to check reproducibility of these results. As per reviewerâs suggestions, figures generated from duplicate WB and the corresponding unprocessed blots were compiled in Figure 1âfigure supplements 1-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There appear to be two ATXN3 bands in panel E (also more weakly in F?) showing different intensities in input and IP.

These IP experiments were repeated under enhanced stringent conditions (IP buffer containing 200 mM KCl) and the improved IP/WB images from these repeated experiments are now added to the revised manuscript (Figures 1F, 1G and Figure 1âfigure supplements 5 and 6). These new figures should remove any ambiguity in data interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Much of the PLA signal is extranuclear?

New unpublished data from our laboratory suggest that both WT and mutant HTT are also present in mitochondria and forms mitochondrial complex with ATXN3 and PNKP similar to the nuclear complex of HTT with these proteins. Our data show that HTT, PNKP, and ATXN3 form a multi-protein complex with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and mitochondrial transcription factors. We hypothesize that this complex probably performs mtDNA repair during mtDNA transcription. These results will be a part of our next manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, the modified protocol used in the current manuscript is more stringent as compared to that of Chatterjee 2015. The manuscript is revised appropriately to clearly address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Qualitatively, the nature of the PLA signal is different depending on the pairs. E.g. HTT and ATXN3 compared to HAP1 and ATXN3. This might suggest that these proteins are part of different complexes, depending on their subcellular localization.</p></disp-quote><p>The intensity and relative abundance of the PLA signal could vary due to several factors, such as abundance, size, conformation and the antibody-recognition epitope of each protein as well as the quality of the antibody used. Although the possibility of these proteins being part of different complexes cannot be completely ruled out, the stringent condition (200-400 mM KCl) used during IP and reverse IPs (data shown in Figure 1, and Figure 1âfigure supplements 1-6) markedly reduces this possibility. Nevertheless, we do agree that additional structural studies using purified proteins would be necessary to understand these interactions in multi-protein complex. These studies will be part of future communication from our laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More detail/QC needed in Materials and methods and/or figure legends in order to interpret results:</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewerâs suggestion, the current manuscript is suitably revised to provide detailed information about each figure and Experimental Procedures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Overall, the figure legends lack sufficient detail to understand exactly what is being shown.

We have now provided detailed information regarding animal usage and additional required specifics. The PNKP activity and total repair assays were performed in transgenic and age-matched WT mice. 15 age-matched animals were used in each group. Tissues from CTX, STR or CRBL dissected from a group of 4 to 5 transgenic or control brain were pooled together to purify nuclear fraction for various analysis shown in Figure 5. Every experiment was repeated minimum of three times. Pooled samples were also used in panel 5F. The figure legends in the manuscript is revised to reflect all the details of animal usage, replications, and statistical analysis specific to each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are G and H data from mice or from human neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>This data is from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human primary neurons.

Recent unpublished data from our laboratory show that the cytoplasmic signals are actually from a similar complex that is detected in the mitochondria. We find that similar HTT-PNKP complex is also present in the mitochondria, and associates with mitochondrial DNA. We postulate that this mitochondrial complex could potentially be involved in mtDNA repair similar to its nuclear counterpart. We have included this explanation in the revised manuscript. The molecular mechanism explaining the role of said complex in mtDNA repair will be a part of our next manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- PHKP phosphatase activity assay: This needs to be described with some level of detail, not just referring to the authors' previous paper using this method (in which the reader is then referred back to other papers).

We have shown phosphorylation-dependent activation of two ATM target proteins e.g., p53 (phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15) and histone H2A (S139) in the revised manuscript.

Essentially, this is the only piece of data supporting an increased interaction of any form of mutant huntingtin with PNKP, and the data need to be much clearer to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this IP/WB experiment to improve the quality of Figure 4C. A much-improved image is now included in the revised manuscript that clearly shows the interaction between NT-wtHTT-Q23, FL-PNKP and PNKP-(PHOS+KIN). The interaction strength of PNKP-(PHOS+KIN) domain with WT and mHTT cannot be reliably quantified via the Co-IP experiment, which was conducted with transient overexpression of the proteins. We have substantially revised the conclusive statement made regarding the increased interaction of PNKP-(PHOS+KIN) with NT-mHTT-Q97. Further structural investigations will be required to determine the effects of polyQ expansion on the HTT and PNKP-(PHOS+KIN) interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Increased binding of the mutant N-terminal fragment to PNKP PHOS+KIN is not obviously supported by the BiFC data (Figure 4E).

This is not commented on/taken into account in the interpretation of the data. Is there any evidence for differences in interaction between mutant and WT HTT with PNKP outside of N-terminal fragment overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this important issue regarding the relative binding affinity between FL-PNKP and WT or mutant HTT. We agree that the binding affinities of PNKP-(PHOS+KIN) domain with WT and mHTT cannot be assessed accurately by the Co-IP experiment which is based on transient overexpression of relevant proteins. Several factors may modulate the outcome e.g., transfection efficiency, appropriate expressions, or folding of the fused peptides. More rigorous biophysical measurements using purified proteins/peptides would be required to understand the true nature of these protein-protein interactions. Since HTT-TCR complex is not completely characterized, there may be additional unidentified factors in the complex that could significantly alter these interactions in vivo. Alternatively, the binding of the mHTT with FL-PNKP or PNKP-(PHOS+KIN) domain may not be different but the expanded polyQ sequences in mHTT may physically hinder the catalytic site of PNKP thus depleting its activity and DNA repair. These possibilities have now been added in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4A shows relatively more co-IP of PNKP in GFP-NT-mHTT-Q97 expressing cells relative to GFP-NT-mHTT-Q23 (Figure 4A). This effect is not apparent in a comparison of the IPs from Myc-NT-HTT-Q23 and Myc-NT-mNTT-Q148 (Figure 4B). These observations are not discussed and their significance and the apparent difference between them are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>These co-IP experiments were done to assess cellular interactions of N-terminal fragments of HTT with PNKP. The IP/WB data described in Figure 4A using GFP-NT-wtHTT and GFP-NT-mHTT suggests that while both wtHTT and mHTT interact with endogenous PNKP and the associated TCR components, interaction with the mutant was noticeably stronger. We agree with the reviewerâs comment that no distinction was observed between mutant and wild type HTT interaction with PNKP or PNKP domains in the co-IP experiments performed with overexpressing Myc-NT-mHTT-Q148 and Myc-NT-wtHTT-Q23 and various PNKP domains (Figure 4C and D). It is possible that the addition of MYC and GFP tag on these peptides may alter the conformation of the peptides distinctly and that may in turn influence their interaction efficacy with other proteins. Our data is a representation of qualitative interaction between these proteins and should not be interpreted as quantitative measurement of these interactions. To make quantitative assessments and to characterize the nature of these protein-protein interactions, structural and biophysical studies using purified proteins would be necessary. Currently, these experiments are being conducted in our laboratory and will be a part of future publications. We have discussed these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
