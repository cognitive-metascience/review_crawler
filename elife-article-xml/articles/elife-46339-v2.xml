However, infection at the single-cell level is highly heterogeneous, with most infected cells giving rise to no or few viral progeny while some cells produce thousands. Analysis of Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection by population-averaged measurements has taught us a lot about the course of viral infection, but has also produced contradictory results, such as the concurrent activation and inhibition of type I interferon signaling during infection. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize viral and host transcriptional heterogeneity during HSV-1 infection of primary human cells. We find extreme variability in the level of viral gene expression among individually infected cells and show that these cells cluster into transcriptionally distinct sub-populations. We find that anti-viral signaling is initiated in a rare group of abortively infected cells, while highly infected cells undergo cellular reprogramming to an embryonic-like transcriptional state. This reprogramming involves the recruitment of β-catenin to the host nucleus and viral replication compartments, and is required for late viral gene expression and progeny production. These findings uncover the transcriptional differences in cells with variable infection outcomes and shed new light on the manipulation of host pathways by HSV-1.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46339.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, is a virus that infects most of the human population. In many people, the virus stays dormant in nerve cells, but in some individuals, it can ‘wake up’ regularly and cause painful facial lesions known as cold sores. In very few cases, the virus can enter the brain and become life threatening.</p><p>When HSV-1 encounters a human cell, there are three possible outcomes. The virus can either enter the cell and then replicate uncontrollably, get inside the cell but not multiply, or fail to enter the cell altogether. However, during experiments, researchers do not usually look at individual cells but instead consider whole populations. This makes it hard to understand the exact mechanisms that contribute to a cell resisting or succumbing to the virus.</p><p>New approaches are now making it possible to study individual cells over time. Here, Drayman et al. harnessed these methods to understand how individual human cells respond to HSV-1. The experiments show that most cells are actually able to resist the infection. Amongst those, a small fraction managed to stop the virus replicating by initiating a built-in ‘antivirus program’. However, a minority of cells did become highly infected, shutting down the signaling process that fends off the virus. In these cells a different set of genes were switched on, making them more similar to the cells found in embryos. In the process, the virus recruited a protein called β-catenin to help with its multiplication.</p><p>There are efforts to develop drugs to interfere with β-catenin, as this protein is also produced differently in people with cancer. Such drugs, if identified and safe in humans, could potentially serve to treat HSV-1 infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>anti-viral</kwd><kwd>HSV-1</kwd><kwd>Herpes Simplex</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drayman</surname><given-names>Nir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell analyses of cells infected by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 revealed extreme heterogeneity among infected cells, including the robust activation of developmental gene programs in highly infected cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites that rely on the biochemical functions of their hosts to carry out infection. Although usually studied at the level of cell populations, viral infection is inherently a single-cell problem, where the outcome of infection can dramatically differ between genetically identical cells. For example, early studies in the 1940 s investigated the burst size of individually infected bacteria and concluded that it both spans three orders of magnitude and cannot be solely attributed to differences in bacteria size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delbrück, 1945</xref>). A later study measured the burst size from individual HeLa cells infected with Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and found that many of the infected cells did not release viral progeny, that the variability between individual cells was high and that it did not correlate with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wildy et al., 1959</xref>). More recently, technological improvements have allowed the quantification of burst sizes and determination of the infection kinetics of different mammalian viruses, pointing to a high degree of cell-to-cell variability in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Timm and Yin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulte and Andino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Combe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen and Kobiler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drayman et al., 2017</xref>). One well-known source of this variability is the random distribution of the number of viruses that individual cells encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parker, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen and Kobiler, 2016</xref>). Another source is genetic variability in the virus population, with some virus particles being unable or less fit to establish infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang and Baltimore, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lauring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stern et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is becoming clear that a third source of variability among individually infected cells is the host cell state at the time of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Snijder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snijder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drayman et al., 2017</xref>). Variability in the host cell state can arise from both deterministic processes, such as the cell-cycle, and stochastic processes, such as mRNA transcription and protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loewer and Lahav, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>). Recently, the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has allowed researchers to examine virus–host interactions in multiple systems, mainly those of RNA viruses, highlighting the extreme cell-to-cell variability during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steuerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Russell et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is clear that a better understanding of viral infection requires studies at the single-cell level. Although scRNA-seq is providing a wealth of new information, it is currently limited to the characterization of highly abundant transcripts and can be augmented by other approaches such as live-cell imaging and RNA-sequencing of defined cell populations.</p><p>HSV-1 is a common human pathogen that belongs to the <italic>herpesviridae</italic> family and serves as the prototypic virus for studying alpha herpesviruses infection. De novo HSV-1 infection has both lytic and latent phases. In the lytic phase, the virus infects epithelial cells at the site of contact, replicates withing these host cells, before destroying them and releasing viral progeny. The latent phase is restricted to neurons, in which the virus remains silent throughout the host life with occasional reactivation. Here, we focus on the lytic part of the virus life cycle. Lytic infection is usually asymptomatic, but in some cases (particularly in immune-compromised individuals and infants), it can result in life-threatening conditions such as meningitis and encephalitis.</p><p>To initiate infection, HSV-1 must bind to its receptors, enter the cytoplasm, travel to the nuclear pore and inject its linear double-stranded DNA into the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobiler et al., 2012</xref>). Once in the nucleus, viral gene expression proceeds in a temporal cascade involving three classes of viral genes: immediate-early (IE), early (E) and late (L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honess and Roizman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honess and Roizman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harkness et al., 2014</xref>). Transcription of IE genes is initiated by VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weir, 2001</xref>), whereas transcription of the E and L genes is activated by the IE protein ICP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon and Schaffer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Watson and Clements, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLuca et al., 1985</xref>). ICP0, another IE gene, is a multifunctional E3-ubiquitn ligase that counteracts some of the host anti-viral systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lanfranca et al., 2014</xref>) and interferes with the action of transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lomonte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lutz et al., 2017</xref>). Viral mutants that lack ICP0 expression (ΔICP0) are highly attenuated in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stow and Stow, 1986</xref>). Viral DNA replication occurs in sub-nuclear structures, called replication compartments (RCs), that aggregate the seven essential replication proteins as well as other viral and host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bruyn Kops and Knipe, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liptak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weller and Coen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dembowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reyes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>). Upon viral DNA replication, ICP4 is predominantly localized in the RCs, with some diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knipe et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu and Schaffer, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Several studies applied high-throughput technologies to analyze the cellular response to HSV-1 infection at the population level. RNA sequencing revealed a widespread deregulation of host transcription, including the disruption of transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rutkowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennig et al., 2018</xref>), activation of anti-sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wyler et al., 2017</xref>), depletion of RNA-polymerase II from the majority of host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birkenheuer et al., 2018</xref>) and changes in splicing and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Although most cellular genes are downregulated by infection, some genes have been reported to be upregulated, including some anti-viral genes and genes encoding host transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pasieka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taddeo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Proteomics studies have defined the different stages and protein complexes that are present during HSV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Suk and Knipe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dembowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reyes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>), as well as the cellular protein response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kulej et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lum et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although incredibly informative, population-level analyses suffer in that they average over all the cells in the population. In the case of virus-infected cells, the population is far from homogenous and could in fact contain opposite phenotypes, such as highly- infected and abortively infected cells, leading to contradictory results. One such example is the seemingly complex relation between HSV-1 infection and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The picture that emerges from population-level measurements is paradoxical, with wildtype HSV-1 infection both clearly activating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gianni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reinert et al., 2016</xref>) and clearly repressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson and Knipe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Manivanh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>) the type I IFN pathway. Such discrepancies might be resolved with the use of single-cell measurements.</p><p>Here, we apply a combination of live-cell time-lapse fluorescent imaging, scRNA-seq and the sequencing of sorted cell populations to explore HSV-1 infection at the single-cell level. We find that single cells that are infected by the virus show variability in all aspects of infection, starting from the initial phenotype (abortive infection vs. successful initiation of viral gene expression), through the timing and rate of viral gene expression, and ending with the host cellular response. This study resolves the apparent discrepancy in the literature regarding type I IFN induction and shows that this induction is restricted to a rare sub-population of abortively infected cells. Surprisingly, we find that the main transcriptional response in highly infected cells is the reprogramming of the cell to an embryonic-like state. We focus on the viral activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and find that β-catenin is recruited to the cell nucleus and the viral RCs, and is required for viral gene expression and progeny production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral infection dynamics vary among individual cells</title><p>We began by studying the temporal variability in viral gene expression initiation.

Primary human fibroblasts (HDFn) were infected and monitored by time-lapse fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

Almost no new infections were observed between 4 hr and 6 hr post-infection, but two infection peaks were later seen at 8 and 11 hr. These peaks are probably the result of secondary infections, as new viral progeny can be detected in infected cells starting at 6 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pomeranz and Blaho, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drayman et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the majority of infected cells have initiated viral gene expression by 5 hr, we chose this time point for further analyses. HDFn were infected as described above, fixed and stained with DAPI at 5 hr post-infection (to allow automated cell segmentation and quantification). This allowed the distinction of two cellular populations: cells that successfully initiated viral gene expression (ICP4<sup>+</sup>) and cells that did not (ICP4<sup>–</sup>). Of 1814 cells exposed to HSV-1, 996 cells (55%) were ICP4<sup>+</sup> and 818 (45%) were ICP4<sup>–</sup>. Cells were classified as ICP4-negative or -positive on the basis of a threshold calculated from mock-infected cells (mean +3 standard deviations).</p><p>Among the ICP4<sup>+</sup> cells, nuclear levels of ICP4 varied by ~100 fold, ranging from 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> AU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Infected cells showed three distinct phenotypes related to ICP4 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon its expression, ICP4 is initially diffuse throughout the cell nucleus. As its level increases, ICP4 forms discrete foci in the nucleus. These are the viral RCs, where viral DNA replication takes place. Later, the levels of cytoplasmic ICP4 increase and interspersed foci can be seen in the cytoplasm. These phenotypes are temporally linked and delineate the progression through infection. As evident by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—Video 1</xref>), individual cells show a high degree of variability, not only in the timing of initial gene expression but also in the rate of infection progression.</p><p>Taken together, we find that not all cells that are exposed to HSV-1 successfully initiate viral gene expression under these experimental conditions. Those that do initiate viral gene expression show variation in the timing of initial gene expression, in the rate of infection progression and in the level and localization of the immediate-early protein ICP4. These results prompted us to explore cellular heterogeneity on a larger scale by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Viral gene expression is extremely variable among individual cells</title><p>HDFn were mock-infected or infected with wildtype HSV-1 (MOI 2, equivalent to ~70 genomes per cell, see 'Materials and methods') or a ΔICP0 HSV-1 mutant (MOI 0.5, equivalent to ~700 genomes per cell) and harvested for scRNA-seq at 5 hr post-infection. We chose to include the ΔICP0 mutant because it results in a relatively high number of abortive infections and in a robust activation of anti-viral responses. For scRNA-seq, we applied the Drop-seq protocol (see 'Materials and methods' and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, a microfluidic device was used to encapsulate individual cells in a water-in-oil droplet in which cell lysis, mRNA-capture and barcoding took place. The barcoded mRNA was then recovered from the droplets, reverse-transcribed, amplified and sequenced. As each cDNA was barcoded with a cell and transcript ID, the sequencing data allow the reliable quantification of the number of transcripts in individual cells. Technical data on sequencing depth and filtering criteria are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Only 0.4% of mock-infected cells had any reads aligned to the HSV-1 genome, with a maximal expression of two viral gene counts (0.05% of transcripts).

The viral gene expression distribution was highly skewed, with most cells expressing low levels of viral transcripts and some cells expressing much higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A joint analysis of mock and wt-infected cells showed that highly infected cells clustered separately from the mock-infected and low-infected cells, which were intermingled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The Gini coefficient, a measurement of population inequality ranging from zero (complete equality) to one (complete inequality), was used to evaluate the distribution of viral gene expression among individual cells.

When wildtype viral gene expression is visualized in two-dimensions (using the tSNE dimensionality reduction technique; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>), two clusters of cells can be seen, which are distinguished by the amount of viral gene expression (less or more than ~1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A similar distribution was seen for ΔICP0-infected cells, although there were significantly fewer cells in the ‘highly infected’ cluster in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To further explore cell-to-cell variability in viral gene expression, we analyzed the relative expression of the four temporal groups of viral transcripts: immediate-early (IE), early (E) and late (subdivided into early-late (γ1) and true-late (γ2)). We focused on the group of highly infected cells, because the lowly infected cells had too few viral gene counts for accurate analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows the relative expression of the viral gene classes in single cells, ordered from low to high viral gene expression. The fraction of late genes increases as total viral gene expression increases, at the expense of IE and E genes.

Similar observations were made for ΔICP0-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Our scRNA-seq data indicate a wide and uneven distribution of viral gene expression during HSV-1 infection, with most cells expressing no or low levels of viral gene transcripts and a smaller group expressing much higher levels (in agreement with the ICP4 expression levels presented above). The vast majority of cells exposed to HSV-1, either wildtype or ΔICP0, had some level of viral gene expression, suggesting that the fraction of lowly expressing cells (and the ICP4<sup>–</sup> population noted above) are indeed abortively infected cells, rather than cells that did not encounter a virus. We note that significant cell-to-cell differences are seen even within the group of highly infected cells, with viral gene expression ranging from 1% to &gt;30%, and that this ‘viral expression load’ is correlated with late gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The cell-cycle affects HSV-1 gene expression</title><p>We have previously shown that the cell-cycle stage at the time of infection is a cellular determinant of successful HSV-1 infection in the H1299 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drayman et al., 2017</xref>). In that study, we found that cells that were infected in the G<sub>2</sub> phase were less likely to initiate viral gene expression and that cellular escape from viral-enforced mitotic arrest is highly detrimental to HSV-1 infection. To evaluate the effect of the cell-cycle in HDFn infection, we calculated a cell-cycle score for each cell in our dataset (see 'Materials and methods' section and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>) and measured the correlation between HSV-1 gene expression and the cell-cycle score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To investigate this, infected cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into two populations based on ICP4-YFP expression (ICP4<sup>+</sup> and ICP4<sup>–</sup>), and each population was sequenced. In agreement with the scRNA-seq data, the expression of canonical anti-viral genes was not significantly different between mock-infected and ICP4<sup>+</sup> cells. Rather, our analysis indicated that a small group of genes, including the anti-viral genes <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>IFIT2</italic>, were specifically upregulated in the ICP4<sup>–</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). The Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes associated with these upregulated genes included terms such as ‘response to type I interferon’ and ‘immune response’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). Validation of selected transcripts by quantitative PCR (QPCR) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>ISGs are usually expressed after interferon stimulation, but we failed to detect the activation of any of the interferon genes in either the scRNA-seq or the sequencing of the sorted cell populations. To pinpoint the origin of the anti-viral response, cells were stained for IRF3, because IRF3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is one of the first steps in type I interferon induction. In ICP4<sup>+</sup> cells, IRF3 was blocked from entering the nucleus and concentrated in the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), while a rare subset of ICP4<sup>–</sup> cells (&lt;1%) showed nuclear localization of IRF3. We thus conclude that wildtype HSV-1 infection efficiently blocks the induction of the anti-viral response and that the activation of anti-viral genes in population-averaged measurements is the result of anti-viral signaling that is elicited in a rare population of abortively infected cells.</p><p>We next evaluated the anti-viral response in cells infected by ΔICP0 HSV-1. ICP0 is a multifunctional viral protein, which blocks IRF3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). Cells infected with ΔICP0 clustered into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cluster 1 consists of cells with very few viral transcripts. Clusters 2 and 3 have slightly higher viral gene expression, and the small cluster 4 consists of highly infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). Although the magnitude of the anti-viral response in ΔICP0-infected cells was much greater than that in the wildtype-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it was still only observed in a small population of cells, with ~8% of the cells expressing <italic>IFIT1, MX2</italic> or <italic>OASL</italic> (compared to none of the mock-infected cells).

This behavior explains the apparent discrepancy in previous population-level measurements that showed both activation and inhibition of type I interferon signaling during HSV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HSV-1 infection results in transcriptional reprogramming of the host to an embryonic-like state</title><p>We next focused on genes that are upregulated during HSV-1 infection, in either the scRNA-seq or sorted cell population experiments.

We find that single cells tha are infected by the virus show variability in all aspects of infection, starting from the initial phenotype (abortive infection vs. successful initiation of viral gene expression), through the timing and rate of viral gene expression and ending with the cellular response of the host cell. Such heterogeneity in the population of infected cells is detrimental when performing population-averaged measurements but can be untangled through single-cell analyses, which can provide new insights into biological processes.</p><p>With regard to IFN response, we find that two opposite phenotypes exist in the population of infected cells, explaining the discrepancy in the literature. Surprisingly, we find that IFN induction is limited to a small group of abortively infected cells, even in cells infected by the ΔICP0 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This rare activation of anti-viral signaling seems to be widespread, as single-cell investigations into RNA viruses such as West-Nile virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Neal et al., 2019</xref>) and influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Russell et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russell et al., 2018b</xref>) have reported similar findings. Why only a subset of cells activate the anti-viral program is an intriguing question and several hypotheses come to mind. For example, these cells could be poised for IFN induction due to stochastic variability in expression of the signaling pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patil et al., 2015</xref>) or IFN induction might be linked to the number of viral particles that a cell encounters. We plan to pursue and further characterize these rare cells in future studies.</p><p>We further found that highly infected cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming and activate multiple developmental pathways. This is exemplified by changes in β-catenin localization that correspond to distinct stages in HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): β-catenin is first recruited to the cell nucleus and then later to the viral replication compartments. These findings augment a growing body of literature that shows a link between viral infection and the β-catenin pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Zuylen et al., 2016</xref>), such as during infections with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juranic Lisnic et al., 2013</xref>), influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">More et al., 2018</xref>), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daud et al., 2017</xref>) and Rift Valley Fever virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harmon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How HSV-1 infection causes this massive reprogramming of the host cell state is currently unknown, although we can rule out a direct involvement of ICP0 because this reprogramming also occurs during infection with ΔICP0, albeit to a lesser extent. β-catenin activation is certainly one part of this, but it is likely that the expression of epigenetic regulators is also important. Indeed, a proteomics study of host chromatin during HSV-1 infection has identified widespread changes in the epigenomic landscape of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kulej et al., 2017</xref>). Although we describe a positive role for β-catenin activation during HSV-1 infection here, a recent report described an inhibitory role for the germline transcription factor DUX4 during HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Full et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, future studies will need to tease apart the differential contributions and effects of different developmental pathways that are activated during infection.</p><p>β-catenin and other developmental pathways are often found to be mutated or dysregulated during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krausova and Korinek, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchartre et al., 2016</xref>) and are considered to be promising targets for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takebe et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to speculate as to the possible impact of β-catenin activation by HSV-1 on its use as an oncolytic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchala et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe and Goshima, 2018</xref>). At present, the first-line treatment for late-stage melanoma is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tracey and Vij, 2019</xref>). These inhibitors revolutionized melanoma treatment, but not all patients respond to them. This heterogeneity was shown to be associated with β-catenin activity in the tumor, where high β-catenin levels negatively correlate with treatment success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spranger and Gajewski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spranger et al., 2015</xref>). Given that an HSV-1 -based oncolytic therapy has been FDA approved for late-stage melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pol et al., 2015</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the high level of β-catenin in melanomas that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors would serve to augment oncolytic HSV-1 replication and anti-tumor effects, although this of course would have to be assessed carefully in separate studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Image analysis was performed with ImageJ and MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-cell RNA-sequencing</title><p>HDFn infected with wildtype HSV-1 at an MOI of 2 or ΔICP0 at an MOI of 0.5 were harvested at 5 hr post-infection and washed three times in PBS containing 0.01% BSA. Cells were counted and processed according to the Drop-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>) in the Genomics facility core at the University of Chicago. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Preliminary data analysis (quality control, trimming of adaptor sequences, UMI and cell barcode extraction) was performed on a Linux platform using the Drop-seq Tools (Version 1.13) and the Drop-seq Alignment Cookbook (Version 1.2), which are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases">https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases</ext-link>. Alignment of reads was performed using the STAR aligner (Version 2.5.4b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) to a concatenated version of the human GRCh38 primary assembly (Gencode release 27) and HSV-1 genomes (Genbank accession: JN555585). The HSV-1 genome annotation file was kindly provided by Moriah Szpara (Pennsylvannia State University). Following the generation of the DGE (digital gene expression) file, further analyses were performed in MATLAB, these included quality control, cell clustering, correlation and differential gene expression analyses and data visualization. All the of the scripts used for data analysis have been deposited in Github (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drayman, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/single-cell-RNAseq-HSV1">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/single-cell-RNAseq-HSV1</ext-link>). Key points in the analysis are expanded on below.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Cell filtering</title><p> Following the construction of the initial DGEs (digital expression matrices), we filtered out cells with low (below 2000) and high (above 10,000) Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts. We then assessed the fraction of mitochondrial genes in individual cells and filtered out cells with high mitochondrial fraction (above 0.2 for mock- and wildtype-infected cells, above 0.4 for ΔICP0-infected cells). The distributions of the number of UMI, total genes and mitochondrial genes are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. This resulted in three DGEs, one for each condition (mock-infected, wildtype-infected and ΔICP0-infected) containing 4500, 807 and 1613 cells, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Normalization and UMI regression</title><p>The DGEs were log-normalized by dividing gene expression by the total number of UMI for each cell, multiplying by 10,000, adding one and taking the log of the value. We then regressed out the effect of the number of UMI on gene expression, by constructing a linear model for each gene’s expression as a function of total number of UMI. The expected value from the model was subtracted from the gene’s expression and the residual kept. We then performed Z-scoring, by subtracting the gene’s mean expression and dividing by the gene’s standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Cell-cycle regression</title><p>A list of 14 G<sub>2</sub>/M marker genes (HMGB2, CDK1, NUSAP1, UBE2C, BIRC5, TPX2, TOP2A, NDC80, CKS2, NUF2, CKS1B, MKI67, TMPO, and CENPF) was used to construct a cell-cycle score (for every gene from the list expressed by the cell, +1 was added to the score). Regression of the cell-cycle score was done as described above for UMI regression (keeping the residual after linear model fitting).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Clustering and differential gene expression analysis</title><p>Cell were clustered using k-means clustering. For clustering wild-type-infected cells, we used all the host and viral genes. For ΔICP0-infected cells, we used the viral genes as well as the top host genes that correlated with viral gene expression (top 100 correlated and top 100 anti-correlated). Genes that are differentially expressed between clusters were then identified by a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, followed by Benjamini and Hochberg false-detection rate (FDR) correction. A gene was considered differentially expressed if the FDR-corrected p-value was below 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA-sequencing of sorted cells</title><p>HDFn cells were mock infected or HSV-1 infected as described above, trypsinized, washed and re-suspended in full growth media. Cells were filtered through a 100 μm mesh into FACS sorting tubes and kept on ice. HSV-1 infected cells were sorted into two populations based on their ICP4-YFP expression. 0.5 million cells were collected from each population. Mock-infected cells were similarly sorted. ICP4-negative cells had the same level of YFP fluorescence at mock-infected cells. For ICP4-positive cells, we collected cells that were in the top 30% of YFP expression. The two populations were clearly separated from each other. Sorting was performed on an AriaFusion FACS machine (BD) at the University of Chicago flow-cytometry core facility. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and submitted to The University of Chicago Genomics core for library preparation and sequencing on a HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina). Reads were mapped to a concatenated version of the human and HSV-1 genomes with STAR aligner (see single-cell RNA-sequencing above for details). Reads were counted using the featureCounts command, which is a part of the Subread package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Further analyses were performed in MATLAB and these included differential gene expression analyses and data visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All sequencing data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE126042.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HSV-1 single cell analysis reveals anti-viral and developmental programs activation in distinct sub-populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jesse D Bloom (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Single cell analyses provide the unprecedented opportunity to study virus-host interactions while exploring and capturing the heterogeneity of cell responses. Although these studies have focused mainly on RNA viruses, the present paper focuses on the Herpex simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) DNA virus. They find that there is substantial heterogeneity among cells, the expression of interferon-stimulated genes is rare, and infection induces a developmental program in the cells. The study is interesting and well done, and the paper is well written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers had questions about the population of uninfected cells and the discussion thereof.</p><p>- Subsection “Viral infection dynamics varies among individual cells”, first paragraph: how was the MOI titered? Only 50% of cells become ICP4-positive at a MOI of 2. This is extremely far off Poisson statistics, which would suggest that 1 – exp(-2) = 84% should be ICP4-positive. The aforementioned paragraph just shows that infection isn't Poisson suggesting some cells might be refractory to infection. This should be more explicitly discussed at this point.</p><p>- Subsection “Viral infection dynamics varies among individual cells”, third paragraph and Figure 1C: Clarity of the wording is important: cells can be exposed but not infected (the virus entered); cells can be abortively infected, i.e. the virus entered but cannot successfully replicate and cells can undergo productive infection. Thus, being ICP4- during imaging analysis does not allow discriminating between abortive and non-infected yet. In this context, I would rather write &quot;of 1,814 cells exposed to HSV-1, […]&quot;.</p><p>- In Figure 1, only ICP4<sup>+</sup> cells are shown and it is not clearly stated what criteria were used to distinguish ICP4<sup>+</sup> and ICP4<sup>-</sup> cells, nor is the distribution for ICP4<sup>-</sup> cells ever shown. Please provide the intensity of the 818 ICP4<sup>-</sup> cells as well as their number. Then, after the scRNA-Seq, please include your interpretation that these data indicate that the majority of cells are expressing some% of viral transcripts and thus are bona fide abortive infections rather than non-infected cells (as only apparently a minor fraction of cells display 0% viral transcripts),</p><p>2) Provision of data and methods:</p><p>-The authors should add a figure supplement that shows some basic statistics on read depth per cell (and its distribution) for each sample. This is critical for evaluating single-cell RNA-seq, and doesn't appear possible to find now short of going to the raw data.</p><p>- The Materials and methods say that the scripts for data analysis are &quot;available upon request.&quot; This is not adequate for a paper that relies so heavily on computational analyses. The authors need to provide the computer code, which is currently not contained as part of the paper. The scripts should be made available (<italic>eLife</italic> allows GitHub repos linked to papers), and the paper should not be accepted until these scripts along with some sort of reasonable README describing their use are available for examination. In addition, some further details (such as how the differential gene expression was done) should be added to the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) The very interesting idea of the role of the cell cycle in infection and signaling should be further developed rather than just mentioned as a possibility, given the richness of the data at hand. The scRNA-seq should allow the testing of correlation between viral phenotype and cell cycle. In the subsection “The cell-cycle affects HSV-1 gene expression” and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, please provide more details and results regarding the cell cycle score and how the outregression was performed (gene list used for the G2/M score and outregression).</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Please include references to relevant papers such as Zhu and Jones, 2018, which shows that HSV1 viral production is inhibited upon treatment with iCRT14. It would be good also to cite other scRNA-seq papers on the sparsity of IFN induction in virus-infected cells, such as DOI 10.1128/JVI.01778-18 and DOI 10.1101/437277.</p><p>2) The expression of ISGs like IFIT1 and Mx2 which are produced in response to IFN-receptor signaling are most frequently analyzed. IRF3 activation is also examined and it would be helpful if the authors would discuss whether that was indicative of the cell-autonomous response, as one might conclude. This would help shed light on whether cells are detecting infection or just responding to signaling.</p><p>3) The argument that ISG expression is higher among low-virus expressing cells infected by deltaICP0 is not entirely convincing. It is true that in Figure 3D, all of the cells expressing ISGs are in clusters 1-3 (except two IFIT1-expressing cells in cluster 4 which are not accurately described in the text which says that no cluster 4 cells express ISGs). However, cluster 4 has many fewer cells, so maybe there just aren’t ISG expressing cells in that cluster by chance. Some statistics should be applied here. Also, Figure 2A, B, C appears to show a IFIT2 expressing cells with high viral expression. Please show additional data to strengthen the conclusions if available or obtainable. It is not clear whether the cell clustering analysis was performed taking into account viral transcripts or not. Could you please compare cell clustering with mock cells performed in parallel?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46339.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers had questions about the population of uninfected cells and the discussion thereof.</p><p>- Subsection “Viral infection dynamics varies among individual cells”, first paragraph: how was the MOI titered?

An MOI of 2 (based on Vero titration) was chosen as it empirically resulted in ~50% of cells becoming ICP4<sup>+</sup>. We have amended the manuscript to reflect this. The relevant part now reads: “HDFn were infected at an MOI of 2 (calculated based on virus titration on Vero cells, which are ~2-fold more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than HDFn). […] Note that we determined the genome:PFU ratio for our viral stock and found it to be 36 ± 4, suggesting that all the cells in the culture have likely encountered numerous virus particles.”</p><p>We have also added a section to the Materials and methods to make it clearer:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Measuring genomes to PFU ratio and determining MOI for experiments: We determined the amount of viral genomes in our viral stocks using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), a method that allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids.

This allowed the distinction of two cellular populations: cells which successfully initiated viral gene expression (ICP4<sup>+</sup>) and cells which did not (ICP4<sup>-</sup>). Of 1,814 cells exposed to HSV-1, 996 cells (55%) were ICP4<sup>+</sup> and 818 (45%) were ICP4<sup>-</sup>.

[…] We found that viral gene expression is negatively correlated with the cell-cycle score, with cells in the later parts of the cell-cycle expressing ~10-fold less viral genes than those in the early part of the cycle, in agreement with our previous finding in the H1299 cell-line.”</p><p>We have also provide a description for the cell-cycle score calculation and its out-regression in the Materials and methods section: “Cell-cycle regression: A list of 14 G2/M marker genes (HMGB2, CDK1, NUSAP1, UBE2C, BIRC5, TPX2, TOP2A, NDC80, CKS2, NUF2, CKS1B, MKI67, TMPO, CENPF) was used to construct a cell-cycle score (for every gene from the list expressed by the cell, +1 to the score). Regression of the cell-cycle score was done as described above for UMI regression (keeping the residual after linear model fitting).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Please include references to relevant papers such as Zhu and Jones, 2018, which shows that HSV1 viral production is inhibited upon treatment with iCRT14. It would be good also to cite other scRNA-seq papers on the sparsity of IFN induction in virus-infected cells, such as DOI 10.1128/JVI.01778-18 and DOI 10.1101/437277.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the suggested references.</p><p>“In accordance with its impact on late viral gene expression, β-catenin inhibition significantly reduced viral progeny formation (Figure 7F). This is in agreement with a recent report by Zhu and Jones showing iCRT14 reduced plaque formation in two other cell types (HLF and Vero) (Zhu and Jones, 2018).”</p><p>“This rare activation of anti-viral signaling seems to be widespread, as single-cell investigations into RNA viruses such as West-Nile virus (O’Neal et al., 2019) and Influenza (Russell et al., 2018a, 2018b) have reported similar findings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The expression of ISGs like IFIT1 and Mx2 which are produced in response to IFN-receptor signaling are most frequently analyzed. IRF3 activation is also examined and it would be helpful if the authors would discuss whether that was indicative of the cell-autonomous response, as one might conclude. This would help shed light on whether cells are detecting infection or just responding to signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point: “As previous population-level studies reported the activation of anti-viral genes during wild-type HSV-1 infection, we hypothesized that highly infected cells (Figure 2A, B, cluster 1) should be enriched for anti-viral genes. […] We thus conclude that wt HSV-1 infection efficiently blocks the induction of the anti-viral response and that the activation of anti-viral genes in population averaged measurements is the result of anti-viral signaling elicited in a rare population of abortively infected cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The argument that ISG expression is higher among low-virus expressing cells infected by deltaICP0 is not entirely convincing. It is true that in Figure 3D, all of the cells expressing ISGs are in clusters 1-3 (except two IFIT1-expressing cells in cluster 4 which are not accurately described in the text which says that no cluster 4 cells express ISGs). However, cluster 4 has many fewer cells, so maybe there just aren’t ISG expressing cells in that cluster by chance. Some statistics should be applied here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now more accurately described the data: “These cells had low viral gene expression levels and mostly belonged to clusters 1-3 (Figure 3C, D). Anti-viral signaling was not seen in highly-infected cells of cluster 4, with the exception of two cells expressing <italic>IFIT1</italic> (Figure 3C, D).”</p><p>We have now included p-values (from a Chi-square test) in the figure, showing that anti-viral gene expression by cells in cluster 4 is indeed significantly different than clusters 1-3.</p><p>Furthermore, to overcome the problem of different group sizes, we have performed a complementary analysis (now Figure 3—figure supplement 1), where we have compared two equal sized groups – taking the top and bottom 25% of cells, according to their HSV-1 gene expression. We have analyzed 23 ISGs, 21 of which show a significant decrease in expression in the cells with high HSV-1 gene expression, supporting our initial conclusion. This is described as follows: “As we have described above for the wild-type infected cells, we also compared a larger panel of ISGs in high vs low infected cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), with similar results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, Figure 2A, B, C appears to show a IFIT2 expressing cells with high viral expression. Please show additional data to strengthen the conclusions if available or obtainable.</p></disp-quote><p>This data is now presented in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and is described as follows: “When comparing a larger panel of ISGs (Interferon Stimulated Genes) in high vs low infected cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), most ISGs are in fact more highly expressed in cells with low HSV-1 gene expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear whether the cell clustering analysis was performed taking into account viral transcripts or not. Could you please compare cell clustering with mock cells performed in parallel?</p></disp-quote><p>We used both viral and host genes for clustering. We have now included a description of clustering in the Materials and methods: “Clustering and differential gene expression analysis: Cell were clustered using k-means clustering. […] A gene was considered differentially expressed if the FDR-corrected p-value was below 0.05.”</p><p>This is also stated in the figure legends.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ request, we have performed a joint analysis of mock and HSV-1 infected cells, taking into account both host and viral genes. The results show that highly-infected cells cluster separately from the rest of the cells, with low-infected and mock-infected cells clustering together. This is reported as follows: “The viral gene expression distribution was highly skewed, with most cells expressing low levels of viral transcripts and some cells expressing much higher levels (Figure 1E). A joint analysis of mock and wt-infected cells shows that highly-infected cells cluster separately from the mock-infected and low-infected cells, which are intermingled (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
