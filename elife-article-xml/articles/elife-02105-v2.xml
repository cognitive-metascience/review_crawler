sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. Post-translational modifications of the CTD coordinate the transcription cycle and various steps of mRNA maturation. Here we describe Tyr1 phosphorylation (Tyr1P) as a hallmark of promoter (5′ associated) Pol II in mammalian cells, in contrast to what was described in yeast. Tyr1P is predominantly found in antisense orientation at promoters but is also specifically enriched at active enhancers. Mutation of Tyr1 to phenylalanine (Y1F) prevents the formation of the hyper-phosphorylated Pol IIO form, induces degradation of Pol II to the truncated Pol IIB form, and results in a lethal phenotype. Our results suggest that Tyr1P has evolved specialized and essential functions in higher eukaryotes associated with antisense promoter and enhancer transcription, and Pol II stability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02105.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02105.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02105.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a gene is expressed, the DNA is first transcribed to produce an intermediate molecule called a messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated to produce a protein. RNA Polymerase II is an enzyme that makes mRNA molecules in organisms as diverse as plants, animals, and yeast.</p><p>RNA Polymerase II is a complex made of a number of proteins. The largest protein in this complex includes a ‘carboxy-terminal domain’ that has multiple repeats of seven amino acids one after the other. The first amino acid in each repeat, a tyrosine, is referred to as tyrosine-1. Adding various chemical tags to the amino acids in these repeats co-ordinates the steps involved in the transcription of genes. In yeast, for example, adding a phosphate group to tyrosine-1 seems to help the polymerase to proceed to make long mRNA molecules. However, it is not known what these chemical tags do in humans or other animals.</p><p>Now Descostes, Heidemann et al. (and independently Hsin et al.) have shown that the same phosphate groups on tyrosine-1 perform functions in vertebrates (animals with backbones) that are different to those performed in yeast. These functions include protecting the carboxy-terminal domain from being broken down inside cells, and transcribing the DNA that is upstream of genes.</p><p>Descostes, Heidemann et al. found that in human cells, RNA Polymerase II with phosphate groups on tyrosine-1 tends to bind to the beginning of genes. However, rather than moving along each gene and transcribing it, the polymerase then moves in the opposite (or ‘antisense’) direction to transcribe the DNA that is upstream of the gene. In most cases, however, the transcription of these ‘upstream antisense RNAs’ does not make a functional RNA molecule and transcription is paused. Furthermore, Descostes, Heidemann et al. found that when RNA Polymerase II that is not tagged with these phosphate groups is degraded in human cells, these cells rapidly die.</p><p>Descostes, Heidemann et al. also found that RNA Polymerase II with phosphate tags on tyrosine-1 also binds to, and transcribes, sections of DNA called ‘enhancers’, which are outside of the genes but that help to activate nearby genes. Importantly, these transcribed enhancers are those that work to define the type of cell and tissue—for example a white blood cell—that any given cell will become.</p><p>Future studies should help to answer remaining questions such as: how do these chemical tags affect the transcription of genes that are specific to certain tissue types? And do these tags on RNA Polymerase II help to direct cells to become specific cell types?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02105.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02105.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>carboxyl terminal domain</kwd><kwd>antisense transcription</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>initiation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spinelli</surname><given-names>Lionel</given-names></name><name><surname>Maqbool</surname><given-names>Muhammad Ahmad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fenouil</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FRM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Innocenti</surname><given-names>Charlène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministère de la Recherche/Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Descostes</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1064 and SFB684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heidemann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Schüller</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name><name><surname>Eick</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide analysis reveals novel functions for a post-translational modification to the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activity of RNA Polymerase (Pol) II is responsible for transcription of mRNAs and many noncoding RNAs. Essential for Pol II function is the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit Rpb1 that consists of a highly conserved YSPTSPS heptad repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heidemann et al., 2012</xref>). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the CTD coordinate both transcription cycle transitions and loading of RNA processing complexes. In the recent years, novel PTMs were described in addition to the well-known Ser5P and Ser2P associated with early transcription and elongation, respectively. These include Ser7P, involved in snRNA gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egloff et al., 2007</xref>), Thr4P associated to transcription elongation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hintermair et al., 2012</xref>) and to histone gene transcription in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsin et al., 2011</xref>), and Tyr1P that in yeast is found at gene body locations, consistent with a role in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>). This latter modification remains however so far uncharacterized in mammalian cells and we aimed at deciphering its function in human cells using biochemical and genome-wide approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To analyze expression and pattern of Tyr1P modified Pol II, we took advantage of our previously developed Tyr1P specific antibodies (3D12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>). We investigated various mouse and human cells and could detect Tyr1P in western blots for all examined lines, in most cases associated with the hyper-phosphorylated IIO form of Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address the function of Tyr1P, we next generated Raji cell lines expressing Pol II resistant to α-amanitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapman et al., 2004</xref>) and carrying either wild-type (WT) or a mutant Rpb1 gene with substitution of tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y1F) in CTD repeats 4 to 51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After expression of the mutant, we observed that Y1F yielded a truncated Rpb1 (Pol IIB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and was unable to form the hyper-phosphorylated IIO Pol II. After disruption of the activity of endogenous Pol II by α-amanitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and soon after disappearance of WT Rpb1, cells became rapidly inviable. This phenotype reveals an essential function of the Y1 residue that appears more drastic than T4A or S7A mutations, but comparable with that of S5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hintermair et al., 2012</xref>). We conclude that Tyr1P very likely contributes to stabilization of CTD and may occur early within the transcription cycle.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02105.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Y1F mutations of the CTD heptads yield a truncated Pol IIB Rpb1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rpb1-Y1F mutant was expressed after removal of tetracycline and in the presence of endogenous Rpb1.

We isolated significantly associated regions based on the signal distribution of the background-subtracted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and found that Pol II and all isoforms, including Tyr1P, correlated with transcription levels of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). At many gene locations, a predominant signal of Tyr1P at promoters was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We further confirmed this by genome-wide profiling of Pol II isoforms at coding-gene locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref> for Ser2P profile). Our profiling analysis shows that Tyr1P signal is predominantly found at promoters similarly to Ser5P, weak or essentially absent at gene bodies and weak at 3′ends in contrast to Ser2P elongating mark and Ser7P (associated to both promoters and gene bodies). These observations are further supported by quantification of signals at various genic sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) and reinforce our conclusion that human Tyr1P is mainly associated to promoters in an early, post-initiation step of transcription. Although we did not further investigate this possibility, in the accompanying manuscript, Hsin et al show that Chicken Tyr1 is found phosphorylated in the nucleoplasm, raising the possibility that Tyr1P is also associated with recruitment of the enzyme and transcription initiation.</p><p>Genomic profiling at the vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) indicates two main peaks of Pol II upstream and downstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These peaks most likely reflect sense and antisense paused transcription as evidenced by our short strand specific (ssRNA) sequencing analysis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>) for mammalian promoters. This transcription results in short promoter-associated transcripts production and might relate to pervasive transcription of promoters in sequence context lacking strong elements imposing directionality. By comparing the signals of these two peaks with that of the Ser5P and Ser7P isoforms, Tyr1P showed a clearly distinct pattern with a more pronounced upstream peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). We confirmed this result with an independent Tyr1P antibody (8G5) harboring wider range of CTD peptide recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), and by using statistical analysis showing that antisense/sense (AS/S) difference was significant for Tyr1P as compared to other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Together, our analyses indicate that Tyr1P is predominantly associated with upstream polymerases, mostly reflecting AS transcription at mammalian promoters.</p><p>We previously showed that mammalian promoters associated with Pol II can be grouped in three main classes in mouse T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>), based on ranking of the main Pol II signal from the most upstream to the most downstream of the TSS. We reproduced this result and the main features of the three groups in human Raji B-cells by ranking the signal of Tyr1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The first class (the majority of genes), with Pol II signals most upstream of TSSs, harbors strongly paused Pol II at promoters with high GC content and CpG islands (CGIs) and is associated with the highest level of bidirectional and AS transcription. The second class, with a sharper Pol II peak centered close to the TSS and lower GC content, contains mostly mono-directional sense paused transcription whereas the third class contains more downstream Pol II with less pause. We then focused our attention on class I that contains most AS short RNAs. In this class, Tyr1P is essentially observed in AS while Ser5P, Ser7P, or total Pol II generally show a second peak around the TSS reflecting sense and therefore bidirectional transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This indicates that AS Tyr1P relates to one specific class of promoters and suggests that in AS orientation, Tyr1P associates mainly with the leading edge of Pol II. Pleading for this hypothesis, the location of the AS Tyr1P in class I is found more downstream on average as compared to Pol II or Ser5P, and locates just after the −2 nucleosome midpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). A more detailed investigation of the individual positions of phospho-isoforms further shows that for the majority of promoters significantly associated with AS short RNAs in class I, Tyr1P is either located at the immediate proximity or after the main Pol II peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggesting that it might play a role in early elongation. Although Ser7P displayed similar characteristics, its influence on transcription of coding genes is likely to be minor, as Ser7 mutations do not show significant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>) or transcriptome impairment (JCA and DE, unpublished observations). We overall conclude that Tyr1P is a CTD PTM that associates with the 5′ end of genes and shows a stronger linkage to paused Pol II at promoters with bidirectional and AS transcription.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02105.014</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tyr1 is preferentially phosphorylated in antisense orientation on a particular subset of genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmaps of Tyr1P (3D12), Pol II, Ser5P, Ser7P, nucleosome midpoints (positioning) and short strand specific RNAs (red for AS and blue for S signal) at promoters with a significant level of Pol II.

To investigate if Tyr1P can be detected at enhancers, we first isolated intergenic regions (IGRs) with stringent criteria in B-cells using Pol II, H3K4me1, and me3 signals. These were further discriminated from noncoding promoters using the relative ratio of H3K4me1/me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pekowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and from both unannotated coding and some long intergenic noncoding genes using the absence of H3K36me3 that marks gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guttman et al., 2009</xref>). Using these criteria, we isolated 390 B-cells enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Our selection was further validated using tissue-specificity analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) indicating IGRs associated with genes specific to B-cells. We next performed profiling of the various Pol II isoforms at these enhancers. As before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koch et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that these IGRs were associated with Ser5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) but not with Ser2P Pol II (not shown) as well as with short transcripts (reflecting paused transcription) and a discrete nucleosome depleted region. Consistent with early elongating Pol II at enhancers, we found signal for both Ser7P and Tyr1P at these IGRs. Importantly, Tyr1P appeared more bound to enhancers as compared to promoters and total Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that Tyr1 is more phosphorylated than Ser5 or Ser7 at enhancers and represent a hallmark of these essential areas of the genome. Additionally, Tyr1P also displayed the best correlation with Pol II at isolated enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, using an independent selection for active enhancers based on H3K27ac brought very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These findings contrast with features of Tyr1P in yeast, which is located at gene bodies and proposed to play a role in elongation by impairing termination factor recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayer et al., 2012</xref>). These apparent discrepancies thus provide an interesting paradigm whereby a conserved PTM has evolved to display specialized functions specific to metazoans. However, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes are very compact, mostly devoid of introns and promoters structure is also extremely divergent in both length and sequence between yeast (around 100–200 nt, AT-rich) and mammals (around 1000 nt, GC-rich). Furthermore, enhancers do not exist per se in yeast. In an accompanying manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsin et al. (2014)</xref> describe similar observations regarding stability of Y1F mutant in chicken cells and involvement of Tyr1P in AS transcription at promoters, thus providing further evidence that our observations are conserved in vertebrates. We therefore speculate that differential CTD PTMs might not only reflect, but also play a role in regulating the directionality of transcription. How would Tyr1P behave in organisms with less prominent bidirectional transcription at promoters such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Core et al., 2012</xref>) thus represents an interesting evolutionary question to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Based on the spatial location of Tyr1P in class I promoters, mostly found at the leading edge of Pol II in opposite orientation of the gene, it is tempting to speculate that this PTM might be involved in a transcriptional state marking the transition between early and productive elongation, providing a checkpoint for transcriptional complexes to proceed in productive elongation. Depending on the level of Tyr1P at promoters, Pol II might become competent for elongation as well as for overcoming the nucleosomal barrier both in sense and antisense orientation. Since less Pol II molecules are able to effectively enter elongation in AS orientation, more accumulation of the Tyr1P could be observed upstream of the TSS toward the leading edge of Pol II. This could also explain degradation of Y1F mutant that is due to absence of Tyr1P checkpoint signal, would accumulate around the edge of the promoters and become degraded. Finally there could also be a link between hyperphosphorylation of Tyr1 in AS orientation and exosome machinery recruitment to degrade nascent RNA prior release of the Pol II enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Preker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, after both 5′ and 3′ adapter ligation, resulting cDNA library was PCR amplified with 14 amplification cycles. Purified library DNA was run on a 10% TBE-PAGE gel and library DNA corresponding to transcripts between 15 nt and 50 nt was cut from the gel and transferred into 0.5 ml tubes with punctured bottoms which were in turn placed in 2 ml collection tubes.

Correlations between biological replicates used in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Whenever 2 replicates were not fitting a minimal good signal/noise or reproducible signal, samples were discarded from analysis and experiment reproduced. For the processing, briefly, piles of tags with same coordinates, due to artifacts of PCR or unannotated regions of the genome were removed according to a thresholding method, except for RNA-seq experiment. Uniquely aligned tags were further elongated after estimating optimal elongation size <italic>in silico</italic> and enabling to use the original fragment length for further processing. For ChIP-seq experiments, all samples were input subtracted and signals were scaled. For nucleosome mapping, MNAse-seq experiment in Raji was sequenced in paired-end with higher depth than ChIP-seq in Hiseq2000. Two types of analyses were applied to this data: nucleosomes density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and nucleosomes midpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that allow to score more specifically for depletion or positioning, respectively. For nucleosome density, paired tags were processed so to be directly connected and to retrieve original fragments (orphan tags were connected to the corresponding pairs using the estimated elongation size computed as described above). The input subtraction step was omitted. For nucleosomes midpoint analyses, the middle of elongated fragments was set as reference allowing locating the maximum signal approximately at the midpoint of the nucleosomes (dyads). For all experiments, the number of tags covering each nucleotide of the genome was computed and averaged in bins of 50 nucleotides and in bins of 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Regions were centered on H3K4me3 maximal values and discarding regions having short RNAs outliers finally gives active enhancers and control promoters (E5′/P5′, 927/5946) and a whole set of enhancers and control promoters (E6′/P6′, 2598/6057).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-8"><title>Tissue specificity analysis</title><p>To assess the tissue specificity of genes associated with identified enhancers and promoters of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>, we proceeded as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koch et al.

Briefly, using bioGPS website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/#goto=welcome">http://biogps.org/#goto=welcome</ext-link>), a Gene Atlas averaged dataset of expression values based on HGU133 array for human containing 84 tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Su et al., 2004</xref>) was used. The expression values of genes nearest to selected enhancers and promoters were compared to the whole dataset and the significance of differences was assessed with a nonparametric statistical Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Bars of expression levels were sorted by p-values and the 10 most differentially expressed tissues are shown.

When several probes indicated expression of a single Refseq gene, the median of expression was attributed to the corresponding Refseq ID. Refseq genes were then ordered by expression removing genes at less than 2 kb from another and particular categories of genes were removed as described in ‘Materials and methods–Gene selection and average binding profiles’. Corresponding ChIP-seq and short ssRNA-seq signals were retrieved on the ordered genes and represented with heatmaps at 1 kb around TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, outliers were discarded. As mentioned above, colors were scaled using Java Treeview software. Profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and boxplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2CD</xref>) were built as described in ‘Materials and methods–Gene selection and average binding profiles and Boxplots and statistical tests’.

They were reduced to values at ± 500 bp around TSS and the list of genes limited to group 1. Maximal value indexes of Tyr1P signal were first retrieved. To avoid ambiguities in interpretation in our relative Pol II and isoforms positions in class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we analyzed those genes that belonged to class I and that clearly featured AS transcription. For this, mean values of short ssRNA experiments were computed at −50/+100 bp around Tyr1P detected maximal peaks. Genes having a significant level of antisense RNAs were kept using the mean distribution and thresholding as described in ‘Materials and methods–Gene selection and average binding profiles’. Only annotations with a level of antisense RNAs higher than sense RNAs were kept performing a one sided nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistical test (p-value &lt;0.05). A total of 529 genes were selected. Then, maximal peaks detection for the other marks was computed at −100/+100 bp around Tyr1P signal. For each maximal peak of each experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, the distances to maximal peaks of Tyr1P and Pol II were computed. The R package rgl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rgl.neoscientists.org/about.shtml">http://rgl.neoscientists.org/about.shtml</ext-link>) was used for 3D representation of the maximal peaks according to the distance to TSS, to Pol II and their values.</p><p>To assess if distances retrieved were not originating from background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), distances to Pol II of selected genes of (A) on 500 bp before TSS (representing the AS region) were compared to the total set of genes (keeping only genes at more than 2000 bp from any RefSeq annotations).
