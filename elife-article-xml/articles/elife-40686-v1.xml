variations. We isolated <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that improved tolerance to dietary saturated fat in a sensitized genetic background, including eight alleles of the novel gene <italic>fld-1</italic> that encodes a homolog of the human TLCD1 and TLCD2 transmembrane proteins. FLD-1 is localized on plasma membranes and acts by limiting the levels of highly membrane-fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. Human TLCD1/2 also regulate membrane fluidity by limiting the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing membrane phospholipids. FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 do not regulate the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids but rather limit their incorporation into phospholipids. We conclude that inhibition of FLD-1 or TLCD1/2 prevents lipotoxicity by allowing increased levels of membrane phospholipids that contain fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

This is because the outer edge of our cells, known as the cell membrane, is built mostly from the fats found in our diet. Yet, there is a possible problem with this situation. Based on their chemical make-up, fats can be classed as saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats, like those in butter, pack closely together and tend to be solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats, like oils from vegetables and fish, pack together more loosely, making them runny. This means that eating too much saturated fat can cause our cell membranes to become unhealthily rigid, while too much unsaturated fat may make them too fluid.</p><p>To avoid these problems, cells can manage the fat content of their membranes, even as the diet fluctuates. Certain proteins alert cells when the membrane is too rigid, and the cells respond by converting saturated fats in the membrane into unsaturated fats. Previous research has found a few of these proteins in humans and nematode worms, but it was not clear what would happen if these sensors were not present or not working as they should. Could other proteins monitor the membrane too?</p><p>To answer this question, Ruiz, Bodhicharla, Svensk et al. took nematode worms that could not make the known sensor proteins and used genetic methods that stop them producing various other proteins too. The mutant worms were then fed a diet rich in saturated fats, and the effect on the fats in the cell membrane was measured. From these experiments, new proteins were found that regulate the composition of fats in cell membranes. In the worms, it turns out that a protein called FLD-1 normally limits the amount of unsaturated fats in the membrane. Stopping the worms from producing this protein made the membrane less rigid. The same applied in human cells with proteins called TLCD1 and TLCD2. More unsaturated fats were incorporated when these two proteins were removed, restoring the membranes to a healthy state despite the cells being grown in the presence of excess saturated fat. Together, these findings suggest that targeting these proteins could potentially lead to new treatments for diseases like diabetes, where cell membranes are too rigid.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane fluidity</kwd><kwd>phospholipid</kwd><kwd>lipotoxicity</kwd><kwd>fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</kwd><kwd>forward genetics</kwd><kwd>membrane homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009479</institution-id><institution>Kungl.

Today we find numerous instances of membrane composition adaptation to environmental conditions such as temperature, pH or pressure across all of life’s diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siliakus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guschina and Harwood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cossins and Macdonald, 1989</xref>). Further, the specific composition of subcellular membranes is of paramount importance for many cellular processes ranging from vesicular trafficking to organelle homeostasis and receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>). In particular, recent studies suggest important roles for specific polyunsaturated lipids in membrane deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>), domain stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levental et al., 2016</xref>) and membrane fission events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manni et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that many disease states are associated with membrane composition defects. Diabetics, for example, have rigid cellular membranes rich in saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borkman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kröger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baba et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Winocour et al., 1990</xref>) that likely contribute to many aspects of the pathophysiology of this disease such as poor microcirculation and impaired insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gianfrancesco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pilon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samuel and Shulman, 2012</xref>), and may be a useful diagnostic criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordelli et al., 2018</xref>). Membrane properties also influence important aspects of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicolson, 2015</xref>) and changes in membrane composition correlate with transformation, for example in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hilvo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dória et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the precise composition of membrane phospholipids influences the activity of many membrane proteins and must often be balanced against possible trade-offs. For example, the levels of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs; i.e. fatty acids of 18 or more carbons and at least two double bonds) are critical for the activity of TRP channels that regulate blood pressure in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caires et al., 2017</xref>) or mechanosensation in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vásquez et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, these same LCPUFAs are highly prone to peroxidation via Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, and therefore represent a liability for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given its central and far-reaching importance, it is surprising that so little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane composition and fluidity, a term used throughout this article as a proxy for membrane properties that include fluidity, phase behavior, thickness, curvature, intrinsic curvature and lateral pressure profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Radanović et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mouritsen, 2011</xref>). New or improved methods, such as lipidomic analysis of membrane composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Löfgren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ivanova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ståhlman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Triebl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurowski et al., 2017</xref>), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and other methods to measure membrane fluidity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maekawa and Fairn, 2014</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Los Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Devkota and Pilon, 2018</xref>), molecular modelling of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkowitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>) and powerful genetic approaches in bacteria, yeast and animals have recently led to the identification of regulators of membrane homeostasis, and elucidation of their mechanism of action. The prototypical fluidity regulator is the prokaryotic DesK protein, which acts as a fluidity sensor that changes conformation depending on membrane thickness, hence switching between its phosphatase and kinase activities and thus regulating its target, a fatty acid desaturase that promotes membrane fluidity when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saita and de Mendoza, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abriata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cybulski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inda et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, the protein Mga2 senses membrane saturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of phospholipid synthesis, via its transmembrane helix, thereby regulating the OLE pathway that promotes fatty acid desaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Covino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballweg and Ernst, 2017</xref>). Similarly IRE1, which is also located in the ER, maintains membrane homeostasis by responding to changes in lipid order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Radanović et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Maintenance of membrane homeostasis in animals is especially challenging since their structural fatty acids (FAs) are primarily obtained from a highly variable diet. For example, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> daily replaces nearly 80% of its membrane phospholipids using mostly dietary fatty acids as building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dancy et al., 2015</xref>). Given the great variation in dietary composition and the narrow membrane composition range optimal for cellular functions, it is evident that robust regulatory mechanisms must exist that adjust FA composition and compensate for dietary variation. We have previously leveraged the power of forward genetics in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> to demonstrate that the proteins PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 act as sensors in the plasma membrane that are essential to promote fatty acid desaturation and restore fluidity during cold adaptation or when fed diets rich in membrane-rigidifying saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Svensk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Svensk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Svensson et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the human AdipoR1/2 that are homologs of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PAQR-2, also regulate membrane fluidity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodhicharla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>). Given the importance of membrane homeostasis, we reasoned that other regulatory pathways likely exist to ensure its robust maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>fld-1</italic> mutations suppress membrane fluidity defects</title><p>We used forward genetics in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to isolate novel mutants that suppress the lethality phenotypes of strains with membrane homeostasis defects.

In all, over 100 000 mutagenized haploid genomes were screened, leading to the isolation of 15 independent mutants that suppress the glucose intolerance of the sensitized strains. The mutants were outcrossed several times to remove unwanted mutations and their genomes sequenced, which revealed eight novel alleles of <italic>fld-1</italic> (<italic>membrane <underline>fl</underline>ui<underline>d</underline>ity homeostasis-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>), a previously uncharacterized gene; the other mutations affect different genes and remain uncharacterized. Introducing a wild-type <italic>fld-1</italic> transgene abolished the suppression, demonstrating that the novel <italic>fld-1</italic> alleles are loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

TLCD1 and TLCD2 do not regulate the uptake of exogenous SFAs since there is no difference in the uptake rate of labelled PA in HEK293 cells treated with siRNA against either gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2J</xref>). The SFA content in the TAGs of PA-treated HEK293 cells is also unaffected by TLCD1 or TLCD2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2K</xref>), as is their TAG/PC ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2L</xref>) and Nile red staining of lipid stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2M–N</xref>), suggesting no effect on either uptake or sequestering of FAs. The expression levels of the desaturases SCD and FADS1-3 are also not increased by TLCD1 or TLCD2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2O</xref>) ruling this out as a mechanism for the fluidizing effect; indeed, the SCD expression is downregulated in TLCD1 or TLCD2 knockdown which may reflect a decreased demand on their activity.</p><p>The most likely mechanisms of action for TLCD1/2 is that they either act by limiting the production of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids or by promoting their turnover, thus echoing our speculations regarding FLD-1 function in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> This conclusion is supported by the marked increase in the abundance of the 18:2, 20:5 and 22:6 LCPUFAs in the PEs of TLCD1 knockdown cells, and of the 18:2, 18:3 and 20:5 LCPUFAs in the PCs of TLCD2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). No other major changes were observed in the lipid profiles of TLCD1/2 knockdown cells. Specifically, there were no large differences in the FA composition of PCs or PEs under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>), in the PC/PE ratio and cholesterol content under basal or PA-challenged conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>), or in the ceramide levels which were dramatically increased upon cultivation in PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E–H</xref>). Note that, as in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the lipidomic analysis was performed on whole cells, and thus reflects global lipid composition rather than the composition of any specific membrane.</p><p>Cultivating HEK293 cells in the presence of exogenous EPA leads to its excess accumulation in PCs and PEs when TLCD2 is knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), which demonstrates that, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, de novo PUFA synthesis is not required for the TLCD2 effect on PUFA-containing phospholipids; no change in TAG storage or EPA storage in TAGs occurred upon TLCD2 knockdown, indicating that TLCD2 does not regulate fatty acid storage or LCPUFA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3I–J</xref>). The effect of TLCD2 knockdown on phospholipid EPA levels is especially interesting since LCPUFAs are very potent fluidizing lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), which we confirmed experimentally in our cell system where as little as 1 μM of EPA or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents membrane rigidification by 400 μM PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Note that caution should be taken when quantitatively interpreting these types of experiments since the uptake, metabolism, incorporation, subcellular localization and turnover of the lipids being compared may differ substantially.</p><p>We then considered whether the TLCDs may act by limiting the generation of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids or by promoting their turnover. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we incubated HEK293 cells in the presence of the <sup>13</sup>C-labeled LCPUFA LA (18:2) and monitored its incorporation and clearance rate in control cells or cells where either TLCD1 or TLCD2 had been knocked down. The results show that TLCD2 knockdown caused increased incorporation of LA in PCs and PEs within 6 hr of incubation, and that increased incorporation was also evident by 24 hr in the PEs of TLCD1 and TLCD2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>). No obvious differences were observed in the TLCD1/2 knockdown cells during the chase part of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3K–L</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that the primary function of TLCD1 and TLCD2 is to limit the formation of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids rather than promote their turnover.</p><p>Finally, we further confirmed functional conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> FLD-1 and mammalian TLCD1/2 in several ways. Firstly, we found that TLCD2 siRNA protects against the potentiated rigidifying effects of PA when the FADS2 desaturase is knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3M</xref>), just as the <italic>fld-1</italic> mutation suppressed the effects of the <italic>fat-2</italic> mutation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; this also strengthens the conclusion that TLCD2 acts independently from the desaturases. We also found that TLCD2 knockdown suppresses membrane rigidification in HEK293 cells where AdipoR2 had been knocked down, which by itself increases the sensitivity to the effect of PA on membrane rigidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This again echoes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> findings where <italic>fld-1 lof</italic> mutations suppress the membrane rigidity phenotype of the <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutant. As noted earlier, TLCD2 knockdown causes a strong increase in the levels of EPA in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is a potent fluidizing LCPUFA: 5 μM are sufficient to completely protect AdipoR2 knockdown cells from the rigidifying effects of 200 μM PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The present study shows that <italic>fld-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and TLCD1/2 in mammalian cells, potentiate the toxicity of exogenous SFAs, and act by limiting the generation of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids (see the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The net result of mutations in <italic>fld-1</italic> or knockdown of TLCD1/2 is therefore an increase in LCPUFA-containing phospholipids, which helps maintain membrane fluidity in the presence of exogenous SFAs. In particular, LCPUFAs, which are present in elevated levels in the worm <italic>fld-1</italic> mutant and in human HEK293 cells with knockdown of either TLCD1 or TLCD2, are potent membrane fluidizers, as we have shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in agreement with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).

The present study shows that an alternative route to promote membrane fluidity is to inhibit FLD-1, for example by mutation, which results in reduced turnover of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids, hence allowing their accumulation. The names of mammalian homologs for PAQR-2 and FLD-1 are indicated in parenthesis; the mammalian homolog of IGLR-2 is not yet identified. The possibility that PAQR-2 regulates FLD-1 (dashed line) is suggested by the fact that <italic>lof </italic>mutations in <italic>fld-1</italic> suppress <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutant phenotypes; there is at present no evidence for physical interactions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40686-fig6-v1"/></fig><p>Structurally, the FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 proteins are characterized by the presence of a TLC domain and are therefore distantly related to the ER-localized ceramide synthases (human CERS1-6) and to the translocation associated membrane proteins (human TRAM1, TRAM2 and TRAM1L1) involved in membrane protein synthesis in the rough ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pewzner-Jung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winter and Ponting, 2002</xref>). Other TLC domain-containing proteins exist (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) but their function remains unclear, though some are suggested to act in lipid sensing, transport or synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winter and Ponting, 2002</xref>). In contrast to the CERSs and TRAMs, FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 are localized to the plasma membrane rather than in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Papanayotou et al., 2013</xref>). This, and the fact that they lack critical motifs, indicate that FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 are neither ceramide synthases nor translocation associated proteins. Instead, their localization and effect on PUFA content in membrane phospholipids suggest that they act at the level of the plasma membrane by limiting the amounts of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids. It is possible, for example, that FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 influence substrate selection by phospholipases or lysophospholipid acyltransferases, that is regulating the Lands cycle through which phospholipids are actively remodelled by fatty acid exchange and hence effectively influence membrane composition and properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shindou et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, the presence of several membrane-bound acyl transferases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest a promising avenue of genetic interaction studies to test their possible connection to FLD-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Note however that the plasma membrane localisation of FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 makes a direct control of lysophospholipid acyltransferases, which are believed to localize in internal membranes, notably the ER, rather unlikely.</p><p>The type of LCPUFAs that are elevated in the <italic>C. elegans fld-1</italic> mutant and in HEK293 treated with siRNA against TLCD1/2 could have other effects besides influencing membrane fluidity. In particular LCPUFAs can serve as precursors for many signalling lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Funk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watts, 2016</xref>). That <italic>fld-1</italic> has its primary effects on membrane fluidity is however supported by several lines of evidence, much of which hinges on the fact that <italic>fld-1</italic> mutants act as <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> suppressors. This is important because the <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> mutants clearly have membrane fluidity defects since: a) They are sensitive to membrane-rigidifying conditions (cold or exogenous SFAs); b) Their mutant phenotypes are suppressed by other mutations that promote an increase in fluidizing UFAs, by exogenous UFAs or by fluidizing amounts of mild detergents (NP-40 or Triton X-100); c) The <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> mutants have an excess of membrane-rigidifying SFA-containing phospholipids; and d) The <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> phenotypes are closely associated with reduced membrane fluidity measured in vivo using FRAP under numerous different experimental conditions or genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Svensk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Svensk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Svensson et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, siRNA against AdipoR2 causes an increase in phospholipid SFAs and reduced membrane fluidity in the presence of exogenous palmitate as determined using FRAP or the Laurdan dye method, and siRNA against TLCD1/2 suppresses this membrane fluidity defect.</p><p>The effect of TLCD1/2 on plasma membrane composition likely explains the published observations that TLCD1 facilitates the activity of calcium channels that are essential during neural plate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Papanayotou et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, membrane composition can have strong effects on a variety of processes including insulin secretion by beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">MacDonald et al., 2015</xref>), glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ginsberg et al., 1982</xref>), endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krischer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Illinger et al., 1991</xref>), regulation of metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hulbert and Else, 2000</xref>), platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Winocour et al., 1990</xref>) and TRPV channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caires et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, given the chemical instability of PUFAs, which are readily peroxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catalá, 2013</xref>), it seems natural for cells to have mechanisms that limit their levels. Indeed, we found that the <italic>C. elegans fld-1</italic> mutant exhibits an enhanced oxidative stress response when challenged with the LCPUFA LA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6J–L</xref>), which indicates a function for <italic>fld-1</italic> in preventing such PUFA-derived oxidative stress. The ubiquitous plasma membrane expression of <italic>C. elegans fld-1</italic> suggests that it functions in most cells, though it is not required under non-challenging conditions given the relative health of the mutant.</p><p>The present work further establishes that a function of <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is to prevent SFA lipotoxicity, and specifically to prevent membrane rigidification by SFAs, and further suggests that they may act via two separate pathways: 1) Upregulation of desaturases to promote membrane fluidity; and 2) Inhibition of <italic>fld-1</italic> directly or of a <italic>fld-1</italic>-regulated pathway. This conclusion is supported by the existence of two classes of <italic>paqr-2</italic> suppressors: mutations that activate desaturases (e.g. <italic>gof</italic> mutations in <italic>nhr-49</italic> or <italic>mdt-15</italic>, and <italic>lof</italic> mutations in <italic>sams-1, cept-1</italic>, <italic>pcyt-1, ech-7</italic> or <italic>hacd-1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Svensk et al., 2013</xref>) and loss-of-function mutations in <italic>fld-1</italic>, which does not act by upregulating desaturases though it depends on their activity (present work). The suggestion that <italic>paqr-2</italic> may influence <italic>fld-1</italic> activity is raised only as a possibility consistent with the observed genetic interactions; we have at present no biochemical evidence that these proteins interact with each other nor do we know of a mechanism by which <italic>paqr-2</italic> could regulate <italic>fld-1</italic>.</p><p>We propose that inhibitors of TLCD1/2 may have therapeutic potential in instances of lipotoxicity and excess membrane rigidity, which is a feature of the diabetic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pilon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perona, 2017</xref>), or in instances of mutations in AdipoR1 that cause retina defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rice et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Ernst (Reviewer #2). Two other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>All three reviewers have provided detailed and thoughtful reviews, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration.</p><p>Overall the reviewers were in broad agreement about the interest of the work and the high quality and compelling nature of the genetic analysis. They also identified a number of weaknesses that they felt needed to be addressed prior to publication. In particular the evidence for the localisation of FLD-1 and its mammalian orthologs, and the effects of the mutations on the levels of cholesterol needs to be addressed more clearly. In addition they felt that your description of what the data show and the citation of the literature need to be more accurate, and some of the statistical analysis needs to be improved. These seem the key points, but the more minor points they make also seem valid and hopefully most can be addressed by changes to the text.</p><p>If you can address all of the reviewers' points, and provide a point-by-point description of your revisions, then I would be happy to consult them again to ask if the paper is now of acceptable quality.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors conduct an extensive genetic approach in worms to characterize the FLD-1 protein and then performed experiments with mammalian cells to study the FLD-1 homologues, TLCD1 and TLCD2. Together with careful lipidomics data and measurements of plasma membrane dynamics by FRAP experiment, this study suggests that these mysterious transmembrane proteins prevent excessive incorporation of polyunsaturated acyl chains into phospholipids, notably PE and PC. When these proteins are deleted or silenced, PUFAs incorporation is increased, which can protect cells from the rigidification effect of lipid saturation (e.g. under the presence of glucose or at low temperature). Although the exact molecular activities of TLCD1/2 and FLD-1 remains unknown, this study is very original and the data are compelling. As this family exists in many organisms, the work should interest a wide audience.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Plasma membrane localization of FLD1. This localization is inferred from confocal images using a GFP construct (Figures 2F and Figure 1—figure supplement 4). I notice that the cells shown in Figure 2F have a prominent nucleus, making the cytoplasm volume minimal. Therefore, I'm not entirely convinced that the protein is at the plasma membrane. Wouldn't a protein present in the cortical ER give a similar localization pattern? This is important because, functionally, the localization of FLD1 at the plasma membrane is puzzling considering that lipid synthesis and remodeling is believed to occur mostly in internal membranes (notably ER). How can FLD1 affects fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids if the protein is not in the same membrane as lysophospholipid acyl transferases? See also my remark on the mammalian proteins.</p><p>2) The genetic characterization in Figures 2 and 3 is extensive and compelling, showing a clear rescue effect of various <italic>fld-1</italic> mutants on the defects induced by temperature or glucose on the growth and morphology of worm mutants for the PAQR-2 and/or IGLR-2 proteins. The genetic interactions tested in Figures 2D-F and 3E suggest that FLD-1 acts by a pathway different from the previously described pathway, which relies on the overexpression of a FA desaturase. Instead, they suggest a genetic interaction with the desaturases <italic>fat-6</italic> or <italic>fat-7</italic> (please comment on the lack of interaction with <italic>fat-5</italic>; Figure 3E). How about acyl transferases e.g. MBOA-6?</p><p>3) Related to the previous point. At least in text or perhaps through further genetic studies, the authors should try to connect their work with recent studies on the families of acyltransferases responsible for the incorporation of fatty acids with defined level of unsaturation (e.g. PMID:28578316 and others studies by the Shimizu group), as well as on recent attempts to better characterize the molecular properties of polyunsaturated phospholipids in membranes (e.g. Pinot et al., 2014 for endocytosis).</p><p>4) The lipidomic analysis on the acyl chain profile performed on phosphatidylethanolamine is also compelling. Under glucose, the <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutant accumulates saturated PE at the expense of polyunsaturated PE, an effect that is inverted by the further introduction of the <italic>fld-1</italic> mutation, notably in combination with mutation of the <italic>mdt-15</italic> gene. The data under conditions of a saturated diet (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D) are also impressive. The authors, however, might mention that the plasma membrane accounts for only a minor part of the total cellular membranes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the plasma membrane is the only one to be affected in its acyl chain profile. The lipidomic analysis is performed on cells or tissues, not on plasma membrane, which is technically much more demanding.</p><p>5) For mammalian cells, would it be possible to further study the sub-localization of the FLD-1 homologues (TLCD1 and TLCD2).</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>6) I am not sure I understood the experiments shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2O and the associated conclusion. Is there an effect of silencing TLCD1 or TLCD2 on desaturases expression?</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The running title is: TLCD1/2 limit LCPUFAs. It should be TLCD1/2 limit LCPUFA incorporation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This genetic study describes the identification of an important modulator of the membrane lipid composition in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells. Building on previous work by the same group, in which the plasma membrane-localized PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 proteins have been identified as an important modulators of fatty acid desaturases, the authors used genetic screens in <italic>paqr-2</italic> and <italic>iglr-2</italic> mutant backgrounds to identify other regulatory factors. The genetic evidence for <italic>fld-1</italic> being an important suppressor of <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutant variants employing a distinct mechanism is very convincing. Furthermore, the authors present data that <italic>fld-1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in plasma membranes and that <italic>fld-1</italic> mutant alleles suppress a series of membrane-related defects observed in <italic>paqr-2</italic> cells, but do not seem to affect membrane properties and membrane-related phenotypes in a wildtype background. The phenotypes include membrane fluidity (as tested by FRAP experiments), worm length, and the acyl chain composition of membrane lipid. Lipidomic analysis provides strong evidence that <italic>fld-1</italic> limits the level of long chain polyunsaturated membrane lipids and that <italic>fld-1</italic> mutants increase it.</p><p>Knockdown experiments of the mammalian TLCD1 and TLCD2 proteins identify similar effects on the membrane lipid composition and membrane fluidity in HEK293 cells stressed by palmitic acid provided with the medium. Pulse-labeling experiment suggest that the production/formation of polyunsaturated acyl chain-containing lipids is increased in <italic>fld-1</italic> mutants thereby leading to the conclusion that <italic>fld-1</italic> is a key regulator of polyunsaturated lipid homeostasis.</p><p>Without any doubt, this manuscript identifies <italic>fld-1</italic> and TLCD1/2 as important contributors to membrane homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells. The technical quality and presentation of the data is very good. The conclusions of the manuscript are justified and provide an important, new link for a better understanding of membrane lipids in health and disease. After a revision of the manuscript based on the points discussed below, I can recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Strength/Weaknesses:</p><p>Even though the number of weaknesses outnumbers the number of strengths, I consider this manuscript as an excellent study with potentially very high impact on a much broader scientific community in the future.</p><p>Strength 1: This manuscript represents a thorough genetic dissection of the pathways involved with membrane homeostasis paired with an extensive phenotypic characterization including lipidomic analyses.</p><p>Strength 2: The technical quality of the data is very high and support the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>Strength 3: The authors provide compelling and carefully controlled data from two distinct model systems: <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells.</p><p>Weakness 1: The literature referenced in the Introduction and Discussion does often not suit the purpose. Many papers referred to in the text report correlative observations, but are cited in way to make a statement. Only few studies mentioned in the text provide the original, clear-cut, biochemical or biophysical studies for the point being made. In some instances, there seems to be a discrepancy between the cited reference and the statement made in the text. This must be improved.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Weijers, 2016: The role of membrane 'flexibility' on microcirculation does not become clear to the reader. The term 'flexibility' lacks a clear physical definition.</p><p>Weijers, 2012 is a review article with similar content as Weijers, 2016, while other highly influential references such as (e.g. PMID: 22385956) or original literature linking the membrane lipid composition to diabetes are missing.</p><p>Taraboletti et al., 1989 and Sherbet, 1989 do not justify the statement that defects in membrane are hallmarks of cancer. Taraboletti et al., 1989 provides only a correlative argument, while the Abstract of Sherbet, 1989 even states 'Steady-state fluorescence polarization […] does not suggest marked differences in bulk 'fluidity' of metastatic variant'.</p><p>Fecchio, Palazzi and de Laureto, 2018 primarily discusses the folding of α-synuclein in the presence of high concentration of free polyunsaturated fatty acids and in the absence of cellular membranes. This is not a suitable model to imply functions of PUFAs in neurodegenerative diseases. The role of α-synuclein in interacting with cellular membranes and regulating vesicular traffic is not being discussed at all in this context.</p><p>Other recent studies, which suggest important roles in specific polyunsaturated lipids in membrane deformation (PMID:25104391), domain stability (PMID: 27119640), membrane fission events (PMID: 29543154). Potential players important for mediated the regulated production/conversion of membrane lipids in <italic>fld-1</italic> cells are not discussed (PMID: 18782225; PMID: 18094042; PMID: 7174678). I suggest that the authors carefully revisit their list of references used in the Introduction and the Discussion.</p><p>Weakness 2: The concept of membrane fluidity is highly prevalent in biology and serves as a wonderful descriptor of membrane biophysics, which is also intuitively understood by a broader readership. However, I do not find any clear evidence in this manuscript (nor in the cited references) that membrane fluidity is indeed the critical factor in the context of the observed phenotypes. The role of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids has gained increasing attention in the past years (see below) and the authors could do a better job in highlighting these developments in light of their data.</p><p>The authors should clearly indicate that membrane fluidity is used as a readily available descriptor of a membrane property. A separate paragraph should discuss that also other membrane properties are greatly affected by lipids with polyunsaturated fatty acid chains and that it is not clear, which of these membrane properties are most relevant for the observed phenotypes observed in genetic experiments.</p><p>Weakness 3: The important role of FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 is being established, but the potential targets of FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 are neither discussed, nor is there any speculation on how a signal from FLD-1 or TLCD1/2 might be transmitted to regulate the production/formation of very long chain polyunsaturated lipids. The authors should provide some more insight in how the communication between the plasma membrane bound proteins and their effector functions is being established. A direct regulation of FLD-1 by PAQR-2 is indicated in Figure 6, but I cannot find evidence that supports this speculation. Do the authors suggest a direct regulation or rather an indirect one via the fluidity (or other properties) of the plasma membrane?</p><p>How can a plasma membrane embedded protein send a signal that affects the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into lipids? Does it signal go to the ER, to the nucleus, or to the plasma membrane? Is there any indication for a transcriptional response or for a signaling molecule/second messenger/post-translational modification that might transmit the signal to other proteins involved in establishing the fatty acyl chain composition of membrane lipids? Does, for example, knockdown of TLCD1/2 lower the activity of the unfolded protein response in response to palmitate? This would indicate that the lipid composition in the ER membrane is affected FLD-1 mediated regulation and not only the plasma membrane.</p><p>What is the connection to cholesterol?</p><p>An important factor contributing to membrane fluidity and membrane phase behavior of cellular membranes in mammals is cholesterol. Especially because cholesterol has key functions in organizing the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (but not <italic>C. elegans</italic>), and because SREBP proteins are central regulators of many aspects of lipid metabolism, it would be important to see if and how TLCD1/2 affects the cholesterol level and cholesterol signaling in these cells.</p><p>Related to the FRAP experiments</p><p>For HEK cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic> different approaches have been undertaken.

Does this indicate that there are substantial changes in the lipid composition of the endoplasmic reticulum under these conditions, which lead to a distinct regulation of SCD?</p><p>The notion that 'as little as 1 µM of EPA or DHA […] prevents membrane rigidification by 400 µM PA' should be avoided. It does not make sense to compare these concentrations, because the uptake, metabolism, incorporation in different lipids, their subcellular localization, and turnover might differ substantially between these fatty acids. Just comparing the concentration in the media does not make sense.</p><p>Subsection “Mammalian TLCD1 and TLCD2 are regulators of membrane composition and fluidity”, last paragraph: (as above) Comparing the concentration of LCPUFA necessary to protect cells from 200 µM PA is not relevant, given the complexity of the metabolic steps involved.</p><p>Discussion, first paragraph: (similar as above): The expression 'fifty times more potent' is misleading and should be omitted. The cited reference (Yang et al., 2011) does not warrant equal metabolism of LCPUFAs and oleic acid in cells. This statement would ignore, that different fatty acids have remarkable distinct abundancies in the cellular membrane. The statement does not define in what respect LCPUFAs are more potent? How is it being measured? Of note, the effect of different lipids on collective bilayer properties are not linear. For these reasons, the authors should avoid a quantitative comparison of the effects by different fatty acids.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph: The authors list a number of processes that seem to be affected by the membrane lipid composition. However, the true underlying mechanism remain entirely unexplored in these studies. Also, membrane microdomains are mentioned here for the first time in the manuscript. This of course has many implications on the interpretation of the FRAP experiments (see below). I would recommend not to go into a discussion on the modulatory role of the membrane composition, but instead focus more on the discussion how FLD-1 and/or TLCD1/2 might excerpt their modulatory function.</p><p>Discussion, third paragraph: It is unclear to me, how the presented data suggest a direct, regulatory role of PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 on FLD-1.

In this study the authors have performed a suppressor screen for <italic>paqr</italic> (adiponectin receptor homolog) and <italic>iglr</italic> (adiponectin interacting protein) mutants that show increased membrane rigidity at low temperature or when grown in presented on high glucose. They identified several alleles of this gene were capable of suppressing the growth and morphological defects observed in the two mutants.

They show improved tolerance only in the presence of other mutations.</p><p>3) Since the molecular function of FLD-1 has not been elucidated it leads to a conceptual dilemma in the working hypothesis proposed by the authors. The authors argue that FLD-1/TLCD1-2 is a plasma membrane protein that decreases the incorporation of LCPUFA to the membrane implying a function in the immediate vicinity of plasma membrane (thus cell autonomous).

They also identified a number of weaknesses that they felt needed to be addressed prior to publication. In particular the evidence for the localisation of FLD-1 and its mammalian orthologs, and the effects of the mutations on the levels of cholesterol needs to be addressed more clearly. In addition they felt that your description of what the data show and the citation of the literature need to be more accurate, and some of the statistical analysis needs to be improved. These seem the key points, but the more minor points they make also seem valid and hopefully most can be addressed by changes to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Response to the decision letter:</p><p>1) A specific point raised in the decision letter regards the localization of the FLD-1 protein. There is no doubt that the in vivo FLD-1::GFP reporter is localized to the plasma membrane of most and perhaps even all cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at all developmental stages. We now provide an additional Figure 1—figure supplement 4A panel which shows confocal imaging of this reporter on a non-fixed living worm where it is very clear that all plasma membranes are GFP-positive while very little/no GFP expression is found in the cytoplasm. We have retained Figure 1F because it includes DAPI staining even though this requires fixation which causes some deformation of the morphology. However, we have rephrased the figure legend as follows: “Confocal image of the anterior portion of a fixed <italic>C. elegans</italic> L1 larva expressing the in vivo translational reporter <italic>Pfld-1::FLD-1::GFP</italic>. This reporter is ubiquitously expressed in the plasma membrane (green) while the DAPI staining (blue) decorates most of the cytoplasm in each cell since fixation allowed the chromosomal DNA to escape the nucleus.” The mammalian homolog TLCD1 was carefully localized to the plasma membrane in mammalian cells using immunofluorescence detection of a series of MYC-epitope tagged constructs. We now explicitly mention this as follows: “The same study localized TLCD1 to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells using a careful series of myc-epitope tagging and immunodetection experiments (Papanayotou et al., 2013)”.</p><p>2) A second point raised concerns the effects of the mutations on the level of cholesterol, which we were asked to address more clearly. We have measured the relative abundance of free cholesterol versus phosphatidylcholine (cholesterol/PC ratio) in control cells and TLCD1/2 siRNA-treated cells with or without palmitate challenge. No changes of note were detected and this information is provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 4D, where the y-axis has been more clearly labelled “cholesterol/PC ratio” rather than the previous “FC/PC ratio”. Note that the lipidomics provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 6 all come from the same experiments, which allows direct comparisons. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> we provide the results from two experiments in which the cholesterol/PC ratios were measured. No changes in cholesterol were detected in the second experiment. We therefore feel confident in our statement that differences in cholesterol content do not explain the effects of TLCD1/2 knockdown on membrane properties (subsection “Mammalian TLCD1 and TLCD2 are regulators of membrane composition and fluidity”, third paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40686.045</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40686-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Cholesterol levels were not measured in <italic>C. elegans</italic> since it is not a structural component of membranes in this organism. We now explicitly indicate this as follows: “cholesterol levels were not measured since this lipid does not appear to play a structural role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but instead is a likely precursor for essential low-abundance metabolites (Merris et al., 2004).”</p><p>3) Also as requested in the cover letter, and by the reviewers, we have thoroughly revised the literature cited both in the Introduction and in the Discussion, and in particular raised the possibility that the FLD-1/TLCDs proteins may influence membrane composition by regulating the Lands cycle by which phospholipids can be remodelled (specific changes are detailed below). Several improvements to our descriptions of the data and statistics have also been made. The “n” for each method used is clearly stated in the Materials and methods, and we also added a statement about repeats of entire experiment (subsection “Statistics”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If you can address all of the reviewers' points, and provide a point-by-point description of your revisions, then I would be happy to consult them again to ask if the paper is now of acceptable quality.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Specific points:</p><p>1) Plasma membrane localization of FLD1. This localization is inferred from confocal images using a GFP construct (Figures 2F and Figure 1—figure supplement 4). I notice that the cells shown in Figure 2F have a prominent nucleus, making the cytoplasm volume minimal. Therefore, I'm not entirely convinced that the protein is at the plasma membrane. Wouldn't a protein present in the cortical ER give a similar localization pattern? This is important because, functionally, the localization of FLD1 at the plasma membrane is puzzling considering that lipid synthesis and remodeling is believed to occur mostly in internal membranes (notably ER). How can FLD1 affects fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids if the protein is not in the same membrane as lysophospholipid acyl transferases? See also my remark on the mammalian proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerns plasma membrane localization of FLD-1 and the mammalian homologs. See answer to decision letter, point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The genetic characterization in Figures 2 and 3 is extensive and compelling, showing a clear rescue effect of various fld-1 mutants on the defects induced by temperature or glucose on the growth and morphology of worm mutants for the PAQR-2 and/or IGLR-2 proteins. The genetic interactions tested in Figures 2D-F and 3E suggest that FLD-1 acts by a pathway different from the previously described pathway, which relies on the overexpression of a FA desaturase. Instead, they suggest a genetic interaction with the desaturases fat-6 or fat-7 (please comment on the lack of interaction with fat-5; Figure 3E). How about acyl transferases e.g. MBOA-6?</p></disp-quote><p>We now comment on the lack of interaction with <italic>fat-5</italic>, in Figure 3E. Specifically, we now write: “Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of the desaturases <italic>fat-6</italic> and/or <italic>fat-7</italic> abolished the suppression of <italic>paqr-2(tm3410)</italic> glucose intolerance by <italic>fld-1(et48)</italic>, and this was the case both in the presence or absence of the <italic>mdt-15(et14) gof</italic> allele (Figure 3E). Knockdown of the desaturase <italic>fat-5</italic> also abolished the suppression of <italic>paqr-2(tm3410)</italic> glucose intolerance by <italic>fld-1(et48)</italic> but not in the presence of <italic>mdt-15(et14)</italic> which likely drives sufficient compensatory induction of <italic>fat-6</italic> and <italic>fat-7.</italic>”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous point. At least in text or perhaps through further genetic studies, the authors should try to connect their work with recent studies on the families of acyltransferases responsible for the incorporation of fatty acids with defined level of unsaturation (e.g. PMID:28578316 and others studies by the Shimizu group), as well as on recent attempts to better characterize the molecular properties of polyunsaturated phospholipids in membranes (e.g. Pinot et al., 2014 for endocytosis).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks that we discuss the possible involvement of acyltransferases as targets of FLD-1/TLCDs. We have now done so in the Discussion: “It is possible, for example, that FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 influence substrate selection by phospholipases or lysophospholipid acyltransferases, i.e. regulating the Lands cycle through which phospholipids are actively remodelled by fatty acid exchange and hence effectively influence membrane composition and properties (Pan and Storlien, 1993; Abbott et al., 2012; Andersson et al., 2002; Shindou et al., 2017). In particular, the presence of several membrane-bound acyl transferases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest a promising avenue of genetic interaction studies to test their possible connection to FLD-1 activity (64,65).” Also, the work by Pinot et al. is now cited in the Introduction (Pinot et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The lipidomic analysis on the acyl chain profile performed on phosphatidylethanolamine is also compelling. Under glucose, the paqr-2 mutant accumulates saturated PE at the expense of polyunsaturated PE, an effect that is inverted by the further introduction of the fld-1 mutation, notably in combination with mutation of the mdt-15 gene. The data under conditions of a saturated diet (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D) are also impressive. The authors, however, might mention that the plasma membrane accounts for only a minor part of the total cellular membranes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the plasma membrane is the only one to be affected in its acyl chain profile. The lipidomic analysis is performed on cells or tissues, not on plasma membrane, which is technically much more demanding.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up the fact that the phospholipid composition analyses presented in the manuscript likely reflect much more than just the plasma membrane. This is entirely correct and the reviewer’s comment alerted us to a possible lack of clarity on this point. We now write: “Note that the lipidomic analysis was performed on whole worms, and thus reflects global lipid composition rather than the composition of any specific membrane; also, cholesterol levels were not measured since this lipid does not appear to play a structural role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but instead is a likely precursor for essential low-abundance metabolites (Merris et al., 2004).” Also, regarding human cells: “Note that, as in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> the lipidomic analysis was performed on whole cells, and thus reflects global lipid composition rather than the composition of any specific membrane.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For mammalian cells, would it be possible to further study the sub-localization of the FLD-1 homologues (TLCD1 and TLCD2).</p></disp-quote><p>Concerns the localization of the TLCDs.

Many papers referred to in the text report correlative observations, but are cited in way to make a statement. Only few studies mentioned in the text provide the original, clear-cut, biochemical or biophysical studies for the point being made.

I suggest that the authors carefully revisit their list of references used in the Introduction and the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer urged us to reconsider the literature cited in the Introduction and Discussion, and made several suggestions for improvement. The references in the first paragraph of the Introduction have been updated to include more primary research articles, and now include the reviewer’s suggestions which were all spot on. Similarly, the second paragraph of the Discussion now brings up phospholipases/acyltransferases (Lands cycle) as a possible regulatory point for FLD-1/TLCDs (see reviewer 1, point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weakness 2: The concept of membrane fluidity is highly prevalent in biology and serves as a wonderful descriptor of membrane biophysics, which is also intuitively understood by a broader readership. However, I do not find any clear evidence in this manuscript (nor in the cited references) that membrane fluidity is indeed the critical factor in the context of the observed phenotypes. The role of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids has gained increasing attention in the past years (see below) and the authors could do a better job in highlighting these developments in light of their data.</p><p>The authors should clearly indicate that membrane fluidity is used as a readily available descriptor of a membrane property. A separate paragraph should discuss that also other membrane properties are greatly affected by lipids with polyunsaturated fatty acid chains and that it is not clear, which of these membrane properties are most relevant for the observed phenotypes observed in genetic experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, we now introduce “fluidity” as a convenient term alluding to a complex phenomenon: “Given its central and far-reaching importance, it is surprising that so little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane composition and fluidity, a term used throughout this article as a proxy for membrane properties that include fluidity, phase behavior, thickness, curvature, intrinsic curvature and lateral pressure profile (Radanović et al., 2018; Mouritsen, 2011).” Additionally, we now include a new paragraph in the Discussion (third paragraph) that serves two purposes: mention the possible roles of LCPUFAs as precursors to signaling molecules, and reviews the evidence that <italic>fld-1</italic> actually acts through its effects on membrane properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weakness 3: The important role of FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 is being established, but the potential targets of FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 are neither discussed, nor is there any speculation on how a signal from FLD-1 or TLCD1/2 might be transmitted to regulate the production/formation of very long chain polyunsaturated lipids. The authors should provide some more insight in how the communication between the plasma membrane bound proteins and their effector functions is being established. A direct regulation of FLD-1 by PAQR-2 is indicated in Figure 6, but I cannot find evidence that supports this speculation. Do the authors suggest a direct regulation or rather an indirect one via the fluidity (or other properties) of the plasma membrane?</p><p>How can a plasma membrane embedded protein send a signal that affects the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into lipids? Does it signal go to the ER, to the nucleus, or to the plasma membrane? Is there any indication for a transcriptional response or for a signaling molecule/second messenger/post-translational modification that might transmit the signal to other proteins involved in establishing the fatty acyl chain composition of membrane lipids? Does, for example, knockdown of TLCD1/2 lower the activity of the unfolded protein response in response to palmitate? This would indicate that the lipid composition in the ER membrane is affected FLD-1 mediated regulation and not only the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer. Our genetic studies clearly identify FLD-1/TLCDs as novel regulators of phospholipid composition acting on very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Nevertheless, these genetic studies have not revealed the actual molecular mechanism by which FLD-1/TLCDs regulate phospholipid composition. As mentioned earlier (reviewer 1, point 3 and reviewer 2, point 1) we now followed the suggestions of the reviewers and mention that FLD-1/TLCDs may influence the Lands cycle (Discussion, second paragraph). Also following up on the reviewer’s suggestion, we used a <italic>hsp-4::GFP</italic> reporter to investigate whether the ER-UPR is induced by exogenous SFAs in <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutants (achieved through glucose supplementation) and whether it is affected by the <italic>fld-1</italic> mutation (it is not). This is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 6H. We did not investigate this further nor in mammalian cells. We are of course very curious about the molecular mechanism (signaling or otherwise) but we feel that this is beyond the scope of this study. Finally, regarding the possibility that <italic>paqr-2</italic> may regulate <italic>fld-1</italic>: this is presented as a dashed line in the model (Figure 6) and is mentioned only as a possibility consistent with the genetic interaction studies. This is now made clear in the legend: “The possibility that PAQR-2 regulates FLD-1 (dashed line) is suggested by the fact that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>fld-1</italic> suppress <italic>paqr-2</italic> mutant phenotypes; there is at present no evidence for physical interactions.” and in the text of the Discussion: “The suggestion that <italic>paqr-2</italic> may influence <italic>tlcd-1/2</italic> activity is raised only as a possibility consistent with the observed genetic interactions: we have at present no biochemical evidence that these proteins interact with each other nor do we know of a mechanism by which <italic>paqr-2</italic> could regulate <italic>tlcd-1/2</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the connection to cholesterol?</p><p>An important factor contributing to membrane fluidity and membrane phase behavior of cellular membranes in mammals is cholesterol.

The authors should provide a confocal image that shows incorporation of the dye in the plasma membrane and no strong labeling of intracellular membranes.

In this study the authors have performed a suppressor screen for paqr (adiponectin receptor homolog) and iglr (adiponectin interacting protein) mutants that show increased membrane rigidity at low temperature or when grown in presented on high glucose. They identified several alleles of this gene were capable of suppressing the growth and morphological defects observed in the two mutants. They show that fld-1 mutants, under conditions of stress (cold/high glucose/or feeding of saturated fatty acid) continue to favor a membrane composition that is slightly higher in unsaturated fatty acids thus increasing its fluidity. They have demonstrated similar abilities for human homologs of this protein in tissue culture studies.</p><p>Strengths of the study:</p><p>1) Suppressor screen and identification of genetic interactors of PAQR/Adiponectin receptor.</p><p>2) Detailed genetic studies of paqr/iglr/fld-1/and other previously isolated suppressors of paqr/iglr.</p><p>3) Efforts to extend the original findings in C.elegans to human homologs in tissue culture experiments.</p><p>4) Lipidomic correlation of morphological defects with increased saturated fatty acid content in membrane lipids (this is not new finding but extension of authors' findings in earlier studies).</p><p>5) General concurrence between C. elegans and human data.</p><p>Weakness of the study:</p><p>1) No biochemical function for FLD-1/TLCD1-2 has been elucidated in this study. The manuscript begins as a genetic interaction study and remains as such despite valiant efforts by the authors to describe the interactions using numerous experiments and extending the studies to human homologs of FLD-1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises the issue that we still do not know the biochemical function of FLD-1/TLCDs. This is true and was discussed in the answer to reviewer 2, point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Abstract is misleading –</p><p><italic>'We isolated C. elegans mutants with improved tolerance to dietary saturated fat, including eight alleles of the novel gene fld-1 that encodes ahomolog of the human TLCD1 and TLCD2 transmembrane proteins.

The authors argue that FLD-1/TLCD1-2 is a plasma membrane protein that decreases the incorporation of LCPUFA to the membrane implying a function in the immediate vicinity of plasma membrane (thus cell autonomous). Yet in Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, they show transgenic expression of FLD-1 in hypodermis or intestine is sufficient to restore glucose sensitivity on paqr-fld-1 double mutant indicating a cell non-autonomous role.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the cell non-autonomous nature of the membrane homeostasis effect of <italic>fld-1</italic> may seem puzzling. We recently published an article showing that PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 can similarly maintain systemic membrane homeostasis in a cell nonautonomous manner, which is now mentioned: “This is consistent with an earlier study demonstrating that the maintenance of membrane homeostasis is cell nonautonomous and may rely on effective trafficking of lipids among tissues (Bodhicharla et al. 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data shows that in the absence of these proteins, there is an increase in incorporation of LCPUFA's within 6 hours, indicating that the deacylation-reacylation cycle (Lands cycle) may be involved.
