Here we present the cryo-EM structure of OTOP3 from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (XtOTOP3) along with functional characterization of the channel. XtOTOP3 forms a homodimer with each subunit containing 12 transmembrane helices that can be divided into two structurally homologous halves; each half assembles as an α-helical barrel that could potentially serve as a proton conduction pore. Both pores open from the extracellular half before becoming occluded at a central constriction point consisting of three highly conserved residues – Gln<sub>232/585</sub>-Asp<sub>262</sub>/Asn<sub>623</sub>-Tyr<sub>322/666</sub> (the constriction triads). Mutagenesis shows that the constriction triad from the second pore is less amenable to perturbation than that of the first pore, suggesting an unequal contribution between the two pores to proton transport. We also identified several key residues at the interface between the two pores that are functionally important, particularly Asp509, which confers intracellular pH-dependent desensitization to OTOP channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>otopetrin</kwd><kwd>proton</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007914</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional analysis of the OTOP3 channel from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> offers insights into the mechanism of ion transport and regulation in the otopetrin proton channel family.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proton transport plays an important role in a number of biological processes, including ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker, 2013</xref>), host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2009</xref>), sperm mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>), viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bron et al., 1993</xref>) and sour taste perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). So far, only a handful of proton channels have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Decoursey, 2003</xref>): the influenza A M2 channel, which is required for viral entry and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bron et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pinto et al., 1992</xref>), and the animal hv1 channel, which is involved in host defense through acidification of the phagosome that eventually inactivates the infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The perception of taste is mediated by receptors that are expressed on the surface of taste cells in the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). While the taste receptors for sensing sweet, bitter, umami and low salt have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), the identity of the sour receptor has been controversial. The PKD2L1 channel, which shows specific expression in type three taste cells where sour taste is perceived, was initially proposed as the sour receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2006</xref>) but was later refuted based on the findings that PKD2L1 knock-out mice retained most of their sensitivity to sour taste perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horio et al., 2011</xref>). A recently characterized proton channel called otopetrin1 (OTOP1) appears to be the bona fide sour receptor because it expresses specifically in type three taste cells rather than other taste cell types, generates a proton current across the plasma membrane in response to extracellular acidification, and exhibits the Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity that is a key feature observed in the proton current of sour taste cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey and DeSimone, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montell, 2018</xref>).</p><p>OTOP1 was initially identified for its role in the development of otoconia, which are calcium carbonate-based structures that sense gravity and acceleration in the vestibular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>), likely by regulating cellular calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).

Additionally, OTOP2 and OTOP3 represent two main paralogs of OTOP1 in mouse and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurle et al., 2011</xref>). While the tissue-specific patterns of expression of OTOP2 and OTOP3 are distinct from OTOP1, their cellular functions remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurle et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of XtOTOP3, which adopts a unique double barrel fold, thus, defining the overall architecture of the otopetrin family of ion channels. Additionally, our mutagenesis and electrophysiological analysis allowed us to pinpoint several important regions within the channel that define the unique biophysical properties of the OTOP family of proton channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional characterization of XtOTOP3</title><p>N-terminal GFP-tagged XtOTOP3 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells for electrophysiology studies.

Two experimental observations led us to conclude that this current decay is caused by both rapid intracellular local proton accumulation upon channel opening and intracellular pH-dependent desensitization of the channel. In one experiment, we measured channel activity with a constant extracellular pH (pH<sub>o</sub>) of 4.5 but with varying intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, the channel is barely conductive when the intracellular pH is maintained at 6.0 but elicited a large proton current when the intracellular pH is adjusted to 6.5 or higher, indicating that XtOTOP3 becomes inactive when intracellular pH becomes acidic. In a second experiment, the intracellular (pipette) pH is maintained at 7.4 and the extracellular (bath) pH is set to 5.0, and the proton currents were elicited by repetitive voltage ramps from −100 mV to 100 mV over a 150 ms duration with a 90 ms interval between two pulses. As shown in the resulting I-V curves, the reversal potential is shifted progressively towards 0 mV, indicating a decrease in the proton gradient that results from the accumulation of localized intracellular protons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Meanwhile, the proton currents become progressively smaller because of the channel desensitization at lower intracellular pH caused by a local proton accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This pH-dependent channel desensitization also explains the faster current decay associated with the larger inward proton currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>Zn<sup>2+</sup>, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>, has been shown to partially block MmOTOP1 from the extracellular side. We, therefore, also tested the effects of divalent blockage on XtOTOP3. Distinct from MmOTOP1, our results demonstrated that both Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> can partially block the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>). Given the high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration under physiological conditions, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> blockage would modulate the conductance of the channel and could potentially be a physiologically relevant property of XtOTOP3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structure determination of XtOTOP3</title><p>To gain further insight into the OTOP family of ion channels, we purified XtOTOP3 and determined its structure to 3.9 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

The two sets of constriction triads are equivalently positioned in each pore, as demonstrated in the superimposition of the two pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><p>As neither of the pores provides a conductive pathway, we performed mutagenesis on the two conserved constriction triads to probe how the two pores contribute to proton conduction. While most of the mutations tested have a profound effect on channel activity, the N-pore constriction triad appears to be more amenable to mutations than that of the C-pore, as most of the mutant channels still conducted protons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). On the contrary, the C-pore constriction triad exhibits greater sensitivity to mutagenesis; in particular, most mutations to Gln585 and Asn623 yielded virtually no currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Two distinct sequence and structural features in the vicinity of the C-pore constriction triad are worth noting. First, the Tyr666 of the C-pore constriction triad comes from the highly conserved FYR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>) of the OTOP channels, which is present in the C-pore but not the N-pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, the C-pore constriction triad forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with some conserved surrounding residues that are not present in the N-pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>). These surrounding residues include Gln520, Gln554 and Arg667, among which Arg667 is from the FYR motif and Gln554 is at the equivalent position of the <italic>backstroke</italic> mutant (Glu429Val) in zebrafish OTOP1 (<italic>25, 26</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Collectively, our structural and functional analysis of the two constriction triads suggests that, although both pores could potentially function as proton permeation pathways, the triad in the C-pore appears to play a more determinant, if not exclusive, role in the channel activity of XtOTOP3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Interface between the N-pore and C-pore</title><p>Interestingly, the interface between the two pores is only tightly packed on the extracellular half of the channel but is solvent accessible from the intracellular half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

The structure adopts a unique two-pore architecture in which both pores could potentially provide pathways for proton permeation. Given the observed constrictions in both pores of XtOTOP3, we suspect that our current structure likely represents the closed state. However, it is worth noting that our current structural and mutagenesis analysis have not yet provided direct evidence to prove that one or both of the pores indeed serve as the ion conduction pathway. It is also unclear whether the triads in both pores are directly involved in proton conduction. Furthermore, given the observation that mutations at either triad can have a profound effect on channel activity, we could not rule out an alternative possibility that the permeation pathway is completely different from the two pores observed in the structure. One possibility is that the mutations to the two constriction triads may allosterically modulate a single, yet unidentified pathway for proton permeation. Thus, what a conductive channel looks like and how protons are selectively relayed from the extracellular to intracellular side require further investigation.</p><p>A defining characteristic among OTOP family members is their pH-dependent activation and rapid desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we show that pH regulates the activity of XtOTOP3 from both sides of the plasma membrane. Low pH activates the channel from the extracellular side but inactivates the channel on the intracellular side. Our functional analysis of XtOTOP3 led us to identify several key regions within the channel that are crucial to channel activity – particularly Asp509, which markedly reduced the rate of desensitization among OTOP family members. Thus, the structure of XtOTOP3, along with the functional hotspots that we have identified in our study, will serve as a valuable template for further mechanistic studies into the OTOP family of proton channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Xenopus Tropicalis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">OTOP3</td><td valign="top">Tranomic technologies</td><td valign="top">NCBI: NP_001106584.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Freestyle 293 F</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_D603">CVCL_D603</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sf9</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_D603">CVCL_0549</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pEZT-BM</td><td valign="top">DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2016.03.004">10.1016/j.str.2016.03.004</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Addgene: 74099</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MotionCor2</td><td valign="top">DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4193">10.1038/nmeth.4193</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GCTF</td><td valign="top">DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jsb.2015.11.003">10.1016/j.jsb.2015.11.003</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RELION2</td><td valign="top">DOI: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18722">10.7554/eLife.18722</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Coot</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S0907444910007493">10.1107/S0907444910007493</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">PyMOL</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.schrodinger.com/">Schrödinger</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Chimera</td><td valign="top">UCSF</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> OTOP3 (XtOTOP3, NCBI accession: NP_001106584.1) containing a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site followed by a 10 × His tag was cloned into a pEZT-BM vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>) and heterologously expressed in HEK293F cells (Life Technologies) using the BacMam system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The final structure model of each subunit starts at residue 107 and ends at residue 681. Residues 1–106, 278–302, 342–357, 383–388, 423–505 and 575–605 were disordered and not modeled. Due to poor density quality for TM7 and TM8, residues 357–422 were modeled as poly-alanine. The statistics of the geometries of the models were generated using MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). All the figures were prepared in PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC.) or Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Programs used for model building, refinement and validation are compiled by SBGrid. Solvent accessible passages were analyzed using the program CAVER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chovancova et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>XtOTOP3, MmOTOP1 and their mutants were cloned into pEGFPC2 vector. About 2 μg of the plasmid containing the N-terminal GFP-tagged XtOTOP3, MmOTOP1 or their mutant was transfected into HEK293 cells grown in a six-well tissue culture dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technology). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were dissociated by trypsin treatment and kept in complete serum-containing medium and re-plated on 35 mm tissue culture dishes in a tissue culture incubator until recording. Similar transfections were performed for the expression test and subcellular localization experiments. In the subcellular localization experiments, 0.5 ug of plasmid containing the plasma membrane marker KRas GTPase tail-tagged with mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heo et al., 2006</xref>) was co-transfected with the XtOTOP3.</p><p>Patch clamp recordings in the whole-cell and outside-out configurations were used to measure channel activity. The standard intracellular solution contained (in mM): 70 Cesium methanesulfonate (Cs-MS), 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA, 100 HEPES buffered with Tris, pH = 7.4. The extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> free solution contained (in mM): 150 NMDG-MS, 10 HEPES buffered with Tris, pH = 7.4. For pH below 6.5, HEPES was replaced with MES buffered with Tris. For measurement of ion selectivity of the channel, the NMDG-MS in the extracellular solution was replaced with K-MS, Cs-MS or Li-MS respectively.</p><p>The data were acquired using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a low-pass analogue filter set to 1 kHz. The current signal was sampled at a rate of 20 kHz using a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices) and further analysed with pClamp nine software (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus) and heat-polished to a resistance of 5–10 MΩ filled with the pipette solution. After the patch pipette attached to the cell membrane, a giga-seal (&gt;10 GΩ) was formed by gentle suction. The whole-cell configuration was formed by short zap or suction to rupture the patch, further pulling the pipette away from the cell to form the outside-out configuration. For continuous current recording, the membrane potential was held at −100 mV. To generate the current and voltage relationship, the membrane potential was held at 0 mV, followed by voltage pulses ramp from −100 to +100 or 120 mV over a 150 ms duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence Protease Protection (FPP) assay</title><p>The FPP assay is adapted from a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">White et al., 2015</xref>). A Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope, equipped with a FITC-3540B-NTE and TRITC-A-NTE filters from Semrock (Rochester, NY, USA) for green and orange fluorescence, respectively, was used for imaging. About 2 μg each of plasmid expressing the N-terminal GFP-tagged wild type XtOTOP3 and pCSCMV:tdTomato plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waldner et al., 2009</xref>) expressing free tdTomato fluorescent protein were co-transfected into HEK293 cells grown in a six-well tissue culture dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technology). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with KHM buffer (110 mM potassium acetate, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.2) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 3 min. The cells were then perfused with KMH buffer containing 50 μg/ml proteinase K at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 10 min. Images were taken at different time points to monitor the change in green fluorescence. Before cell permeabilization by digitonin, proteinase K was removed by washing the cells three times, 1 min each, with DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, followed by washing the cells with KHM buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 2 min. 50 μM digitonin in KHM buffer was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 10 min. Images were taken at different time points to monitor the changes in orange fluorescence. After successful membrane permeabilization indicated by loss of orange fluorescence inside cells, cells were subjected to a second round of proteinase K treatment. Images were taken at different time points to monitor the changes in green fluorescence.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Nguyen for manuscript preparation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sudha Chakrapani (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The otopetrin proteins were recently identified as the proton channels involved in perception of sour taste in specialized cells found in the tongue. These receptors were activated by protons and shown to be blocked by μM concentrations of zinc. Here, Chen et al., describe the structure of OTOP3 channel derived from <italic>Xenopus</italic> tropicalis. From a functional standpoint, this channel behaves very much like the mouse orthologs. Interestingly, XtOTOP channel is sensitive to block by both zinc and calcium unlike the mouse channel which is sensitive to zinc block only. This is a very exciting new structure which does not have resemblance to any known protein. The structure shows that the channel has a unique double barrel fold with two possible proton conduction pathways. Based on the structure, the authors identified a conserved triad of residues Gln-Asp/Asn-Tyr. These residues form a structurally conserved constriction point which likely occludes proton permeation. Although not explicitly discussed by the authors, it appears that this structure is of the closed state of the channel. Structure guided mutagenesis shows that residues in the constriction triad are involved in proton permeation and that the two constriction triads do not contribute equally. Overall, this is an excellent structural analysis of a new protein family and is nicely complemented by structure-guided functional analysis. Nevertheless, the reviewers have some concerns mainly with regards to interpretation and presentation of the experimental data. We believe these concerns can be easily addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors contend that the rapid decay following activation is both due to inactivation and changes in proton concentration. The reversal potential obtained in a single ramp experiment closely matches the expected E<sub>rev</sub>. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proton concentration changes significantly to cause a rapid current decay following channel opening during a pulse. While the original otopetrin study suggested that the rapid current decrease is due to changes in proton concentration, it seems that the authors data presented here is more consistent with inactivation (or densensitization) mechanism. Have the authors tested the effect on the current decay as the buffer concentration is varied? The D509 is shown to affect current decay and it is concluded that this position is involved in pH-dependent inactivation. Since the experiments were done at one set of pH<sub>o</sub>/pH<sub>i</sub>, this effect could also be explained from drop in conductance (slower accumulation of protons at the intracellular end) from electrostatic effects. Please clarify these points perhaps in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) While the mutagenesis data are very nice and show that the conserved residues in the constriction triad are important for proton permeation, I think the interpretation needs further consideration. If the two pores are completely independent, then one would predict that the mutations in one would not have much effect on the currents through the other. In fact, a mutation that completely blocks conduction in one pathway but does not affect the other would just result in reduced current. The data would be indistinguishable from a mutation that just reduces channel expression on the surface. The interesting point here is that some of the single point mutations in C-terminal constriction triad abolish most of the proton current suggesting that either the two pore are tightly linked to each other. The better way to determine the contribution of individual pores is to either express each subdomain separately or block one of the conduction pathways. The alternate explanation is that the permeation pathway is completely different and the two triads are sites for allosteric modulation through a single ion channel pore.</p><p>3) Is there similarity or difference from other proton selective channels such as M2 and Hv1? Hydrophobic region consisting of the Gln-Asn (or Asp)-Tyr triad may perhaps have similar function of Phe at the hydrophobic plug of Hv1 and voltage sensor domains of voltage-gated ion channels. Could any titratable residues in the pore (N-pore or C-pore) be predicted as proton acceptor in proton-selective permeation of otopetrin? Related to mutagenesis of N-pore and C-pore, have authors examined if proton selectivity is altered? Some of these points should be addressed in the Discussion section but other can be clarified in your response to the reviewers.</p><p>4) What regions contribute to Zn2+ inhibition and what regions may confer differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity between OTOP1 and OTOP3?

The first observation is that the channel has almost no activity when intracellular pH is around 6.0. The second observation is that when applying repetitive voltage ramps from -100 mV to 100 mV over a 150 ms duration with a 90 ms interval between two pulses (instead of holding at -100mV in most other experiments), the I-V curves show a progressive decrease of currents accompanied by a progressive shift of the reversal potentials towards 0mV. We intentionally used short pulse duration in the second experiment to reduce the proton influx and thereby slow down the current decay. These points are clarified in the revision. As suggested by the reviewers, we define the current decay of OTOP channel as desensitization instead of inactivation in the revision.</p><p>We actually tested two different buffer concentrations in a separate experiment – not discussed in the manuscript – (10 mM and 100 mM) and did not observe any obvious difference in the rate of current decay. It is possible that the proton accumulation occurs locally in a restricted area and cannot be quickly dissipated by the buffer.</p><p>When comparing the rate of decay between the WT and D509 mutants, we tried to use cell patches with comparable current levels. The patches containing the wild type channels consistently exhibited a faster current decay regardless of whether the current is small or large. It is unlikely that the slower decay of the D509 mutants is caused by a drop in conductance (slower accumulation of protons at the intracellular end) from electrostatic effects, as the D509E exhibited a similar slower rate of decay as the D509N or D509A mutants. We have included the data for the D509E mutant in the revision. Of course, to absolutely rule out the possibility that channel conductance change in the mutant contribute to the rate of desensitization would require single channel recording, which we are unable to do because the single channel current is too small to measure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the mutagenesis data are very nice and show that the conserved residues in the constriction triad are important for proton permeation, I think the interpretation needs further consideration.

Some of the current reduction could be caused by a reduction in protein expression on the cell membrane as suggested by the reviewers. After obtaining the structure of XtOTOP3, we spent more than a year to determine whether one or both pores are ion conductive, including expressing the N-/C-pore separately and using MTS reagent to block the pore, as suggested by reviewers. We were unable to get any currents when separately expressing the N- or C-pore constructs, which might be caused by compromised protein expression, folding or trafficking. The MTS reagent blockage experiments were unsuccessful also, since the WT channel contains multiple cysteines that could already be blocked by the MTS reagent from the extracellular side. Furthermore, mutations of these cysteines resulted in the loss of channel activity. The only conclusion we can draw based on the current data is that both triads appear to be sensitive to mutations and mutations at the C-pore triad appears to have a stronger effect. We also agree with the reviewers that we cannot rule out the alternative possibility that the permeation pathway is completely different and that the two triads are sites for allosteric modulation through a single ion channel pore. In the revision, we briefly raised this possibility in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there similarity or difference from other proton selective channels such as M2 and Hv1?

The triad in the OTOP channel is also quite different from the hydrophobic plug (or gating charge transfer center formed by two acidic residues and an aromatic residue) of the Hv1 and VSD of voltage-gated channels. In the Hv1 channel, the aspartate is essential for proton selectivity and its mutation to neutral residues renders the channel anion permeable. In most OTOP channels, the triad has the sequence Gln-Asn-Tyr and does not contain titratable Glu or Asp. We measured the selectivity of several triad mutants (Q232E, D262Q, Y322W, N623Q and Y666A) that retain some channel activity and found no obvious change in proton selectivity. We should point out that it is still unclear whether the triads or some other regions define the proton selectivity in OTOP channels. We feel it is premature to discuss the selectivity mechanism with the assumption that the constriction triads are directly responsible for proton selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What regions contribute to Zn2+ inhibition and what regions may confer differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity between OTOP1 and OTOP3?

We have spent quite some efforts on mutagenesis studies on the negatively charged residues on the extracellular side, but have not yet been able to pinpoint the Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition sites. Efforts aimed at solving the XtOTOP3 structures in complex with Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> were not successful due to the poor resolution of the reconstructed maps. In addition, the structural mechanism of proton-dependent activation of the channel is also unclear. All these points raised by reviewers are important questions remained to be addressed in our ongoing studies. However, due to a lack of any experimental data at the current stage, we are not in a position to provide any speculative discussion on these issues.</p></body></sub-article></article>
