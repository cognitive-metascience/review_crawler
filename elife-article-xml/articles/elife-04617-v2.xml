organization of peripheral clocks, we generated forebrain/SCN-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice by using floxed <italic>Bmal1</italic> and pan-neuronal Cre lines. The forebrain knockout mice showed &gt;90% deletion of BMAL1 in the SCN and exhibited an immediate and complete loss of circadian behavior in constant conditions. Circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues persisted but became desynchronized and damped in constant darkness. The loss of synchrony was rescued by light/dark cycles and partially by restricted feeding (only in the liver and kidney but not in the other tissues) in a distinct manner. These results suggest that the forebrain/SCN is essential for internal temporal order of robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks, and that individual peripheral clocks are affected differently by light and feeding in the absence of a functional oscillator in the forebrain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04617.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04617.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04617.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Jet lag is a common experience when flying long distance. This disorientating phenomenon occurs when our internal ‘body clock’ remains set to the time zone where the plane departed and fails to reset to the new local time.</p><p>Our internal clock actually consists of a series of clocks—each of which is based upon groups of genes that are switched on and off at different times of the day and night. There is a master clock in our brain and a series of peripheral clocks in our other organs and tissues. The master clock is thought to coordinate the peripheral clocks, which in turn control the fluctuating activity of a specific organ in response to the time of day.</p><p>To further investigate the master clock, a typical approach has been made to disable it by deleting the genes for its components. But some of these deletions can cause abnormalities in mice and some are lethal. To get around these problems, Izumo, Pejchal et al. have devised a way to delete a molecular component of the master clock only in the mouse's brain.</p><p>Izumo, Pejchal et al. used this approach to specifically disable the mouse's master clock and, unlike mice that completely lack the <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene, mice with the brain-specific deletion were as healthy and lived as long as normal mice. A molecular probe was used to monitor the peripheral clocks in different organs and tissues of these mutant mice, and revealed that, without a working master clock, the peripheral clocks were no longer synchronized. Izumo, Pejchal et al. found that the lost synchrony could be partially restored by training the mice to adapt to cycles of light and dark and feeding schedules.</p><p>Following on from the work of Izumo, Pejchal et al., one of the next challenges is to understand how the master clock communicates with the peripheral clocks in different organs and tissues around the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04617.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04617.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>Bmal1</kwd><kwd>Cre/loxP</kwd><kwd>suprachiasmatic nucleus</kwd><kwd>peripheral clock</kwd><kwd>light entrainment</kwd><kwd><italic>Arntl</italic></kwd><kwd>Mop3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H0690101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Joseph S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 MH61915, P50 MH074924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Joseph S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30NS056551-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pejchal</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izumo</surname><given-names>Mariko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 ES005703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradfield</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takashi R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditional deletion of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the forebrain/SCN reveals an essential role of a functional master clock in maintaining synchronized and high amplitude rhythms of peripheral clocks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the primary regulator of daily rhythms of behavior and physiology in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meijer and Rietveld, 1989</xref>;

Extensive evidence suggests that the SCN controls not only behavioral rhythms but also the circadian programs of peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). However, much remains unclear regarding the relationship between the central clock and peripheral oscillators, which can be entrained by many different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buhr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saini et al., 2012</xref>). To clarify the contribution of a central clock to the circadian rhythms of peripheral tissues, we sought to find a way to disable the molecular oscillators in the brain without affecting the genetic components in the rest of the body.</p><p>Traditionally, a functional role of a gene has been investigated by a gene targeting strategy, which eliminates the gene from embryonic stem cells so that it is inactivated ubiquitously in mice. While this approach provides a powerful method to study the function of genes in vivo, it cannot be applied to genes that affect developmental or metabolic processes crucial for survival. Moreover, even if the knockout mice survive to adulthood, some lines suffer from systemic conditions and hence require special handling in experiments. For instance, although a global knock out of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) completely eliminates circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>), the animals suffer from morbid conditions including arthropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunger et al., 2005</xref>), sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boden et al., 2010</xref>), defects in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marcheva et al., 2010</xref>), premature aging, and decreased lifespan [their average lifespan is 37 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kondratov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2006</xref>)]. Possibly due to the pleiotropic effects of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, results of studies such as food entrainment behavior with <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice have been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mistlberger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pendergast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mistlberger et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mieda and Sakurai, 2011</xref>). To circumvent these problems, conditional knockout techniques utilizing Cre recombinase and <italic>loxP</italic> sequences have been applied widely in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gavériaux-Ruff and Kieffer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). However, until recently, Cre drivers that can efficiently recombine a floxed allele in the majority of SCN neurons have not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mieda and Sakurai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musiek et al., 2013</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husse et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the ability of a forebrain-specific Cre driver to excise floxed alleles of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, a critical component of the molecular oscillator, specifically from brain regions including the SCN. The resulting knockout mice were devoid of BMAL1 expression in the forebrain/SCN but not in other peripheral tissues. Unlike <italic>Bmal1</italic> global knockout mice, <italic>Bmal1</italic> forebrain knockouts did not display detectable defects in reproduction, activity, body weight, or life span, thereby providing an ideal model to study circadian physiology in the absence of a central clock. These genetically engineered mice are better experimentally controlled than mice that receive SCN lesions, which is a classic method to induce arrhythmic behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meijer and Rietveld, 1989</xref>). With SCN lesions, precise removal of the SCN tissue varies from mouse to mouse and requires laborious confirmation of the excision. In addition, ablation of the SCN destroys neuronal networks and communication pathways, rendering the network responses and mechanisms incapacitated.</p><p>With forebrain-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice, we examined the impact of defunct brain clocks on the organization of peripheral oscillators as well as their response to environmental signals such as light and food. Cre-mediated excision of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the forebrain/SCN confers complete arrhythmicity to circadian behavior. In contrast to the abolition of rhythms in the SCN, all peripheral tissues in these mice sustained circadian rhythmicity; however, they lacked phase coordination and normal amplitude in constant darkness. The synchrony and the oscillatory amplitude of peripheral rhythms in these mice were completely rescued by exposure to light dark cycles but not fully in time-restricted feeding experiments. The feeding cues appear to control the phase expression of the peripheral clocks in a tissue-specific way and in a distinct manner from light. These results demonstrate that an intact central clock plays an essential role in driving normal circadian behavior as well as synchronized and robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks and that light and feeding act on individual peripheral clocks differently in the absence of a functional oscillator in the SCN.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Forebrain/SCN-specific deletion of <italic>Bmal1</italic></title><p><italic>Bmal1</italic> (also known as <italic>Arntl, Mop3</italic>) is one of the essential components of the molecular oscillator, unique in that the single knockout of <italic>Bmal1</italic> can confer arrhythmicity both at the behavioral and molecular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>). To generate a forebrain-specific knockout of circadian rhythms, we crossed floxed <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>fx/fx</italic></sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>) to <italic>Camk2a</italic>::<italic>iCre</italic>BAC mice (<italic>CamiCre</italic> or Cre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>) and produced <italic>CamiCre+</italic>; <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>fx/fx</italic></sup> (that we denote as ‘Brain’ Knockout, BKO, defined as a forebrain-specific knockout) as well as <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>fx/fx</italic></sup> (Fx/Fx), <italic>CamiCre+</italic> (Cre), and <italic>CamiCre+</italic>; <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>fx/+</italic></sup> (Het) control mice. <italic>Camk2a</italic>::<italic>iCre</italic>BAC mice were used because their Cre expression is faithful to the endogenous <italic>Camk2a</italic> gene expression pattern: it is neuron-specific, forebrain-enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>), and expressed highly in the SCN as observed in Cre-dependent fluorescence reporter mice, <italic>CamiCre</italic>+; <italic>tdTom</italic>+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Although there are more than 37 different <italic>Camk2a::Cre</italic> transgenic lines reported in Mouse Genome Informatics database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=Camk2a-cre%26page=featureList">http://www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=Camk2a-cre&amp;page=featureList</ext-link>), the majority do not appear to express well in the SCN (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/experiment/81162458">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/experiment/81162458</ext-link>), likely because of shorter promoter regulatory sequences and position effects. The other advantage of this Cre driver is that its Cre expression is post-natal and starts at P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>), thus reducing potential developmental effects. <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>fx/fx</italic></sup> mice were generated by inserting <italic>loxP</italic> sites into the introns surrounding exon 4, which codes for the DNA-binding bHLH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>).

In more detailed analysis, control mice (Cre, Fx/Fx) showed intense mRNA expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the SCN at its peak time (CT18) as well as circadian fluctuation (CT18 vs CT6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To further characterize the tissue specificity of the BKOs, we used Western blot analyses to measure BMAL1 protein levels in various brain and body tissues at ZT16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>). In contrast to Fx/Fx and Cre controls, BMAL1 (∼69 kD) was detected only faintly in BKO frontal cortex and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), likely due to glial and non-neuronal expression of BMAL1 since <italic>Camk2a</italic> is not expressed in glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 1987</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that a peripheral defect in BMAL1 is responsible for the low activity levels that had been reported in global <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. In BKOs (which do not have this peripheral defect so that locomotion is normal), the absence of a central circadian gating mechanism, which normally suppresses activity during the subjective daytime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Menaker, 1980</xref>), likely contributes to an increase in overall levels of activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Entrainment to light cycles and masking</title><p>One of the notable differences between BKO and SCN-lesioned mice is that BKOs display apparent entrainment to light/dark cycles (probably because BKOs are spared from surgical interruption of retinal inputs to the SCN which usually occurs in lesion experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the activity onset of BKOs in LD was variable and on average earlier than controls. As a result, daytime activity level was higher in BKOs (15.58 ± 1.8% of total daily activity) compared to the three control groups (3.81 ± 0.96%, average of the three control groups ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Yet it was unclear whether the pre-dark activity of <italic>Bmal1</italic> brain knockouts around the light/dark transition was due to poor entrainment of a residual circadian pacemaker or to a defect in masking.</p><p>In order to test whether <italic>Bmal1</italic> brain knockouts entrain to light, we used a skeleton photoperiod (LDLD 1:10:1:12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). The activity patterns of Cre, Fx/Fx, and Het mice during the skeleton photoperiod were virtually indistinguishable from the activity patterns in LD 12:12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, none of the 10 BKO mice used in this study entrained normally to the skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>): 3 BKO mice showed activity that resembled their activity in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), 2 BKO mice displayed a bimodal activity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), and 5 BKO mice exhibited activity that was intermediate between these two phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). Unlike control mice, BKO mice distributed their running activity equally between the subjective day and the subjective night of the skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In fact, controls spent 97.9% of their activity during the skeleton night, compared to only 52.5% for BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The amount of activity that BKOs spent during skeleton day vs night was not significantly different. This type of abnormal entrainment to skeleton photoperiods is reminiscent of the entrainment behavior of pinealectomized sparrows, which behave as a population of circadian oscillators that entrain with two opposite phase relationships to the skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi and Menaker, 1982</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that entrainment in <italic>Bmal1</italic> brain knockout mice is abnormal under skeleton photoperiods, consistent with the idea that the coherence of phase during entrainment may be compromised. Overall this suggests that the periodicity seen in LD 12:12 in BKOs arises from entrainment of a population of driven oscillators in which phase control is labile.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04617.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Both entrainment and masking are abnormal in <italic>Bmal1</italic> brain knockout mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Representative double-plotted actograms of daily wheel-running activity of Cre, Fx/Fx, Het, and BKO mice.

To assess masking in BKO mice, we used an LD 3.5:3.5-hr light–dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Redlin et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,F,G</xref>). Mice are unable to entrain to LD 3.5:3.5 cycles, thus permitting the masking and the entraining effects of light to be distinguished. Maintaining this schedule for a week ensures the testing of all phases of a circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). On average, BKOs exhibited significantly less activity during the light portions of LD 3.5:3.5 (4.68 ± 0.71% of total activity vs 9.56 ± 1.83% for Fx/Fx littermates, p &lt; 0.032 by t-test). Fx/Fx mice display more activity during the light portions of LD 3.5:3.5 because the circadian clock is promoting activity despite the presence of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). While Fx/Fx mice have an underlying circadian component of activity under LD 3.5:3.5, BKOs have none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Aside from this difference, when we examined the time course of the masking response, it became apparent that the masking of BKOs is delayed compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; a score of 50% indicates failure to mask). Thus BKOs failed to mask during the first 30 min of the light phases. Plotting actograms on a 7-hr time scale aids in visualization of this masking impairment in BKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These entrainment and masking studies led us to conclude that BKOs lack an endogenous clock but also exhibit some impaired masking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phase synchrony and desynchrony in peripheral tissues of BKOs</title><p>To analyze the temporal organization of peripheral oscillators at an organismal level, we crossed the BKOs to PER2::LUC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>) and monitored the bioluminescence signals from the SCN and other tissues in the body.

Unlike SCN-lesioned mice, however, BKOs preserve intact neural networks and show normal or enhanced levels of behavioral activity in LD and in constant conditions. This new analysis allows us to determine whether deleting BMAL1 (thus inactivating the molecular clock) in the forebrain, without destroying the structure of the SCN, is sufficient to affect the organization of peripheral rhythms.</p><p>Age-matched pairs of mice (Fx/Fx littermate control and BKO) were maintained in DD for more than 30 days (30–44 days) before harvesting eight different tissues for real-time reporting of circadian gene expression. As a light synchronized control group, tissues were also collected from mice in LD 12:12. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>), mean period length was variable yet characteristic from tissue to tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

Heart tissue was chosen for this experiment, because the heart showed both significant phase dispersion and severe amplitude reduction in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). In this imaging, bioluminescence signals from heart tissue were insufficient to identify single cells in the field of view. Therefore, we developed a grid method to allow extraction of time-series data in a narrow area of the target-imaging sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The size of the grid was narrowed down to 40 µm × 40 µm. Circadian rhythms in the brightest 200 grids were aligned in the order of expression intensity in a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistent with the organotypic recording by LumiCycle luminometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the heart cells from a wild-type mouse exhibited robust oscillation, while those from a BKO displayed damped rhythms with broader phase distribution. The damped rhythms were also clear in a linear graph in which the top 50 time-series were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Amplitude analysis of these 50 time-series data showed that the oscillatory amplitude was significantly reduced within the grids in the BKO heart sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Furthermore, their phases were significantly dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

Therefore, behavioral responses to temporal food restriction in BKOs were enhanced in DD.</p><p>Previously, the DMH was thought to be a possible candidate site of a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) that regulates feeding behavior [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gooley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mieda et al., 2006</xref>) but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landry et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moriya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landry et al., 2011</xref>)].

On the other hand, BKOs had no significant <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA in the DMH at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite a complete lack of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the DMH, BKOs exhibited normal FAA, indicating that <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the DMH is not necessary for food entrainment. Surprisingly, BKOs showed <italic>Per2</italic> expression levels comparable to those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The peripheral tissues in these mice displayed variable phase relationships with respect to the feeding time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). However, when the peak phases were converted to the circadian time of the animal at harvest, the phases in a majority of tissues examined (except for pituitary and liver) became markedly clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 8—source data 1A</xref>), suggesting that the circadian rhythms in many peripheral tissues in wild-type mice are still dictated by the signals from the intact central clock. On the other hand, the peripheral tissues of BKOs showed distinct changes in phase expression patterns in response to restricted feeding cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Although BKOs exhibited prolonged pre-feeding activity in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), only the liver and kidney showed tightly clustered phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 8—source data 1A</xref>).

These results suggest that feeding cues differentially entrain peripheral clocks; FR strongly synchronizes circadian clocks in the liver and kidney but has weaker effects on other peripheral tissues such as the pituitary, heart, lung, and spleen.</p><p>To our surprise, with the exception of the liver, oscillatory amplitude of peripheral rhythms of BKOs remained lower than that of Fx/Fx control mice even after 2 weeks of FR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Lower amplitude is not related to the state of phase synchrony, because relative amplitude of kidney still remained low even though FR synchronized its phase. This indicates that the damped rhythms were not completely restored by food signals.</p><p>To compare <italic>ad libitum</italic> and FR conditions directly, we performed a ‘meta-analysis’ on phase and amplitude within Fx/Fx and BKOs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–D</xref>).

First, entrainment in a skeleton photoperiod was abnormal with a bimodal pattern. A similar pattern is found in pinealectomized sparrows in which a population of oscillators entrains with two different and opposite phase angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi and Menaker, 1982</xref>).

Previous studies have investigated the effect of SCN ablation on peripheral rhythms by making SCN lesions and recording circadian gene expression of peripheral tissues either ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we used a Cre-mediated genetic excision approach to remove a critical component of the molecular oscillator from the intact SCN network. This strategy demonstrates that internal synchrony and high amplitude rhythms are lost in the absence of a functional master oscillator in the forebrain/SCN and supports previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, further studies are needed to elucidate the functional consequences of damped circadian rhythms in each peripheral organ.</p><p>On the other hand, the dispersed phases in BKOs were not observed when mice were placed in an LD condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). Given that the BKO's circadian behavior is driven by light from retinal pathways presumably acting via the SCN, this demonstrates that cyclic photic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is sufficient to sustain coherent temporal synchrony of peripheral oscillators. Alternatively, the effects of light could also be mediated by activity (wheel-running)-associated stimuli driven by LD as another source of systemic signals impinging on peripheral clocks analogous to that found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kornmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Forebrain <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression is not necessary for food entrainment behavior</title><p>BKOs offer an advantage for investigating the effects of a disabled master clock in the brain because they do not suffer from the morbid phenotypes observed with a global loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic>. Using the forebrain <italic>Bmal1</italic>-deficient animals, we were able to conduct food restriction experiments under completely standard conditions. In contrast to global <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockouts, altered experimental conditions such as enriched liquid food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>), LD 18:6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pendergast et al., 2009</xref>), or food placed on the cage bottom, and gentle handling to prompt feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuller et al., 2008</xref>) were not required for these mice.

Specifically, our <italic>Bmal1</italic> in situ results in the DMH indicate that the DMH is not necessary for FAA as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landry et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moriya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landry et al., 2011</xref>). In our experiments, BKOs tend to exhibit intact food-anticipatory behavior under constant darkness conditions. However, overall activity of BKO's circadian behavior was also significantly elevated in DD, which makes it difficult to distinguish whether the elevated pre-feeding activity is due to enhanced FAA or to the effect of overall activity increase. Nevertheless, these results suggest that an inhibitory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Menaker, 1980</xref>) suppresses the total activity of both circadian behavior and FAA. It remains to be determined what factors underlie suppression of the activity and how their regulation in the SCN and other brain regions is altered by the deletion of BMAL1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Differential effects of light/dark cycles and feeding cues</title><p>Previous work has shown that restricted feeding can alter the phase of peripheral rhythms without affecting the phase of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>). While peripheral oscillators can be uncoupled from the central clock in the SCN, recent studies have suggested that SCN-derived signals counteract the feeding cues for rapid phase-shifting of peripheral clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saini et al., 2013</xref>) and that phase-shifting rates are variable among different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamazaki et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with these observations, peripheral tissues in our control mice displayed variable phases relative to the FR schedule when conducted in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In these free-running conditions, the circadian activity rhythms of the mice were not affected by FR; and as a consequence, the phase relationships between the FR schedule and circadian phase could be dissociated. When control mice in DD under <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions were compared to control mice in DD under FR using circadian phase as a marker, the liver, kidney and heart significantly shifted their mean circular phase in response to feeding, showing an effect of FR on these tissues [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, compare Fx/Fx from DD with Fx/Fx from DD + FR (in CT); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 9—source data 1A</xref>]. However, the phases of the peripheral rhythms were significantly clustered with the phase of the activity rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), strongly suggesting that signals from the SCN continue to dictate the expression of peripheral phases in wild-type mice despite the expression of FAA behavior. Indeed, only the liver was strongly clustered in phase with FR in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, Fx/Fx from DD + FR) compared to the circadian phase of activity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, Fx/Fx from DD + FR (in CT)] in which all peripheral tissues were clustered in phase. Thus we see a rather complex picture in control mice in which FR exerts tissue-specific effects on peripheral organ circadian phase and coherence.</p><p>In contrast, in the absence of a functional pacemaker in the forebrain, liver and kidney clocks shifted to a distinct phase in response to food restriction and became synchronized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), which supports the results of an in vivo study using SCN-lesioned animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). We found, however, that other tissues such as heart, lung, and spleen did not entrain to food restriction even after 2 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 9—source data 1A</xref>). Although the precise mechanism is not known, the lower degree of synchrony of these tissues could be due to the longer duration of pre-feeding behavioral activity which could mobilize additional (conflicting) signals. At the same time, these tissues showed distinct phase shifts in response to feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 9—source data 1B</xref>). Circular phase variance analysis indicates that internal coherence among different organs within an individual mouse still remained disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that, while synchrony of individual tissues such as liver and kidney can be maintained independently by a feeding schedule, synchrony among peripheral tissues requires central clocks in the forebrain/SCN.</p><p>The effects of FR were different from the effects of LD cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), which sustained both phase synchrony and oscillatory amplitude in peripheral clocks in BKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Notably, both phase angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; Figure 5—source data 1A) and phase coherence among peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) were similar to those in Fx/Fx control mice which possess an intact central clock. We speculate that, while feeding cues can antagonize SCN-derived signals, LD cycles appear to act in concert with the SCN or signals arising from the SCN. Although detailed pathways through which the SCN controls the peripheral clocks remain unknown, recently, SRF was identified as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in peripheral tissues in response to systemically oscillating signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to explore how these signals affect circadian gene expression in vivo to determine the mechanisms by which the SCN communicates with peripheral oscillators. Our experiments reveal the diverse behavioral and peripheral physiological consequences of inactivating a forebrain clock.

Fluorescent lights (300–600 lux inside the cage) were used for behavior experiments. Mice were transferred into DD for 4 weeks, returned to LD for 2 weeks, released into LL for 4 weeks, and then returned to LD for at least 2 weeks. For the entrainment experiment, mice were placed in LD 12:12 for at least 10 days, released into DD for 4 weeks, followed by LD for 2 weeks, before they were introduced to a skeleton photoperiod (LDLD 1:10:1:12) for 4 weeks.

The free-running periods in DD and LL were calculated from the entire 28-day interval by using χ<sup>2</sup> periodogram analysis (Clocklab software, Actimetrics). The amplitude of circadian rhythm was analyzed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which estimates the relative power of approximately 24 hr period rhythm in comparison with all other periodicities in the time-series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shimomura et al., 2001</xref>). The power spectral densities for frequencies ranging from 0 to 1 cycle/hr were determined and normalized to a total power (area under the curve) of 1.0. The peak in the circadian range (18- to 30-hr period or 0.033–0.055 cycles/hr) of the relative power was determined for each animal for comparison. If no significant periodicity in the 18–30 hr range was detected by FFT, the free-running period was not scored. For analysis of total daily activity, the total number of wheel revolutions per day was averaged in LD (last 10 days of initial LD interval), DD, and LL (28 days) using the same days described above for free-running period and amplitude analysis. Effects of genotype were analyzed by a Generalized Model (GLM) ANOVA by using NCSS (Kayesville, UT), with Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison post-tests for pairwise comparisons.</p><p>Two-sample t-tests were used to analyze subjective day vs night activity during skeleton photoperiod and amplitudes during LD 3.5:3.5, and Repeated Measures GLM ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison post-tests was used to compare the time course of masking between genotypes during days 3–15 of the 21-day LD 3.5:3.5 cycle. FFT was used to analyze amplitudes in the circadian as well as 7-hr range during LD 3.5:3.5. To analyze FR data, Repeated Measures GLM ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison post-tests was used to compare the effect of genotype, time, and interaction between the two on FAA (absolute counts), FAA (% of total activity), weights, total daily activity, and food intake.

Brains were rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until further processing. Standard in situ hybridization procedures were used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sangoram et al., 1998</xref>). Alternate 20-µm thick coronal sections were collected from each brain from the rostral to the caudal end of the SCN or DMH (24–32 total, 12–16 for each probe) by using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. Sections were thaw-mounted onto SuperFrost plus microscope slides (VWR, Radnor, PA), then stored at −80°C until all sectioning was completed. Alternate sections were hybridized to a combination oligoprobe against <italic>mBmal1</italic> exon 4 and to a riboprobe against <italic>Per2</italic>. For the <italic>Bmal1</italic> combination oligoprobe, three 37 to 50-mer oligonucleotide probes (IDT, Coralville, IA) were radiolabeled at the 3′ ends with <sup>33</sup>P via terminal I deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Gibco/Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and used in equal proportions: Mop3Ex4Probe1 5′-AACTGTTCATTTTGTCCCGACGCCTCTTTTCAATCTGACTGTGGGCCTCC-3′, Mop3Ex4Probe2 5′-CCTGGACATTGCATTGCATGTTGGTACCAAAGAAGCCAATTCATC-3′, Mop3Ex4Probe3 5′-CTGAACAGCCATCCTTAGCACGGTGAGTTTATCTAAC-3′.

PCR products were cloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The T7 promoter from the TA cloning vector was used to generate both anti-sense and sense probes. All probes were labeled with <sup>33</sup>P. Quantitation of the autoradiogram signal was performed by using NIH ImageJ 1.34s software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and normalized to radioactive standards as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vitaterna et al., 1999</xref>). The optical density (OD) of individual SCN or DMC was normalized by subtracting the OD of an area of identical size in the lateral hypothalamus or the magnocellular nucleus of lateral hypothalamus, respectively, from the same side (left or right) and section. Normalized values from three sections near the middle (anterior–posterior) SCN or caudal DMH (at the level of DMC) were used to calculate an average for each brain.

The brains were removed and post-fixed for 2 hr at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 63.4 mM phosphate buffer and transferred to 20% sucrose/phosphate buffer overnight. For immunohistochemistry, 50-µm coronal sections were collected through the entire SCN using a Leica cryostat and processed free-floating.

Sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated microscope slides using aqueous mounting medium (3:1 glycerol/phosphate buffer), cover-slipped, and imaged with a Leica DM-RB upright microscope using Openlab software in the Biological Imaging Facility at Northwestern University. For the whole brain imaging, a Zeiss Stereo Discovery Microscope V12 was used under a bright field.

Coronal sections of the brain were sliced at 300-μm thickness by a vibratome in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen). Each individual SCN was dissected out and cultured on a Millicell organotypic membrane (PICM ORG50, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a 35 mm tissue culture dish containing 1.2 ml DMEM (90-013-PB, Mediatech, Manassas, VA), supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.035% sodium bicarbonate, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM luciferin (L-8240, Biosynth AG, Staad, Switzerland). Other tissues were processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamazaki and Takahashi, 2005</xref>) and cultured as above. The bioluminescence was monitored by a light-tight 32-channel LumiCycle luminometry (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) maintained at 36°C and was recorded at an interval of 10-min continuously for a minimum of 8 days followed by medium change to confirm the viability of the samples.</p><p>All data were analyzed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumo et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, raw data of bioluminescence records were corrected for background counts and PMT gain. For animals harvested from a DD condition (30–44 days in DD), activity onset of each Fx/Fx control mouse was set as CT12. The time-series data were detrended by a 24-hr running average and then subjected to FFT-NLLS analysis to calculate periods and phases. The initial 20 hr of data were trimmed because they contain an acute effect of explant preparation. Data beyond 192 hr before medium change were also trimmed except for one group (1 Fx/Fx control and 1 BKO), which was affected by an electrical shutdown on day 6. The amplitude was computed at a 36–60 hr range and normalized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumo et al., 2006</xref>). For all data, the calculations were averaged where duplicated samples were prepared from the same tissue within an individual mouse, and the averaged value was used to map or calculate for all mice collected. Samples with RelAmp Error ≥0.84 (background counts) or out of a circadian (17–31 hr) range (24 hr ± 30% of 24 hr) in the periodicity were excluded from the analysis. A total of 1106 LumiCycle files were processed and used in this study. To construct a phase map, smoothed time-series were used to determine the peak on the second day. Phase angles and circular variances of circular plots were computed using Oriana (Kovach Computing Services, Wales, UK). The variance of the peak phases between two groups was compared using bootstrap analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). For each iteration of the bootstrap, the difference of the variance between the two groups was calculated by random sampling with replacement from the data within the each of the two groups. Following 20,000 iterations, ninety-five percent confidence intervals were used to determine whether the differences were significantly different from zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bioluminescence imaging and data analysis</title><p>For real-time bioluminescence imaging analysis, age-matched pairs of mice (Fx/Fx control and BKO) were placed in DD for &gt;30 days before harvesting the tissues. The tissue collection was repeated for a total of three pairs of mice. The tissues were processed and prepared in the same manner as in the luminometry recording, except that a glass bottom culture dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA) was used. The sealed culture was placed onto the stage chamber maintained at 36°C inside the LV200 Bioluminescence Imaging System (Olympus America, Irving, TX). The sample was imaged using a 10× objective lens with 10-min exposure time at 25-min interval for 7 days. The imaging files were converted to linear time-series by quantifying the signals on grid matrices. The heat map was generated using the top 200 time-series data starting with the strongest signals. The top 50 of these time-series data were analyzed for period, phase, and relative amplitude by FFT-NLLS as described above. The phases calculated by FFT-NLLS were further converted to the actual time and divided by each circadian period to normalize period differences. Statistical analysis was conducted between paired mice as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ms Amanda Falk for help with mouse production, Dr Tereza Smejkalova for help with Westerns, Dr William Russin at the Biologial Imaging Facility and Dr Xinran Liu for help with imaging, Dr David Ferster for help with data analysis, Mr Giuseppe Fruci for assistance with figure production, Drs Martha Vitaterna, Hee-Kyung Hong, Marleen de Groot, Kazuhiro Shimomura, and Ethan Buhr for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Louis Ptacek (Reviewing editor); Ralph Mistlberger (peer reviewer). Two other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The primary hypothesis being addressed in this paper is that temporal organization of peripheral clocks may be maintained <italic>in vivo</italic> by light and/or feeding cues, when the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei is genetically altered. For that purpose, the authors generated forebrain Bmal1 conditional mutant mice (noted KO thereafter). In constant darkness, these mice are behaviorally arrhythmic, while their peripheral clocks were still oscillating, albeit in a desynchronized way as compared to control mice.</p><p>1) The authors consider that light, but not feeding, rescues temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice. The data provided suggest alternative interpretations. Because the temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice exposed to a light-dark cycle (LD) matches remarkably that in SCN-functional control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), this indicates that the direct effects of light cues given by LD are sufficient to maintain temporal organization in peripheral clocks (i.e., light cues do not rescue any defect in KO mice). Based on the immediate behavioral arrhythmicity after transfer to DD, while the rhythmicity is apparent under regular LD, there is no obvious reason to speak of weak entrainment to light in KO mice. The apparent rhythmicity under LD is likely due to direct effects of daily exposure to 12 hours of light per cycle. A recent study using Syt10(Cre) driver to alter the clock in the SCN has shown that timing in a peripheral clock (i.e., adrenal gland) can be maintained by exposure to LD (Husse et al. 2014 FASEB J). If really the authors consider that light rescues temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice without involving masking effects of light, they should prove it by investigating such temporal organization in KO mice exposed to lighting conditions that maintain entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, while limiting the masking effects of light, such as a skeletal photoperiod (as used here for behavioral measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or daily 1 h light pulses followed by 23 h of darkness.</p><p>2) Feeding cues in constant darkness are said not to rescue temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice. However, visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> suggests that phase dispersion between peripheral clocks is not different, if not improved, in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel F) as compared to control fx/fx mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D). The authors' conclusion is based on data converted in circadian times for control mice, and compared to data expressed according to Zeitgeber (feeding) time in KO mice. Even with data conversion, phase dispersion in KO mice is not different for the pituitary, liver and kidney. The question here is to investigate the synchronizing effects of feeding in DD and because it is not possible to convert data of KO mice in circadian times, data from both fx/fx and KO mice should be compared according to feeding time. The results will probably lead to the conclusion that feeding cues have synchronizing effects in KO mice, at least not worst, and maybe better than in control mice with functional SCN. Together, these points suggest that both light and feeding maintain temporal organization of peripheral circadian clocks in forebrain Bmal1 conditional mutant mice.</p><p>Some conclusions were felt to be too strong and restatement of these is necessary, as follows.</p><p>3) A major result and substantive conclusion of this study, as stated in the abstract, is that “Light cycles, but not restricted feeding treatment, rescued this defect [loss of synchrony of peripheral clocks, between and within tissues, in brain bmal1 deficient mice, BKOs], revealing the dominance of photic entrainment pathways acting via the SCN over nutrient signals”. This conclusion is summarized in the Discussion section, by statements that light appears to be a stronger entraining signal than feeding cues for most peripheral clocks, and that the SCN plays a 'critical' role in actively sustaining internal synchronization. I would argue that this representation of the results is not quite accurate, and that the conclusion is overstated, for the following reasons:</p><p>a) The midday restricted feeding schedule did fully rescue the clock in the liver (both phase and amplitude), and rescued phase in the kidney. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> also shows that phase in the heart, lung, pituitary and spleen are at least partly rescued, compared to the adlib DD condition. The statement of the results in the Abstract should be revised to acknowledge that loss of synchrony was rescued by restricted feeding in the liver and kidney, but only partially in the other tissues. Synchrony among peripheral tissues requires central bmal1 dependent clocks, while synchrony of individual tissues to a feeding schedule may not require central clocks.</p><p>b) The statement that light appears to be stronger than feeding for 'most' peripheral clocks might give the impression that most peripheral tissues were examined.

Relative strength has already been established by studies of intact animals; when food is restricted to the daytime, peripheral clocks uncouple from LD and SCN and shift to align with mealtime. There may be conditions under which light is more effective than feeding, for some tissues (possibly the minority, pending further study), but references to relative strength of food and light should be avoided, or stated in a more nuanced fashion.</p><p>4) The statement that the SCN plays a 'critical' role in actively sustaining internal synchronization is also debatable, because Bmal1 was absent from most of the rest of the brain, and some of the loss of amplitude or phase control in peripheral tissues, particularly in the restricted feeding condition, could be due to loss of inputs from Bmal1-dependent FEOs in the brain outside of the SCN. Presumably, hypothetical bmal1-dependent FEOs (in PVN, DMH, arcuate, brainstem?) communicating with peripheral organs would have to be distinct from FEOs responsible for food anticipatory behavioral rhythms, given that the behavioral rhythms were quite robust in the BKOs.</p><p>5) The conclusion that cyclic photic input is sufficient to sustain coherent temporal synchrony of peripheral oscillators is supported by the data, but the mechanism by which light does this remains an open question. The LD cycle in BKO mice drives a daily rhythm of activity and presumably feeding, and the effects of light may be mediated by stimuli associated with these behaviors. Indeed, it would not be surprising if the heart and lung circadian clocks are regulated by various systemic effects of wheel running (exercise); the phase of those clocks may be regulated by the timing of behavior. FAA in DD was much longer in duration in the BKO mice, and that might explain the lower degree of synchrony of heart and lung clocks during restricted feeding in those mice. I would recommend briefly noting this as a potential mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04617.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors consider that light, but not feeding, rescues temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice. The data provided suggest alternative interpretations. Because the temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice exposed to a light-dark cycle (LD) matches remarkably that in SCN-functional control mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>), this indicates that the direct effects of light cues given by LD are sufficient to maintain temporal organization in peripheral clocks (i.e., light cues do not rescue any defect in KO mice). Based on the immediate behavioral arrhythmicity after transfer to DD, while the rhythmicity is apparent under regular LD, there is no obvious reason to speak of weak entrainment to light in KO mice. The apparent rhythmicity under LD is likely due to direct effects of daily exposure to 12 hours of light per cycle. A recent study using Syt10(Cre) driver to alter the clock in the SCN has shown that timing in a peripheral clock (i.e., adrenal gland) can be maintained by exposure to LD (Husse et al. 2014 FASEB J). If really the authors consider that light rescues temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice without involving masking effects of light, they should prove it by investigating such temporal organization in KO mice exposed to lighting conditions that maintain entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, while limiting the masking effects of light, such as a skeletal photoperiod (as used here for behavioral measurements shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) or daily 1 h light pulses followed by 23 h of darkness</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that LD cycles are likely the primary stimulus maintaining temporal organization of peripheral clocks in BKO mice. It is not our intention to say that masking effects of light are not involved. To avoid confusion and also to incorporate the comments below, we have modified the title to, “Differential effects of light and feeding on circadian organization of peripheral clocks in a forebrain <italic>Bmal1</italic> mutant” and emphasized “light/dark cycles” in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Feeding cues in constant darkness are said not to rescue temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice. However, visual inspection of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that phase dispersion between peripheral clocks is not different, if not improved, in KO mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>, panel F) as compared to control fx/fx mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>, panel D). The authors' conclusion is based on data converted in circadian times for control mice, and compared to data expressed according to Zeitgeber (feeding) time in KO mice. Even with data conversion, phase dispersion in KO mice is not different for the pituitary, liver and kidney. The question here is to investigate the synchronizing effects of feeding in DD and because it is not possible to convert data of KO mice in circadian times, data from both fx/fx and KO mice should be compared according to feeding time. The results will probably lead to the conclusion that feeding cues have synchronizing effects in KO mice, at least not worst, and maybe better than in control mice with functional SCN. Together, these points suggest that both light and feeding maintain temporal organization of peripheral circadian clocks in forebrain Bmal1 conditional mutant mice</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers and thank them for their careful consideration of our description. In an attempt to oversimplify our description of the results, we overgeneralized our conclusions. We have now described the results in more detail to emphasize the differential effects of FR on peripheral rhythms. We have performed additional analysis of the phase data of Fx/Fx and BKO tissues by comparing the peak phases plotted against feeding time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 8–source data 1a</xref>, Fx/Fx ZT vs BKO). The statistical analysis indeed showed a significance shift in the mean phase angle in kidney, heart, lung, and spleen (but not in pituitary and liver) in BKOs. Comparison of the circular variance also showed that the phases of BKO’s were more clustered in liver, kidney, lung, and spleen (but not in pituitary and heart) as compared to Fx/Fx, suggesting that feeding cues have synchronizing effects on peripheral clocks in the absence of functional SCN.</p><p>This analysis as well as additional analyses that we present in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 8–source data 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 9–source data 1a,b</xref> as described below), together suggest that both light (in the form of LD cycles) and feeding have an effect on the temporal organization of peripheral oscillators in the forebrain <italic>Bmal1</italic> conditional knockout mice. However, we also noted that their effects are not equal. While the synchronizing effect of light is similar to the effect from the SCN (as manifested in the DD condition), the restricted feeding shifts the phases of peripheral rhythms differently and clusters the phase variance only in liver and kidney in BKO’s. To aid in the visualization of all results in one page, we performed a “meta-analysis” of all phase and amplitude data taken under different conditions and summarized the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 9–source data 1a,b</xref>.
