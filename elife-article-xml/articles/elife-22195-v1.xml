non-crossover outcome, thus avoiding the potential for chromosomal rearrangements and loss of heterozygosity. Genetic analysis identified the Srs2 helicase as a prime candidate to promote SDSA. Here, we demonstrate that Srs2 disrupts D-loops in an ATP-dependent fashion and with a distinct polarity. Specifically, we partly reconstitute the SDSA pathway using Rad51, Rad54, RPA, RFC, DNA Polymerase δ with different forms of PCNA. Consistent with genetic data showing the requirement for SUMO and PCNA binding for the SDSA role of Srs2, Srs2 displays a slight but significant preference to disrupt extending D-loops over unextended D-loops when SUMOylated PCNA is present, compared to unmodified PCNA or monoubiquitinated PCNA. Our data establish a biochemical mechanism for the role of Srs2 in crossover suppression by promoting SDSA through disruption of extended D-loops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22195.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22195.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genome stability</kwd><kwd>homologous rcombination</kwd><kwd>crossover avoidance</kwd><kwd>DNA helicase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA187561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ED 162/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ede</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM081433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd Washington</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM58015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heyer</surname><given-names>Wolf-Dietrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA92276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heyer</surname><given-names>Wolf-Dietrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Srs2 helicase functions in Synthesis-Dependent Strand Annealing to avoid crossover formation during homologous recombination by disrupting D-loops that are extended by DNA polymerase delta in an ATP-dependent and direction-specific manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can be an important contributor to carcinogenesis and a principal mechanism leading to LOH is crossover formation by homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knudson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern, 1936</xref>). HR is a high-fidelity DNA repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and interstrand cross-links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>). HR is also involved in the recovery of stalled or collapsed replication forks, as well as in the bypass of damage in the DNA template. In general, there are two types of HR repair products, crossovers and non-crossovers, depending on whether the arms of sister chromatids or homologs are exchanged or not, respectively. Crossovers between non-allelic DNA regions lead to chromosomal aberrations including deletions, inversions, and translocations. Non-crossover is the preferred outcome of HR in somatic cells avoiding potential loss of heterozygosity and possible chromosome rearrangements. In contrast, during meiosis HR is designed to generate at least one crossover per homolog to facilitate accurate chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter, 2015</xref>). The D-loop is the joint molecule produced by the Rad51-DNA filament after homology search and DNA strand invasion, key steps of the HR process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>). DNA polymerases, in particular DNA polymerase δ, extend the invading 3'-OH in the D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McVey et al., 2016</xref>). The extended D-loop is a critical intermediate in determining crossover/non-crossover outcome. In the double Holliday junction (dHJ) pathway, where both DSB ends are engaged to form a joint molecule with two Holliday junctions (HJs), both crossover and noncrossover products can be formed by nucleolytic resolution, while enzymatic dissolution leads to non-crossover products only. In break-induced replication, recombination-associated DNA synthesis extends for the rest of the chromosome arm directly causing LOH. During Synthesis-Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA), the newly extended D-loop is disrupted to produce exclusively non-crossover products, thus avoiding the possibility for LOH. SDSA is the preferred HR pathway in somatic cells and is likely dynamically regulated to ensure faithful DNA repair while avoiding LOH and chromosome rearrangements.</p><p>Multiple enzymes can act on D-loops either to abort recombination (anti-recombination) or influence the repair outcome (crossover/non-crossover) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>). The first DNA strand invasion product is the nascent D-loop and reversion of this HR intermediate represents a mechanism of anti-recombination. Several proteins have been shown to disrupt protein-free, nascent D-loops in vitro, including Sgs1 and its human homolog BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachrati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Brabant et al., 2000</xref>). Rad54 is required for D-loop formation in yeast and stimulates D-loop formation by the human RAD51 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ceballos and Heyer, 2011</xref>). Both yeast and human Rad54 can also dismantle D-loops made with short invading ssDNAs in reconstituted in vitro reactions containing Rad51 and RPA. This is especially true for invading ssDNA lacking flanking dsDNA regions such as found in a resected DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugreev et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). Moreover, Top3-Rmi1, a type1A topoisomerase that associates with Sgs1 (human BLM-TOPOIIIα-RMI1/2 is the homologous complex) efficiently dissolves Rad51-mediated nascent D-loops in reconstituted reactions, an activity that is shared by the human TOPOIIIα-RMI1/2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>) and appears to be physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, human RTEL-1 can reverse RAD51-mediated D-loops and may act in the specific context of telomeres in dismantling T-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vannier et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although quite similar in DNA structure, the extended D-loop represents a very different target, and dismantling this HR intermediate is pro-recombinogenic affecting the crossover/non-crossover outcome. Three major helicases have been genetically implicated in this process in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>: Sgs1, Mph1, and Srs2. Current evidence suggests that all three act in distinct but possibly partially overlapping pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). These helicases represent the prototypes for the homologous or analogous activities in all eukaryotes including the human proteins BLM (yeast Sgs1), FANCM (yeast Mph1), and FANCJ, FBH1, PARI, RECQ1, RECQ5, RTEL-1 (proteins with analogous activities to Srs2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sung and Klein, 2006</xref>). Sgs1 (human BLM) is involved at multiple stages in HR as part of a complex with Top3-Rmi1 (human TOPOIIIα-RMI1/2) including DSB end-resection and dHJ dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bizard and Hickson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niu et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in Sgs1 increase the crossover/non-crossover ratio, and this effect is explained by the role of Sgs1 in dHJ dissolution, as a defect in dHJ dissolution provides opportunity for nucleolytic resolution of dHJs and crossover formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>). Mph1 (human FANCM) is a 3'−5' DNA helicase required for recombination-dependent error-free bypass of DNA damage during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schürer et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic evidence shows that Mph1 contributes to the SDSA pathway, and the Mph1 protein is able to disrupt nascent and extended D-loops during in vitro reconstituted reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sebesta et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>SRS2</italic> gene was originally discovered as a suppressor of a <italic>rad6</italic> mutation (<italic>SRS2=S</italic>uppressor of <italic>R</italic>AD <italic>S</italic>ix) and equally suppresses a defect in the <italic>RAD18</italic> gene, which encode the Rad6-Rad18 ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets PCNA for mono-ubiquitination to favor tranlesion DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence and Christensen, 1979</xref>). Srs2 is a member of the SF1 helicase family and translocates on ssDNA with a 3' to 5' polarity using the energy from ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rong and Klein, 1993</xref>). The Srs2 ATPase activity is required for both its activities in HR (anti-recombination, pro-SDSA; see below). The Srs2 helicase represents the prototypic anti-recombinase dismantling the Rad51-ssDNA filament, which performs the central HR reactions of homology search and DNA strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, accumulating genetic evidence also reveals a positive role of Srs2 in HR, specifically in the formation of non-crossover products by the SDSA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aylon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupaigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saponaro et al., 2010</xref>). In an HO-induced ectopic recombination assay, <italic>srs2</italic>∆ cells show a significant decrease in the level of non-crossover products; however, the level of crossovers remains almost unchanged, leading to an increase of percentages of crossovers among the total products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, in a spontaneous ectopic recombination assay, <italic>srs2</italic>∆ cells show a four-fold increase in crossover formation such that almost half of the recombination products are crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2006</xref>). Post-translational modifications of PCNA are involved, as suggested by the genetic analysis of PCNA mutants defective in ubiquitylation/sumoylation, of the SUMO ligase Siz1, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6, all of which shows increase in crossover levels in a plasmid-based SDSA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>). The involvement of SUMO-PCNA in crossover suppression is also confirmed in other ectopic recombination systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2006</xref>). In sum, these data provide compelling evidence for an additional, pro-recombinogenic role of Srs2. It was proposed that Srs2 disrupts extended D-loops to favor annealing with the second end during SDSA to generate non-crossover products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanism of anti-recombination by Srs2 is well established, the mechanisms involved in its pro-recombination (SDSA) role and its function in adaptation/recovery remain to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macris and Sung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini and Krejci, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaze et al., 2002</xref>). Biochemical characterization of Srs2 demonstrated that it unwinds various synthetic replication and recombination intermediates including replication forks, 3′- and 5′- flaps, Holliday junction (HJ), and nicked HJ, but not D-loops in reconstituted recombination reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le Breton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marini and Krejci, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sebesta et al., 2011</xref>). It was proposed that Srs2 competes with Pol δ for PCNA binding to inhibit HR-associated DNA synthesis, and by this SDSA, in an ATP-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>). However, later genetic work showed that the Srs2 ATPase activity is essential for its SDSA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that competition for PCNA binding could be an aspect but not the underlying fundamental mechanism. The apparent lack of D-loop disruption activity of Srs2 also suggested a second possible mechanism for its SDSA activity by dissociating Rad51 from the second end of the DSB to enable annealing with extended invading strand from the disrupted D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini and Krejci, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that Srs2 is capable in vitro to disrupt Rad51/Rad54-produced D-loop structures mimicking physiological length and structures, providing biochemical evidence for a specific SDSA mechanism by Srs2. The SDSA pathway was partially reconstituted with RPA, Rad51, Rad54, RFC, DNA Polymerase δ and three different but fully modified forms of PCNA. Consistent with the genetic data, we demonstrate that Srs2 disrupts D-loops in an ATP-dependent fashion with a slight but significant preference for extending D-loops over unextended D-loops when SUMO-PCNA is present, compared to unmodified PCNA or monoubiquitinated PCNA (Ubi-PCNA). Our data provide a plausible mechanism of Srs2 activity in SDSA and assign a specific role of PCNA sumoylation during HR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Srs2 disrupts D-loops mimicking physiological length in a time- and concentration-dependent manner</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rad51 relies on Rad54 to generate D-loop structures. Typically in reconstituted systems, short ssDNAs (~35–100 nts) are used for Rad51 filament formation and DNA strand invasion, however the D loops products in such reactions suffer from instability due to Rad54’s ability to dismantle these short D loops efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugreev et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). This complicates data analysis and was found to be unsuitable to explore the D-loop disruption activity of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, there is a need to generate stable D-loop structures in reconstituted reactions. To this end, we utilized a series of long ssDNA substrates, which have been designed to resemble physiological-length Rad51 filaments that produce relatively stable D-loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). An ssDNA with 607 nucleotides (named ‘<italic>607’</italic> thereafter) of homology to a supercoiled dsDNA donor is able to form D-loops with high yield (~50%) and stability over the time course of a D-loop reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In addition, we carefully staged the reaction by adding Srs2 10 min after the initiation of D-loop formation by Rad54 and dsDNA substrate, which allows accumulation of maximal D-loop levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). This protocol avoids the complication of overlaying the phase of D-loop formation with D-loop dissociation catalyzed by Srs2. Previous attempts to identify D-loop disruption activity by Srs2 used reaction schemes where Srs2 was added immediately after or simultaneously with Rad54 and dsDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). The combination of staged reactions and long ssDNA substrates enabled us to identify robust dissociation of D-loops by Srs2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>), <italic>607</italic> can invade multiple dsDNA molecules to produce D-loops, where one ssDNA invaded up to three duplex DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All D-loop species from single invasion to multiple invasions were disassembled almost completely by 25 nM Srs2 in a 25 min reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At intermediate concentrations (5 nM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) it appears as if multiple invasion products are more sensitive to Srs2. However, multiple invasions are processed into single invasions before complete disruption, making it impossible to assess whether multiple invasions or single invasions are preferentially disrupted. As little as 2.5 nM Srs2 showed significant D-loop disruption in these reactions that contained 1 nM invading ssDNA, showing that Srs2 is highly effective in D-loop disruption. D-loop disruption by Srs2 is not dependent on the presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that Srs2 is capable of disrupting nascent D-loops, and below we show directly that Srs2 is also capable of disrupting D-loops that are being extended by DNA polymerase δ, the presumed in vivo substrate in the SDSA pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Srs2 disrupts D-loops in a concentration-, time-, and helicase activity-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) D-loop disruption assay.

To determine whether the ability to translocate or unwind dsDNA is required for Srs2 to disassemble D-loops, we purified an ATPase-defective Srs2 point mutant carrying a single amino acid substitution in the Walker-A motif (Srs2-K41S). Srs2-K41S displays no detectable ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while wild type Srs2 shows strong, ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. As expected, the motor/helicase activity of Srs2 was required to dissociate D-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), since the addition of Srs2-K41S did not alter D-loop level. The Srs2-K41S mutant protein appears to fold properly as it purifies like the wild type protein (not shown) and interacts with Rad54 like wild type Srs2 (Figure 3E), suggesting that it is the lack of ATPase and not incorrect protein folding that leads to the D-loop disruption defect. Moreover, the Srs2 motor activity is required for 4-Nitroquinine-N-oxide (4-NQO)-induced recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), an assay that reports on Rad51-dependent sister-chromatid recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ede et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> is epistatic to deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> for induced recombination, and induced recombination is strongly Rad51-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Additionally, mutation of <italic>SRS2</italic> increases the spontaneous recombination rate in this assay system and this increase is abolished by a <italic>rad51</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This result is consistent with previous observations that show a hyper-rec effect for <italic>SRS2</italic> deletion mutations in spontaneous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palladino and Klein, 1992</xref>). Finally, the Srs2 motor activity is also required for anti-recombination in vivo as indicated by the suppression of the severe sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic>△ strain towards UV and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) by the <italic>srs2-K41R</italic> and <italic>srs2-K41A</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). <italic>rad18</italic>△ suppression by these <italic>SRS2</italic> Walker A box mutations was not evident in a different assay of UV-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>). Together these results show that the translocase/ATPase activity of Srs2 is required for its two essential functions in HR, Rad51 filament disruption (anti-recombination) and D-loop disruption (pro-SDSA/anti-crossover). These results are consistent with previous findings that the Srs2 motor activity is essential for its anti-recombination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krejci et al., 2004</xref>) and pro-SDSA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Srs2 is capable of disrupting different D-loop structures</title><p>During long-range DSB resection, Sgs1/Dna2 or Exo1, degrade the 5' strand to produce 3' tailed ssDNA spanning hundreds of nucleotides, which represents the in vivo substrate for Rad51 filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). After showing that Srs2 efficiently disrupts D-loops, we wanted to test further whether Srs2 shows any substrate preference towards D-loops produced from ssDNA with zero (<italic>607</italic>), one (98ds-<italic>607</italic>, 3'-tailed), or two (98ds-<italic>607</italic>-78ds) terminal duplex heterologies mimicking different cellular repair scenarios of DSB repair (3'-tailed) or gap repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These D-loops with terminal heterologies add another layer of stability against Rad54 disruption in addition to increased ssDNA length that enables longer heteroduplex (hDNA) to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). The yield of D-loop was slightly different with all the three substrates, but Srs2 dismantled all D-loops efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). After normalizing the D-loop level according to the initial yield, it became clear that Srs2 displays a significant preference toward D-loops made with 3'-tailed invading DNA (98ds-<italic>607</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This preference is confirmed by further experiments determining the preferred orientation of D-loop disruption (see below, Figure 4). We conclude that Srs2 is capable of disrupting different nascent D-loop structures with modest preference for D-loops containing 3'-tailed invading DNA, the mimic for physiological DSB repair.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Srs2 disrupts various D-loops produced from ssDNA substrates mimicking physiological length and structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) D-loop disruption assay and substrates.

To this end, we generated protein-free D-loops and compared the disruption by Srs2 with D-loops formed in reconstituted reactions with the cognate Rad51 and Rad54 proteins. First, we used Rad51/Rad54 to generate <italic>607</italic>-based D-loop structure at high yield conditions and purified protein-free D-loops by removing all proteins. Then, we tested whether these protein-free D-loops can serve as substrates for Srs2. The reactions contained about 85% of protein-free D-loops, and the results are plotted as normalized D-loops with the initial level set at 100% to allow comparison. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 15 nM Srs2 disrupts only about 35% of the available protein-free D-loops in 40 min, while Srs2 at similar enzyme/DNA ratios disrupts almost all D-loops at 25 min in the Rad51/Rad54 reconstituted reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, 25 nM &gt;95%, 5 nM ~70%). Using this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we estimate an about ten-fold difference in the disruption between protein-free D-loops and D-loops in the reconstituted reaction. Thus, although Srs2 recognizes and loads onto D-loop as a protein-free DNA structure, the sheer presence of Rad51 and Rad54 enables more effective disruption by Srs2. Srs2 interacts with Rad51 physically through its C-terminal interaction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colavito et al., 2009</xref>), and this protein-protein interaction has been demonstrated to trigger ATP turnover and dissociation of Rad51 from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony et al., 2009</xref>). Only amino acids 783–859 of the Rad51 protein interaction site of Srs2 were found to be required for non-crossover formation in vivo but not amino acids 860–998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of more defined Rad51 interaction mutations, it is difficult to assess whether Rad51 interaction is required for SDSA. Rad54 removes Rad51 at the 3' end of the invading strand during heteroduplex formation to clear the stage for DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Heyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>), suggesting that Rad51 may not be in a position to interact with Srs2 during D-loop disruption. Therefore, we entertained the idea that Srs2 might interact with Rad54 and discovered a direct and robust physical interaction between Srs2 and Rad54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The Srs2-Rad54 interaction might be involved in the observed preference to disrupt D-loops in reconstituted reactions using the cognate proteins. We conclude that interactions with Rad51 and Rad54, but not RPA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), potentially play an important role in Srs2-mediated D-loop disruption.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Srs2 disrupts Rad51/Rad54 reconstituted D-loops with higher efficiency than protein-free D-loops.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) D-loop disruption assay using purified protein-free D-loops generated by Rad51 and Rad54.

For D-loops formed by the invasion of <italic>607</italic>, this means that the heteroduplex region will not contain the <italic>Mlu</italic>I and <italic>Bst</italic>XI sites (362 nucleotides apart) simultaneously. The observation that the sum of the <italic>Mlu</italic>I (5') and <italic>Bst</italic>XI (3') digestion products matches exactly the amount of D-loop products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) independently confirms that both restriction sites never cohabitate, otherwise a sum of greater than 100% of the D-loop amount would be expected. Thus, there were two major species of D-loop, <italic>Mlu</italic>I-incorporated D-loop (30% yield) and <italic>Bst</italic>XI-incorporated D-loop (42% yield) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,E</xref>). The addition of Srs2 to an ongoing Rad51/Rad54-reconstituted D-loop reaction revealed a marked preference for disruption of D-loops in which the 3' end-proximal region (<italic>BstX</italic>1 cleavage is 111 nt from the 3' end) had been incorporated into hDNA. The 3' proximal/<italic>Bst</italic>XI-incorporated D-loops show an immediate and rapid decline from 42 to 10 percent in the ~30 s it took to add the enzyme and stop the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, the 5' proximal <italic>Mlu</italic>I -incorporated D-loops showed a slower time course of disruption that did not reach a final level until 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As is the case in the absence of Srs2, the D-loop levels closely follow the sum of 3' and 5' proximal digestion products, and the cleavage levels never decrease for one site while increasing for the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that Srs2 action does not result in extensive branch migration of the hDNA region before complete hDNA disruption is accomplished. We conclude that Srs2 prefers disrupting D-loops, which include the 3' region of the invading DNA in the heteroduplex DNA. This is in congruence with the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, where ds98-<italic>607</italic> D loops are preferentially disrupted by Srs2, followed by <italic>607</italic> and then gapped ssDNA. This follows the same rank order of 3' proximal site incorporation preference that was previously mapped by the hDNA incorporation assay for these same three substrates under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>). Further, this may reflect the need for Srs2 to disrupt 3' heteroduplex to promote the D-loop reversal step of SDSA.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Srs2 preferentially disrupts D-loops with 3' proximal hDNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) hDNA detection assay.

To present Srs2 with this substrate, we partly reconstituted the SDSA pathway in vitro using Rad51, Rad54, RPA, PCNA, RFC, and DNA polymerase δ and assessed the ability and efficiency of Srs2 in disrupting extending D-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The long substrates we tested in the earlier assays produce D-loops with about 200 base pairs of heteroduplex incorporation, resulting in fully relaxed plasmid donors. Consequently, extended D-loops do not differentiate from unextended D-loops during electrophoresis, and in addition, DNA polymerase δ would experience an immediate topological block to DNA synthesis when attempting to extend the hDNA region. Therefore, a conventional 100-mer ssDNA was used to allow clear visual difference between extended and unextended D-loops (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The reaction was staged to recapitulate the flow of the SDSA pathway in vivo to maximize D-loop synthesis before the addition of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Rad51 and Rad54 were allowed to produce high levels of D-loop before the addition of RFC/PCNA and Pol δ. Srs2 was added after efficient D-loop extension. To minimize fluctuations, the newly extended D-loops were split at the end into buffers containing various amount of Srs2 to reach a final concentration of 0, 2.5, 7.5, or 25 nM, and products analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At the 25 min time point, <italic>i.e.</italic> 40 min after Pol δ addition, almost all D-loops had been extended and the yield of extended D-loop plateaued at 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Addition of Srs2 led to a significant decrease in extended D-loops compared to the control without Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). 25 nM Srs2 decreases extended D-loop level from 30% to 7.6%, and correspondingly increases collapsed extended D-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data demonstrate that Srs2 dissociates Polδ-extending D-loops.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Srs2 disrupts extended D-loops produced by DNA polymerase δ, in a reconstituted assay system containing RFC, PCNA, Rad51 and Rad54.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extended D-loop disruption assay.

Using 25 nM of Srs2 (25 nM) essentially all extended D-loops were disrupted within the first five minutes, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that Srs2 is capable of disrupting extended D-loops in the presence of RFC, PCNA, and Polδ, providing a potential mechanism for how Srs2 promotes SDSA and favors non-crossover formation. We estimate that disruption of RFC/PCNA/ Pol δ extending D-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is at least twice faster than disruption of D-loops with the <italic>607</italic>-based invading DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, replication machinery-covered D-loops serve as better substrates for Srs2, suggesting a positive recruitment of Srs2 through protein-protein interaction, which we examined in more below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Srs2 exhibits slight preference for extending D-loop using SUMO-PCNA</title><p>Previous studies have established that SUMO-PCNA exhibits higher affinity to Srs2 than unmodified or ubiquitinated PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>), leading to the model that SUMO-PCNA recruits Srs2 to its site of action. Genetic analyses showed that the protein interaction of Srs2 with SUMO-PCNA is required for SDSA in vivo, as <italic>siz1</italic>△ and <italic>pol30-K164R</italic> mutant strains shared the same defects as <italic>srs2</italic>△ strain in SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le Breton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that SUMO-PCNA and its interaction with Srs2 is required for SDSA and predicts that post-translational modifications of PCNA affect the efficiency of Srs2 in D-loop disruption. Hence, we evaluated the effect of PCNA modification by SUMO and ubiquitin on Srs2-mediated D-loop disruption of Pol δ extending D-loops. Split forms of wild type PCNA (referred as WT PCNA thereafter), monoubiquitylated-PCNA (Ubi-PCNA), and SUMOylated-PCNA (SUMO-PCNA) were utilized, where either ubiquitin or SUMO was fused in frame to the C-terminal peptide to produce large quantities of Ubi-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA with uniform modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freudenthal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010</xref>). Crystal structures of split form Ubi-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA revealed that ubiquitin and SUMO moieties were localized on the back side of the PCNA trimeric ring without changing its conformation, and indeed these split forms of PCNA function properly at both the cellular and biochemical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freudenthal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010</xref>). We reconstituted the in vitro SDSA assay with WT PCNA, Ubi-PCNA, and SUMO-PCNA separately and monitored whether Srs2 D-loop disruption activity is affected. These split forms of PCNA have been reported to support normal cell replication in yeast and stimulate the ability of pol η or Pol δ to incorporate nucleotide opposite an abasic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freudenthal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2010</xref>). Consistent with these reports, we did not detect a difference among different species of PCNA in recruiting Pol δ to nascent D-loops for new DNA synthesis and D-loop extension in the absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The results show a slight, but significant, preference to disrupt SUMO-PCNA extending D-loops over WT PCNA- or Ubi-PCNA extending D-loops at a limiting concentration of Srs2 (7.5 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Early biochemical studies on Srs2 either did not employ the D-loop reaction or staged the reaction to focus on the anti-recombination activity of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). Several later studies failed to observe D-loop disruption activity by Srs2 in reconstituted in vitro reactions although using significantly higher concentrations of Srs2 (up to 167 nM) than used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sebesta et al., 2011</xref>). We have identified several factors that explain this apparent discrepancy of the results reported here with these studies. First, the traditional short oligonucleotide-based D-loops undergo significant instability caused by Rad54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugreev et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>), making it difficult to identify an effect of Srs2 on D-loop stability. Moreover, the effect of Srs2 in disrupting D-loops becomes more apparent at later time points of Srs2 incubation, in particular in the reconstituted reactions with PCNA/RFC and Polδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>). These differences in protocol explain why no disruption was observed when Srs2 was added 1 min after plasmid dsDNA addition and the reaction time was only 8 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>) or only 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sebesta et al., 2011</xref>). The D-loop disassembling activity of Srs2 was much more evident, when we used D-loops made of long ssDNA with physiological-relevant length and structure, which minimize Rad54-mediated D-loop instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Another previous study showed that the Srs2 C-terminal truncation containing amino acids 1–898 was able to disrupt protein-free D-loops assembled from oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marini and Krejci, 2012</xref>). This result showed that Srs2 can disrupt model D-loops, but left open the critical question, whether Srs2 can act in the context of the ongoing reaction, where proteins are bound to the HR-intermediates, in particular in extended D-loops which engage PCNA/RFC and DNA Polymerase δ. For example, Sgs1 disrupts protein-free-D-loops, but Sgs1 is not able to disrupt D-loops in reconstituted reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fasching et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, we were able to partly reconstitute the SDSA pathway and show that Srs2 efficiently disrupts D-loops in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These results are consistent with the genetic requirement for the Srs2 ATPase activity for SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>). These findings provide a plausible mechanism for the SDSA function of Srs2 as discussed below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>SDSA Model: SUMO-PCNA facilitates Srs2 recruitment towards newly extended D-loops.</title><p>After DNA resection and Rad51 filament formation, Rad54 assists Rad51 to search for homology and form D-loops. During heteroduplex formation, Rad54 removes Rad51 at the 3' invading end to prepare the loading of DNA polymerase through RFC and PCNA. DNA synthesis is initiated by DNA polymerase δ. SUMO-PCNA actively recruits Srs2 to the D-loop. Srs2 potentially enforces SDSA through three distinct mechanisms: 1) Srs2 competes with DNA polymerase for PCNA controlling the length of new DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>). 2) Srs2 translocates in a 3' → 5' direction to dissociate the hDNA incorporated in the D-loop (this work). After the newly extended 3' invading end is dissociated it is available to anneal with the second end to generate non-crossover products. 3) Srs2 may also dissociate Rad51 from the second end to allow single-strand annealing in analogy to RECQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwendener et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22195.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22195.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-22195-fig8-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.032</object-id><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title><bold>Why are so many proteins involved in D-loop disruption?</bold> Different D-loops during homologous recombination initiating at DNA double-stranded breaks and replication-associated gaps.</title><p>Numerous proteins have been implicated genetically and biochemically in targeting the D-loop intermediate for disruption as discussed in the introduction.

We highlight possible reasons for the involvement of multiple proteins in D-loop disruption. First, before extension by DNA polymerase, disruption of a nascent D-loop is an inherently anti-recombination activity, whereas disruption of a D-loop extended by DNA polymerases limits crossover and favors SDSA. What distinguished these D-loops is their potential length, although little is known about this in vivo, and the proteins bound to the intermediate. While the genetic signatures of anti-recombination and pro-SDSA are different, the biochemical reaction of disrupting nascent or extending D-loops is highly similar and protein interactions involving also posttranslational modifications between the various D-loop disrupting enzymes may only impart preference rather than absolute specificity. Second, D-loops are dynamic entities, likely with varying length and structure, where for example the 3’ end may be embedded in the heteroduplex or transiently extruded. As we show for Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), such structural variations may influence the activity of the enzymes involved. Finally, D-loops occur not only in the context of DSB repair but also in the context of gap repair. The D-loop structure resulting from gap invasion differs, as there are no free ends available to allow true intertwining. We tried to model this reaction using invading DNA molecules with duplex heterology on both ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and show that Srs2 can disrupt such pairing intermediate, albeit with lower efficiency than regular D-loops. It will be interesting to test the activity of other D-loop disrupting proteins on such substrates. We propose that multiple enzymes with individual preferences for specific D-loop substrates are acting in vivo in a partially overlapping fashion to control anti-recombination, crossover, and SDSA.

Mph1 has been implicated in this step by genetic and biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sebesta et al., 2011</xref>) and genetic experiments strongly suggested that other enzymes, specifically Srs2, play a partially overlapping role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). Concomitant with DNA strand invasion by the Rad51 filament, Rad54 is required to remove Rad51 during hDNA formation to allow access to PCNA loading by RFC to enable DNA synthesis by DNA Polymerase δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2009</xref>). We speculate that sumoylation of PCNA during HR-associated DNA synthesis increases the likelihood of Srs2 recruitment to the extending D-loop, where it disengages the polymerase from PCNA, as Srs2 has been shown to compete with Pol δ for PCNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>). Srs2 contains a PCNA interaction motif (PIP box) and a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) providing the basis for the avid interaction between Srs2 and SUMO-PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>). This enhanced recognition between Srs2 and SUMO-PCNA has classically been viewed as an effective means to eliminate inappropriate recombination events through Rad51 filament disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stelter and Ulrich, 2003</xref>). Based on the biochemical preference of Srs2 to disrupt D-loops that are extended using SUMO-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), we suggest that PCNA sumoylation is also critical for the tuning of the SDSA function of Srs2. This is consistent with the genetic data showing a requirement for the ATPase, the PIP box and the SIM for the pro-SDSA function of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le Breton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2006</xref>).

It is possible, but remains to be demonstrated, that SUMO-PCNA stays associated with the D-loop and Srs2 during D-loop disruption (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The orientation of Srs2 in disrupting the D-loop in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> by translocating 3'−5' on the invading strand is consistent with the known polarity of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rong and Klein, 1993</xref>) and the preference of Srs2 for D-loops with an embedded 3'-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Srs2 exhibits a significant preference for disrupting D-loops in the cognate reconstituted reactions compared to protein-free DNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), suggesting that this activity is of biological relevance and likely related to the physical interactions of Srs2 with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colavito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seong et al., 2009</xref>) and/or Rad54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, Srs2 stimulates ATP hydrolysis activity of Rad51 and triggers the dissociation of Rad51 clusters from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony et al., 2009</xref>). The same principle could be utilized to dislodge residual Rad51 and Rad54 from newly extended D-loops, which could further destabilize hDNA by removing these potentially stabilizing protein factors. It was reported that Rad51 bound to adjacent duplex DNA stimulates the helicase activity of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupaigne et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and proposed for Srs2 and RECQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwendener et al., 2010</xref>), it is possible that Srs2 also acts on the second end during SDSA dissociating Rad51 to enable reannealing, as Rad51 inhibits the Rad52 annealing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). This mechanism would be complementary to Srs2 disrupting D-loops, as Rad51 displacement alone appears to be insufficient to explain the SDSA role of Srs2. Analysis of the <italic>srs2-R1</italic> mutant showed that the interaction of Srs2 with SUMO-PCNA is not required for its anti-recombination activity but the mutant showed the increase in crossovers indicative of a defect in SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le Breton et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, the resected DSB is not a substrate for PCNA loading by RFC, as it has the opposite polarity (5' junction) of the native RFC substrate (3'-junction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majka and Burgers, 2004</xref>), and it appears unlikely that PCNA would be found on resected DSBs.</p><p>In sum, Srs2 and Mph1 appear to provide two distinct pathways to process extended D-loops and shunt HR to non-crossover outcome and SDSA. The genetic profiles of both mutants show a clear difference: <italic>mph1</italic> mutants shift non-crossover to crossover events without effect on repair efficiency, whereas <italic>srs2</italic> mutants show a decrease in repair efficiency and loss of non-crossover products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ira et al., 2003</xref>). The synthetic negative interaction between both mutants suggests partial overlap between both pathways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) for a discussion why there are so many proteins involved in D-loop disruption). What differentiates both proteins is their physical and functional interaction with PCNA, specifically SUMO-PCNA. We suggest that Srs2 is specialized to disrupt D-loops extended with SUMO-PCNA, and that in its absence such extended D-loops become a potentially lethal intermediate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins and DNA substrates</title><p>Yeast Rad51, RPA, Rad54, Srs2, RFC, and DNA Polymerase δ were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fortune et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiianitsa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solinger and Heyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van Komen et al., 2006</xref>).

The authors explore the pro-recombination role of Srs2 by establishing robust assays for D-loop formation and dissociation in vitro with purified components. Revealing this essential pro-recombinogenic role of Srs2 in SDSA is of general importance for the genome stability field. Srs2 is able to displace D-loops both un-extended and extended by SUMO-PCNA and DNA polymerase δ. The authors show that Srs2 is highly active in dissociating D-loop generated by Rad51 and Rad54 with a 607 nucleotide invading ssDNA. They also show Srs2 has a weaker activity in disrupting extended D-loops made in reactions that include DNA polymerase δ/RFC/PCNA. The use of different forms of PCNA allowed the authors to show that it is the SUMO-PCNA extended D loops the one affected by Srs2. No effect is seen with Ubi-PCNA or wild-type PCNA suggesting that only the SUMO-PCNA form is able to promote extension that is displaced by Srs2. The manuscript is clear and extremely well written. It just needs some clarifications and some experimental modifications, as suggested below, to strengthen some conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> provide convincing support of D-loop dissociation by Srs2, but some of the later analyses are less convincing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Srs2 disruption of protein free and protein-bound D loops is compared. The authors state that in order to directly compare the activity of Srs2 on RecA-generated vs. Rad51-generated D-loops they needed to change the buffer conditions, but this seems to result in a very poor yield of D-loops in the Rad51 reaction (~12% compared with &gt;50% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Without Srs2 the level of D-loops continues to increase over the time course. The concern here is that addition of Srs2 is preventing formation of D-loops in the ongoing reaction instead of by D-loop disruption. By contrast, the RecA reaction seems to be complete at the time Srs2 is added (yield of D-loops is not changed in the absence of Srs2); thus the drop in D-loop yield observed after Srs2 addition probably reflects D-loop disruption.

Thus, the yield of D-loops and extended D-loops with a 100 nt ssDNA is very similar to that reported previously by the Krejci lab. The Krejci and Sung groups have previously shown that Mph1 helicase is highly active in dissociating unextended as well as extended D-loops, but these two groups observed no or only weak D-loop disruption by Srs2.

The yield of extended D-loops increases over the time course in the absence of Srs2 raising the question of whether Srs2 is preventing D-loop extension (by its strippase function or by preventing access to Pol δ) or disrupting extended D-loops after they are made. This is particularly problematic for interpreting the data with SUMO-PCNA because the yield of unextended D-loops is higher in the reactions with SUMO-PCNA than with WT PCNA suggesting SUMO-PCNA is inhibiting D-loop extension rather than preferentially disrupting extended D-loops. It would be necessary to start with conditions where all D-loops have been extended before adding Srs2 to ensure only the disruption activity is monitored as well as to assess the role of the Srs2 ATPase activity in disruption of extended D-loops, especially with SUMO-PCNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22195.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript describes the biochemical reconstitution of a significant part of the SDSA homologous recombination pathway in which the Srs2 a 3'-5' helicase with pro and anti-recombination roles in vivo, participates.

Upon quantitation and calculating D-loop dissociation rates, it actually appears that Srs2 has an about two-fold preference to disrupt extending D-loops over D-loops made with the 607 nt substrate (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We added this information to the manuscript. In addition, we want to clarify that Srs2 can disrupt extending D-loops with all forms of PCNA (SUMO, ubiquitin, unmodified) but shows a slight preference for D-loops extending with SUMO-PCNA.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> provide convincing support of D-loop dissociation by Srs2, but some of the later analyses are less convincing.

The reaction conditions of the bacterial RecA reaction and the yeast Rad51/Rad54 reaction are quite different. For example, the RecA reaction is sensitive to salt, whereas the Rad51/Rad54 reaction is stimulated by salt. Moreover, the RecA reaction shows different kinetics and yield making a direct comparison difficult. We tried many conditions to compare the two enzymes, both in their respective optimal and permissive condition. In hindsight, we should have omitted these experiments from the manuscript, but we had invested so much that we initially decided to include them. We think that we can eliminate the RecA experiments and still maintain that Srs2 shows specificity for the reconstituted reaction with yeast proteins, as D-loop disruption in the reconstituted assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is ten-fold better than the disruption of protein-free D-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A, B</xref>) [see subsection “Srs2 disrupts Rad51/Rad54 produced D-loops more effectively than protein-free D-loops”].</p><p><italic>Analysis of D-loops extended by DNA polymerase δ/RFC/PCNA is complicated by the need to use a shorter oligo substrate to avoid topological constraints on extension of the invading strand.

First, as the reviewers correctly note, in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> data D-loop extension was not completed and extended D-loops increased during the Srs2 time course, but less so in the presence of Srs2 than in its absence. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, parts A-C, we kept the original experimental design with an end-labeled oligonucleotide as invading DNA but increased the incubation time with the polymerase from 6 to 15 min to drive most D-loops into the extended form. Addition of increasing amounts of Srs2 clearly shows a reduction of extended D-loops from about 30% to about 10%. This is accompanied by a congruent increase in the expected products of collapsed extended D-loops visualizing the extended, end-labeled invading DNA. Second, we added in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, parts D and E, a new experimental design producing radiolabeled extended D-loops using <italic>α</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>P-dCTP incorporation. The time course after addition of 25 nM Srs2 shows a dramatic decrease in extended D-loops and a concomitant increase in the expected signal for the radiolabeled, extended invading strand of the collapsed extended D-loop. This experiment has a more qualitative character and the quantitation is provided as a supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>, we did not observe a significant difference between SUMO- PCNA and unmodified PCNA. This is likely related to the fact that the reaction conditions were not designed to document subtle differences. For example, Srs2 was not limiting and the incubation temperature was optimal. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we use the <italic>α</italic><sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation assay and a titration of Srs2 at a lower temperature (25 instead of 30 °C) to slow the reaction. Here, we see a slight, but reproducible and significant, preference for disrupting D-loop extending with SUMO-PCNA. In these reactions, higher amounts of Srs2 (25 nM) still disrupt all D-loops efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This slight preference for SUMO-PCNA extending D-loops seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is congruent with the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> using the end-labeled invading DNA substrate in the D-loop reaction (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and these effects depend on the presence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and active extension (i.e. presence of dNTPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We are careful in our wording to reflect that Srs2 has only a slight preference under our assay conditions for SUMO-PCNA over unmodified and UBI- PCNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
