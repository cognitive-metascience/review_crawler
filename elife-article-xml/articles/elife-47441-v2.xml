and transmembrane channel-like 2 (TMC2) have been proposed to be the pore-forming subunits in mammals. TMCs were also found to regulate biological processes other than MET in invertebrates, ranging from sensations to motor function. However, whether TMCs have a non-MET role remains elusive in mammals. Here, we report that in mouse hair cells, TMC1, but not TMC2, provides a background leak conductance, with properties distinct from those of the MET channels. By cysteine substitutions in TMC1, we characterized four amino acids that are required for the leak conductance. The leak conductance is graded in a frequency-dependent manner along the length of the cochlea and is indispensable for action potential firing. Taken together, our results show that TMC1 confers a background leak conductance in cochlear hair cells, which may be critical for the acquisition of sound-frequency and -intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TMC1</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>leak conductance</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd><kwd>tonotopy</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31522025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science &amp; Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001518001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81873703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3181101148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint research scheme grant (N_HKUST614/18)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Pingbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint research scheme grant (N_HKUST614/18)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Other than its function in mechanotransduction, TMC1 is indispensable for action potential firing of auditory hair cells by mediating a leak conductance that alters tonotopically along the cochlea coil.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells are mechanoreceptors that convert mechanical stimuli provided by sound and acceleration into electrical signals. In the snail-shaped mammalian cochlea, hair cells are organized into three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row of inner hair cells (IHCs) that run along the length of the cochlear duct. The cochlea is tonotopically organized, where hair cells at the base of the cochlea signal high-frequency sounds and hair cells at the apex catch low-frequency sounds, with a gradient in between. OHCs amplify input sound signals whereas IHCs transmit sound information to the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>The mechanotransduction complex in cochlear hair cells consists of a multitude of proteins, including ion channel subunits, cell adhesion proteins, myosin motors, and scaffolding proteins that are critical to sense sound-induced force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiong and Xu, 2018</xref>). The transmembrane proteins TMC1, TMC2, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5), and transmembrane inner ear expressed protein (TMIE), are thought to be integral components of the MET channels in hair cells. TMC1 and TMC2 have been proposed to be the pore-forming subunits of the MET channel in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballesteros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corey and Holt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawashima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this model, MET currents are absent in hair cells from mice lacking both TMC1 and TMC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>), while the unitary conductance, permeability, and ion selectivity of the MET channel differs between hair cells expressing only TMC1 or TMC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corns et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Fettiplace, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, cysteine mutagenesis experiments are consistent with the model that TMC1 is a pore-forming subunit of the hair-cell MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). However, all efforts have so far failed to express TMC proteins in heterologous cells to reconstitute ion channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corey and Holt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu and Müller, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, MET responses in OHCs vary tonotopically, and a lack of TMC1 and LHFPL5, but not TMC2, abolishes the tonotopic gradient in the MET response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2015b</xref>). While changes in the levels of expression of TMC1 from the base to the apex have been proposed to underlie the tonotopic gradient in the MET response, the mechanisms that cause the tonotopic gradient are not completely defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waguespack et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>TMC orthologues in other species have been linked to a diversity of functions. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, TMC is expressed in the class I and class II dendritic arborization neurons and bipolar dendrite neurons, which are critical for larval locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). TMC is also enriched in md-L neurons that sense food texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and for proprioceptor-mediated direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, TMC1 regulates development and sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and is required for the alkaline sensitivity of ASH nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). While efforts have failed to demonstrate that TMCs in flies and worms are mechanically gated ion channels, recent mechanistic studies in worms have shown that TMC1 and TMC2 regulate membrane excitability and egg-laying behavior by conferring a leak conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the question of whether mammalian TMC1 and TMC2 only function as components of mechanically gated ion channels, or possess additional roles critical for mechanosensory hair-cell function.</p><p>In this study, we set out to determine the non-MET functions of TMCs and to tackle the link with hair-cell function by manipulating TMCs genetically and monitoring membrane current and potential in mouse hair cells. We sought out potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TMCs and their correlated relevance in auditory transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TMC1 but not TMC2 mediates a background current in hair cells</title><p>During the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording from P6 outer hair cells (OHCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in regular 144 mM Na<sup>+</sup>-containing external solution (144 Na), we always recorded a ‘leaky’ membrane current (I<sub>m</sub>, 73 pA on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). When Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced in the external solution by N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG<sup>+</sup>) (144 NMDG), the I<sub>m</sub> was small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating that this background current is significantly carried by an ion channel in the cell membrane. When reperfused with 144 Na solution, the current baseline returned to ‘leaky’ status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the I<sub>m</sub> was markedly diminished in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

Furthermore, the voltage dependence of I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>NMDG</sub> was analyzed by applying a series of voltage-pulse stimuli to OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>).

A significant leak conductance would be expected to depolarize the membrane and affect cell excitability. IHCs are innervated by the spiral ganglion neurons that transmit sound information to the CNS, and signal transmission from hair cells to the spiral ganglion; therefore possibly being affected by the leak conductance. Therefore, we measured the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in IHCs bathed in external solution with 100 μM DHS by whole-cell current-clamp recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In wild-type IHCs, the resting V<sub>m</sub> varied (actively and periodically) in bursting and non-bursting states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, the resting V<sub>m</sub> was more hyperpolarized, and there was limited action potential firing in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). With positive current injection, the <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs fired action potentials at threshold similar to wild-type IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

As shown by the mutagenesis experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), at least four amino acids were critical for the leak conductance, as these constructs failed to restore the leak current after replacement of a single amino acid by cysteine. In addition, the leak conductance was inhibited by typical MET channel blockers, implying that TMC1 is the responsible component for the leak current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). With TMC1 deficiency, the resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized, resulting in the absence of the spontaneous action potential firing in neonatal IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and the removal of the leak conductance was coupled with abolishment of the gradient of MET conductances in OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). All these data pointed out a previously unappreciated non-MET role of TMC1 in mammals, by mediating a leak conductance and thereby participating tonotopy and regulating membrane excitability.</p><p>It has been recognized that leak conductance is generally used in the nervous system to regulate neuronal excitability and thus circuit activity; it recruits a variety of channels on the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enyedi and Czirják, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). In other species, TMC orthologues function in diverse ways according to their expression pattern in effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the excitability of cells and neural circuits that control processes from sensory transduction to motor function are commonly upregulated by TMC proteins in diverse organisms.</p><p>Of interest, the leak conductance differed from the MET conductance in several properties, although both are functional representations of TMC1. First, the leak current did not stem from the resting open MET channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, the patterns of conductance change differed for the leak channel and the MET channel according to the amino-acid substitution experiment. Further, adding positive charge to these amino acids did not affect the leak conductance, as revealed by its insensitivity to treatment with MTSET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was not identical to the effect on the MET conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). An intriguing observation was that M412C did not disrupt the leak conductance with or without MTSET. Inversely though, previous evidence has shown that MTSET treatment of M412C reduced the MET current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). In terms of the leak conductance, M412C behaved similarly to wild-type, which is not surprising, as studies have shown the distinct sensitivities of the leak and MET conductances to factors including channel blockers and calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and M412K causes deafness without affecting the MET current in Beethoven mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marcotti et al., 2006</xref>). Third, the leak channel shared a group of identical antagonists with the MET channel but had different blocking affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Both MET channel blockers, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>) and non-selective cation channel blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>) inhibited the leak current but with an IC<sub>50</sub>5–10-fold higher than that for the MET channel. Last, extracellular high Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocked the leak conductance but not the MET channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These lines of evidence indicate that TMC1 confers the leak conductance by a mechanism distinct from the MET channel.</p><p>The tonotopic gradient of conductance in OHCs is an important property of hair-cell MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waguespack et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the TMC1-mediated leak conductance exhibits a tonotopic pattern in OHCs, in parallel with the tonotopicity of the MET current. The leak current still existed in <italic>Tmc2</italic>-knockout OHCs, but it was absent from <italic>Tmc1</italic>- or <italic>Lhfpl5</italic>-knockout OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), which is consistent with the findings that the gradient of the MET response was lost in <italic>Tmc1</italic>- and <italic>Lhfpl5</italic>-knockout mice and preserved in <italic>Tmc2</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2015b</xref>). The leak conductance and the MET conductance increased in wild-type OHCs but decreased in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout OHCs along the cochlear coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), which also coincides with the spatiotemporal <italic>Tmc1</italic> expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>) and the abundance of TMC1 proteins in graded numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>). However, high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> abolished both the leak current and the gradient of the MET response, defined by the analysis of the macroscopic MET current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and unitary MET current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which reflected different working mechanisms of the MET channel and the leak channel to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Our results showed thatthe leak conductance, together with the MET response, is tuned by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other unknown determinants, which is not surprising as other factors, such as PIP2, also regulate MET channel pore properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Effertz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Because of limited information about the structure of TMC1, we do not yet know how TMC1 confers the leak conductance, at least it appears that the leak channel is located in the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It was proposed that there are increasing numbers of TMC molecules (from 8 to 20) per MET site from low-frequency OHCs to high-frequency OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>). However, not all TMC1 proteins are localized at the MET site, where only up to two MET channel complexes exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurima et al., 2015</xref>). Our data further describe a scenario that extra TMC1 proteins functionally couple with the leak channels with graded conductances in OHCs along the cochlear coil, coinciding with increased numbers of extra TMC1 molecules that are not at the MET site per hair bundle from apex to base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we suggest a working model in which TMC1 functionally incorporates into a leak channel and the MET channel, rather than being the pore of the two channels, and tunes the activity of hair cells. However, this hypothesis needs to be further examined by structural and functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Cochlear culture and injectoporation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the organ of Corti was isolated from P3 mice and cut into three pieces in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 with 1.5 μg/ml ampicillin. For electroporation, a glass pipette (2 μm tip diameter) was used to deliver cDNA plasmids (0.2 μg/μl in 1 × Hanks' balanced salt solution) to hair cells in the sensory epithelium. EGFP was used as an indicator for the selection of transfected hair cells. A series of three pulses at 60 V lasting 15 ms at 1 s intervals was applied to cochlear tissues by an electroporator (ECM Gemini X2, BTX, CA). The cochlear tissues were cultured for 1 day in vitro and then used for electrophysiological recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Hair cells were recorded using whole-cell voltage or current clamp as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25°C). Briefly, the basilar membrane with hair cells was acutely dissected from neonatal mice. The dissection solution contained (in mM): 141.7 NaCl, 5.36 KCl, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3.4 L-glutamine, 10 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES (pH 7.4). Then the basilar membrane was transferred into a recording chamber with recording solution containing (in mM): 144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES (pH 7.4). For I<sub>Leak</sub> calculation, the cells were further bathed in recording solution containing 144 mM NMDG that replaced 144 mM NaCl. The acutely isolated or cultured basilar membrane was used for electrophysiological recording within 1 h. Hair cells were imaged under an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 × water immersion objective and an sCMOS camera (ORCA Flash4.0, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) controlled by MicroManager 1.6 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (BF150-117-10, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) with a pipette puller (P-2000, Sutter) and polished on a microforge (MF-830, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to resistances of 4–6 M'Ω. Intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 H-HEPES, pH 7.2), except when CsCl was replaced with KCl in current-clamp. Hair cells were recorded with a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC 10 USB and Patchmaster software, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). As measured, the liquid junction potential of the pipette with CsCl intracellular solution had a value of +4 mV in regular recording solution and −6 mV in 144 mM NMDG<sup>+</sup> solution, which was not corrected in the data shown.</p><p>For single-channel recordings, we followed published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ricci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). The intracellular solution was the same for macroscopic and microscopic current recording. To break tip-links, hair bundles were exposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution using a fluid jet (in mM): 144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 5 EGTA, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES, pH 7.4. After bundle destruction, fresh external solution was given to re-establish the corresponding extracellular ionic environment. Two external solutions were used: 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution containing (in mM) 144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES, pH 7.4; and 35 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution containing (in mM) 80 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 35 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES, pH 7.4. Only traces with obvious single-channel events were included for analyzing.</p><p>The sampling rate was 1 kHz for leak current recording, 50 kHz for the IV protocol and current-clamp recording, and 100 kHz for unitary channel recording. The voltage-clamp used a –70 mV holding potential, and the current-clamp was held at 0 pA. Only recordings with a current baseline &lt;20 pA in NMDG solution were used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hair bundle stimulation and removal</title><p>The hair bundle was deflected by two types of mechanical stimulus, fluid jet and glass probe. The fluid jet stimulation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurg et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, a 40 Hz sinusoidal wave stimulus was delivered by a 27-mm-diameter piezoelectric disc driven by a home-made piezo amplifier pipette with a tip diameter of 3–5 μm positioned 5–10 μm from the hair bundle to evoke maximum MET currents. For glass probe stimulation, hair bundles were deflected with a glass pipette mounted on a P-885 piezoelectric stack actuator (Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany). The actuator was driven with voltage steps that were low-pass filtered at 10 KHz. To avoid bundle damage caused by overstimulation, the glass probe was shaped to have a slightly smaller diameter than the hair bundles, and the stimulation distance was 800 nm for macroscopic current and 100 nm for unitary channel recording. For hair bundle removal, a pipette with 1 μm diameter tip was used to suck away the hair bundles of the target OHCs. The hair-bundle-removed OHCs with good condition were further recorded. Examined by a fluid-jet stimulation, the OHCs without obvious MET current were further measured for the leak current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Inhibitors, ion substitution, permeability, and perfusion</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, DHS, dTC, amiloride, GdCl<sub>3</sub>, and LaCl<sub>3</sub> were added as calculated to the recording solution (in mM) 144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES (pH 7.4).

A voltage-ramp stimulation from −120 to 80 mV lasting for 2 s was applied to calculate the reversal potential. For measuring Na<sup>+</sup> permeability, OHCs were perfused with the external solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl,1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES.

To eliminate the influence of technical leak, an identical voltage-ramp stimulation was applied on each recorded OHC in 150 NMDG. The part of the inward current trace was fitted linearly to calculate the voltage value cross point between interest of ion and NMDG solution, which represented the reverse potential of the leak between this ion and Cs<sup>+</sup>. The relative permeability of the monovalent cation was calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hille, 2001</xref>)<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>And for divalent cations, the equation was:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For which γ<sub>Cs</sub> = 0.70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hille, 2001</xref>), γ<sub>Ca</sub> = 0.4657, γ<sub>Mg</sub> = 0.5271 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodil and Vera, 2001</xref>).</p><p> <italic>E<sub>rev</sub></italic> means reversal potential, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>R</italic> mean Faraday constant and gas constant, <italic>T</italic> means absolute temperature.

For cochlear tissue, the perfusion tip was placed 2–3 mm from the patched hair cell and the perfusion rate was ~0.5 ml/min.

For certain experiments, such as single-channel recording, the trace numbers were over 100. All cell numbers were noted in the figure legends. Multiple recordings from one cell with the identical stimulus protocol were considered as technical replications, which were averaged to generate a single biological replication representing value/data from one cell. Data were managed and analyzed with Excel (Microsoft), Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and Igor pro 6 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The current traces similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> were low-pass filtered to less noisy traces with the smoothing function (Binomial 20) provided by Igor software. All data are shown as mean ± SEM. We used student’s T-test for one-to-one comparison and ANOVA for multiple comparisons to determine statistical significance (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001). Values and N numbers are defined in the figures and figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs Ulrich Mueller, Bailong Xiao, Xin Liang, Wei Zhang, and members of Xiong laboratory for helpful discussions and critical proof-reading of this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter G Barr-Gillespie (Reviewer #2); Anthony J Ricci (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study which examined the contribution of TMC1 to the resting membrane &quot;leak&quot; conductance of hair cells in the mammalian cochlea. An understanding of the proteins involved in forming MET channels and other sources of resting membrane current in hair cells is lacking and continues to be an issue of great controversy. The authors approach this question by performing whole cell voltage clamp recordings from OHCs and IHCs in cochlea isolated from pre-hearing mice, in combination with pharmacological and genetic manipulations. The experiments provide evidence that TMC1 can contribute to a resting &quot;leak&quot; conductance that is in many ways distinct from the MET. Most striking is the lack of MTSET effects on TMC1 cysteine mutants thought to reside within the pore; in particular, MTSET does not alter the leak but reduces the transduction current in Tmc1 ko OHCs expressing TMC1-M412C. This is a remarkable finding and it is hard to understand how this could occur if these amino acids are part of a pore formed by TMC1. The experiments have been conducted carefully and the inclusion of long duration recording traces are particularly impactful and illustrate the consequences of the manipulations particularly clearly. There are however multiple issues with the work that need clarification before publication. The majority of the comments are related to presentation and interpretation, which make it difficult to appreciate the overall significance of the findings, given that the majority of the experiments focus on excitability of OHCs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The writing and grammar in the manuscript needs a complete overhaul. There are many mistakes and unclear wordings which interfere with understanding what the authors are trying to convey.</p><p>2) Figure 1 panel B, what do the light gray and pink traces represent? (This is in most of the figures and should be stated at least in the first legend). I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>BG</sub> should be defined directly, particularly in the legend. It is unclear the point of Figure 1G, but it should include an estimate of the reversal potential for each conductance. Do you know that the permeation of NMDG is the same or different between conductances?</p><p>3) The authors should provide better justification that either the endogenous or overexpressed leak is coming from the hair bundle. Might these channels be on the soma?</p><p>4) The mutagenesis data suggest TMC1 is part of the leak conductance, but the authors should not overstate the evidence to indicate that it is the channel. It might be a component and that can be suggested, but until the protein can be shown to actually be a channel, a more conservative approach to the writing would make sense. Basing conclusions on work that, in itself is not yet complete, weakens the argument. Given that the subunit composition and pore structure of the native channels will impact how the cysteine mutations manifest, these data should be used to highlight that the two conductances can be separated rather than used as evidence that it is the channel.</p><p>5) Descriptions of resting membrane current are only relevant when discussing what membrane potential the hair cells were held at. The recording configuration should also be described as whole-cell voltage clamp, not &quot;patch-clamp&quot; as patches of membrane were not isolated for these experiments.</p><p>6) It is not clear why the authors make the statement that &quot;the inward I<sub>BG</sub> was dramatically reduced in Tmc1-knockout OHCs&quot;, as both inward and outward components are reduced to nearly similar degrees in Tmc1-ko OHCs.</p><p>7) Statements about current amplitudes should include the data (average + SD/SEM and N values). The authors report current amplitudes significant to two decimal places, that is to the level of femtoamperes – this seems unnecessary, given the noise level of the recordings (5-10 pA, Figure 1B). Here and elsewhere-four significant digits makes no sense (unless the measurement is so precise that the errors justify it). Please report the error (SD or SEM, with n), keep the error to two significant digits, and adjust the significant digits in the mean accordingly.</p><p>8) Statistical analysis – the authors exclusively perform Student's T-tests, which it would be more appropriate to perform ANOVA followed by post-hoc test, to assess multiple comparisons (e.g. Figure 2D, Figure 6B, etc).</p><p>9) Why was the current amplitude so much smaller for the P3+ 1 OHCs than the acute P6 OHCs? It is notable that the resting current measured at P3 +1 is not different from the P6 TMC ko OHCs. Could the transfection be affecting the health of the cells?</p><p>10) &quot;These data indicated that hair cells possess a background leak conductance, conferred specifically by TMC1.&quot; Given the complexity (and controversy) surrounding conductances in hair cells, I feel that this statement is too strong. It certainly suggests that TMC1 is necessary for the leak, but does not show it mediates it directly. In this regard, the lack of MTSET sensitivity could be regarded as refuting this hypothesis.</p><p>11) &quot;Exogenously expressed TMC2 was significantly located in hair bundle of OHCs, as shown by HA tag (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).&quot; I don't find this statement compelling based on the fluorescent traces provided. Images with better optical sectioning should be provided. The use of the word &quot;significantly&quot; should be backed by a quantitative assessment.</p><p>12) &quot;Thus, neither mechanical nor pharmacological blockade of the MET channel affect I<sub>Leak</sub> &quot; This statement is also too strong. What the experiments show is that there is a holding current that persists when MET channels are closed or blocked with DHS. The experiments do not directly assess whether the leak current is affected by these manipulations.</p><p>13) Most striking is the MTSET effect – it does not alter the leak but reduces the transduction current in Tmc1 ko OHCs expressing TMC1-M412C. However, the high variability in I<sub>Leak</sub> measurements decrease the power of the conclusions regarding the ability of different cysteine mutations to restore the leak current (particularly for M412C, T532C). What accounts for the high variance in this measurement? It is surprising that 5 out of the 6 cysteine mutants failed to restore the leak current. It is hard to reconcile that result with the idea that TMC1 contributes its pore both to the MET conductance and to the leak conductance. It is equally strange that M412C behaved identically to WT. Further discussion/clarification on these points is necessary.</p><p>14) Panel C in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 is not explained in the figure legend and there are no n values for these experiments.</p><p>15) To assess excitability, the authors move to IHCs, but there is insufficient evidence of TMC1 dependent leak current with similar characteristics in IHCs. The authors should indicate what age and location (along the cochlea) was used for these recordings.</p><p>16) The discussion of excitability changes was difficult to follow. In particular, the statements &quot;the V<sub>m</sub> was largely hyperpolarized&quot; should be supported by data for clarity and the statement &quot;Although the V<sub>m</sub> in the non-bursting state was more hyperpolarized than in the bursting state in wild-type IHCs, it was positive to the V<sub>m</sub> in Tmc1-knockout IHCs (Figure 7A,B).&quot; needs to be revised.</p><p>17) The change in firing behavior TMC1 ko IHCs is difficult to understand. Presumably, these cells have a higher membrane resistance, so all other things being equal, they should experience greater depolarization for a given current injection, therefore increasing their excitability. As described, this is opposite to the phenotype observed. To control for resting state changes, these experiments should be repeated by measuring input output at the same membrane potential (neglecting the amount of current required to hold the cells at the same potential).</p><p>18) The authors make the statement &quot;The MET current decreased from apex to base in Tmc1-knockout OHCs, which might result from that the hair bundle got more disrupted at base coil.&quot; If there could be differences in MET current amplitudes due to damage, this needs to be explored more thoroughly and accounted for, as it could complicate interpretation of the current amplitude gradients.</p><p>19) The variation in Ca sensitivity between MET and leak currents (Figure 8) is very perplexing and the authors do not provide a compelling answer to the observed variation.</p><p>20) The authors discuss three measured or derived currents: I-membrane, I-background, and I-leak. The writing and figures make it very difficult to figure out exactly what they are referring to, especially the difference between I-background and I-leak. I figured it out, but it took work. The distinction between these currents needs to be made much more clear.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;TMC1 Is an Essential Component of a Leak Channel Underlying Tonotopy and Excitability of Auditory Hair Cells in Mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The general writing of the manuscript is still an obstacle to understanding the work. It needs major grammatical check as well as structural work to increase clarity and interpretation. For the revision, please send a version of the file with changes incorporated (without the Word edits highlighted). It is difficult to read the manuscript in this format.</p><p>2) The description of the contribution of TMC1 to the MET and leak currents needs further revision. For example, in the Discussion section: &quot;Hence, we suggest a working model in which TMC1 integrates with the MET channel and a leak channel, and tunes the activity of hair cells.&quot; the authors should be more explicit about their thinking-it's not that TMC1 can be a leak channel or a MET channel, but it can incorporate into each. That makes interpretation of the results-especially the striking differences in behavior of the mutants-more understandable. This is an important point as some may have been thinking that the transduction channel (and the leak channel, by parallel) is just the TMCs, but it must be more complicated.</p><p>3) Subsection “The leak current modulates action potential firing in IHCs”. For the Tmc1 KO effects on excitability, how do we distinguish a reduction of MET resting Popen from the reduction in the leak current?</p><p>4) Subsection “TMC1 but not TMC2 mediates a background current in hair cells”. Change &quot;the I<sub>m</sub> was little (Figure 1B)…&quot; to &quot;the I<sub>m</sub> was small (Figure 1B),…&quot; (changing the word and adding a comma).</p><p>5) Subsection “TMC1 but not TMC2 mediates a background current in hair cells”. Change to &quot;falls after P4&quot;.</p><p>6) Subsection “TMC1-mediated leak current is not carried by the resting open MET channel”. Change to something like: &quot;Due to existing tension in the hair bundle, the open probability of MET channels at rest in hair cells is significant…&quot;</p><p>7) Throughout. Unless it is used as a compound adjective, &quot;amino-acid&quot; or &quot;amino-acids&quot; should be changed to &quot;amino acid&quot; and &quot;amino acids.&quot;</p><p>8) Subsection “Amino-acid substitutions in TMC1 alter the TMC1-mediated leak current”. The clause &quot;neglecting to express any of the six cysteine-substituted TMC1 constructs&quot; doesn't make sense.</p><p>9) Subsection “The leak current modulates action potential firing in IHCs”. The usual vernacular is to &quot;depolarize the membrane,&quot; rather than &quot;depolarize the membrane potential.&quot;</p><p>10) I'm not 100% sure, but I didn't think worm TMC-1 and TMC-2 are specifically homologous to (respectively) TMC1 and TMC2.</p><p>11) Discussion section. I don't understand this sentence: &quot;However, it is still not yet explained that only a quarter proportion of TMC1 proteins are localized at the MET site, whereby counting around 2 MET complexes exist…&quot;</p><p>12) The interpretation of the IV curves needs to be clarified. I would assume that the IV curves represent complex currents, not just leak and MET but other voltage gated channels as well. Would further assume the outward currents are not affected by NMDG but rather by the internal ions. So how these plots are interpreted is important and might be different depending on the voltage range that is investigated.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;TMC1 Is an Essential Component of a Leak Channel Underlying Tonotopy and Excitability of Auditory Hair Cells in Mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We hypothesized that, if the leak current reduced in major proportion, the leak is coming from the hair bundle. If not, then the leak is coming from the soma. Our result showed that, the leak current decreased to 10 pA in hair-bundle removed OHCs, compared to the 48 pA leak current from intact OHCs. This piece of evidence indicated that, the leak conductance likely comes from the hair bundle. We did not successfully achieve similar recordings in cultured and overexpressed OHCs.

Especially, under treatment or manipulation of hair cells (e.g. tissue culture status and TMC1 overexpression), the current amplitude varies depending on quantity of TMC1 proteins. Our solution was to make more recordings in order to gain better quantification from mean and distribution analysis. Based on amino-acid substitution experiment and other results, the leak channel demonstrated distinct properties from the MET channel, including the M412C that regulated the MET channel conductance but not the leak channel conductance. We agreed that, M412 is an interesting site and that M412C mutation did not affect the leak current, even with MTSET treatment. While previous evidence has shown that MTSET treatment of M412C reduces the MET current (Pan et al., 2018), and M412K causes deafness without affecting the MET current in Beethoven mice (Marcotti et al., 2006). In terms of the leak conductance, M412C behaved similar to wild-type, which is not atypical since other evidence has shown the distinct dosage sensitivities to factors (e.g. channel blockers and calcium, between the leak channel and the MET channel). In the revised manuscript, we stated that, TMC1 is essential for the leak channel, but it not yet ready to claim it as the pore for the leak channel.

The authors should indicate what age and location (along the cochlea) was used for these recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>For the IHC recordings, the mouse age was P6 and the location recorded was 0.4 to the very apex as length of the whole cochlear coil was 1.0. At the same age and recording location of cochlea, the leak current amplitude was obviously different between IHCs (24 pA, n=11, previous Figure 7D) and OHCs (51 pA, n=9, new Figure 3E). We also added more IHC recordings to raise the n value from 11 to 20, with the leak current being 25 pA (new Figure 7D); similar to the previous value. We hypothesized that, it may have resulted from the less number of TMC1 proteins in IHCs compared to that in OHCs (Beurg et al., 2018), which is discussed.

In particular, the statements &quot;the V<sub>m</sub> was largely hyperpolarized&quot; should be supported by data for clarity and the statement &quot;Although the V<sub>m</sub> in the non-bursting state was more hyperpolarized than in the bursting state in wild-type IHCs, it was positive to the V<sub>m</sub> in Tmc1-knockout IHCs (Figure 7A,B).&quot; needs to be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence &quot;the V<sub>m</sub> was largely hyperpolarized&quot; was changed to “the resting V<sub>m</sub> was more hyperpolarized” in subsection “The leak current modulates action potential firing in IHCs”. It was supported by the quantification in Figure 7B. The statement &quot;Although the V<sub>m</sub> in the non-bursting state was more hyperpolarized than in the bursting state in wild-type IHCs, it was positive to the V<sub>m</sub> in Tmc1-knockout IHCs (Figure 7A,B).&quot; was revised to “Although the V<sub>m</sub> baseline in the non-bursting state was more hyperpolarized than that in the bursting state in wild-type IHCs, it was still more depolarized than the V<sub>m</sub> baseline in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs (Figure 7A,B)” subsection “The leak current modulates action potential firing in IHCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The change in firing behavior TMC1 ko IHCs is difficult to understand. Presumably, these cells have a higher membrane resistance, so all other things being equal, they should experience greater depolarization for a given current injection, therefore increasing their excitability. As described, this is opposite to the phenotype observed. To control for resting state changes, these experiments should be repeated by measuring input output at the same membrane potential (neglecting the amount of current required to hold the cells at the same potential).</p></disp-quote><p>We added experiments to answer this question. By adjusting holding current, the membrane potential was brought to -60 mV in wild-type and <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs. When injecting additional 50 pA current, the firing rate of action potentials in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs was higher than that in wild-type IHCs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Hence, it is not opposite to the phenotype we described in Figure 7. Due to lack of the leak conductance that induces a higher membrane resistance in Tmc1-knockout IHCs than that in wild-type IHCs, the V<sub>m</sub> is more hyperpolarized and action potential fires less in resting condition. Hence, when artificially bringing the holding V<sub>m</sub> to an identical level followed by injecting the same amount of current, the action potential fires more in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout IHCs.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47441-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The authors make the statement &quot;The MET current decreased from apex to base in Tmc1-knockout OHCs, which might result from that the hair bundle got more disrupted at base coil.&quot; If there could be differences in MET current amplitudes due to damage, this needs to be explored more thoroughly and accounted for, as it could complicate interpretation of the current amplitude gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers of expressed TMC1 proteins could determine the amplitude of the MET current. In the revised manuscript, we stated that, “the leak and MET current decreased from apex to base in <italic>Tmc1</italic>-knockout OHCs, which correlated with the graded expression level of TMC1 along the cochlear coil” in subsection “The leak current follows the tonotopic gradient of the MET response in OHCs”. Moreover, we discussed the rationality in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The variation in Ca sensitivity between MET and leak currents (Figure 8) is very perplexing and the authors do not provide a compelling answer to the observed variation.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 6C,D, the P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> was 0.7 and the P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> was 0, indicating Ca<sup>2+</sup> barely entered the leak channel. This dataset could not be used to calculate Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the MET channel because we added DHS in the external solution. Thus, we included an experiment to measure the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of MET channel. The P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> is 1.3, while the P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> is 6.4, which is consistent with the report by Kim and Fettiplace, (2013). Figure 6F showed a typical dosage-dependent inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the leak conductance but not on MET channel. Thus, in Figure 8D,E, 35 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> transiently abolished the leak current and tonotopic gradient of the MET current in wild-type OHCs, similar to Tmc1-deficiency induced effect. In the revised manuscript, we compared the difference between the MET channel and the leak channel in terms of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in OHCs. We hypothesized that, Ca<sup>2+</sup> may inhibit the leak channel, although it is permeable to the MET channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) The authors discuss three measured or derived currents: I-membrane, I-background, and I-leak. The writing and figures make it very difficult to figure out exactly what they are referring to, especially the difference between I-background and I-leak. I figured it out, but it took work. The distinction between these currents needs to be made much more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We introduced a series of values for further measurement in the revised manuscript. They are I<underline><sub>m</sub></underline> (recorded membrane current), I<sub>Na</sub> (I<sub>m</sub> under 144 Na recording solution), I<sub>NMDG</sub> (I<sub>m</sub> under 144 NMDG treatment), I<sub>BG</sub> (background current by subtracting I<sub>NMDG</sub> from I<sub>Na</sub>), I<sub>DHS</sub> (I<sub>m</sub> under 100 μM DHS treatment), and I<sub>Leak</sub> (resting-MET independent leak current). In Figure 1 legend, it says, “I<sub>BG</sub> (background current) was calculated by subtraction of I<sub>m</sub> in 144 Na (I<sub>Na</sub>) and I<sub>m</sub> in 144 NMDG (I<sub>NMDG</sub>) to exclude technical leak”. In text, it says, “For more accurate quantification, the amplitude of the background current (I<sub>BG</sub>) was calculated by subtracting the I<sub>m</sub> in 144 NMDG solution (I<sub>NMDG</sub>) from that in Na<sup>+</sup> solution (I<sub>Na</sub>)”, subsection “TMC1 but not TMC2 mediates a background current in hair cells”. In Figure 3 legend, it says, “The baseline current was similar when the MET channels were closed by either FJ (#1) or DHS (I<sub>DHS</sub>, #2), as highlighted with a red dashed line. As shown in #3, the DHS-sensitive resting MET current (I<sub>Resting-MET</sub>) was calculated by subtraction of I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>DHS</sub>. The baseline current was further closed by NMDG, defined as I<sub>Leak</sub> by subtraction of I<sub>DHS</sub> and I<sub>NMDG</sub>.”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The general writing of the manuscript is still an obstacle to understanding the work.

For example, in the Discussion section: &quot;Hence, we suggest a working model in which TMC1 integrates with the MET channel and a leak channel, and tunes the activity of hair cells.&quot; the authors should be more explicit about their thinking-it's not that TMC1 can be a leak channel or a MET channel, but it can incorporate into each. That makes interpretation of the results-especially the striking differences in behavior of the mutants-more understandable. This is an important point as some may have been thinking that the transduction channel (and the leak channel, by parallel) is just the TMCs, but it must be more complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the last paragraph to clarity our opinion in the Discussion section.

I would assume that the IV curves represent complex currents, not just leak and MET but other voltage gated channels as well. Would further assume the outward currents are not affected by NMDG but rather by the internal ions. So how these plots are interpreted is important and might be different depending on the voltage range that is investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, I<sub>m</sub> represents complex currents that include leak current, resting MET current, and other channels. Because NMDG was applied only extracellularly, the inward currents but not outward currents were affected by NMDG. Then we only calculated the inward background current (I<sub>m</sub>-I<sub>NMDG</sub>) from recordings similar to Figure 1F and I<sub>BG</sub> was used in Figure 1 and Figure 2. However, as you mentioned that the I<sub>background</sub> was still complex. According to the investigation requirement, we then used I<sub>Leak</sub> to describe the leak current that may mostly represent the contribution by TMC1 (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8). The aim of I-V experiments was to show the voltage dependence of these inward background currents. We have updated sentence in subsection “TMC1 but not TMC2 mediates a background current in hair cells” to “Furthermore, the voltage dependence of I<sub>m</sub> and I<sub>NMDG</sub> was analyzed by applying a series of voltage-pulse stimuli to OHCs (Figure 1F-I). The I<sub>m</sub>-V curves obtained from these measurements verified a reduced I<sub>m</sub> (Figure 1G) and a more negative reversal potential (Figure 1H) in Tmc1-knockout OHCs. After subtraction (only inward I<sub>BG</sub> was calculated because NMDG was applied extracellularly), it was clear that the I<sub>BG</sub> altered almost linearly with holding potentials and was dramatically reduced in Tmc1-knockout OHCs (Figure 1I).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some minor revisions that are necessary for clarity, as outlined below:</p><p>Title:</p><p>TMC1 Is an Essential Component 1 of a Leak Channel Underlying Tonotopy and Excitability of Auditory Hair Cells in Mice</p><p>Change &quot;underlying&quot; to &quot;that modulates&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, “underlying” has been changed to “that modulates” in the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract:</p><p>Change to &quot;The leak conductance is graded in frequency-dependent manner along the length of the cochlea…&quot;.</p><p>our results showed – change to &quot;show&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, “The leak conductance is graded in frequency-dependent manner…” has been changed to “The leak conductance is graded in frequency-dependent manner along the length of the cochlea…” on page 2, line 30 and “showed” has been changed to “show” in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>&quot;it is a pore-forming subunit&quot; – define what &quot;it&quot; is.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, “it” has been changed to “TMC1” in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>It is noteworthy to point out that, I<sub>BG</sub> was used as the title of vertical axis to show the dosage effect (Figure 5), but it represented the leak component when the concentration of blockers was high enough.</p><p>Revise – it is not clear which leak component you are referring to:</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, this sentence has been updated to “It is noteworthy to point out that the I<sub>BG</sub> included the I<sub>Resting-MET</sub> and the I<sub>Leak</sub> when the concentration of the blockers was low, but the I<sub>BG</sub> was mainly composed of the I<sub>Leak</sub> when the concentration of blockers was high enough (Figure 5).” in subsection “Pharmacological blockade of the TMC1-mediated leak conductance”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A significant leak conductance would be expected in order to depolarize the membrane and affect cell excitability,</p><p>Revise – &quot;would be expected to depolarize…&quot;,</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, “would be expected to in order to depolarize…” has been updated to “would be expected to depolarize…” in subsection “The leak current modulates action potential firing in IHCs”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
