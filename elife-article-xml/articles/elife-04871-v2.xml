of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) restores protein synthesis at the waning of stress responses and requires a PP1 catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, PPP1R15A/GADD34 or PPP1R15B/CReP. Surprisingly, PPP1R15-PP1 binary complexes reconstituted in vitro lacked substrate selectivity. However, selectivity was restored by crude cell lysate or purified G-actin, which joined PPP1R15-PP1 to form a stable ternary complex. In crystal structures of the non-selective PPP1R15B-PP1G complex, the functional core of PPP1R15 made multiple surface contacts with PP1G, but at a distance from the active site, whereas in the substrate-selective ternary complex, actin contributes to one face of a platform encompassing the active site. Computational docking of the N-terminal lobe of eIF2a at this platform placed phosphorylated serine 51 near the active site. Mutagenesis of predicted surface-contacting residues enfeebled dephosphorylation, suggesting that avidity for the substrate plays an important role in imparting specificity on the PPP1R15B-PP1G-actin ternary complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04871.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04871.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04871.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a cell to build a protein, it must first copy the instructions contained within a gene. A complex molecular machine called a ribosome then reads these instructions and translates them into a protein. This translation process involves a number of steps. Proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (or eIFs for short) coordinate the first step in the process, which is known as ‘initiation’.</p><p>The eIFs also provide the cell with ways to control how quickly it makes proteins. For example, when a cell is stressed, either by starvation or toxins, it adds a phosphate group onto part of an eIF protein, called eIF2α. This modification makes this eIF protein less able to initiate translation, and so the cell builds fewer proteins and conserves more of its resources during times of stress.</p><p>Once the stressful conditions are over, the phosphate group is removed from eIF2α by an enzyme called a phosphatase. This phosphatase contains two subunits: one that recognizes eIF2α and another that removes the phosphate group. However, experiments that attempted to recreate this phosphatase activity using just these two subunits in a test tube failed to generate a working enzyme that specifically targeted the phosphate group of eIF2α. This suggests that in cells this enzyme contains an additional unknown subunit. Now, Chen et al. (and Chambers, Dalton et al.) report the identity of a ‘missing’ third subunit as a protein known as globular-actin or G-actin.</p><p>First, Chen et al. looked at the three-dimensional structure of a two-subunit complex formed from the previously known subunits of the phosphatase enzyme, and confirmed that it could remove phosphate groups from a range of proteins and not just eIF2α. However, when a mixture of other proteins taken from mouse cells was added to this two-subunit complex, the complex could specifically remove the phosphate group on the eIF2α protein.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that G-actin was the protein in the mixture that, when added to the two-subunit complex, made it specifically target the eIF2α protein. Chen et al. then used a combination of biochemical and structural biology techniques to investigate the phosphatase activity of the three-subunit complex. These findings suggest a plausible molecular mechanism by which the three-subunit complex becomes selective for its target, but further refinements to the structural work will be needed to critically test these suggestions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04871.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04871.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>cell line</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084812/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1002610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marciniak</surname><given-names>Stefan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU FP7 Beta-Bat No: 277713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>082961/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Randy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marciniak</surname><given-names>Stefan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Randy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The biochemical basis for coupling cytoskeletal dynamics to regulated protein synthesis has been revealed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reversible phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) is pivotal to control of global rates of protein synthesis and to modulating mRNA-specific translation in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, attenuating the translation of most mRNA, whilst the translation of a small subset of mRNAs, with special 5′ untranslated regions, is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). As the latter encode potent transcription factors, such as GCN4 in yeasts and ATF4 in animals, eIF2a phosphorylation activates gene expression programs with broad physiological ramifications: the integrated stress response (ISR) in mammals and its yeast counterpart, the general control response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Four kinases are known to couple diverse upstream signals to eIF2a phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ron and Harding, 2007</xref>). PERK restrains protein synthesis in response to unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. HRI accomplishes the same in response to heme restriction in developing erythroid precursors, whereas PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA to curtail viral protein synthesis in infected cells. The oldest eIF2a kinase, GCN2, is activated by uncharged tRNAs to restore amino acid balance by ISR activation.</p><p>In animal cells, eIF2a phosphorylation is reversed by cellular phosphatase complexes consisting of a protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1) and a substrate-specific regulatory subunit. Two such regulatory subunits have been identified in mammals: PPP1R15A (known as GADD34) is encoded by an ISR-inducible gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma and Hendershot, 2003</xref>), whereas PPP1R15B (known as CReP) is constitutively present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>). Cells lacking PPP1R15A are impaired in recovery of protein synthesis during resolution of the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>), whereas elimination of PPP1R15B results in developmental impairment and perinatal lethality of mice. Importantly, inactivation of both PPP1R15 isoforms is lethal to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsaytler et al., 2011</xref>), but can be rescued by converting serine 51 of eIF2a to the non-phosphorylatable alanine, providing genetic proof for the narrow in vivo substrate specificity of the PPP1R15 family of regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, PPP1R15 genes encode proteins of over 600 amino acids, but conspicuous conservation of sequence between the A and B isoform is confined to a stretch of ∼70 residues at their C-termini. This is also the only sequence in eIF2a-specific regulatory subunits that is conserved broadly across phyla and is encoded by a separate exon; a conserved feature of the genomic organization of the two isoforms of <italic>PPP1R15</italic>. Viruses have co-opted PPP1R15; presumably to neutralize the effects of host PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1997</xref>) and conservation amongst these viral proteins is also confined to the same stretch of 70 residues. The preeminence of the PPP1R15 C-terminus is also supported by functional experiments, as over-expression of this portion was the basis of their identification as ISR inhibitors in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the extended N-terminal region of PPP1R15 participates in membrane binding, regulating subcellular localization and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brush et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brush and Shenolikar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Binding to the PP1 catalytic subunit has been mapped to the C-terminal functional core of the PPP1R15 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>) and is shared by the pared-down viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 1998</xref>). An RV<sc>x</sc>F motif, common to many PP1 binding proteins, is present in the conserved functional core of the PPP1R15 family members and their viral counterparts, and plays an important role in assembly of the active holophosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>). However, beyond these important insights the basis for substrate-specific dephosphorylation remains largely mysterious.</p><p>Here, we report on the in vitro reconstitution of an active eIF2a-directed phosphatase from bacterially-expressed PP1 and PPP1R15 functional core. Our studies reveal the essential role of a third cellular factor, G-actin, in endowing the complex with substrate specificity and provide the first glimpse at the structure of a ternary holophosphatase complex possessing such substrate specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PP1-PPP1R15 binary complex</title><p>Alignment of regulatory subunits mediating eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation reveals that sequence conservation in the PPP1R15 family is limited to a stretch of ∼70 residues in their C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is also the only conserved region of these proteins predicted to be ordered by DISOPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ward et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04871.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A core functional domain in the C-terminus of PPP1R15 family members inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting the domain organization of mammalian and viral PPP1R15 proteins.

From there PPP1R15B winds its way through the C-terminal groove to the front of the catalytic subunit.

The interactions between PPP1R15B and PP1G were thus confined to residues conserved in all PP1 isoforms, explaining the lack of preference of PPP1R15 for binding different PP1 isoforms.</p><p>Despite their presence in the crystallized proteins, none of the residues C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup> could be assigned in the density maps, suggesting that the C-terminal portion of PPP1R15's functional core is disordered in the binary complex. Interestingly both spinophilin and PNUTS also appear to disengage from the surface of PP1 at a similar position (D<sup>475</sup> of spinophilin and N<sup>424</sup> of PNUTS), suggesting that the C-terminal extension of these regulatory subunits evolved to engage component(s) missing from the binary complex.</p><p>PP1G in these crystals conformed to previous structural determinations of PP1 isoforms (RMS: 0.19–0.29 Å over more than 240 Cα atoms), indicating that the binding of PPP1R15 did not change PP1's structure. Previous structures of PP1 revealed two metal ions, M1 and M2 (likely Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in the shallow groove implicated in catalysis. Two metal ions were also detected in the complex of PP1G 7–300 with PPP1R15B 631–669 (PDB: 4V0W), occupying the sites observed in other crystal forms of PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). However, in the crystal structure of the binary complex of PP1G with the shorter, PPP1R15B 631–660 (PDB: 4V0V), and the longer PPP1R15B 631–684 (PDB: 4V0X), only a single metal ion, occupying an identical M2 position, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). An unoccupied M1 site was previously observed in the crystal structure of PP1G-Inhibitor-2 complex (PDB: 2O8G) and the okadaic acid-bound PP1G (PDB: 1JK7), suggesting that the metal ion at M1 site is more labile than that at the M2 site and that the structures determined here provide different snapshots of metal ion occupancy of the catalytic subunit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Substrate-specificity of the PPP1R15-PP1 complex</title><p>The structure of the binary complex of PP1G and PPP1R15B 631–684 (PDB: 4V0X), with ∼2800 Å<sup>2</sup> of buried surface at the interface of its two protomers, is consistent with the high affinity of PPP1R15 for PP1, a property it shares with other regulatory subunits. However, given their similar trajectory on the surface of the catalytic subunit, these structures do not provide a ready answer for the basis of substrate specificity of the different holophosphatases.

Mouse pancreas (a tissue in which the ISR plays an important role) was homogenized to obtain a cytoplasmic lysate, which was added in escalating amounts to binary complex (1.5–7.5 nM) and substrate (∼2 µM). At the concentrations used (up to 100 ng/µl of protein) the lysate itself had minimal GST<sup>P</sup> or eIF2a<sup>P</sup>-directed phosphatase activity (compare lanes 1 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), however, when added to a binary complex of PPP1R15B and PP1 the lysate selectively increased the eIF2a<sup>P</sup>-directed phosphatase activity without affecting the dephosphorylation of GST<sup>P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Our estimate of 1.13 ± 0.15 µM eIF2a in the cytosol of HEK 293T cells agrees well with an estimate derived from the number of molecules of the yeast homolog, Sui2p, in a haploid yeast cells (1.71 × 10<sup>4</sup> molecules/cell, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>], which, assuming a yeast cell volume of 60 fl, of which half is cytosol, yields a concentration of 0.95 µM). This information enabled a detailed quantitative comparison of the initial velocity of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation over a range of physiologically relevant substrate concentrations by three different purified enzymes: apo-PP1G, a binary complex of PPP1R15B-PP1G and a ternary complex of actin-PPP1R15B-PP1G.

Whilst the resolution of the ternary complex is insufficient to trace the regulatory subunit's trajectory beyond that defined by the higher resolution binary complexes (i.e., C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup>), the most significant feature in the averaged difference density map is observed in the cleft between domains I and III in actin's barbed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>); suggesting that PPP1R15B extends to engage this site and providing a plausible explanation for the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D on eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation by the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

It was surprising therefore to learn that the PPP1R15-PP1 complex is as active in dephosphorylating a non-specific substrate as in dephosphorylating eIF2a<sup>P</sup>. However, a factor found in cell lysates, G-actin, can provide the necessary specificity.</p><p>The critical role of G-actin in constituting an eIF2a<sup>P</sup>-specific holophosphatase is consistent with its emergence as a conserved binding partner of PPP1R15 across phyla and with evidence that manipulations of the cellular cytoskeleton that diminish the pool of free G-actin promote higher levels of phosphorylated eIF2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>). The latter observations point to a role for cytoskeletal dynamics in regulating rates of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation and are consistent with the finding that most of the stimulatory activity of cell lysate is subject to inhibition by the actin-binding drug cytochalasin D. Nonetheless, our observations are not incompatible with the existence of other cellular proteins contributing to alternative PPP1R15-containing eIF2a<sup>P</sup>-directed holophosphatases.</p><p>Like other PP1 regulators (e.g., spinophilin, inhibitor 2), the functional core of PPP1R15 is natively unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2004</xref>) and attains its structure by wrapping around the catalytic subunit. In so doing it follows closely the path of other regulatory subunits, spinophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>) and PNUTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choy et al., 2014</xref>). However, these well-resolved interactions (involving residues R<sup>639</sup>-W<sup>662</sup>) account for slightly less than half the length of the PPP1R15B functional core. Residues C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup>, which are not conserved in other regulatory subunits, are also not resolved in crystal structures of the PPP1R15B-PP1G binary complex. Furthermore, binary complexes containing the entire functional core of PPP1R15B require the presence of actin for stability and solubility. Unfortunately, the resolution of the ternary complex is too low to place the portion of PPP1R15B C-terminal of W<sup>662</sup> in the density maps, but mutagenesis suggests that it plays an important role in actin-mediated substrate-specific dephosphorylation.</p><p>The gap between actin and PP1 is potentially suited to accommodate PPP1R15B residues C-terminal to W<sup>662</sup> whose density is not resolved in the crystal. Furthermore, the presence of density in the cleft between actin domains I and III, which is known to accommodate a short amphipathic helix of other G-actin binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>), is consistent with the engagement of the C-terminal five residues of the functional core of PPP1R15. Deletion of this predicted short amphipathic helical region of PPP1R15 markedly impairs activation by actin in vitro and de-stabilizes actin's association with PPP1R15 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>). Together, the in vivo and in vitro approaches suggest two complementary roles for actin: stabilizing the PPP1R15-PP1 complex and endowing it with substrate specificity. The two functions can be separated in vitro by mutations that retain sufficient PP1 binding to enable reliable measurement of the non-specific phosphatase activity of the binary PPP1R15-PP1 complex and all but eliminate actin's ability to promote substrate specificity.</p><p>In the ternary complex of PPP1R15-PP1-actin, the active site (of the catalytic subunit) is positioned at the bottom of a shallow platform constituted by actin and PP1. The N-terminal lobe, containing the phosphorylated residue of eIF2a, can be computationally docked into this composite surface, bringing phospho-S<sup>51</sup> in contact with the catalytic site. This model of the enzyme-bound substrate identifies surface residues in PP1 and actin that could engage the substrate in ionic interactions. In support of this model, we note that mutations in several of these residues enfeeble dephosphorylation of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> by the specific ternary complex, but less so by the binary complex. This feature is noted not only for the eIF2a R<sup>74</sup>E mutation, predicted to affect the binding to actin, but also in mutations affecting residues predicted to interact with charged surface residues of PP1 (eIF2a residues R<sup>66</sup>E and K<sup>86</sup>E), suggesting that such substrate-PP1 contacts are especially important in the setting of the actin-containing ternary complex. Together these observations support a simple model whereby the composite surface of actin and PP1, held together by PPP1R15, cooperatively engages its substrate to provide specificity through enhanced affinity of binding.</p><p>G-actin reproducibly enfeebled the phosphatase activity of the PP1-PPP1R15 complex towards an irrelevant structured substrate (phosphorylase A). The enfeebling effect of actin is modest by comparison to its stimulatory effect on dephosphorylation of the specific substrate, eIF2a<sup>P</sup>. This last observation is consistent with the shallowness of the composite surface, which would likely have a modest negative effect on accessibility of a structured substrate to the active site and even less so to inhibit an unstructured phosphorylated peptide (such as GST<sup>P</sup>). However, as bacterially-expressed PP1 has more promiscuous phosphatase activity than the enzyme purified from natural sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacKintosh et al., 1996</xref>), we may be underestimating the extent to which G-actin biases against the dephosphorylation of other PP1 substrates, such as phosphorylase A. These considerations may also account for the apparent difference in the extent of the bias against phosphorylase A noted in this study and an earlier one which used PP1 derived from rabbit muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connor et al., 2001</xref>). The functional importance of an inhibitory facet of regulatory subunit action is influenced by stoichiometric considerations. As the pool of free PP1 in cells is believed to be low, the dramatic increase in PPP1R15A levels in stressed cells may have consequences not only in terms of enhanced dephosphorylation of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> but also in terms of diminished dephosphorylation of other substrates.</p><p>Actin is an abundant protein. In vitro, the EC<sub>50</sub> of G-actin for activation of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation by PP1-PPP1R15 complexes is &lt;100 nM (for both isoforms of PPP1R15). It is therefore possible that under most circumstances G-actin is not limiting to holophosphatase formation. The nearly wildtype ISR-antagonizing activity of the weaker PPP1R15A F<sup>585</sup>A and I<sup>589</sup>A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) observed in the face of a nearly log-order higher EC<sub>50</sub> for actin activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), could be explained by high G-actin concentration in CHO cells. However, an informative precedent exists for regulation of cellular processes by variation in the abundance of G-actin: physiological changes in the ratio of monomeric G-actin to filamentous F-actin regulate the activity of serum response factor (SRF) through G-actin's ability to engage SRF's activation partner, MAL/MRTF-A, with affinities in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mouilleron et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given the abundance of cellular G-actin-binding proteins, many of which engage the cleft between domains I and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>) and are thus predicted to compete with PPP1R15, it is possible that in some circumstances G-actin availability may also be limiting to holophosphatase formation and that actin dynamics may thus be coupled to eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation. The eIF2a phosphorylation-dependent ISR strongly affects memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>) and actin dynamics are important in synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate on localized changes in G-actin levels modulating levels of phosphorylated eIF2 and protein synthesis through localized changes in holophosphatase activity in the dynamic synapse.</p><p>The ISR also plays an important role in protein folding homeostasis, especially in the endoplasmic reticulum, where PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation defends the stressed organelle by limiting the influx of newly synthesized proteins. The phenotype of combined deletion of PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B tells us that the capacity to reverse this process, by eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation, is essential to homeostasis and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 2009</xref>). However, under conditions of severe stress, the normal induction of the <italic>PPP1R15A</italic> gene overshoots its mark, such that genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>) or pharmacological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsaytler et al., 2011</xref>) attenuation of PPP1R15-mediated phosphatase activity is protective. Accordingly, small molecules that engage the composite actin-PP1 surface might serve as specific inhibitors of eIF2a<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation to reverse the aforementioned failure of homeostasis, without affecting the many other PP1-containing holophosphatases in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> lists the plasmids used, their lab names, description and notes their first appearance in the figures and their corresponding label, and provides a published reference, where available.</p><p>A combination of PCR-based manipulations, restriction digests, and site-directed mutagenesis procedures was used to mobilize the coding sequence and produces in-frame fusions with the affinity tags (GST, His X6 or FLAG epitope) or mCherry fluorescent tag, and to create the deletions and the point mutations indicated in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Actin was purified from rabbit muscle as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pardee and Spudich, 1982</xref>), dialyzed against G buffer (2 mM Tris pH 8, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>), blocked from further polymerization by incubation with a fivefold molar excess of Latrunculin B (#428020, Calbiochem), and used in biochemical and structural studies.</p><p>Chromatographically purified bovine pancreatic DNase I (&gt;2000 units/mg) was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (#LS002006, Lakewood NJ) and constituted into a complex with actin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mannherz et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Binary complexes of mouse PP1G and PPP1R15 with diverse endpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were created by co-transforming BL21 T7 Express <italic>lysY/I</italic><sup><italic>q</italic></sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> (#C3013, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with ampicillin<sup>r</sup> marked GST-tagged PPP1R15 expression plasmids and kanamycin<sup>r</sup> marked untagged PP1G expression plasmids.

Your article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Treisman, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers, with different degrees of enthusiasm, thought that the work in this manuscript was interesting and potentially important. One of the reviewers, Richard Treisman, had some minor comments, but stated: “This is a super paper. It is of interest as it presents a detailed molecular rationale for the biochemical function of actin in a non-cytoskeletal regulatory complex, adding to a number of recent structures in which G-actin plays a role as a regulator rather than regulate. Publish it!” The other two reviewers were less positive, and they have made a number of substantive criticisms that will need to be addressed directly before we can consider a revised manuscript. We have summarized their criticisms below:</p><p>Substantive comments:</p><p>Despite the extensive dataset and provocative finding that G-actin might regulate PP1/R15 substrate specificity, the potential impact of the work is undermined (1) by conceptual issues related to basic conclusion that PP1/R15 lacks substrate specificity, and (2) by technical limitations related to the phosphatase assays.</p><p>Building on a large body of biochemical studies, and substantiated by X-ray crystal structures of a growing number of PP1 complexes, the substrate specificity of PP1 is thought to occur through its interactions with its many 100s of PP1 binding proteins through both negative and positive selection. Like PP1-MYPT1, PP1-spinophilin and others, the interaction of the PP1 binding protein blocks dephosphorylation of substrates (typically phosphorylase is used), but allows either unaltered dephosphorylation of other substrates (e.g. PP1-spinophilin towards GluR1) or enhanced dephosphorylation of a specific target (e.g. PP1-MYPT toward myosin light chain). In the case of R15 early studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connor et al., 2001</xref>) showed that the activity of PP1 towards phosphorylase was blocked by GADD34, but activity towards eIF2α was maintained. Therefore the basic experimental set-up used does not address the selective blockade of non-preferred substrates; this is an important omission (our emphasis). The assessment of PP1 activity is also made more complicated by the known limitation that bacterial PP1 (generated in a Mn<sup>2+</sup> form) possesses promiscuous activity that is not found for native enzyme. Thus the assay used here measures an activity which is not designed to address the question of what is driving preference for eIF2α (our emphasis). Indeed, an interpretation of the key data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is that addition of the cell lysate blocks the non-specific activity towards phospho-GST, not that it confers any change in eIF2α activity, though much more quantitative kinetic analysis is required to know exactly what is going on. On this point, the other reviewer also wondered why addition of lysate alone did not dephosphorylate the non-specific substrate, when there are many different phosphatases in cell lysates.</p><p>Both of the less positive reviewers agreed that there is a general lack of quantification (Vmax and Km data are needed to assess activities) and lack of analysis of replicated data for many of the figures. In short, all the phosphatase assays will need repeating to produce at least 3 replicates. The reviewers recognized that this is not trivial and will take time to set up and complete. Depending on the outcome, the conclusions of the paper and the significance of the structural interactions could change.</p><p>1) The phosphatase assays rely exclusively on a gel-shift assay that does not allow for assessment of linear rate kinetics, a requirement for a study of this type.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is supposed to show that the bacterial complex of PPP1R15A/PPPIc lacks specificity. But, the last two reactions are not relevant. There is apparently a huge amount of enzyme relative to substrate, and both substrates are completely dephosphorylated. What are the enzyme concentrations used for each reaction? More intermediate concentrations should be shown. Also, 3 time points are shown (5, 15 and 30 minutes) but there seems to be little difference in dephosphorylation between 15 and 30 minutes for either substrate suggesting the enzyme may be dying; the substrate seems to be at a high concentration relative to enzyme (2 micro molar substrate). Time points earlier than 5 minutes should be shown.</p><p>3) A high concentration of actin is added to dephoshorylation assays (1 micro molar) and compared to assays with no actin (for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Is this really a specific effect? What happens if 1 micro molar concentration of a different purified protein is added?</p><p>4) It is unclear what the 'specificity factor“ calculated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> really represents. The concentration of enzyme is different, the substrates are different and it is not clear how a velocity was calculated when some of the reactions have gone to completion at the first time point. For R<sup>66</sup>E the two reactions look identical on the gels shown. Only the R<sup>74</sup>E mutation provides useful information regarding the potential role of the interaction of R15 with G-actin. In contrast to the conclusions made by the authors (see also the Discussion), the other mutations do not seem to have much effect. Indeed there is not much difference between the minus and plus G-actin data in panels B, C and D, which is in contrast to data in earlier figures.</p><p>5) Information about the relative amounts of dimeric complexes that were used for the various mutants (in the subsection headed “G-actin, PPP1R15 and PP1 form a ternary holophosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates eIF2α” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) should be given.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Editorial note dated 19 January 2015</title><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “G-actin provides substrate-specificity to eukaryotic initiation factor 2α holophosphatases” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and two of the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. One of the reviewers, self-identified as Richard Treisman, stated that the rebuttal was satisfactory.

The extent of inhibition may have been limited by the fact that bacterially-derived PP1 may have intrinsically relaxed substrate specificity, a point emphasized by the knowledgeable reviewers.

These measurements, conducted in triplicate, over a range of physiologically-relevant substrate concentrations (established by measuring the concentration of eIF2α in HEK 293 cells, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), address all the conceptual points of critique. They establish PP1+R15+G-actin as an eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-specific holophosphatase, with the expected attribute of discrimination against irrelevant substrates and showcase the inability of the R15 regulatory subunit alone (that is in the absence of actin) to accelerate eIF2α<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation over what is afforded by apo-PP1. As such, the revised version not only supports the conclusion offered in the title and abstract (that “G-actin provides substrate-specificity to eukaryotic initiation factor 2α holophosphatases”) but also aligns this newly described holophosphatase (the ternary complex of PP1 +R15+G-actin) with the prevailing concepts of substrate- specific dephosphorylation by PP1-containing holoenzymes, thus dealing with the concern, raised in review, that our “system deviates from what is accepted for PP1 and related phosphatases”.</p><p>In the new experiments reported on in this revised version, we combine an enzyme (apo-PP1, PP1+R15 or PP1+R15+G-actin) and a substrate (eIF2α<sup>P</sup> or PYGM<sup>P</sup>) at various concentrations and we measure the rate at which the substrate is converted to product over time by applying samples of the reaction mix at different time points to a PhosTag gel that separates the substrate and product. Time-resolved end point assays such as ours, that can measure the presence of both substrate and product in the reaction, are well suited to measure enzyme kinetics.</p><p>In such experiments it is simplest to measure the rate of conversion of substrate to product over the early time points, before substantial substrate depletion has taken place, as later measurements may underestimate enzyme velocity. However, this is less of a problem in reactions conducted well under the substrate <italic>Km</italic>, in which enzyme velocity is related linearly to substrate concentration, as it is a simple matter to correct for the effects of substrate depletion by using the integrated rate equation for first order kinetics to deduce the initial velocity (the instantaneous velocity at t=0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jencks, 1969</xref>). In reactions conducted at substrate concentrations approaching or exceeding the <italic>Km</italic>, in which enzyme velocity approaches its maximum, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>, the non-linear relation of velocity to substrate concentration invalidates such simple corrections. However, as eIF2α<sup>P</sup> is present at concentrations well below the substrate <italic>Km</italic> of its phosphatase (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>) and as we are conducting the measurements of enzyme velocity in this physiological range of substrate concentration (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), the impact of substrate depletion on the accuracy of the measurement of enzyme velocity is insignificant.</p><p>To ensure that we are measuring enzyme velocity over physiologically relevant substrate concentrations, we applied quantitative immunoblotting (with a standard curve of recombinant protein) to measure the concentration of eIF2a in the cytosol of mammalian cells and calculated the same for yeast cells (based on information available in a public data base; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). The concentration of eIF2α in eukaryotic cells (yeast or cultured HEK293 cells is about 1 µM) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). Guided by this data, and in specific response to the critiques of reviewers 2 and 3, we have performed a formal analysis of enzyme velocity over a physiologically-relevant range of substrate concentrations (from 0.5-4 µM), comparing the three enzymes (apo-PP1, PP1+R15, PP1+R15+G-actin). In this assay, conducted in triplicate, the initial velocity of eIF2α<sup>P</sup> dephosphorylation was increased 16.5 fold (95% confidence limits 21.2-3.2 fold) by the presence of actin in the ternary complex, whereas the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase A was decreased 3.1 fold (95% confidence limits 6.8-1.4 fold) by actin’s presence (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>To place these observations in perspective and thereby take into account the prevailing concepts on holophosphatase action we note (in the subsection headed “G-actin, PPP1R15 and PP1 form a ternary holophosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates eIF2α<sup>P</sup>” of the revised manuscript) that together, these observations fit well with prevailing concepts on the basis of substrate-specific dephosphorylation by PP1-holophosphatase complexes, in that their regulatory component(s), R15 and G-actin in this case, endow the enzyme with specificity towards its physiological substrate (eIF2α<sup>P</sup>) whilst inhibiting the dephosphorylation of an irrelevant substrate (phosphorylase A), citing a recent review from Wolfgang Peti in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus we believe the biochemical characterization of the actin-containing and actin-free enzyme provide conclusive experimental evidence that G-actin positively affects the ability of PP1+R15 to dephosphorylate eIF2α<sup>P</sup>, compared to other substrates. In so doing we have also addressed the other point deemed conceptual: We have found, as expected, that when actin joins the holophosphatase complex it inhibits the dephosphorylation of an irrelevant substrate (the selective blockade of non-preferred substrates alluded to in the previous editor’s letter).</p><p>In the critique of the previous version, the reviewer writes: “but much of the data still shows very high and non-linear dephosphorylation conditions”. We note that as a measure of prudence the quantitative data used to measure the initial velocity (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3D, 4E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>) were derived from early time points in which substrate depletion was less than 25%. We also wish to reiterate that reactions conducted well under the substrate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> proceed as a first order process and thus continue to yield valuable information on their kinetics even as the substrate is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jencks, 1969</xref>). This is showcased by the strong linear relationship between the log change of substrate concentration with reaction time, extending into the later time points with considerable substrate depletion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3B</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). These findings indicate that the assays performed here report on enzyme substrate pairs that obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics for reactions well below the substrate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and thus serve a valid basis for drawing conclusions regarding their relative velocity.</p><p>The reviewer is concerned by our finding that the PP1+R15+G-actin enzyme cannot be saturated with substrate, implying that others have been able to measure saturation of PP1 holophosphatase complexes with substrate (to quote: “But they fail to acknowledge that numerous studies of PP1 have obtained Michealis-Menton like kinetics”).</p><p>We believe that our experimental finding that the enzyme (PP1+R15+G-actin) is unsaturated by substrate µM at concentrations of up to 15 (estimated to be &gt;15 fold higher than those present in the cytosol) has no bearing on the validity of the measurements of enzyme velocity or on our conclusion that actin selectively accelerates the dephosphorylation of eIF2α<sup>P</sup> by PP1+R15. Furthermore, we note that in her paper on the subject, and referring to PP1 holophosphatases, Carol MacKintosh states that: “it is frequently impossible to use protein substrates at high enough concentrations to attain V<sub>max</sub> conditions, the assays therefore use a fixed subsaturating substrate concentration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacKintosh, 1993</xref>). Thus it would seem that eIF2α<sup>P</sup> is not exceptional among PP1 holophosphatase substrates in being present in cells at concentrations below its substrate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for the holophosphatase and that PP1+R15+G-actin obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics for reactions well below the substrate <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and thus does not raise alarms in regards to our methodology for measuring enzyme kinetics, nor diminish in any way the validity of our conclusions.</p><p><italic>Specific comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Related to the issues of the assay method, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>is the amount of the substrate calculated correctly?

Thus, valuable kinetic information is to be gleaned from all the time points in the assays and not only from their earliest points. Plots of time dependent changes in log[s] are now presented in conjunction with the linear regression coefficient and error estimates. These strongly support the conclusions regarding the selective stimulatory effect of actin on dephosphorylation of eIF2α<sup>P</sup>.</p><p>These considerations aside, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, measurements were conducted in triplicate and, as a measure of prudence, the reaction was not allowed to progress beyond 25% substrate depletion at any point. Thus, substrate depletion has not compromised the measurements of enzyme velocity nor the key conclusion regarding the relative velocity of the PP1+R15 and PP1+R15+G-actin complex.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>: also confusing.

This feature is more conspicuous in the jasplakinolide-treated sample, where actin filaments are stabilized. Of note, the stock of G-actin was maintained in a low ionic strength buffer, which inhibits polymerization, whereas the dephosphorylation assay is performed at physiological salt concentration that favor the concentration-dependent cooperative process of polymerization that can deplete the monomer.

The contrasting ability of the strong mutations, R15A<sup>R571A</sup> and R15A<sup>W575A</sup> (that have lost all measureable responsiveness to G-actin in vitro) to inhibit the ISR and the inability of the weak mutations to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) fits with differences in mutation strength acting in an in vivo assay that has significant threshold effects: with the weak mutations falling, with the wildtype, on one side of that threshold and the strong mutations falling on the other side. This point is now addressed in the Results section of the revised manuscript (in the subsection headed “G-actin, PPP1R15 and PP1 form a ternary holophosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates eIF2α<sup>P</sup>”) and its potential physiological significance in the Discussion.
