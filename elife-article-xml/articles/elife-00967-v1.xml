C2A, which binds RIM (a protein associated with calcium channels), anchored UNC-13 at active zones and shortened the latency of release.

When an electrical signal known as an action potential travels along a neuron and arrives at a synapse, the neuron releases a package of transmitter chemicals into the synapse. These chemicals then diffuse across the gap and bind to receptors on a second neuron, conveying the signal to the target neuron.</p><p>The strength of a synapse depends in part on the number of packages, or vesicles, of transmitter chemicals that are available for release. Most synapses contain multiple populations of vesicles: some that are released within a few milliseconds of the arrival of an action potential, and others that are released more slowly. The vesicles that are released rapidly are found close to sites at which calcium ions enter the neuron, whereas the others are located further from these sites.

Hu et al. showed that the release of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junction between neurons and muscles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also has slow and fast components. A long form of UNC-13, which is also found in mammals, promotes fast release of transmitter vesicles. Slow release is mediated by an independent pathway that involves both long and short UNC-13 proteins, as well as a protein called Tomosyn. As in mammals, long UNC-13 is localized to the sites at which calcium ions enter neurons, whereas short UNC-13 is more widely distributed throughout neurons.</p><p>The work of Hu et al. provides a molecular explanation for how the timing of transmitter release is determined.

To become competent to undergo calcium-evoked fusion, SVs must first physically attach to the plasma membrane (termed docking), and then must undergo a second process that has been termed priming. Docking and priming are both promoted by UNC-13/Munc13 proteins, whereas Tomosyn inhibits both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Verhage and Sorensen, 2008</xref>). Mammals express four Munc13 isoforms (Munc13-1, ubMunc13-2, bMunc13-2, and Munc13-3), while <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> expresses two. It is not known if each Munc13 protein has distinct functions. Do they mediate different forms of plasticity? Do they promote exocytosis of different subpopulations of SVs?</p><p>At most synapses, neurotransmitter release comprises multiple populations of SVs that fuse with distinct kinetics and distinct release probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). These kinetic components of release are thought to be mediated by SVs in different spatial domains of the nerve terminal. Rapid (or synchronous) release occurs within a few milliseconds and is proposed to consist of fusion of SVs that are close to calcium entry sites. Delayed release occurs over tens to hundreds of milliseconds and is thought to be mediated by fusion of SVs that are farther from calcium channels.</p><p>Although a great deal is known about how synchronous and delayed release are regulated by calcium and by activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>), relatively little is known about the molecules that define these kinetic components of release. It is generally believed that distinct calcium sensors are utilized for fast and slow release. Many studies suggest that the calcium sensor for fast release is Synaptotagmin I that binds calcium with low affinity and rapid kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pang and Sudhof, 2010</xref>). A recent study proposed that the calcium sensor for slow release is Doc2α that binds calcium with high affinity and slow kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yao et al., 2011</xref>). Beyond the use of distinct calcium sensors, it is unclear if fast and slow release are distinguished by other exocytic proteins. Several important questions remain unanswered. Do SVs equilibrate between the slow and fast pools? Is there a molecular code that determines whether SVs enter the fast or slow pool? Are fast and slow SVs regulated by distinct mechanisms?</p><p>We utilized the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cholinergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model to address these questions. Transmission at this synapse is mediated by graded release of neurotransmitter, whereby release varies with the strength of depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). When activity is low, transmission consists of endogenous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that are evoked by fusion of a single SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Following forced depolarization of the motor neuron (with a brief current pulse), large evoked EPSCs are produced consisting of the synchronous release of several hundred SVs. The ultrastructure of this synapse has been extensively characterized using the high-pressure freeze preservation technique. Each synapse contains a single dense projection that is surrounded by a pool of docked SVs, where docking occurs over a 1-μm domain of the presynaptic plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>). In immunostained electron micrographs, UNC-2 calcium channels are enriched at dense projections, indicating that they are the sites of calcium entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>). The active zone proteins UNC-10/RIM and UNC-13 promote docking of distinct population of SVs. In mutants lacking UNC-10/RIM, there was a reduction of docked SVs within 50 nm of the dense projection while SVs docked more distally were unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants, there was a uniform reduction of docked SVs across the entire 1-μm domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>). Corresponding patterns of docking defects were observed in mouse Munc13 and RIM knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Siksou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2011</xref>). UNC-10/RIM and UNC-13 immunostaining was also concentrated near dense projections in electron micrographs, consistent with their playing a relatively direct role in SV docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that different proteins promote docking and fusion of distinct SV subpopulations. The functional significance of this spatial SV docking pattern remains unclear. Do proximal and distally docked SVs represent functionally distinct populations of SVs? Do they mediate different forms of neurotransmitter release or different forms of synaptic plasticity? Although this synapse has been characterized electrophysiologically, the mechanisms regulating release kinetics have not been analyzed.</p><p>Here we show that ACh release at this synapse consists of fast and slow components, and that these components are mediated by distinct SV priming factors. Fast release is mediated by exocytosis of SVs that are docked and primed by a long UNC-13 isoform (UNC-13L). Slow release is mediated by two UNC-13 isoforms (UNC-13L and S) and is inhibited by a third priming protein, the syntaxin-binding protein Tomosyn. These results suggest that UNC-13L, UNC-13S, and Tomosyn form a protein code that dictates the timing of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UNC-13L and S have distinct subcellular localization patterns</title><p>The <italic>unc-13</italic> gene contains two promoters. The upstream promoter drives expression of long isoforms, while a downstream promoter (which lies in the intron between exons 13 and 14) drives expression of short isoforms (hereafter referred to as UNC-13L and UNC-13S, respectively). UNC-13L and UNC-13S share a common domain (R, encoded by exons 15–31) that contains the C1, C2B, C2C, and MUN domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohn et al., 2000</xref>). UNC-13L proteins have an N-terminal domain (NTD, exons 1–13) containing the C2A domain, which the UNC-13S NTD (exon 14) lacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rodents have analogous long (Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2) and short (bMunc13-2 and Munc13-3) Munc13 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brose et al., 2000</xref>). In long Munc13 proteins, the C2A domain mediates formation of Munc13 homodimers and Munc13/RIM heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-13L (mCherry-tagged) and UNC-10 RIM (GFP-tagged) proteins were colocalized at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), consistent with immuno-EM studies indicating that they are concentrated near dense projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, UNC-13S had a diffuse distribution in axons and was less colocalized with UNC-10 RIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Their different localization patterns suggested that UNC-13L and UNC-13S may mediate different forms of release and, consequently, could have distinct effects on synaptic transmission.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00967.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UNC-13L and UNC-13S have distinct localization patterns in axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The domain structure of UNC-13L (encoded by exons 1–31, excluding exon 14) and UNC-13S (exons 14–31) are illustrated. Ligands for each domain are indicated. The R region (1205 aa, comprising C1, C2B, MUN, and C2C domains) is shared between the two isoforms and is encoded by exons 15–31. Each isoform has a unique NTD. The L-NTD (610 aa) is encoded by exons 1–13 and contains a C2A domain (aa 1–96) and a predicted calmodulin binding site (green box, aa 556–610).

In UNC-13L-rescued animals, evoked EPSCs exhibited a shorter lag between the stimulus and release (i.e., 0–20% rise time) as well as faster activation and decay kinetics than in wild-type controls, which resulted in a faster rate of charge transfer during evoked responses. Similarly, evoked responses in animals rescued with mCherry-tagged UNC-13L also exhibited faster activation and charge transfer than in wild-type controls, indicating that fusion to mCherry did not disrupt UNC-13L function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

This possibility seems unlikely because the UNC-13 transgenes are not expressed in muscles. Nevertheless, we did two experiments to test this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). First, the kinetics of endogenous EPSCs were unaltered in UNC-13L and UNC-13S rescue, indicating that the intrinsic kinetics of muscle ACh responses were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Second, we analyzed the contribution of postsynaptic receptor composition to evoked EPSC kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). Body muscles express two classes of nicotinic ACh receptors, homomeric ACR-16 receptors and heteropentameric levamisole receptors (LevRs), which have distinct kinetic properties. ACR-16 receptors exhibit fast desensitization, whereas LevRs desensitize slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Francis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Touroutine et al., 2005</xref>). Evoked EPSC decay kinetics was slower in <italic>acr-16</italic> mutants and was unaltered in <italic>unc-29</italic> Lev mutants. Evoked EPSC activation kinetics were unaltered in both <italic>acr-16</italic> and <italic>unc-29</italic> Lev mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Thus, changes in postsynaptic receptor composition cannot account for the altered evoked EPSC kinetics observed in UNC-13L- and UNC-13S-rescued animals. Instead, these results suggest that the altered evoked EPSC kinetics observed in UNC-13 transgenic animals are caused by changes in the kinetics of ACh release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Coupling between exocytosis and calcium entry dictates release kinetics</title><p>The lag (or coupling) between calcium entry and exocytosis is determined by how rapidly calcium reaches primed SVs and binds to their calcium sensors. Tighter coupling is expected when SVs are physically closer to calcium channels or when they have higher intrinsic calcium sensitivity. Thus, differences in evoked EPSCs kinetics could be mediated by differential coupling of primed SVs to the sites of calcium entry. To test this idea, we analyzed the effects of the calcium chelator EGTA on evoked responses. Because EGTA binds calcium slowly, it inhibits SV fusions that occur later in time, that is the SVs that are more loosely coupled with calcium entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atluri and Regehr, 1996</xref>).</p><p>To determine if fast and slow ACh release at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ can be distinguished by their calcium coupling, we analyzed the effect of EGTA on evoked EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We recorded evoked release after adding a membrane-permeant form of EGTA to the extracellular recording solution (40 μM EGTA-AM). EGTA-AM is loaded into both motor neurons and body muscles. In our experiments, body muscle EPSCs are recorded using patch pipettes containing 5 mM EGTA. Consequently, any effect of EGTA-AM on synaptic transmission must be caused by changes in presynaptic calcium. In wild-type animals, EGTA treatment significantly reduced the quantal content (56% decrease, p&lt;0.001) of evoked EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Fast release comprises fusion of SVs that are tightly coupled to calcium entry, and is mediated by UNC-13L. Slow release consists of SV fusions that are loosely coupled to calcium entry is promoted by UNC-13S and L acting in concert, and is inhibited to TOM-1 Tomosyn. UNC-13L accelerates release by two mechanisms: increasing the spatial proximity of primed SVs to calcium channels and enhancing the calcium sensitivity of release by binding to calmodulin. These experiments define a molecular code that dictates the kinetics of neurotransmitter release during evoked responses. Below we discuss the significance of these findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tomosyn inhibits slow release</title><p>Prior studies showed that TOM-1 inhibits SV priming, and that it does so by binding to plasma membrane SNAREs, forming inactive SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McEwen et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that Tomosyn’s effect on synaptic transmission is mediated primarily by inhibiting UNC-13S-mediated release. The increased evoked ACh release in <italic>tom-1</italic> mutants was eliminated by EGTA treatment, indicating that the extra release was mediated by fusion of SVs that are loosely coupled to calcium entry. In transgenic animals, TOM-1 inhibited UNC-13S-mediated slow release far more potently than UNC-13L-mediated fast release. The apparent selectivity for inhibiting slow release could result from the distal localization of the TOM-1 protein, as immuno-EM studies indicate that TOM-1 staining peaks ∼300 nm from the dense projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gracheva et al., 2007</xref>).

By contrast, inactivating TOM-1/Tomosyn increased docking of distal SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>) and made ACh release slower and more loosely coupled to calcium entry. Finally, the proportion of docked SVs that are &lt;100 nm from the dense projection (15/38, or ∼40%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>) is similar to the fraction of evoked release that was EGTA resistant in our conditions.</p><p>Thus, electrophysiological recordings, ultrastructural analysis of SV docking, immuno-EM localization of priming proteins (UNC-10/RIM, UNC-13L, and TOM-1), and sensitivity to EGTA inhibition all support a model whereby fast ACh release is mediated by the subpopulation of SVs that are docked adjacent to dense projections (&lt;100 nm), while slow release is mediated by fusion of distal SVs (100–350 nm from dense projections).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>UNC-13L enhances release by three mechanisms</title><p>Are differences in the spatial location of primed vesicles sufficient to explain the kinetics of fast and slow release? Several results argue against this idea. The rise time of fast and slow release differ by ∼2 ms. If this difference was caused solely by a diffusional delay in calcium binding, slow SVs would have to be 3 μm farther from calcium channels than fast SVs (assuming D<sub>ca</sub> = 200 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). Thus, it seems likely that exocytosis of UNC-13S primed SVs is intrinsically slower than that of UNC-13L primed vesicles.</p><p>We show that UNC-13L accelerates release by two mechanisms. The C2A domain increased UNC-13 anchoring at active zones, and produced a slight decrease in the delay between stimulation and the onset of release. Both effects support the idea that the C2A domain caused primed SVs to become physically closer to calcium channels, thereby decreasing the time required for calcium to reach the vesicle’s calcium sensor. Other UNC-13L sequences (beyond C2A) also contribute to its physical location because the ΔC2A protein was strongly colocalized with UNC-10/RIM. The calmodulin-binding site in UNC-13L’s NTD also accelerated release. The analogous calmodulin-binding site in mouse Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 is required for augmentation, a form of short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Junge et al., 2004</xref>). Based on these results, it was proposed that calmodulin binding to Munc13 comprises a calcium sensor for short-term plasticity. Our results suggest that this calmodulin-binding site also accelerates release. Thus, the faster kinetics of UNC-13L-mediated release results from both tighter spatial coupling to calcium channels and faster intrinsic kinetics of exocytosis.</p><p>In addition to promoting fast release, UNC-13L also acts in conjunction with UNC-13S to promote slow release. Mutations inactivating UNC-13L dramatically reduced fast and slow release, and both forms of release were re-instated by restoring UNC-13L expression. Thus, UNC-13L promotes but is not required for slow release. The UNC-13L requirement for slow release was reduced (but not eliminated) when the total number of primed SVs was increased (by inactivating Tomosyn or by overexpressing UNC-13S). UNC-13L could regulate slow release by a variety of mechanisms. UNC-13S mRNA levels were not decreased in <italic>unc-13</italic> [L<sup>−</sup>S<sup>+</sup>] mutants, implying that UNC-13L did not alter expression of the UNC-13S promoter. UNC-13L could directly bind to UNC-13S thereby altering its activity or stability. UNC-13L could prevent inhibition of UNC-13S by Tomosyn. Finally, UNC-13L could increase the release probability of UNC-13S primed SVs. Further experiments will be required to determine how UNC-13L regulates slow release.</p><p>Our results do not exclude the idea that other potential mechanisms also contribute to differences in UNC-13L and UNC-13S release kinetics. For example, UNC-13 and TOM-1 could regulate the kinetics or duration of calcium entry or could alter the spatial distribution of open calcium channels. Further experiments will be required to test these ideas.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for understanding synaptic plasticity and circuit function</title><p>Our results suggest that fast and slow release are mediated by exocytosis of distinct subpopulations of SVs, and that distinct priming molecules mediate fast and slow SV fusions. In this manner, fast and slow release could be independently adjusted by modulatory pathways. It is intriguing that the fast and slow release components appear to function in parallel. We were able to construct mutants in which evoked release is mediated purely by either the fast or slow mechanism. Thus, both forms of release can occur in isolation. These results imply that fast SVs are not derived from maturation of slow SVs, and vice versa. Our results are more compatible with the idea that fast and slow release comprise independent exocytosis mechanisms that operate in parallel. Fast and slow release share a requirement for UNC-13L, which provides a potential mechanism for coordinately regulating changes in these two release pathways.</p><p>Adjusting the contributions of fast and slow release will alter the duration of postsynaptic responses. This could have several important consequences for circuit function. Prolonged EPSCs will result in increased integration of synaptic inputs, which could alter the rate of postsynaptic spiking. Shifting the kinetics of postsynaptic responses could also alter spike timing-dependent plasticity. In sensory circuits, prolonged postsynaptic responses could alter the temporal integration of sensory inputs, and may alter the kinetics of sensory evoked responses. All these changes could have profound effects on circuit development, cognition, and behavior. Consistent with this idea, we recently showed that mutations linked to Autism alter the kinetics of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, there is significant interest in identifying molecular mechanisms that adjust the kinetics of neurotransmitter release.</p><p>In summary, we propose that the kinetics of neurotransmitter release are dictated by a protein code consisting of fast (UNC-10/RIM, UNC-13L) and slow (UNC-13L, UNC-13S, and Tomosyn) priming factors, which mediate fusion of proximal and distal SVs, respectively. All these molecules are conserved across phylogeny, and orthologous proteins are found at both NMJs and central synapses. Thus, we propose that the basic mechanisms governing the kinetics of neurotransmitter release are ancient, and will apply to many synapses. Consistent with this idea, a recent study showed that Munc13 proteins that lack C2A domains (bMunc13-2 and Munc13-3) are located more distally and mediate slow release at the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Strain maintenance and genetic manipulation were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Integrated transgenes were obtained by UV irradiation of strains carrying extrachromosomal arrays. All integrated transgenes were out-crossed at least six times. UNC-13L and UNC-13S expression constructs contained full-length cDNAs, with the exceptions noted below. For UNC-13L, we utilized a full-length ZK524.2e cDNA (spanning exons 1–31, excluding exon 14), whose expression as an SL1 spliced mRNA we confirmed by qPCR. The ZK524.2e cDNA corresponds to the LR mRNA previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohn et al., 2000</xref>). For UNC-13S, we confirmed expression of an SL1 spliced mRNA containing exons 14–31, which corresponds to the MR mRNA previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohn et al., 2000</xref>). We could not detect expression of ZK524.2c, a WormBase predicted short UNC-13 mRNA, by qPCR; therefore, we utilized the full-length MR cDNA for UNC-13S imaging and an MR minigene (<italic>nuIs46</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nurrish et al., 1999</xref>) for electrophysiological recordings and behavior. Other UNC-13 constructs are as follows (all residue coordinates refer to the ZK524.2e protein sequence): ΔC2A (KP#1907), ZK524.2e cDNA lacking the C2A domain (residues 1–96); UNC-13R (KP#1908), cDNA containing exons 15–31 (residues 611–1816); C2AR (KP#1909), cDNA containing the C2A domain (residues 1–96) fused to the R domain; CaMR (KP#1910), and F574R (KP#1911), cDNAs containing the predicted CaM binding site (residues 556–610) or a mutated binding site fused to the R domain. For electrophysiological recordings, transgenes were expressed by the downstream <italic>unc-13</italic> promoter (UNC-13S rescue) or the <italic>snb-1</italic> promoter (all others). For imaging experiments, UNC-13 (c-terminal mCherry-tagged) and UNC-10 (<italic>nuIs165</italic>, c-terminal GFP tagged) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ch’ng et al., 2008</xref>) transgenes were expressed in DA and DB neurons, using the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Locomotion and behavior assays</title><p>Worm tracking and analysis were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, worms were reared at 20°C and moved to room temperature 30 min before imaging. Young adult animals were picked to agar plates with no bacterial lawn (30 worms per plate). Locomotion was analyzed 10 min after the worms were removed from food. 30 s videos of individual animals were captured at 5× magnification and 4 Hz frame rate on a Zeiss Discovery Stereomicroscope using Axiovision software. The center of mass was recorded for each animal on each video frame using the object tracking software in the Axiovision software. The trajectories were then analyzed using custom software written in Igor Pro 5.0 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>All quantitative imaging was done on a Zeiss Axioskop, using an Olympus PlanAPO 100 × 1.4 NA objective and a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper, Trenton, NJ). Worms were immobilized with 30 mg/ml BDM (Sigma). Image stacks were captured and maximum intensity projections were obtained using Metamorph 7.1 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). GFP fluorescence was normalized to the absolute mean fluorescence of 0.5-mm FluoSphere beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For dorsal cord imaging, young adult worms, in which the dorsal cords were oriented toward the objective, were imaged in the region midway between the posterior gonad bend at the tail. Line scans of dorsal cord fluorescence were analyzed in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics) using custom-written software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dittman and Kaplan, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiology was done on dissected adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>). Worms were superfused in an extracellular solution containing 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM glucose, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% O<sub>2</sub> at 20°C. Whole-cell recordings were carried out at −60 mV using an internal solution containing 105 mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM CsCl, 15 mM CsF, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 using CsOH. Under these conditions, we only observed endogenous acetylcholine EPSCs. For endogenous GABA IPSC recordings, the holding potential was 0 mV, at which we only observe GABAergic postsynaptic currents. All recording conditions were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). Stimulus-evoked EPSCs were stimulated by placing a borosilicate pipette (5–10 μm) near the ventral nerve cord (one muscle distance from the recording pipette) and applying a 0.4 ms, 30 μA square pulse using a stimulus current generator (WPI). On average, this stimulus evoked ∼85% of the charge evoked by hypertonic sucrose, suggesting that a large fraction of the primed pool was released. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Genetics Stock Center for strains and reagents.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Graeme Davis (Reviewing editor) and Erik Jorgensen (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Hu et al. provide exciting new data on a few longstanding questions in synaptic research regarding heterogeneity of release-probability of synaptic vesicles. They use the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction, which displays two clearly distinct kinetic components of release and exploit the relative ease of genetic manipulations in this system to provide important new information regarding two sources of heterogeneity: localization of vesicles relative to Ca-sources and intrinsic “willingness” of vesicles to fuse. They relate these aspects to the only two isoforms of the UNC-13 protein, which are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting roles of the C2A domain of UNC-13L in proper localization of vesicles relative to the dense projection and the calmodulin-binding domain of the same isoform in accelerating release. Furthermore, they describe an inhibitory/competitive role of Tomosyn, acting on UNC-13S mediated release. The data are of highest relevance for the understanding of synaptic function.</p><p>All of the reviewers consider this work high profile and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. No additional experiments are necessary prior to publication. However, several issues should be addressed in the text prior to resubmission and publication. In general the manuscript could be improved by re-organization. This would take considerable work and is not necessary for publication, but it is a suggestion that the authors might wish to consider. Two textual revisions are considered essential for publication, highlighted as #1 and #2 under “Essential revisions”.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers strongly suggest a more cautious interpretation of the CaM-domain data. In essence, does the CaM-domain increase or decrease sensitivity? A high Ca<sup>++</sup> sensitivity of the diffusely distributed CamMR would result in prolonged, EGTA-sensitive release. A decreased Ca<sup>++</sup> sensitivity, on the other hand, would produce short-lived EGTA-insensitive release, since release would be restricted to the peak-Ca, both temporally and spatially, since release probability is low and a high-power function of local [Ca<sup>++</sup>]. It should also be noted that the UNC-13L rescue has very low quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as does the CAMR under EGTA. The final word regarding the mechanistic interpretation will require quantitative modeling. This, however, clearly goes beyond the scope of a single paper, since it requires knowledge about pool sizes and release probabilities, which may be difficult to quantitate. The conclusion that the CaM-binding domain makes fusion EGTA resistant would seem to be a safe conclusion.</p><p>2) The absence of detailed cartoons diagramming the constructs makes a careful reading of the manuscript difficult and, at times, confusing. It was not clear what the constructs looked like and how much of the surrounding region was included or whether there was a flexible linker. Given that supplements are now commonplace, it seems that DNA constructs can be described precisely, so that future researchers will be able to either repeat or interpret the experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00967.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers strongly suggest a more cautious interpretation of the CaM-domain data.

As suggested, we deleted that speculation from our Discussion, which now reads: “Our results suggest that this calmodulin binding site also accelerates release. Thus, the faster kinetics of UNC-13L mediated release results from both tighter spatial coupling to calcium channels, and faster intrinsic kinetics of exocytosis.”</p><p><italic>2) The absence of detailed cartoons diagramming the constructs makes a careful reading of the manuscript difficult and, at times, confusing.
