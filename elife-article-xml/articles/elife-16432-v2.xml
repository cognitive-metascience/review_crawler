sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, accounting for ~80% of skin cancer-related deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller and Mihm, 2006</xref>). Some of the most commonly observed oncogenic events in melanoma are activating mutations of the oncogenic neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS; typically NRASQ61K/R), which occur in 20% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller and Mihm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsao et al., 2012</xref>). Oncogenic NRAS causes constitutive activation of NRAS, resulting in activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. These signaling pathways promote proliferation and reduce apoptosis to facilitate cellular transformation, tumor growth, and metastatic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wellbrock et al., 2004</xref>). Key pathways regulated by NRAS include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) pathways, all of which are shown to play important roles in NRAS-driven oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Both the PI3K and MAPK pathways have been targeted using very effective small molecule inhibitors as a clinical approach to treat RAS-mutant cancers, including NRAS-mutant melanoma. However, other pro-survival pathways can be activated by feedback and crosstalk from the pathway being targeted. For example, inhibition of the PI3K pathway alone can result in compensatory upregulation of the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carracedo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serra et al., 2011</xref>). For this and several other known and unknown reasons, these approaches have not proven clinically beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, new therapeutic approaches for treating NRAS-mutant melanoma and other RAS-mutant cancers are needed.</p><p>To discover and develop more effective approaches to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma, we aimed to understand the mechanism of oncogenic NRAS-induced transformation and tumor maintenance. We identified interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) as a new regulator of oncogenic NRAS-induced melanocyte transformation and melanoma tumor growth, which functions by regulating E2F2 expression and consequently DNA replication. Surprisingly, we also found that NRAS-mutant melanoma cells were significantly more resistant to the drugs that induce DNA replication stress than were BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanomas. In addition, treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, which reduces IFI6 expression, when combined with drugs that induce DNA replication stress, potently inhibited NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth in cell culture and in mice. Taken together, our results identify a new role for IFI6 in E2F2-mediated regulation of DNA replication and melanoma development and growth. These studies also uncover a pharmacologically tractable DNA replication stress resistance pathway that can be targeted to inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oncogenic NRAS transcriptionally upregulates <italic>IFI6</italic> via MAPK pathway</title><p>Oncogenic mutations in neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS), typically in codon 61, are observed in &lt;∼20% of melanoma (2015). However, NRAS-mutant melanoma currently lacks effective targeted therapies, and targeting the pro-survival pathways downstream of oncogenic NRAS (e.g., PI3K or MEK inhibitors) have not been successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britten, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao and Adjei, 2014</xref>). Thus, a better understanding of NRAS-mutant melanoma is required for developing effective targeted therapies. Toward this end, we sought to identify factors that are necessary for oncogenic NRAS-induced melanocyte transformation and melanoma growth.</p><p>First, we performed transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses. To do so, we transformed immortalized melanocytes (MEL-ST cells) using oncogenic NRAS, NRASQ61K (hereafter referred to as MEL-ST/NRASQ61K), and then we analyzed the gene expression changes using an Illumina gene expression array. Our gene expression data analyses identified 301 genes that were significantly upregulated (p&lt;0.05, fold-change &gt;2.0) in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells compared to MEL-ST cells with an empty vector control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the top five genes were <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic>, which were previously implicated in RAS-mediated transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cataisson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sparmann and Bar-Sagi, 2004</xref>). However, we also identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)—<italic>IFI6, IFI27,</italic> and <italic>MX1</italic>—that have not been previously implicated in oncogenic NRAS-induced transformation and melanoma tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, an analysis of previously published melanoma datasets revealed that <italic>IFI6</italic> is overexpressed in melanoma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haqq et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talantov et al., 2005</xref>).

Toward this end, we employed RAS mutants that specifically activate either the MAPK (HRAS v12 S35) or PI3K pathway (HRAS v12 C40). Using these mutants, we found that the MAPK pathway stimulated <italic>IFI6</italic> expression effectively in MEL-ST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). To confirm this finding, we used the constitutively active MEK construct MEK-DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehm et al., 2007</xref>) and found that the introduction of MEK-DD in MEL-ST cells was sufficient to stimulate <italic>IFI6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the expression of <italic>IFI6</italic> and key MAPK transcriptional targets in 20 patient-derived melanoma samples. We observed that <italic>IFI6</italic> expression strongly correlated with the expression of other known MAPK transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Additionally, IFI6 overexpression significantly correlated with the NRAS mutation status in patient-derived melanoma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haqq et al., 2005</xref>). These results demonstrate that NRASQ61K activates <italic>IFI6</italic> expression through the MAPK pathway.</p><p>In melanoma, the MAPK pathway can also be activated as a result of mutations in BRAF genes (e.g., BRAFV600E) or loss of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) activity due to inactivating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coverley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krauthammer et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether BRAFV600E or <italic>NF1</italic> knockdown could result in the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>IFI6</italic>, similar to NRASQ61K. To this end, we either introduced BRAFV600E or knocked down <italic>NF1</italic> expression in MEL-ST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As controls, we used empty vector or non-specific (NS) small hairpin RNA (shRNA), respectively. These cells were then analyzed for <italic>IFI6</italic> expression by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis. Our results showed that BRAFV600E, similar to NRASQ61K, was able to activate IFI6 expression. However, <italic>NF1</italic> knockdown did not result in <italic>IFI6</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>NF1</italic> loss is not functionally equivalent to BRAFV600E or NRASQ61K regarding its ability to activate <italic>IFI6</italic> expression.</p><p>Next, we asked which transcription factors downstream of the MAPK pathway were necessary to activate expression of <italic>IFI6</italic>. Toward this end, we analyzed the promoter of <italic>IFI6</italic> using rVISTA2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loots and Ovcharenko, 2004</xref>) and identified DNA binding sites for transcription factors NF-κB and STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To test if NF-κB or STAT1 directly regulate <italic>IFI6</italic> transcription, we first performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells showed enrichment of NF-κB on the <italic>IFI6</italic> promoter relative to MEL-ST cells expressing an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). However, we did not observe enrichment for STAT1 on the <italic>IFI6</italic> promoter in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells relative to MEL-ST cells expressing an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To further test whether NF-κB and STAT1 influence <italic>IFI6</italic> mRNA expression, we measured the expression of <italic>IFI6</italic> in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells after knocking down the expression of either <italic>NF-</italic>κ<italic>B (p65/ RelA)</italic> or <italic>STAT1</italic>. We found that <italic>NF-κB</italic> knockdown markedly decreased <italic>IFI6</italic> expression in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1L–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), whereas <italic>STAT1</italic> knockdown had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also determined the mechanism of NF-κB activation downstream of NRASQ61K. To this end, we knocked down the expression of <italic>IKKβ</italic>, a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates IκB; IκB inhibits NF-κB by preventing its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1999b</xref>). IKKβ was previously shown to be necessary for NF-κB activity and HRASv12-driven melanoma growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>IKKβ</italic> resulted in reduced phosphorylation of IκB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) and reduced NF-κB reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Analysis of IFI6 also revealed that <italic>IKKβ</italic> knockdown attenuated NRAS-induced <italic>IFI6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). ChIP analysis showed decreased enrichment of NF-κB on the <italic>IFI6</italic> promoter upon <italic>IKKβ</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NRASQ61K, in a MAPK pathway-dependent manner via NF-κB, stimulates the transcription of <italic>IFI6</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IFI6 is required for NRASQ61K-induced transformation and NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth</title><p>Next, we asked if IFI6 is necessary for NRASQ61K-induced transformation.

Furthermore, consistent with the increased level of <italic>E2F2</italic> mRNA, we observed increased E2F2 protein level and increased E2F2 enrichment on the promoter of its target gene <italic>MCM10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> results in dysregulated DNA replication via E2F2 upregulation, which in turn blocks NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth and melanomagenesis. To test this likelihood, we analyzed the DNA content of YUGASP cells expressing either <italic>IFI6</italic> or NS shRNA by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

In complete agreement with our previous results, expression of NRASQ61K resulted in increased <italic>IFI6</italic> expression and decreased expression of E2F2 and its target genes in MEL-ST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We also observed dysregulated DNA replication in NRASQ61K-transformed MEL-ST cells expressing <italic>IFI6</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, senescence induction was not observed in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells expressing <italic>IFI6</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that the MEL-ST cells express the SV40 early region (SV40-ER) and thus inactivate both p53 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathways. However, previous studies have shown that uncontrolled DNA replication-induced DNA damage can result in apoptosis induction even in the absence of p53 and RB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aladjem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knudsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strasser et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> results in apoptosis induction when p53 and RB are inhibited. To this end, we tested anchorage-independent cell growth in plates coated with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) and using the recently developed growth in low attachment (GILA) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rotem et al., 2015</xref>). We found that loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells increased apoptosis under anchorage-independent growth conditions compared to NS shRNA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). We confirmed these results by annexin V staining and immunoblot analysis of cleaved caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that upon p53 and RB pathway inactivation, <italic>IFI6</italic> loss results in the upregulation of <italic>E2F2</italic> and its target genes involved in DNA replication. This, in turn, causes DNA replication stress and consequent DNA damage, thereby inducing apoptosis. However, when the p53 and/or RB pathway is intact, <italic>IFI6</italic> loss results in the induction of cellular senescence. This consequentially inhibits mutant NRAS-induced melanocyte transformation and melanoma growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16432.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title><italic>IFI6</italic> loss results in DNA replication stress and apoptosis induction in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MEL-ST cells expressing empty vector or NRASQ61K were analyzed by RT-qPCR.

Toward this end, we tested the response of NRAS-mutant melanoma cells to drugs that induce cytotoxicity by inducing DNA replication stress. We treated NRAS-mutant (YUGASP, SKMEL-2, SKMEL-103, and M318), BRAF-mutant (SKMEL-28 and A375), NF1-mutant/null (MeWo and YUTOGS), and NRAS/BRAF/NF1 wild-type (YUVON) melanoma cells with three DNA replication stress-inducing agents: aphidicolin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Connell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>). We found that NRAS-mutant melanoma cells were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs compared to other genotypes (BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Furthermore, we noted that the knockdown of <italic>IFI6</italic> sensitized NRAS-mutant cells to DNA replication stress-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), and this effect was rescued by simultaneous knockdown of both <italic>E2F2</italic> and <italic>IFI6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Because we had observed that the MAPK pathway regulates IFI6, we tested whether pharmacological MEK inhibitors could be combined with DNA replication stress-inducing drugs to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma. Remarkably, we found that simultaneous treatment of NRAS-mutant cells with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and either hydroxyurea or aphidicolin resulted in significantly stronger melanoma growth inhibition in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) than either drug alone. These results were surprising because <italic>IFI6</italic> was also upregulated by the BRAFV600E mutation. Therefore, we asked if <italic>E2F2</italic> and its target genes involved in the regulation of DNA replication were upregulated in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanoma cells deficient in <italic>IFI6</italic>. To do so, we knocked down the expression of <italic>IFI6</italic> and measured the expression of <italic>E2F2</italic> and its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not observe similar changes in mRNA levels of <italic>E2F2</italic> or its target genes after <italic>IFI6</italic> knockdown in BRAF-mutant or NF1-deficient melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that only in the context of NRASQ61K, <italic>IFI6</italic> loss results in <italic>E2F2</italic> upregulation, which induces the expression of E2F2 target genes that regulate DNA replication. Thus, the ability of IFI6 to regulate DNA replication stress originates in its ability to repress <italic>E2F2</italic> and its target genes specifically in the context of NRAS-mutant melanoma. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NRASQ61K upregulates <italic>IFI6</italic>, consequently repressing <italic>E2F2</italic>, thereby conferring resistance to drugs that induce cytotoxicity by causing DNA replication stress. This genetically vulnerable pathway can be targeted pharmacologically by combining a MEK inhibitor with cytotoxic agents that induce DNA replication stress to potently inhibit NRAS-mutant melanoma growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16432.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Targeting the DNA replication stress resistance pathway to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Indicated melanoma cell lines were treated with indicated drugs and analyzed by MTT assay after 48 hr of drug treatment.

Our findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and described below. First, our results demonstrate that IFI6 expression is activated by oncogenic NRAS, which is necessary for oncogenic NRAS-induced transformation and melanoma tumor growth. Second, we report a previously undocumented role for IFI6 in E2F2-mediated regulation of DNA replication. We show that oncogenic NRAS stimulates IFI6 expression to facilitate melanocyte transformation and tumor growth. The loss of IFI6 results in E2F2-mediated dysregulation of DNA replication, resulting in cellular senescence or apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition. Finally, we show that NRAS-mutant melanomas are significantly more resistant to cytotoxic agents that function by inducing DNA replication stress than wild-type NRAS melanoma cells. These observations are highly significant because they uncover a previously undocumented genetic vulnerability that is pharmacologically amenable and can be targeted to treat NRAS-mutant melanoma. These results also have important clinical implications because there are currently no effective therapies for NRAS-mutant melanoma.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16432.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the role of IFI6 in melanoma tumor growth.</title><p>The model shows the mechanism by which IFI6 contributes to NRASQ61K-induced transformation and the maintenance of oncogenic NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16432.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16432.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16432-fig10-v2"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>IFI6 is necessary for oncogenic NRAS-induced transformation and melanoma growth</title><p>ISGs are shown to play several important biological roles. Among these, their roles in resisting and controlling pathogens are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). For example, many RNA viruses that induce the interferon response activate the expression of ISGs. This activation allows host cells to control the viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). This phenomenon is observed in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive IFN-α-based drug regimens. In patients who respond to this treatment, expression of ISGs is low in the liver before treatment and increases significantly after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, increased expression of 36 unique ISGs correlated with a reduction in HCV viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brodsky et al., 2007</xref>). It is important to note that some viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), have been shown to use specific ISGs, such as RSAD2, to enhance infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seo et al., 2011</xref>). We found that three ISGs—IFI6, IFI27, and MX1—were transcriptionally upregulated by oncogenic NRAS and other oncogenic RAS proteins in a MAPK pathway-dependent manner. These results show that the introduction of oncogenic RAS into human cells induces responses similar to those seen during viral infections, and oncogenic NRAS uses ISGs, such as IFI6, to facilitate cellular transformation and tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Loss of IFI6 results in E2F2-mediated DNA replication stress</title><p>In addition to identifying the role for IFI6 in the regulation of melanoma development and tumor growth, we also discovered a previously undocumented role for IFI6 in the regulation of DNA replication. We found that the inhibition of <italic>IFI6</italic> by shRNA-mediated knockdown results in upregulation of transcription factor E2F2, which specifically activates its target genes involved in the activation of DNA replication. This upregulation of DNA replication-promoting genes results in dysregulated DNA replication in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Some studies have shown that oncogenes induce DNA replication stress, resulting in cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>), but the precise mechanism of this process was not clearly illustrated. Here, we provide evidence that loss of IFI6 results in the upregulation of <italic>E2F2</italic>, which dysregulates DNA replication. This biological process is also necessary for NRAS-induced cellular transformation and for maintaining the NRAS-mutant melanoma tumor growth. The E2F transcription factors are downstream effectors of the retinoblastoma pathway, and their transcriptional activity is required to regulate various genes, including those required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>). Context-specific roles for different E2F family members have been shown, which further highlights their non-redundant biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwooll et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the loss of IFI6 results in specific upregulation of E2F2 but not other E2F family genes. This observation suggests a tumor suppressor-like role for E2F2 in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Notably, although E2F family proteins are typically known to activate genes that facilitate cell cycle progression and proliferation, a number of growth inhibitory genes, such as CDKN2C (p18), CDKN2D (p19), CDKN1C (p57), E2F7, RB1 (pRB), and RBL1 are upregulated by E2F proteins during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Stefano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ortega et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sherr and Roberts, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stott et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, one might speculate that the induction of these growth inhibitory genes might be necessary for regulated progression of the cell cycle. For example, activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as CDKN2C, CDKN2D, and CDKN1C, would hypothetically reduce CDK activity and DNA replication fork firing during late S phase. Interestingly, none of these growth inhibitory targets of E2F were upregulated after <italic>IFI6</italic> knockdown, which may in part explain why IFI6-mediated upregulation of E2F2 results in dysregulated DNA replication and tumor growth inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cellular senescence or apoptosis as an outcome of loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> expression</title><p>Our study also shows that loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> results in two different outcomes, depending on the status of the p53 and RB pathways. In melanoma cells and primary human melanocytes, <italic>IFI6</italic> loss results in the induction of cellular senescence as a result of E2F2-mediated dysregulated DNA replication and consequent DNA damage. However, oncogenic NRAS-transformed MEL-ST cells express SV40 early region, thus inactivating both p53 and RB pathways. In this scenario, we found that the loss of <italic>IFI6</italic> results in apoptosis induction. Our results are consistent with multiple previous studies that have demonstrated DNA damage in p53 and RB pathway-defective cells, resulting in p53- and RB-independent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aladjem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knudsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strasser et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DNA replication stress resistance as a genetic vulnerability of NRAS-mutant melanoma</title><p>Our studies have identified a novel and clinically significant feature of NRAS-mutant melanoma. We found that cytotoxic agents that typically inhibit growth by inducing DNA replication stress are largely ineffective at inhibiting NRAS-mutant melanomas. In contrast, BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, and triple wild-type melanomas were relatively sensitive to these agents. We also confirm resistance to these agents is due in part to the oncogenic NRAS-mediated upregulation of IFI6 and consequential repression of E2F2 and its target genes. Knockdown of <italic>IFI6</italic> increased the sensitivity of NRAS-mutant melanoma to DNA replication stress-inducing agents, and simultaneous loss of E2F2 and IFI6 rescues this effect. Notably, knockdown of <italic>IFI6</italic> in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanoma did not alter the expression of <italic>E2F2</italic> or its target genes. This in part explains the differences in the sensitivity of melanoma genotypes to agents that induce cytotoxicity through DNA replication stress. Because IFI6 is upregulated in NRAS-mutant melanoma, and its expression correlates with NRAS mutation status, this subgroup of melanoma could be targeted using this therapeutic approach. Therefore, the DNA replication stress pathway represents a unique vulnerability of NRAS-mutant melanoma that can be pharmacologically inhibited to achieve tumor inhibition in cell culture and in vivo. Several of the agents we used here, such as aphidicolin, camptothecin, and hydroxyurea, are used in clinical cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geyer and Mesa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sargent et al., 1996</xref>). Based on our results, we speculate that these drugs will have limited utility in patients harboring NRAS and potentially other RAS mutations. Thus, our results may have clinical application for the identification of patient populations that might benefit from these drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and plasmids</title><p>SKMEL-2, SKMEL-28, MeWo, and A375 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown as recommended.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Zhi Sheng (Reviewer #2) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The required experiments represent a substantial investment and it will be good to hear back from you with a plan and an estimate of the time it may take to complete the required additions and changes.</p><p>The current manuscript by Gupta et al. describes the putative involvement of the interferon-stimulated gene IFI6 in the development of NRAS mutated melanoma. The authors describe a molecular pathway whereby mutations in the NRAS oncogene lead to upregulation of IFI6 expression via the activation of MEK kinases and the NF-κB transcription factor. Since IFI6 depletion leads to deregulated DNA replication and senescence, the authors propose a model whereby IFI6 upregulation downstream of NRAS is required for cell proliferation and tumor growth.</p><p>The reviewers and Senior Editor discussed the manuscript at length and after much deliberation reached a consensus, deciding to invite a resubmission of a thoroughly revised manuscript addressing the points below. A key point discussed by the reviewers is the fact that the mechanism illuminated is based on cell-based work and xenograft studies, and that a key test of the conclusions would involve the use of genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models. However, the reviewers agreed that requiring the use of GEM models would be outside of the scope of the current manuscript, and that a thorough response to the concerns raised below could be satisfactory.</p><p>The major concerns are:</p><p>1) Specificity for NRAS-driven tumors. The manuscript describes a mechanism that is supposedly specific for NRAS-driven melanomas, but reviewers pointed out that the involvement of the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway indicates that melanomas driven by mutations in BRAF or silencing of NF1 should also display elevated IFI6 mRNA expression. This point should be carefully investigated and clarified. Is IFI6 upregulation unique to NRAS-driven tumors or not? Furthermore, by what mechanism(s) does NRAS-activated RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK activate NF-κB? Is it a direct mechanism of activation or does this occur through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines leading to NF-κB activation? If NRAS activates NF-κB signaling through the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway as described, then why wouldn't BRAF(V600E) or NF1(Null) melanomas, which have readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling, not also activate IFI6 mRNA expression? Indeed, it was noted that in their &quot;NRAS wild-type&quot; melanoma cell lines the authors employed at least one cell line (A375), which expresses BRAF(V600E) and has readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling. In sum, additional experiments are required to provide mechanistic insight into the mechanism of NRAS-mediated IFI6 expression through NF-κB activation and thus clarify the source of specificity (or lack thereof) for NRAS-driven melanoma.</p><p>2) Deregulated DNA replication versus senescence. The authors conclude that RNAi-mediated silencing of IFI6 leads to senescence, but this is not well documented and somewhat contradictory. The cells display elevated levels of SA- -β-gal, a widely used but unreliable marker of senescence, and a decrease in H3K9 acetylation. However, the cells also display increased numbers of cells in S phase, which is contrary to the idea of senescence, an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest generally associated with arrest in G1. How can these observations be reconciled? Could the authors detect evidence of DNA damage such as collapsed DNA replication forks, gH2AX foci and/or the recruitment of RAD51 or 53BP1 into damage sites?</p><p>Furthermore, in their initial gene induction studies and throughout the manuscript that authors employed Mel-ST cells, which are melanocytes immortalized by expression of hTERT and rendered susceptible to oncogenic transformation by expression of the SV40 Large and small T/t antigens. Since Large T binds to and inhibits the activity of the pRB, p107 and p130 &quot;pocket proteins&quot; that are negative regulators of E2F activity, and also to TP53, it is hard to understand mechanistically how senescence could be elicited in cells that are lacking these key tumor suppressors that are known to enforce the senescence program. Moreover, the authors claim that shIFI6 leads to elevated E2F2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but since, to all intents and purposes, Mel-ST cells are TP53, pRB, p107 and p130 deficient, the significance of this observation is questionable since these cells should already have abundant E2F activity. It is also notable that the authors have not assessed expression of E2F2 protein or the DNA binding/transcriptional activity of E2F2 in the cells under study. The authors claim that their data &quot;demonstrates that IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication&quot;. Of note, IFI6 knockout mice are normal and cells engineered to over-express do not show any obvious alterations in DNA synthesis. It is not clear where IFI6 is located in the cell or whether it is a part of the DNA replication machinery. Hence, there are no hints from previous publications, nor any compelling evidence from this manuscript, that &quot;IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication&quot;. In sum, additional experiments would be needed to clarify the relationship between deregulated IFI6 expression, E2F control, accelerated DNA replication and the establishment of senescence.</p><p>3) Correlation between sensitivity to DNA replication stress-inducing drugs and pERK levels. The relative sensitivity of NRAS mutated melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs should be assessed compared to the levels of pERK1/2 signaling and IFI6 expression in the control (NRAS wild-type) cells. Since A375 cells express BRAF(V600E), the differences in sensitivity may not be related to pERK1/2 levels. This should be further investigated and clarified.</p><p>4) Lack of correlation between NRAS mutation status and IFI6 expression in the TCGA dataset. The authors conclude that mutational activation of NRAS in melanocytes drives expression of the known interferon-regulated genes IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1. However, this conclusion is not supported by analysis of TCGA data for cutaneous melanoma that comprises ~478 well curated specimens of which 278 specimens are informative for NRAS, BRAF or NF1 mutation and the expression of IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Using the MSKCC cBio Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/">http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/</ext-link>), one of the Reviewers interrogated this dataset and found no correlation between mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of the IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Indeed, mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of these mRNAs tends towards mutual exclusivity. The authors should address this concern, and the revised manuscript should discuss analysis of public datasets, and to what extent these analyses support (or do not) the overall molecular mechanism described here.</p><p>5) Missing experimental controls. The authors fail to provide an immunoblot that documents diminished IFI6 expression in the knockdown cells. Reviewers request a rescue experiment in which an RNAi resistant form of IFI6 rescues the knockdown phenotype with regard to colony formation in agarose, and if possible, tumorigenicity in mice. The authors fail to present an immunoblot that documents diminished E2F2 expression in the shE2F2 knockdown cells. Have the authors conducted specificity experiments to confirm that their siRNAs are working through E2F2? How was NF-κB knocked down in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>?

The manuscript describes a mechanism that is supposedly specific for NRAS-driven melanomas, but Reviewers pointed out that the involvement of the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway indicates that melanomas driven by mutations in BRAF or silencing of NF1 should also display elevated IFI6 mRNA expression. This point should be carefully investigated and clarified. Is IFI6 upregulation unique to NRAS-driven tumors or not? Furthermore, by what mechanism(s) does NRAS-activated RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK activate NF-κB? Is it a direct mechanism of activation or does this occur through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines leading to NF-κB activation? If NRAS activates NF-κB signaling through the RAF-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK pathway as described, then why wouldn't BRAF(V600E) or NF1(Null) melanomas, which have readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling, not also activate IFI6 mRNA expression? Indeed, it was noted that in their &quot;NRAS wild-type&quot; melanoma cell lines the authors employed at least one cell line (A375), which expresses BRAF(V600E) and has readily detectable pERK1/2 signaling. In sum, additional experiments are required to provide mechanistic insight into the mechanism of NRAS-mediated IFI6 expression through NF-κB activation and thus clarify the source of specificity (or lack thereof) for NRAS-driven melanoma.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for asking these important questions. To address these concerns thoroughly, we performed several new experiments.</p><p>First, we showed that ectopic expression of BRAFV600E in MEL-ST cells, similar to NRASQ61K, results in the upregulation of IFI6 expression, which is consistent with the role of the MAPK pathway in the upregulation of IFI6. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p>Second, we knocked down the expression of NF1 in MEL-ST cells but did not observe an upregulation of IFI6. This indicates that there are still unknown effects of NF1 loss beyond MAPK pathway activation involved in the regulation of IFI6 expression. These results also show that NF1-deficient and NRAS-mutant melanoma are not equivalent, because NRASQ61K was able to activate IFI6, but loss of NF1 was not (also see our response to point 4 in this regard). These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>The regulation of NF-κB by RAS proteins is a well-studied phenomenon. Therefore, to determine the mechanism of NF-κB upregulation, we first surveyed the literature and found that IKKβ is necessary for NF-κB activation in a mouse model of HRASv12-driven melanoma and for HRASv12-driven melanoma growth (see Yang et al., 2010, JCI PMID: 20530876). This study also showed that HRASv12 activates IKKβ kinase activity to activate NF-κB. IKKβ activates NF-κB via inflammatory cytokines, and in absence of IKKβ, inflammatory cytokines cannot activate NF-κB expression (see Li et al., 1999, J Exp. Med. PMID: 10359587 and Li et al., 1999, Science PMID: 10195897).</p><p>Therefore, we knocked down IKKβ expression in MEL-ST cells expressing NRASQ61K and asked if this inhibits NF-κB activity and the ability of NRASQ61K to activate IFI6. Similar to the results reported by Yang et al., we found that knockdown of IKKβ prevented NF-κB activation, as assessed by decreased IκBα phosphorylation, decreased NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter activity, and decreased binding of NF-κB to the IFI6 promoter and the inability of NRASQ61K to activate IFI6 expression. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Deregulated DNA replication versus senescence. The authors conclude that RNAi-mediated silencing of IFI6 leads to senescence, but this is not well documented and somewhat contradictory. The cells display elevated levels of SA-β-gal, a widely used but unreliable marker of senescence, and a decrease in H3K9 acetylation. However, the cells also display increased numbers of cells in S phase, which is contrary to the idea of senescence, an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest generally associated with arrest in G1. How can these observations be reconciled? Could the authors detect evidence of DNA damage such as collapsed DNA replication forks, gH2AX foci and/or the recruitment of RAD51 or 53BP1 into damage sites? Furthermore, in their initial gene induction studies and throughout the manuscript that authors employed Mel-ST cells, which are melanocytes immortalized by expression of hTERT and rendered susceptible to oncogenic transformation by expression of the SV40 Large and small T/t antigens. Since Large T binds to and inhibits the activity of the pRB, p107 and p130 &quot;pocket proteins&quot; that are negative regulators of E2F activity, and also to TP53, it is hard to understand mechanistically how senescence could be elicited in cells that are lacking these key tumor suppressors that are known to enforce the senescence program. Moreover, the authors claim that shIFI6 leads to elevated E2F2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but since, to all intents and purposes, Mel-ST cells are TP53, pRB, p107 and p130 deficient, the significance of this observation is questionable since these cells should already have abundant E2F activity. It is also notable that the authors have not assessed expression of E2F2 protein or the DNA binding/transcriptional activity of E2F2 in the cells under study. The authors claim that their data &quot;demonstrates that IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication&quot;. Of note, IFI6 knockout mice are normal and cells engineered to over-express do not show any obvious alterations in DNA synthesis. It is not clear where IFI6 is located in the cell or whether it is a part of the DNA replication machinery. Hence, there are no hints from previous publications, nor any compelling evidence from this manuscript, that &quot;IFI6 is a new regulator of DNA replication&quot;. In sum, additional experiments would be needed to clarify the relationship between deregulated IFI6 expression, E2F control, accelerated DNA replication and the establishment of senescence.</italic> </p><p>The second set of concerns also included several important questions. First, the reviewers mentioned that we did not document the senescence phenotypes very well. As the reviewers noticed, we used two established criteria (SA-β-gal assay and H3K9 acetylation) used by others to identify senescent cells. The use of H3K9Ac measurement was based on previous studies demonstrating increased heterochromatinization in senescent cells (for an example, see Narita et al., 2006, Cell PMID: 16901784).</p><p>Therefore, together, these markers are predictive of cellular senescence. As an additional DNA damage marker, we have now included p-H2A.X immunoblot. Regarding the collapsed DNA replication fork, in the previous version of our manuscript, we used the gold standard method for measuring DNA replication stress: the DNA combing assay. This assay clearly showed dysregulation of DNA replication, and, in conjunction with p- H2A.X, demonstrates DNA damage. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p>The statement that senescence results in G1 phase cell cycle arrest is not entirely accurate, because the state of cell cycle arrest depends upon various factors including cell type and stimuli that induce senescence. For example, in cellular senescence, cells can be arrested in the G2/M phase (for a review on this topic, please refer to Gire and Dulic, 2015, Cell Cycle PMID: 25564883).</p><p>Second, regarding the statement that an increase of cells in S phase is counterintuitive for a senescence phenotype, we find that the loss of IFI6 results in E2F2-mediated unscheduled DNA replication (as demonstrated in the DNA combing assay, as well as the activation of several genes involved in DNA replication). As a result, cells incorporate more nucleotides, which causes a surge of cells in the S phase. Once this uncontrolled replication reaches a threshold level, the cell can no longer divide and therefore undergoes senescence. Please note that two previous studies have also documented this phenomenon in the context of cellular senescence. We cited these studies in our previous submission (Bartkova et al., 2006, Nature PMID: 17136093 and Di Micco et al., 2006 Nature PMID: 17136094) However, we understand the confusion this might have created for the reviewers; therefore, we have clearly articulated these results in the revised manuscript and added a paragraph in the Discussion section to clarify this point.</p><p>Third, we agree with the reviewers regarding the question of senescence induction in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells upon IFI6 knockdown. In the previous version of the manuscript, we did not test MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells expressing IFI6 shRNA for cellular senescence induction, but tested only melanoma cell lines and primary human melanocytes. Therefore, we tested cellular senescence induction in MEL-ST cells transformed with NRASQ61K and expressing either IFI6 shRNA or nonspecific shRNA as a control. As suggested by the reviewers, we did not observe senescence in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells expressing IFI6 shRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with published studies demonstrating that the p53 and RB pathways are required for senescence induction.</p><p>We, then, asked what could be a possible reason for the attenuation of NRASQ61K-induced transformation upon IFI6 knockdown in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells. Previous studies have shown that uncontrolled DNA replication and consequent DNA damage can result in apoptosis induction in a p53- or RB-independent manner (for examples, see Strasser et al., 1994, PMID: 7954799; Knudsen et al., 2000, PMID: 11003670; and Aladjem et al., 1998, PMID: 9443911). To determine whether increased apoptosis induction might explain the observed phenotype in MEL-ST cells, we measured cell death and apoptosis using various assays (poly-HEMA coated plates, growth in detached condition assay (GILA), annexin V-FITC staining, and cleaved caspase 3 by immunoblotting). These assays were performed under detached conditions that mimic soft agar and in vivo tumor formation. We found that loss of IFI6 increased apoptosis induction in MEL-ST/NRASQ61K cells. These new results are presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> of this revised manuscript. Taken together, these results show that loss of IFI6 expression results in DNA replication stress-induced DNA damage, which can cause senescence or apoptosis depending upon the presence or absence of active p53/RB proteins.</p><p>Finally, in regard to E2F gene activity/function, it is important not to generalize the functions of all E2F proteins. Previous studies have shown significant differences in these proteins, and context-specific functions for several of them have been described (for examples, see Attwooll et al., 2004, PMID: 15538380; DeGregori et al., 1997, PMID: 9207076; and DeGregori, 2002, Biochim Biophys Acta PMID: 12020800). It is also important to note that oncogenes can enhance the expression and/or activity of E2F family proteins (for an example, see Berkovich and Ginsberg, 2001, JBC PMID: 11551910).</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewers that it is important to show that E2F2 expression and function are enhanced after IFI6 knockdown. Therefore, we measured both RNA and protein level of E2F2 and our result showed that loss of IFI6 does result in increased E2F2 mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To show increased enrichment of E2F2 on the promoters of DNA replication regulatory genes that are upregulated in IFI6 knockdown cells, we performed ChIP experiments. Our results show increased enrichment of E2F2 on the MCM10 promoter after IFI6 knockdown. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p>In regard to the IFI6 knockout mice, we are not sure which study the reviewers are referring to. We do not find any evidence of IFI6 knockout mice in the literature. Moreover, none of our studies were performed using mouse cells, so we cannot comment on the role of IFI6 in mouse cells.</p><p>Regarding overexpression studies, we are not aware of any study that contradicts our results. Moreover, the fact that there is no hint of alteration in DNA replication in previous studies does not mean much unless a DNA replication stress phenotype was actively investigated. Moreover, none of the previous studies were performed in melanocytes or melanoma cells; therefore, it is hard to draw conclusions or determine the relevance of those previous studies in relation to our study.</p><p>Regarding, IFI6 being a regulator of DNA replication, we did not state that IFI6 directly regulates DNA replication by associating with the DNA replication machinery. Instead we showed that IFI6 loss results in the upregulation of E2F2, which in turn activates the expression of genes that are known regulators of DNA replication. Therefore, IFI6 loss results in uncontrolled DNA replication via upregulation of E2F2 and its target genes that regulate DNA replication, which is a more accurate description of our results and was discussed in our previous manuscript. Dysregulated DNA replication is one of the outcomes of IFI6 loss. Based on the questions from the reviewers, we have modified the language of our manuscript to more clearly show that the effect of IFI6 on DNA replication is not direct but rather mediated through E2F2.</p><p><italic>3) Correlation between sensitivity to DNA replication stress-inducing drugs and pERK levels. The relative sensitivity of NRAS mutated melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of DNA replication stress-inducing drugs should be assessed compared to the levels of pERK1/2 signaling and IFI6 expression in the control (NRAS wild-type) cells. Since A375 cells express BRAF(V600E), the differences in sensitivity may not be related to pERK1/2 levels. This should be further investigated and clarified.</italic> </p><p>The above-mentioned point concerns the specificity of resistance towards the DNA replication stress-inducing agents. To further expand our results and determine the reason for this drug resistance, we performed additional experiments using additional BRAF-mutant and NF1-deficient melanoma cell lines. Our results reconfirmed our findings that NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines were far more resistant to DNA replication stress-inducing drugs than other melanoma genotypes. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p>To determine whether IFI6 is upregulated by both oncogenic NRAS and oncogenic BRAF, and why only NRAS-mutant cell lines are resistant to DNA replication stress-inducing agents, we tested if the same set of genes is upregulated upon IFI6 knockdown in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, and triple wild-type melanoma cells. We found that IFI6 knockdown did not result in increased expression of E2F2 or target genes that regulate DNA replication in BRAF-mutant, NF1-deficient, or triple wild-type melanoma cells, as was observed in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells. Thus, the sensitivity of melanoma cells to DNA replication stress-inducing drugs is not due to the ability of a genetic alteration (such as BRAFV600E) to simply activate IFI6 alone. Rather, it depends upon the ability of IFI6 to regulate DNA replication stress through E2F2-mediated transcription of key DNA replication target genes, which is seen only in the context of NRAS-mutant melanoma. These new results are presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> of this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Lack of correlation between NRAS mutation status and IFI6 expression in the TCGA dataset. The authors conclude that mutational activation of NRAS in melanocytes drives expression of the known interferon-regulated genes IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1. However, this conclusion is not supported by analysis of TCGA data for cutaneous melanoma that comprises ~478 well curated specimens of which 278 specimens are informative for NRAS, BRAF or NF1 mutation and the expression of IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Using the MSKCC cBio Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/">http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/</ext-link>), one of the Reviewers interrogated this dataset and found no correlation between mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of the IFI6, IFITM1 and MX1 mRNAs. Indeed, mutational activation of NRAS and the expression of these mRNAs tends towards mutual exclusivity. The authors should address this concern, and the revised manuscript should discuss analysis of public datasets, and to what extent these analyses support (or do not) the overall molecular mechanism described here.</italic> </p><p>Before describing our findings using the TCGA dataset, we would like to point out that in our previous submission, we presented results from several publically available datasets, in which we found that IFI6 expression was upregulated in melanoma samples compared to normal skin samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and I</xref>). We also showed an analysis from a study that confirmed that IFI6 expression correlates with NRAS mutation status in clinical melanoma samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>We would also like to point out that based on the analysis of TCGA dataset there is no tendency for NRAS-mutant melanoma and expression of IFI6, IFIMT1, and MX1 to be mutually exclusive, because the p-values for these comparisons do not reach significance (p-value for IFI6 comparison in NRAS-mutant melanoma=0.555, p-value for IFI27 comparison in NRAS-mutant melanoma = 0.391, and p-value for MX1 comparison in NRAS-mutant melanoma =0.226).</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the statement above assumes that the TCGA melanoma dataset is powerful enough to identify all MAPK target genes or BRAF/NRAS/NF1 signature genes. Thus, we put the TCGA melanoma dataset to this test. To this end, we selected two previously published studies and analyzed 71 genes in total. The first study identified 43 BRAF-MAPK-regulated target genes using BRAFV600E and MEK inhibitors (Joseph et al., 2010, PNAS PMID: 20668238), and the second study presented a large-scale analysis of patient-derived cutaneous melanoma samples that identified 29 genes that predict a mutant BRAF signature in melanoma (Kannengiesser et al., 2008 Molecular Oncology PMID: 19383316). Of the 43 genes from the Joseph et al. study, only 7 showed a significant tendency towards co-occurrence with the BRAFV600E mutation, and 5 showed a significant tendency towards mutual exclusivity with BRAFV600E. Surprisingly 31 of the 43 genes showed no correlation with the BRAFV600E mutation in the TCGA dataset.</p><p>Because in principal, as mentioned by the reviewers, oncogenic NRASQ61K and inactivation of NF1 should activate MAPK targets and correlate with these genotypes, we analyzed all 43 genes in the context of NRAS mutation or NF1 mutation/deletions. Our results showed that only 3 of the 43 genes showed a significant tendency towards co- occurrence in NRAS-mutant melanoma sample and 3 of the 43 genes showed a significant tendency towards mutual exclusivity, whereas 37 showed no correlation. Notably, these genes expect one did not show the same tendencies between the BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma samples. In NF1-mutant melanomas, 3 of these 43 genes showed a significant tendency toward co-occurrence, and none of these 3 genes were common with NRAS-mutant and BRAF-mutant melanoma samples. Overall, this analysis showed that the TCGA data analysis identified less than 30% of MAPK targets in melanoma and less than 15% MAPK targets in NRAS- and less than 10% in NF1-mutant samples. Thus lack of correlation in the TCGA data between IFI6 expression and NRAS mutation should not be considered surprising based on this analysis.</p><p>The study by Kannengiesser et al. identified 29 genes that are upregulated in BRAF-mutant melanoma patient samples and thus represent a BRAF-mutant melanoma signature. Similar to our analysis with the Joseph et al. study, only 6 of the 2930 genes showed a significant tendency towards co-occurrence with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Thus, it failed to identify 23 of the 30 29 (796%) BRAF signature genes reported by Kannengiesser et al. Furthermore, only 1 gene showed a significant tendency towards co- occurrence with NRAS-mutant melanoma, and 7 showed a significant tendency toward mutual exclusivity. Finally, only 2 gene showed a significant tendency towards co- occurrence with NF1-deficient melanoma, and only one of these genes were identified to be significant for NRAS-mutant melanoma but not for BRAF-mutant melanoma.</p><p>Based on these preliminary analyses of the TCGA dataset we identified several genes that correlated with NRAS or NF1 mutations, but not with both genotypes, indicating differences between NRAS-mutant and NF1-deficient melanomas. This also provides a partial explanation for the differential regulation of IFI6 under NRAS-mutant and NF1-deficient conditions.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that datasets such as TCGA, although useful tools for researchers, are not comprehensive enough to predict or identify all biological outcomes in any given tumor type. We believe that the lack of correlation between IFI6 expression and NRAS mutation represents a limitation of the TCGA dataset rather than the proof that it is not regulated by the MAPK pathway. Therefore, independent studies, such as ours, should be encouraged and are complementary to the existing literature and large- scale datasets, including TCGA. We have included this analysis for the reviewers for review purpose as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and would be happy to include it as part of our manuscript if the reviewers recommend that we do so.</p><p><italic>5) Missing experimental controls. The authors fail to provide an immunoblot that documents diminished IFI6 expression in the knockdown cells. Reviewers request a rescue experiment in which an RNAi resistant form of IFI6 rescues the knockdown phenotype with regard to colony formation in agarose, and if possible, tumorigenicity in mice. The authors fail to present an immunoblot that documents diminished E2F2 expression in the shE2F2 knockdown cells. Have the authors conducted specificity experiments to confirm that their siRNAs are working through E2F2? How was NF-κB knocked down in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>? Please include an immunoblot that demonstrates knockdown of a component of NF-κB.</italic> </p><p>As per the reviewers’ request, we included immunoblots that are in agreement with loss of IFI6 mRNA, confirming that IFI6 protein was also efficiently reduced in cells expressing IFI6 shRNA. These results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To show the specificity of the phenotype, we performed rescue experiments using two representative cell lines from our studies (YUGASP and MEL-ST/NRASQ61K). Our results show that ectopic expression of the IFI6 open reading frame (ORF) rescues growth in the soft agar assay and tumor growth in mice caused by IFI6 shRNA targeting the 3'-UTR. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We included data showing that E2F2 shRNA knocks down both E2F2 mRNA and protein levels. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>.</p><p>We also show that IFI6 loss activates E2F2 but not other E2F family genes. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. Furthermore, we show that E2F2 knockdown does not affect the expression of other E2F family genes, thus E2F2 shRNA is highly specific to E2F2. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the NF-κB blot, NF-κB was knocked down by shRNA that targets p65 (RelA).
