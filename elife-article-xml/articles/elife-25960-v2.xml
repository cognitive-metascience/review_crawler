limiting membrane of that compartment. Using freeze fracture electron microscopy, we show here that the yeast NPC orthologs, Ncr1p and Npc2p, are essential for formation and expansion of raft-like domains in the vacuolar (lysosome) membrane, both in stationary phase and in acute nitrogen starvation. Moreover, the expanded raft-like domains engulf lipid droplets by a microautophagic mechanism. We also found that the multivesicular body pathway plays a crucial role in microautophagy in acute nitrogen starvation by delivering sterol to the vacuole. These data show that NPC proteins promote microautophagy in stationary phase and under nitrogen starvation conditions, likely by increasing sterol in the limiting membrane of the vacuole.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25960.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25960.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25960.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Niemann-Pick disease type C is a human disease that is characterized by severe neurological symptoms. The brains of children with this disease develop more slowly and adult patients have difficulty walking, coordinating movements, speaking clearly and they develop dementia. The disease is caused by mutations in two proteins called NPC1 and NPC2, which are normally needed to move lipid molecules, especially cholesterol, between different compartments within a cell.</p><p>Lysosomes are compartments within human cells that act as recycling points for many nutrients, including lipid molecules. The membranes surrounding lysosomes can bend to form pouches that can engulf the materials to be recycled. However, it was not clear exactly how this process, also known as microautophagy, happens and whether the NPC1 and NPC2 are involved.</p><p>Here Tsuji et al. used a method called freeze fracture to study microautophagy in yeast under an electron microscope. For the experiments, the yeast cells were exposed to conditions that prevented them from dividing to mimic human nerve cells in the brain. The experiments show that NPC1 and NPC2 play important roles in creating and enlarging areas in the lysosome’s membranes that are rich in a lipid molecule called ergosterol, which yeast uses in the same way as animals use cholesterol. These areas, also known as rafts, promoted microautophagy of lipid storage compartments in the yeast cells, ensuring the healthy recycling of nutrients. Furthermore, when the normal version of NPC2 was replaced with a mutated form of NPC2 that could not bind to ergosterol, the yeast cells were less able to form ergosterol-rich rafts.</p><p>These findings indicate that the symptoms of Niemann-Pick type C may be due, at least in part, to defects in the formation of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the membranes of lysosomes. Future experiments may investigate whether this microautophagy process, which depends on the NPC proteins in yeast, is exactly the same in human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25960.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25960.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microautophagy</kwd><kwd>Niemann-Pick type C</kwd><kwd>sterol</kwd><kwd>raft</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd><kwd>lipophagy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25111510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujimoto</surname><given-names>Toyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H02500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujimoto</surname><given-names>Toyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujimoto</surname><given-names>Toyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuji</surname><given-names>Takuma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K15544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuji</surname><given-names>Takuma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sterol transport by Niemann-Pick type C proteins induces the expansion of raft-like domains in the yeast vacuole, enabling engulfment of lipid droplets by microautophagy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) proteins NPC1 and NPC2 bind with cholesterol derived from endocytosed lipoproteins and transport it to the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Genetic defects in NPC1 and NPC2 cause a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomes, demonstrating the physiological importance of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenbaum and Maxfield, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which NPC proteins transport cholesterol has been studied extensively: NPC2, a soluble protein, binds cholesterol and transfers it to NPC1, a multipass transmembrane protein, which then inserts cholesterol into the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In parallel with this ‘hand-off’ mechanism, NPC2 is also thought to transport cholesterol directly to the membrane, bypassing NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Cholesterol that is inserted into the lysosomal membrane is then delivered to other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, by mechanisms that are yet to be defined in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikonen, 2008</xref>).</p><p>At one point during this transport process, cholesterol must be incorporated into the lysosomal membrane. Considering the low cholesterol content of the lysosomal membrane under ordinary circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolter and Sandhoff, 2005</xref>) and the known effect of cholesterol on various membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>), the insertion of cholesterol by NPC proteins is likely to influence the lysosomal membrane significantly, but to the best of our knowledge, relatively little attention has been paid to this aspect.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate this matter through experiments with budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The use of yeast is legitimate because the functional orthologs of NPC proteins in budding yeast, namely, Ncr1p and Npc2p, can substitute for NPC1 and NPC2, respectively, in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malathi et al., 2004</xref>). We examined yeast in two different conditions: one is the stationary phase, in which the cell cycle is arrested because of the gradual exhaustion of nutrients, and in which the formation of raft-like domains and lipophagy occur in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Toulmay and Prinz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>); the other is acute nitrogen starvation, which causes macroautophagy as well as microautophagy of lipid droplets (LDs) and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We discovered that NPC proteins, especially Npc2p, play a critical role in the formation and expansion of the raft-like domain in the vacuole, and that the domain is engaged in the binding and engulfment of LDs, both in stationary phase and in acute nitrogen starvation. This result indicates that a major function of NPC proteins is to expand the sterol-rich raft-like membrane domain in the vacuole to execute microautophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipophagy in stationary phase occurs through the expansion of raft-like vacuolar membrane domains</title><p>In stationary phase yeast, raft-like domain formation and lipophagy have been hypothesized to proceed in a feed-forward manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), but the exact mechanism has not been clear.

LDs were often found within deep vacuolar invaginations, suggesting that they were processed by a microautophagic mechanism similar to that in stationary phase.

The latter result was apparently produced because the quantity of full-length Nvj1p–GFP in WT increased after nitrogen starvation, reflecting the expansion of the nuclear-vacuolar junction (NVJ) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the degradation of the mitochondrial marker Om45p–GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and the bulk autophagy activity measured by the Pho8Δ60 assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>) were at comparable levels in WT and NPC-deficient cells.

First, in <italic>vps4△</italic>, in which the MVB pathway is blocked, hardly any degradation of Erg6p–GFP and Nvj1–GFP was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and the number of raft-like domains in the vacuolar membrane was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistently, filipin failed to stain the vacuolar membrane in <italic>vps4△</italic> after nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Here it is of note that, in <italic>vps4△</italic>, macroautophagy is not suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babst et al., 1997</xref>) and NPC proteins show normal vacuolar distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Second, in cells in which two major vacuolar proteases (<italic>pep4△prb1△</italic>) are depleted, the vacuolar lumen harbored a large number of ILVs as well as macroautophagic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and the raft-like domain in the vacuolar membrane was reduced to a minimum level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This result, together with the persistence of ILVs and microautophagic vesicles in <italic>ncr1△npc2△</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), suggested that both proteolysis and NPC-mediated sterol extraction are necessary for efficient degradation of sterol-rich membranes such as ILVs. Finally, to confirm that yeast ILVs are enriched with sterol, <italic>atg7△pep4△prb1△</italic> was examined after nitrogen starvation. As expected from the results from <italic>pep4△prb1△</italic>, the vacuole of <italic>atg7△pep4△prb1△</italic> contained abundant ILVs with few other structures, whereas that of <italic>atg7△</italic> was largely vacant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The combined result indicated that ILVs are enriched with sterol. On the basis of these results, we concluded that sterol brought into the vacuole by ILVs is crucial for the formation and expansion of the raft-like domain and microautophagy in nitrogen starvation.</p><p>The above result prompted us to ask whether ILVs also play a role in the domain formation in the stationary phase vacuole. In stationary phase, sterol esters in LDs were proposed to be a sterol source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, raft-like domain formation and lipophagy were decreased to low levels in <italic>are1△are2△</italic> that cannot synthesize sterol esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, domain formation and lipophagy in the stationary phase vacuoles were absent in <italic>vps4△</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Abnormal trafficking of NPC proteins may be a cause of the defect, but the complete absence of the raft-like domain in <italic>vps4△</italic> suggests that sterol in ILVs may be important as an initial trigger to induce the stationary phase vacuolar domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Involvement of Atg proteins and actin filaments in microautophagy during nitrogen starvation</title><p>Microautophagy of LDs and the nucleus in nitrogen starvation is suppressed in <italic>atg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>).

Latrunculin A suppressed degradation of both Erg6p–GFP and Nvj1p–GFP, whereas nocodazole did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The larunculin A treatment also decreased the number of raft-like domains in the vacuolar membrane in WT, but it did not affect the already reduced number of raft-like domains in <italic>ncr1△npc2△</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). On the other hand, the gross shape change in vacuoles was reduced in WT treated with latrunculin A and further decreased in <italic>ncr1△npc2△</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), indicating that the effects of actin depolymerization and NPC deletion were additive in this respect. This result suggested that actin depolymerization may have an additional effect besides suppressing raft-like domain formation.</p><p>On the basis of all of these results, we propose the mechanism for microautophagy in nitrogen starvation, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>NPC proteins are essential for the expansion of raft-like domains and microautophagy</title><p>The absence of Ncr1p or Npc2p does not cause overt abnormalities in yeast cells cultured under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malathi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). This may be because the yeast vacuole does not need to process endocytosed lipoproteins as mammalian cells do, but this possible explanation raises the question of which functions NPC proteins have in yeast. The present study showed that NPC proteins play a crucial role in the expansion of raft-like vacuolar membrane domains in microautophagy, probably by transporting sterol to the vacuolar membrane.</p><p>Obviously, NPC proteins are not the only mechanism capable of transporting sterol to the vacuolar membrane. This is indicated by the presence of raft-like domains in NPC-deficient cells, albeit at a lower level than in WT. Nevertheless, stationary phase lipophagy is prominently suppressed in NPC-deficient cells. This result suggests that sterol transport by NPC proteins is important not just for raft-like domain formationbut more critically so for the expansion of those domains, and this latter process appears indispensable for the engulfment of cargo in microautophagy.</p><p>How can NPC proteins expand the raft-like domain and promote microautophagy? In this context, it is notable that depletion of Npc2p causes more significant defects in microautophagy than does depletion of Ncr1. The Npc2p dominance indicates that direct sterol transport by Npc2p (bypassing Ncr1p), as shown for mammalian NPC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), may play a major role in the expansion of raft-like domains. Npc2p was shown to bind preferentially with negative-charged membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCauliff et al., 2015</xref>), and thus the sphingolipid-enriched raft-like domain is a suitable platform for the interaction with Npc2p. Hence, it is plausible that recruitment of Npc2p to the raft-like domain facilitates the domain’s expansion through direct sterol transfer. Exclusion of Ncr1p from raft-like domains is also consistent with this deduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Toulmay and Prinz, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The other important finding that contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of NPC proteins’ functioning is the manner in which raft-like domains invaginate. Inward budding of raft-like domains has been observed in giant liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamada et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that it may be an endogenous propensity of those domains. However, the vacuolar invagination differs from the liposomal phenomenon in that it occurs only in limited raft-like domains. This was particularly obvious in stationary phase vacuoles, where polygonal raft-like domains exist over the entire vacuole surface but invagination occurs only in the domains adhering to cargo. This result suggests that tight adhesion to cargo is conducive to invagination. We speculate that the inward curvature imposed on raft-like domains by the adhesion may create packing defects in the luminal leaflet of the vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2011</xref>), thereby enhancing the Npc2p-mediated sterol transfer.</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that Vac8p, the vacuolar protein interacting with Nvj1p, has an affinity to rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peng et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesize that this raft-philicity of vacuolar interacting molecules is important for the microautophagic process,because enlargement of the raft-like domain and recruitment of additional interacting proteins may proceed in a feed-forward manner. The marked elongation of NVJ in nitrogen starvation is consistent with this idea.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The MVB pathway supplies sterol for the induction of microautophagy</title><p>The MVB pathway and endocytic degradation of plasmalemmal proteins are activated immediately after amino acid starvation; and the resultant proteome remodeling, including upregulation of vacuolar hydrolases, is thought to boost macroautophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). The present study showed that this activation of the MVB pathway is also important for microautophagy and that ILVs are a major source of sterol that is transported by NPC proteins. Hence, in acute nitrogen starvation, both macroautophagy and microautophagy appear to be coordinated with the MVB pathway to support cell survival.</p><p>The importance of the MVB pathway in microautophagy in the stationary phase vacuole is less clear than that in acute nitrogen starvation because of the longer time course. Nevertheless, we think that as cells enter the post-diauxic phase, the MVB pathway is likely to be upregulated because the recycling of endocytosed plasmalemmal proteins from the endosome to the plasma membrane is reduced in glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). Complete lack of raft-like domains in <italic>vps4△</italic>, in which ILVs do not form, is consistent with this assumption. We thus propose that the MVB pathway may be involved in an early stage of raft-like domain formation in the stationary phase vacuole, whereas LDs may become an important sterol source at later time points after the MVB pathway subsides.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Correlation of macroautophagy and microautophagy in nitrogen starvation</title><p>Microautophagy in acute nitrogen starvation is suppressed in <italic>atg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>), but how this defect is correlated with macroautophagy deficiency has not been clear. We found that the raft-like domain formation in nitrogen starvation is significantly down-regulated in <italic>atg</italic> mutants. This is peculiar because the activation of the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 2015</xref>) and the vacuolar distribution of NPC proteins are observed in <italic>atg</italic> mutants, suggesting that sterol transport to the vacuolar membrane occurs in these mutants on a level comparable to that in WT.</p><p>We speculate that the defect of microautophagy in <italic>atg</italic> mutants may be caused by deficiency of sphingolipids, the other indispensable component of raft-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). Considering that the vacuolar membrane is relatively poor in sphingolipids under normal growing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hechtberger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneiter et al., 1999</xref>), sphingolipids are thought to be imported to the vacuole to form the raft-like domains in nitrogen starvation. Fusion of autophagosomes is the most likely route for such transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamagata et al., 2011</xref>), and this explains why <italic>atg</italic> mutants that are deficient in autophagy show few raft-like domains. Nevertheless, the possibility that other sphingolipid transport pathways that are downregulated in <italic>atg</italic> mutants may be involved cannot be excluded.</p><p>Additional defects may also occur in <italic>atg</italic> mutants after nitrogen starvation. In this context, it is notable that microautophagy in nitrogen starvation was suppressed by depolymerization of actin. In light of the necessity of actin for selective macroautophagy, but not for bulk autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reggiori et al., 2005</xref>), one role of actin may be to facilitate the engagement of cargo organelles with the vacuolar membrane. Yet we found that actin depolymerization also decreases raft-like domain formation, which implies that actin has some direct effect on the vacuolar membrane. Considering that actin integrity is important in organizing plasma membrane domains in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goswami et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>), actin that is associated with the vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eitzen et al., 2002</xref>) may be involved in generating the raft-like domains. This vacuole-associated actin might not be properly organized in <italic>atg</italic> mutants in nitrogen starvation. These speculations need to be tested in further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for mammalian cells</title><p>In mammalian cells, microautophagy of cytosolic proteins has been reported to occur in the late endosome by an ESCRT-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sahu et al., 2011</xref>), but it is not known whether microautophagy and the MVB pathway are correlated in the same way that we observed in yeast. It is noteworthy, however, that autophagosomes in mammalian cells may often fuse with MVBs to form amphisomes before fusing with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes, whereas autophagosomes in yeast fuse directly with vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fader and Colombo, 2009</xref>). The amphisome is unique in that it delivers autophagocytosed cytosolic materials and sterol-rich ILVs to the lysosome simultaneously. Moreover, the relative size of an autophagosome (and an amphisome) to a lysosome (or a vacuole) is much larger in mammals than in yeast, indicating that a single autophagosomal fusion would have a greater impact on the mammalian lysosome than on the yeast vacuole. It is thus probable that the mammalian autophago-lysosomal membrane acquires an amount of both sterol and sphingolipids that is sufficient to generate raft-like domains. On the basis of this inference, we would predict that microautophagy in mammalian cells occurs preferentially in lysosomes after fusion with amphisomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are based on the parent strain SEY6210 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

To remove the cell wall, yeast replicas were treated for 2 hr at 37°C with one of the following solutions: (1) 20 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T (Nacalai Tesque) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque) or (2) 0.1% Westase (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) in McIlvain buffer (37 mM citrate, 126 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 6.0) containing 10 mM EDTA, 30% fetal calf serum, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. Replicas for labeling PtdIns(3)P were generally treated with Zymolyase, whereas those for protein labeling were treated with Westase. After the enzyme treatment, the replicas were further treated in 2.5% SDS and stored in buffered 50% glycerol at −20°C until use.</p><p>For freeze-fracture/etching, the specimens were fractured at −102°C under a vacuum of ~1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mbar and kept at the same temperature for 2 min to induce sublimation of water from the fractured surface. The samples were then exposed to rotary evaporation of Pt/C (4 nm) at an angle of 20°, followed by C (20 nm) at an angle of 80°. The replicas were treated with household bleach to digest biological materials before mounting on EM grids for observation. The method of freeze-fracture/etching is described in detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsuji and Fujimoto, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Replica labeling</title><p>PtdIns(3)P was labeled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, SDS-treated freeze-fracture replicas were incubated at 4°C overnight with GST-tagged p40<sup>phox</sup> PX domain (10 ng/ml) in PBS containing 1% BSA, followed by rabbit anti-GST antibody (10 µg/ml) and then by colloidal gold (10 nm)-conjugated protein A (PAG10; University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands), each for 30 min at 37°C in 1% BSA in PBST. For labeling of Vph1p–mRFP, replicas were incubated with rabbit anti-mCherry antibody (provided by Dr Shuh-ichi Nishikawa of Niigata University and Dr Masahiko Watanabe of Hokkaido University) followed by PAG10. The labeled replicas were picked up on Formvar-coated EM grids and observed with a JEOL JEM-1011 EM (Tokyo, Japan) operated at 100 kV. Digital images were captured using a CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and subjected to further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pho8Δ60 assay</title><p>Bulk autophagic activity of yeast cells was quantified by measuring phosphatase activity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda et al., 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>EM images obtained from more than three independent experiments were used for the analysis. The number of colloidal gold particles was counted manually, and areas were measured using ImageJ (NIH). The labeling density in the selected structure was calculated by dividing the number of colloidal gold particles by the area. Statistical differences between samples were examined by Student’s t-test except for the results concerning PtdIns(3)P labeling density, the diameter of microautophagic vesicles, and Western blotting. Differences in PtdIns(3)P labeling density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and in the diameter of microautophagic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>) were examined by Mann-Whitney’s U-test.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Through a series of elegant and technically challenging morphological assays, the authors present compelling freeze-fracture images showing the vacuolar phenotypes in yeast mutants defective in the Niemann-pick type C (NPC) proteins. The authors show that the NPC proteins play an important role in the formation and expansion of lipid domains on the vacuole membrane in both stationary phase, and after nitrogen starvation (vacuole domain formation has been previously reported: Moeller et at., 1979, Toulmay et al., 2013, and Wang et al., 2014). They use freeze fracture EM and replica labeling to show that LDs enter the vacuole using a microautophagic mechanism which occurs at the sterol-rich, IMP-deficient vacuolar domains. In npc mutants microautophagic lipophagy is strongly inhibited. The authors do observe microautophagic vesicles in the vacuole lumen in npc mutants, however, the vesicles are significantly smaller than those in WT cells, indicating that NPC proteins are required for the expansion of vacuolar domains needed to engulf the relatively large LDs. The authors also address whether macroautophagy and the MVB pathway, both previously shown to be required for vacuolar domain formation and lipophagy, play direct or indirect roles. There are several major points which need to be addressed to support their conclusions.</p><p>1) NPC induced sterol trafficking defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) The authors show a moderate defect in domain formation by ncr1 mutants, and a strong defect in npc2 mutants. The authors attribute this to the lack of cholesterol transport from the vacuole lumen into the vacuole membrane in cells at stationary phase and under nitrogen starvation. The assays used by the authors, however, do not adequately show that the vacuole membrane has lowered sterol concentrations in npc mutants. They instead point to an accumulation of sterols in the vacuole lumen. This is especially apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, where the WT vacuole membrane does not show strong filipin staining after nitrogen starvation. In addition, the lack of a vacuole membrane marker makes it hard to interpret these data. The authors use lipophagy as a reporter for vacuole domain expansion. However, they do not address whether npc mutants affect the number or size of lipid droplets at stationary phase or under nitrogen starvation. Please provide data relevant to this issue.</p><p>2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) The core ATG components have been shown to be required for vacuole domain formation as well as lipophagy, however, their exact role is not clear (Wang et al., 2014). In this manuscript, the authors attribute this defect to two different mechanisms. Under saturation conditions, core atg mutants cause a NPC trafficking defect, re-localizing NPCs from the vacuole to a dot near the vacuole. They claim that this prevents sterol transport to the vacuole membrane, inhibiting domain formation. The authors do not show that vacuole membrane sterol concentration is affected in these cells. Under nitrogen starvation, they do not see a NPC trafficking defect, which is inconsistent with their conclusions about the role of ATGs in saturated cells. They instead posit that autophagy is required for the delivery of sphingolipids to the vacuole membrane. The authors do not consider an alternative mechanism in which macroautophagy is required under starvation conditions for nutrient availability, indirectly blocking the function of other components required for vacuolar domain formation. Please clarify and please explain why Ncr1p and Npc2p are mis-localized when autophagy is disrupted.</p><p>3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) The requirement of the MVB pathway for vacuole domain formation, and lipophagy has been previously reported (Toulmay et al., 2013, and Wang et al., 2014). The authors claim that the MVB pathway is required for the delivery of sterols to the vacuole for domain formation. There are three major problems with this conclusion. First, it is not well established in yeast that ILVs are sterol rich. Second, the vps4 mutant used to block ILV formation causes defects in NPC trafficking. Third, the authors do not address whether vacuole membrane sterol distribution is altered in MVB mutants.

In response, the authors quantified the distribution of filipin staining as the percent of cells showing PM and vacuole membrane (&quot;double-ring&quot;) staining under saturation conditions. The authors also showed filipin staining for other mutants which they claim &quot;lower vacuole membrane sterol delivery&quot; or affect NPC localization. The data do not actually show lowering of cholesterol, however.</p><p>The filipin only shows the relative distribution of sterols in these cells, and does not indicate absolute amounts (increased Vacuolar Membrane sterols under saturation conditions). Another drawback to filipin staining is that it also stains lipid droplets, which under the tested conditions should dock on the vacuole membrane. In many of the images shown, the vacuole membrane filipin staining looks patchy, it is not clear if these dots represent raft-like domains, or perivacuolar sterol rich compartments. We recommend that the authors clarify this explicitly throughout the text and Abstract – they cannot conclude that &quot;loss of NPC lowers the cholesterol concentration of vacuolar membranes.&quot;</p><p>2) There are way too many supplemental figures.

In addition, the lack of a vacuole membrane marker makes it hard to interpret these data.</italic></p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, in the original manuscript, filipin staining was used to show sterol-rich deposits in the vacuolar lumen of NPC mutants. To examine changes in sterol in the vacuolar membrane, quantification of sterol in isolated vacuole fractions was considered as a possibility, but we found that isolated vacuoles retain macro- and micro-autophagic vesicles as well as ILVs in the lumen, making it difficult to measure the sterol content in the vacuolar membrane per se. We thus utilized filipin staining to examine whether the sterol concentration in the vacuolar membrane of mutant yeast was higher/lower than that of wild-type yeast.</p><p>With regard to stationary phase yeast, which generally contains one large vacuole, filipin staining revealed two concentric fluorescent rings, i.e., one in the plasma membrane and one in the vacuolar membrane, in a majority of wild-type cells. This was drastically different from the result in log phase wild-type yeast, in which the vacuolar membrane contains little sterol and filipin staining invariably gives a single-ring fluorescence pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the sterol concentration of the vacuole membrane increased in stationary phase. Based on these results, we compared the proportion of cells showing the double-ring filipin staining pattern. The result showed that cells with the double-ring pattern were significantly less abundant in NPC mutants than in wild-type cells, indicating that sterol in the vacuolar membrane is actually lower in NPC mutants. The result of this experiment was added to the text (subsection “Sterol transport by NPC proteins is essential for stationary phase lipophagy”, fifth paragraph) and as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.</p><p>For yeast under nitrogen starvation, the vacuolar membrane needs to be visualized with a fluorescent marker because the vacuolar shape is grossly changed, especially in the wild-type yeast, and is therefore not distinct using the Nomarski method. We thus modified the protocol to enable simultaneous observation of the filipin staining and Vph1-GFP. The result showed that the filipin staining in NPC mutants is seen as large puncta within the Vph1p-GFP ring (i.e., in the vacuolar lumen), whereas that in wild-type cells is observed as indiscrete signals largely overlapping with the deformed vacuolar membrane visualized by Vph1p-GFP. The filipin staining in the wild-type vacuolar membrane was less distinct than that in stationary phase. This result agrees well with the freeze-fracture EM result showing that the raft-like domain formation is less extensive in nitrogen starvation than in stationary phase, indicating that the increase in sterol in the vacuolar membrane in nitrogen starvation is not so drastic as in stationary phase. The method of this experiment and its result were added to the text (subsection “Fluorescence microscopy”, second paragraph and subsection “Microautophagy in acute nitrogen starvation also occurs in NPC-dependent raft-like domains”, second paragraph, respectively) and as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors use lipophagy as a reporter for vacuole domain expansion. However, they do not address whether npc mutants affect the number or size of lipid droplets at stationary phase or under nitrogen starvation. Please provide data relevant to this issue.</italic> </p><p>The number and size of lipid droplets in NPC mutants were examined by fluorescence microscopy after BODIPY493/503 staining and by freeze-fracture EM, respectively. The result showed that both the number and size of lipid droplets are not drastically different between wild-type cells and NPC mutants, both in stationary phase and under nitrogen starvation. The result was added to the text (subsection “Sterol transport by NPC proteins is essential for stationary phase lipophagy”, third paragraph; subsection “Microautophagy in acute nitrogen starvation also occurs in NPC-dependent raft-like domains”, fourth paragraph) and also as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and Figure 5—figure supplement 4.</p><p><italic>2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) The core ATG components have been shown to be required for vacuole domain formation as well as lipophagy, however, their exact role is not clear (Wang et al., 2014). In this manuscript, the authors attribute this defect to two different mechanisms. Under saturation conditions, core atg mutants cause a NPC trafficking defect, re-localizing NPCs from the vacuole to a dot near the vacuole. They claim that this prevents sterol transport to the vacuole membrane, inhibiting domain formation. The authors do not show that vacuole membrane sterol concentration is affected in these cells.</italic> </p><p>The sterol concentration in the stationary phase vacuole in <italic>atg</italic> mutants was examined by quantifying the double-ring filipin staining pattern as described above in our first answer to comment 1. The result indicated that the sterol concentration in the vacuolar membrane of <italic>atg7Δ</italic> is significantly decreased compared to that in wild-type cells. This result was described in the text (subsection “Trafficking defect of NPC proteins impairs stationary phase lipophagy”, second paragraph) and added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Under nitrogen starvation, they do not see a NPC trafficking defect, which is inconsistent with their conclusions about the role of ATGs in saturated cells.

The authors do not consider an alternative mechanism in which macroautophagy is required under starvation conditions for nutrient availability, indirectly blocking the function of other components required for vacuolar domain formation. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out correctly by the reviewers, a possible deficiency of sphingolipids due to the absence of autophagosomal fusion is one of the possible causes contributing to the observed decrease of vacuolar domain formation in <italic>atg</italic> mutants. In the revised manuscript, we discussed other possible abnormalities leading to the decrease in vacuolar domain formation: transport of sphingolipids to the vacuole by pathways other than autophagosomes may be down-regulated in <italic>atg</italic> mutants; and the vacuole-associated actin network may not be properly organized in <italic>atg</italic> mutants. These possibilities were discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “Correlation of macroautophagy and microautophagy in nitrogen starvation”, last two paragraphs).</p><p><italic>Please explain why Ncr1p and Npc2p are mis-localized when autophagy is disrupted.</italic> </p><p>We think that the aberrant distribution of NPC proteins in stationary phase <italic>atg</italic> mutants may not be directly derived from the lack of macroautophagy, because the distribution persisted in <italic>atg18Δ</italic> even when the autophagic activity was restored by expression of Atg18(FTTG)-2xFYVE, which binds to PtdIns(3)P, but not to PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>fab1Δ</italic>, which lacks PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> but retains macroautophagic activity, also showed similar NPC puncta in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Based on these results we conjectured that some abnormality in the PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism may occur in <italic>atg</italic> mutants, thereby leading to the abnormal NPC distribution.</p><p>The above conjecture was supported by the additional experiments. By studying the time course of the puncta formation in <italic>atg7Δ</italic> and in other mutants, it was found that the abnormal NPC puncta in <italic>atg7Δ</italic> were not observed in day 1, a period corresponding to the early post-diauxic phase, appeared in some cells in day 2, and finally became prevalent in day 3 when cells reached the stationary phase. In contrast, in <italic>pep4Δ</italic>, which is defective in recycling of autophagocytosed materials, NPC proteins showed the vacuolar distribution even in stationary phase, arguing that nutritional deficiency caused by the absence of macroautophagy may not be the direct cause of their aberrant distribution. Furthermore, in <italic>fab1Δ</italic>, which is totally lacking in PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, NPC proteins started to show the punctate distribution in a majority of cells in day 1. These results were added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and discussed in the text (subsection “Trafficking defect of NPC proteins impairs stationary phase lipophagy”) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>These results suggested that abnormality in the phosphoinositide metabolism, in particular that of PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, may occur in <italic>atg</italic> mutants, causing the aberrant distribution of NPC proteins. But we are still seeking the mechanism causing the defective PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism, as well as how such abnormality leads to the trafficking defect of NPC proteins. We think that the peculiar behavior of NPC proteins in <italic>atg</italic> mutants is worth further investigation and wish to clarify the details in future studies.</p><p><italic>3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) The requirement of the MVB pathway for vacuole domain formation, and lipophagy has been previously reported (Toulmay et al., 2013, and Wang et al., 2014). The authors claim that the MVB pathway is required for the delivery of sterols to the vacuole for domain formation. There are three major problems with this conclusion. First, it is not well established in yeast that ILVs are sterol rich.</italic> </p><p>We examined <italic>atg7Δpep4Δprb1Δ</italic> in nitrogen starvation. In this mutant, the vacuolar lumen was expected to contain abundant ILVs due to the absence of proteolytic degradation, whereas structures other than ILVs must be scarce because both macroautophagy and microautophagy are abrogated. This assumption was confirmed by freeze-fracture EM, which showed the presence of numerous ILVs with few other structures (added as Figure 6—figure supplement 4). In contrast, the vacuolar lumen of <italic>atg7Δ</italic> was largely vacant (the former Figure 7—figure supplement 2 was moved to Figure 6—figure supplement 4). When <italic>atg7Δpep4Δprb1Δ</italic> and <italic>atg7Δ</italic> under nitrogen starvation were compared by filipin staining, the vacuolar lumen of <italic>atg7Δpep4Δprb1Δ</italic> was filled with filipin fluorescence, whereas that of <italic>atg7Δ</italic> was not. Although individual ILVs cannot be distinguished by fluorescence microscopy, the combined result indicates that yeast ILVs are enriched with sterol. This result was described in the text (subsection “The MVB pathway supplies sterol for induction of microautophagy”, second paragraph) and the filipin staining result was added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>.</p><p><italic>Second, the vps4 mutant used to block ILV formation causes defects in NPC trafficking.</italic> </p><p>We confirmed that Ncr1p-GFP and Npc2p-GFP in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> after nitrogen starvation were observed in the membrane and the lumen of the vacuole, respectively, as they were in the wild-type cell. The result in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> contrasted with the aberrant distribution of both Ncr1p-GFP and Npc2p-GFP in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> in stationary phase (Figure 4—figure supplement 7). The result in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> after nitrogen starvation was added to the text (subsection “The MVB pathway supplies sterol for induction of microautophagy”, second paragraph) and as Figure 6—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Third, the authors do not address whether vacuole membrane sterol distribution is altered in MVB mutants. Please address.</italic> </p><p>By using the protocol described in the first answer to comment 1 [the last paragraph of that answer], filipin staining in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> was examined. In <italic>vps4Δ</italic> under nitrogen starvation, Vph1-GFP was observed as a large dot representing the class E compartment as well as in the vacuolar membrane, and the vacuole largely retained its round shape. In comparison to wild-type cells, which showed filipin staining overlapping with the Vph1-GFP-positive vacuolar membrane, filipin-derived fluorescence in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> was intense in the class E compartment but negligible in the vacuolar membrane. The result indicated that the sterol concentration in the vacuolar membrane may not increase in <italic>vps4Δ</italic> in nitrogen starvation.

[please see the following 2) for the context to which this figure was added]</p><p>The changed portions are as follows:</p><p>1) Abstract: “The result shows that a prime function of NPC proteins is to promote microautophagy <italic>probably</italic> by increasing sterol in the vacuolar membrane.”</p><p>2) Results: “Consistent with the formation of raft-like domains, sterol stained by filipin was observed along the vacuolar membrane in stationary phase, giving a double-ring staining pattern, whereas filipin staining in log-phase yeast was found only in the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <underline>[…]</underline> We hypothesized that this <italic>probable</italic> increase in sterol in the stationary phase vacuolar membrane may not occur through spontaneous incorporation but may involve NPC proteins”.</p><p>3) Results: “Fourth, the proportion of cells showing the double-ring filipin staining pattern was significantly lower in NPC-deficient cells than in WT cells, indicating that sterol transport to the vacuolar membrane may be suppressed in NPC-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).”</p><p>4) Results: “Consistent with the decrease in NPC proteins in the vacuole, the proportion of cells showing the double-ring filipin staining pattern was lower in <italic>atg7△</italic> than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p>5) Results: “Filipin staining suggested a relative increase in sterol in the vacuolar membrane of WT”.</p><p>6) Discussion: “The present study showed that NPC proteins play a crucial role in expansion of raft-like vacuolar membrane domains in microautophagy, probably by transporting sterol to the vacuolar membrane.”</p><p><italic>2) There are way too many supplemental figures.
