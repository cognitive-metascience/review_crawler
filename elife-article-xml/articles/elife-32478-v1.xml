Experiments suggest the capsid must be flexible to function; however, capsid structure and dynamics have not been thoroughly characterized in the absence of icosahedral symmetry constraints. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are leveraged to investigate the capsid without symmetry bias, enabling study of capsid flexibility and its implications for biological function and cryo-EM resolution limits. Simulation results confirm flexibility and reveal a propensity for asymmetric distortion. The capsid’s influence on ionic species suggests a mechanism for modulating the display of cellular signals and implicates the capsid’s triangular pores as the location of signal exposure. A theoretical image reconstruction performed using simulated conformations indicates how capsid flexibility may limit the resolution of cryo-EM.

Despite the availability of a vaccine, around 240 people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ott et al., 2012</xref>), placing them at risk for severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and cancer. Among new strategies being explored for the treatment of HBV, disruption of its capsid represents a promising approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zlotnick and Mukhopadhyay, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The HBV capsid typically manifests as a T = 4 icosahedral particle, 36 nm in diameter, composed of 120 copies of capsid protein (Cp) homodimer. The capsid carries out important functional roles throughout the HBV infection cycle, assembling to enclose the viral genome (pregenomic RNA, pgRNA), serving as a container for reverse transcription of single-stranded linear pgRNA to circular double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA), displaying signals for intracellular trafficking and the binding of viral envelope glycoproteins, and dissociating to release its cargo to the host cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>). The Cp assembly domain (Cp149) represents the minimum protein length required to achieve self-association of dimers into archetypal capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zlotnick et al., 1996</xref>). Atomic models of the assembly domain capsid (4 MDa) have been determined crystallographically via symmetry averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wynne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Full-length Cp includes 34 additional residues on its C-terminus (Cp183). The C-terminal domain (CTD) tails interact with pgRNA in the immature capsid, extrude to the capsid exterior to signal key events during the viral life cycle, and are subject to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Development of therapeutic interventions that target the HBV capsid can be supported by all-atom characterization of its structure, dynamics, and biophysical properties. However, the size and complexity of the complete capsid have rendered it difficult to study without enforcing assumptions based on icosahedral symmetry. For decades, researchers have relied on symmetry to obtain experimental structures of icosahedral virus capsids, as well as to make computational predictions regarding their dynamical behavior. Unfortunately, the results generated by such approaches may provide an incomplete and/or oversimplified description of a complex molecular machine, thus, limiting researchers’ ability to ascertain the mechanisms by which it functions.</p><p>The present work addresses the need for all-atom characterization of the HBV capsid without symmetry bias using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the microsecond timescale. MD simulations have emerged as a powerful technique to model and investigate large biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perilla et al., 2015</xref>), and advances in supercomputing now enable their application to complete virus capsids and virus-like particles at full chemical detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freddolino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarasova et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tarasova et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>). The HBV capsid has been examined previously with coarse-grained simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkhipov et al., 2009</xref>) and in preliminary work that encompassed a timescale of only 0.1 µs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perilla et al., 2016</xref>). Here, computational study of the HBV capsid yields an all-atom description of unconstrained dynamics based on a timescale an order of magnitude greater than hitherto explored and represents the most extensive unbiased simulation achieved to date for a T &gt; 1 icosahedral virus capsid. The availability of an unsymmetrized conformational ensemble sampled over 1 µs provides the unique opportunity to study intrinsic capsid flexibility, its potential role in viral function, and its relationship to resolution obtained with single-particle image reconstruction, a technique used widely in structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).</p><p>Simulation results reveal remarkable asymmetry in capsid shape and essential dynamics, supporting hypotheses that the ability to accommodate asymmetric distortion plays a key role in its biological function. Findings further demonstrate the capsid’s influence on its surrounding solvent environment, particularly with respect to the behavior of charged species, suggesting a mechanism to modulate the display of nuclear localization signals. Observations implicate the capsid’s triangular pores as participating in the cellular signaling process. The identification of sodium localization within trimer-of-dimer interfaces could contribute to accelerated capsid assembly under high salt concentrations. Finally, a theoretical single-particle image reconstruction performed using capsid conformations sampled during simulation indicates that capsid flexibility may represent a major limiting factor to achieving true atomic (1–2 Å) resolution with cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Capsid simulation reaches equilibrium after 0.1 <bold>µ</bold>s</title><p>An all-atom model of the HBV capsid assembly domain (Cp149, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) was constructed based on an available apo-form crystal structure (PDB ID 2G33, 3.96 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>) and simulated without restraints for a total of 1.1 µs.

Following the release of simulation restraints, volume increased for 0.05 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). An overall expansion of capsid volume by 4% suggests that the crystal structure was substantially affected by crystal contacts. The mutual similarity of capsid conformers sampled during simulation was assessed by measuring Cα root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) pairwise between them. RMSD is defined as the root-mean-square-average distance between two optimally superimposed biomolecular structures. Cα RMSD between capsid conformers converged to within 5 Å around 0.1 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating the equilibration time required for the model to reach a stable configuration. Interestingly, the all-atom model of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) was observed to shrink during simulation and reached equilibrium only after 0.4 µs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The sphericity of the HBV capsid, a measure of how closely its 3D shape approaches that of a sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wadell, 1935</xref>), was also estimated based on the 240-face polyhedron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The capsid’s morphology remained highly spherical throughout the course of simulation, fluctuating within 0.15% of the value calculated for the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). While fluctuations in sphericity clearly arise from fluctuations in capsid shape, decreased sphericity does not necessarily indicate asymmetry.</p><p>The 0.1 µs equilibration time required for the HBV capsid model is consistent with previous all-atom simulation work on the similarly sized poliovirus capsid, which attempted to correct for anticipated volume expansion in the initial model, prior to simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andoh et al., 2014</xref>). Equilibration times are expected to be even longer for larger capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>) and capsids whose experimental structures were determined under conditions very different from their native environment. Given that most other all-atom investigations of virus capsids have reached timescales of only tens of nanoseconds, these observations underscore the likely necessity of future capsid simulation studies to sample temporal regimes of hundreds of nanoseconds in order to produce relaxed conformational ensembles conducive to the measurement of equilibrium biophysical properties.

Values are 9.8 ± 3.1 Å at V149-Cα and 2.1 ± 0.7 Å at T142-Cα , the last crystallographically ordered residue in most experimental structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wynne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). In Cp183, residues 140 to 149 have been described as a linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watts et al., 2002</xref>) that connects the assembly domain to the disordered CTD, whose flexibility and mobility are known to be vital for capsid function throughout the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to quasi-equivalence, dimers can be classified into two groups: those composed of A and B chains (AB dimers) and those composed of C and D chains (CD dimers). Comparing average Cα RMSF for dimer groups indicates that CD dimers are more flexible than AB dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). Apart from the C-termini, the spike tips at the junction of helices 3 and 4 and the region encompassing helix 2 and its connecting loop to helix 3 exhibit the greatest mobility. The flexibility and variability of the CD dimer exceeds that of the AB dimer in both of these key locations, demonstrating that local capsid dynamics are a function of quasi-equivalence.</p><p>Even within the crystal structure, CD dimers exhibit more disorder in the spike tips than AB dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>). CD dimer spike tips also maintain a shorter gap between constituent chains than AB dimer spike tips (4.9 ± 4.4 Å versus 7.2 ± 5.2 Å from D78-Cα to D78-Cα’ on average during simulation), indicating that greater mobility in this region does not arise from or lead to a more open dimer interface.

Future simulation work on icosahedral capsids that explore longer, multi-microsecond timescales, likely through the use of enhanced sampling methods, will shed further light on the role of symmetry versus asymmetry in capsid collective motions, particularly in the presence of solvent.

Measurement of exchange rates for ionic species crossing the capsid surface indicates that, at 150 mM NaCl, sodium ions exchange inward and outward at rates of 8.4 ± 0.7 ns<sup>-1</sup> and 8.5 ± 0.6 ns<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), and chloride ions exchange inward and outward at rates of 1.8 ± 0.4 ns<sup>-1</sup> and 1.7 ± 0.3 ns<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Equivalence between inward and outward rates confirms that ion exchange is, like water exchange, in equilibrium between the capsid interior and exterior.

Due to the highly negative net charge of the Cp149 capsid (−1680e at pH 7.0), an excess of sodium ions was included in the simulation to achieve neutrality, such that there is a sodium to chloride ratio of approximately 4:3. While the presence of more sodium in the system could account for the observation of more translocation events for this species, a preference to exchange sodium rather than chloride remains clear.</p><p>The measured rate for sodium exchange is consistent with the average rate determined for the HIV-1 capsid (9.0 ± 1.9 ns<sup>-1</sup>), yet HIV-1 was found to preferentially exchange chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>).

In contrast to both HBV and HIV-1, simulation studies of the poliovirus and PCV2 capsids suggested that, while both structures are permeable to water, they do not exchange ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tarasova et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Ion translocation events were observed for all pore types in the HBV capsid during simulation, including those at the centers of capsomeres; however, computed ion occupancy maps reveal strong localization of sodium only within the triangular pores that occur on either side of CD dimers, indicating that sodium exchange primarily occurs through these apertures. Occupancy values are directly related to the Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>), and a 3D potential of mean force was derived to quantify the strength of ion association based on the ratio of species occupancy at a given site versus its occupancy in bulk solvent.

The highly negative nature of the triangular pores likely relates to their preference to exchange positive ions and may contribute to the relatively slow rate of exchange observed for negative ions.

Notably, computed ion occupancy maps reveal that the capsid invites the localization of sodium ions in key regions around its structure. At ΔG = −0.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, sodium localizes in a shell along the capsid’s interior surface and in arcs across the capsid spike tips where two copies each of E77 and D78 come together in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>).

Chloride was instead noted along the interior of both the HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>) and PCV2 capsids, with a sufficient ‘neutralizing’ layer of chloride shown to be critical for the stability of PCV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarasova et al., 2017a</xref>).

In the Cp183 capsid, the disordered CTD tails carry a highly positive net charge (+3600e at pH 7.0) and have been shown to localize primarily along the interior surface of the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selzer et al., 2015</xref>), roughly corresponding to the shell region weakly occupied by sodium ions during simulation. The ability of the capsid to closely corral positive species along its interior likely contributes to the organization of the CTD tails within the capsid, explaining their experimentally observed preference to remain there and become exposed to the capsid exterior only transiently for cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selzer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In a mature Cp183 capsid containing a 3200-basepair dsDNA genome, the negative charge of phosphates (−6400e at pH 7.0) should massively exceed the positive charge contributed by CTD tails. Experimental work on Cp183 phosphorylation-mimic mutants indicate that the presence of phosphates increases the preference of the CTD tails to remain within the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selzer et al., 2015</xref>). Combined with experimental observation of a notable gap between the genome and capsid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), these findings suggest that the putative sodium shell identified by simulation is a feature of the native capsid structure and may serve to electrostatically stabilize phosphorylated CTD tails within the capsid interior. The CTD tails likely displace the sodium shell in the absence of phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Sodium binds to Cp dimers</title><p>Further inspection of occupancy maps indicates that sodium ions can bind directly to Cp dimers. At ΔG = −1.4 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, specific sodium binding is apparent at E117, where helix 5 extends from the dimer-dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). E113 is adjacent on the helix, and simulation results demonstrate that the localization of sodium here can transiently bridge interactions with E145 from the C-termini of both the same and contacting dimer within the capsomere. Interactions between helix 5 and E145 were not previously emphasized by experiment, as the flexible C-termini of Cp149 are not resolved in crystal structures. Specific sodium binding was also identified in the HIV-1 capsid, within the threefold interfaces between hexamers, and shown to bind the capsid structure with an affinity similar to that observed for HBV (ΔG = −1.8 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perilla and Schulten, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Chloride mediates intra-dimer interactions</title><p>While simulation results suggest that sodium is highly involved in HBV capsid function, chloride ions were observed to play but a single role based on occupancy maps, weakly mediating an intra-dimer contact.

Analysis of HBV capsid shape and essential dynamics identifies a common theme of subtle ellipsoidal distortion, which occurs even at equilibrium. Cryo-EM and biochemical studies indicate that mature HBV capsids (36 nm in diameter) can pass through the nuclear pore (39 nm in diameter) to become localized within the nuclear basket, even when associated with importin α/β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Panté and Kann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallucci and Kann, 2017</xref>). It may be that plasticity in overall capsid structure is necessary to facilitate its ability to maneuver through the relatively close-fit of the nuclear pore’s central channel. Indeed, coarse-grained MD simulations, combined with atomic force microscopy experiments, showed that mechanical deformation of the capsid was reversible up to 60% of its average radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkhipov et al., 2009</xref>), demonstrating the capsid’s ability to undergo moderate compression without structural failure. The capsid’s high permeability to water, owing to its large pores, may confer the ability to rapidly equilibrate water density across its surface upon mechanical deformation to prevent bursting.</p><p>Further, the maturation of HBV cores, which involves reverse transcription of pgRNA to dsDNA within the assembled capsid, has been associated with structural destabilization. This effect is believed to be due, at least in part, to mechanical strain imposed by the increased rigidity and organization of dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhason et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). Simulation results indicating that the capsid is highly flexible and capable of asymmetric distortion support speculations that it may flex or distort asymmetrically to accommodate the uneven distribution of internal pressure arising from genome maturation, in turn rendering the capsid metastable (i.e. spring-loaded) to facilitate uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhason et al., 2012</xref>). The ability of the capsid to filter negatively charged ionic species and translocate them at a relatively slow rate could serve to regulate the rate of reverse transcription, such that structural distortion to accommodate dsDNA is allowed to occur gradually.</p><p>A growing body of experimental evidence indicates that the capsid’s mechanical properties are essential to its biological function. Mutations in the Cp assembly domain, distant from the packaged pgRNA, result in a capsid that supports reverse transcription of only one strand of the viral genome, suggesting that capsid dynamics play an important role in genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). A novel treatment strategy for HBV may, thus, lie in the development of small-molecule drugs designed to increase capsid rigidity or otherwise limit the relative degrees of freedom of subunits, such that key dynamical properties are suppressed or any necessary asymmetric distortion becomes impossible. Recent work has shown that a class of HBV capsid-directed antiviral compounds not only modulate assembly, but also cause pre-formed capsids to become asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perilla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlicksup et al., 2018</xref>), underscoring the ability of drugs to alter capsid structure and further demonstrating the capsid’s readiness to undergo distortion in response to external stress.</p><p>Mechanical malleability of the HBV capsid has been attributed to relatively loose packing of its constituent Cp dimers compared to packing of other capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkhipov et al., 2009</xref>). The complex dynamics observed during simulation, as well as variability in collective motions across the capsid within single modes, may result from such loose subunit packing, relatively weak interaction energies between capsid subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceres and Zlotnick, 2002</xref>), and/or a relatively flat energy surface for different inter-subunit interactions, all of which can contribute to global flexibility and, thus, asymmetry. Moreover, structural diversity arising from capsid flexibility and asymmetry is likely critical to viral function. Conformational variations contribute to entropic stabilization of the capsid, which may be an important component of the hysteresis between assembly and disassembly reactions. Entropic mechanisms are now known to play an important role in allosteric regulation and protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hilser et al., 2012</xref>). Such transitions will further contribute to low-frequency structural events, including reverse transcription and conformational changes that the virus uses to surveil its environment, such as exposure of nuclear localization signals.</p><p>From a cryo-EM perspective, asymmetry in virus particles can be defined in terms of a distinct structural feature (such as a bound receptor), structural defects, or stochastic dynamical effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). There have been a number of asymmetric reconstructions of icosahedral viruses that treat asymmetry with respect to a structural feature, including HBV containing pgRNA and reverse transcriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), canine parvovirus bound to a single receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hafenstein et al., 2007</xref>), MS2 bound to a pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2013</xref>), and MS2 with genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). Asymmetry with respect to particle defects was explored in a recent analysis of Ross River virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The present work has enabled investigation of the effects of asymmetry driven by protein dynamics.</p><p>Density maps calculated for conformations sampled during simulation were averaged to yield a final map that incorporates structural heterogeneity and mimics the result of a single-particle image reconstruction. Despite the all-atom level of detail encompassed by simulation, capsid flexibility and asymmetry were sufficient to cause notable blurring of the final map, particularly when icosahedral averaging was applied. Resolution of the theoretical image reconstruction was 2.3 Å, while the best cryo-EM resolution achieved thus far for the HBV capsid is 3.5 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, the latter value contains errors resulting from experimental considerations that lower resolution, such as heterogeneity due to sample preparation, the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of imaged particles, error in particle alignment, inelastic scattering, incomplete sampling of particle orientations, and imperfections in the experimental hardware. Yet, in the absence of experimental error, simulation results indicate that thermal motion of particles makes large contributions to limiting the resolution of image reconstructions.</p><p>Single-particle image reconstructions depend on averaging together many image samples of what is presumably a single biomolecular conformation; however, simulation results indicate that icosahedral capsids can explore a massive ensemble of asymmetric conformations. Averaging over such an ensemble, even without imposing icosahedral symmetry, will force the result to appear as a single, blurry state. New 3D classification techniques can separate substantially different states, but the structural variation and diversity observed during simulation suggests a continuum of states, which will be difficult for image processing software to distinguish. Capsid dynamics may also lead to a large fraction of images being discarded due to particle heterogeneity. Thus, even in this era of increasing cryo-EM resolution, intrinsic capsid flexibility may represent a major limiting factor to achieving true atomic (1–2 Å) resolution. Symmetry relaxation methods may warrant greater consideration in future work.</p><p>Capsid dynamics occur within the context of the surrounding solution environment. Simulation results indicate that the capsid can induce changes in the properties of its environment, particularly with respect to the behavior of ions. Analysis of solvent exchange rates reveal that the capsid selectively filters ions based on charge and translocates sodium across its surface more rapidly than chloride. The ability of the capsid to differentiate ionic species and preferentially translocate those that are positively charged may play a role in facilitating the extrusion of the positively charged CTD tails through the capsid’s pores to expose them to the surface for cellular signaling. By the same logic, the addition of negative charges on the CTD tails by phosphorylation could serve to slow the rate of extrusion, accounting in part for the observation that Cp183 phosphorylation-mimic mutants show reduced rates of proteolytic cleavage, consistent with reduced exposure to the capsid exterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Selzer et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, based on its ion exchange preferences, the capsid could employ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation to modulate its own cellular signaling process.</p><p>Ion occupancy maps indicate that the translocation of sodium ions primarily occurs through the triangular pores located on either side of CD dimers, suggesting that these apertures may also represent the gateways of CTD tail extrusion. Cryo-EM studies have implicated the capsid hexamers as the sites of extrusion based on structural observation of a protein kinase within the hexameric valleys of the capsid exterior, presumably bound there to CTD tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). These separate findings are not mutually exclusive. Hexameric valleys are each surrounded by six triangular pores, and as the largest valleys between capsid spikes, they may represent the most accessible location along the surface for close approach of a kinase for CTD tail binding. Further, the triangular pores are the largest surface apertures, and are, thus, best able to accommodate translocation of the peptide chains that comprise CTD tails. The swaying motion of capsid spikes identified by simulation could function to guide CTD tails extruded through triangular pores to their neighboring hexameric valleys for interaction with kinases for phosphorylation. Enhanced flexibility of CD dimer spikes relative to AB dimer spikes could bias the movement of CTD tails to hexameric valleys rather than pentameric valleys, which may be too spatially restrictive to accommodate kinase approach.</p><p>If the capsid’s triangular pores are indeed the location of CTD extrusion and therefore play a critical role in cellular signaling, a novel treatment strategy for HBV may lie in the development of a peptide designed to block the pore to prevent extrusion and inhibit signaling. Recent work on the HIV-1 capsid demonstrated the tractability of pores as drug targets, describing a channel inhibitor that blocks the pores to prevent nucleotide translocation into the capsid and, thereby, suppresses reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>). Pore-blocking drugs could also serve to inhibit reverse transcription in the HBV capsid.</p><p>Strong localization of sodium ions observed within the capsid’s triangular pores appears to enhance dimer-dimer interaction in regions of high negative charge. Positively charged metal ions have been shown experimentally to increase the rate of capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceres and Zlotnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2005</xref>), possibly through specific binding to Cp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceres and Zlotnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stray et al., 2004</xref>). Zinc and nickel have been shown to accelerate assembly at much lower concentrations than monovalent cations and are hypothesized to function by binding Cp dimers and inducing them to adopt an assembly active conformation; a putative binding site for zinc ions has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stray et al., 2004</xref>). However, simulation does not identify sodium localization within the zinc binding site. Importantly, zinc and nickel are transition metals capable of forming coordination spheres, while sodium is an alkali metal whose ionic interactions are governed primarily by electrostatics. As kinetic enhancement by divalent transition metals is conferred at lower concentrations than other divalent ions that lack coordination ability, such as calcium and magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stray et al., 2004</xref>), it is likely that the mechanism by which zinc and nickel accelerate assembly acts in addition to that of sodium or other non-transition metals.</p><p>Simulation results suggest that sodium reduces electrostatic repulsion within the triangular pores where three dimers pack together to form a trimer of dimers. Importantly, a trimer of dimers is implicated as the nucleation core for HBV capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zlotnick et al., 1999</xref>), and electrostatic stabilization of this critical substructure may represent a mechanism by which positively charged metal ions enhance assembly kinetics. Such an effect is consistent with calculations suggesting that ionic strength promotes HBV capsid assembly by globally screening electrostatic repulsion between dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kegel and Schoot Pv, 2004</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chemical-physical characterization of the hepatitis B virus capsid by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: William Gelbart (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision. Major revisions are required in order to make this work potentially acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>. A final decision will be made once we receive your revisions.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors use unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structural dynamics of the icosahedral HBV capsid. This study extends both time sampling and level of detail for previous work at the coarse-grained level for the same system, and shows insights into the function of the capsid. In addition, they show that capsid dynamics limits achievable resolution in cryoEM data processing for this system.</p><p>Overall, in its current form, the paper reads like a long description of the simulation and its analyses, and the reader may miss the exciting bits along the way, especially if they are not experts in molecular dynamics simulations. The paper should be rearranged to present from the get go the most exciting findings. Even the title and Abstract fail to do so currently. The Results sections should have meaningful section titles announcing the main finding to be expected (not just a narration of the analysis and figures). The separation between the Results section and the Discussion renders the former very dry. I suggest that the main findings and their contextualization with other data is included in the Results, with a shorter Discussion section.</p><p>Moreover, the authors should relate their results in more detail to previous findings, and to elaborate on the idea of suggesting treatment for disease. A couple of specific testable predictions would be very useful.</p><p>Below are more specific major concerns about the work and the presentation of the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What are the biological / biochemical / biophysical implications for the capsid hexamers to be more flexible than pentamers? (Subsection “Capsid flexibility and dynamics”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>2) The determination of larger-scale collective modes still appears to be challenging for this system. The authors present a normal mode analysis in Figure 5, but as they state in the Discussion, the results are difficult to interpret. Have the authors considered a principal component analysis of the capsid dynamics? This could bring to light similar motions but with more clarity.</p><p>3) The exchange rates for the water molecules (subsection “Solvent exchange across the capsid”) of 4.7x10^6 / ns seem extremely high. Do these rates imply that there are a lot of water molecules moving in/out per nanosecond? Are these waters bouncing back and forth? How does this compare to other viruses (or to bulk water, if one was to define a surface)? The rates for the sodium ions are more reasonable. The authors should also show the channels or paths through which the water molecules flow. Are there channels that lead water molecules in, and others out? Or is the exchange happening both ways in a single channel? It could be interesting to know more of the detailed structure on what is happening with this process. This is something interesting that can only be seen or suggested based on their heroic calculations.</p><p>4) Regarding the ion location around the capsid, Figure 7A is not really clear enough to see the positioning of Asp78 and Glu77; could this be improved? Also, I do not understand the delta<italic>G</italic> values presented along each panel in Figure 7. What are these values exactly? Is it the density / location of sodium ions at different delta-<italic>G</italic> cutoffs? More details should be given here.</p><p>5) It is questionable if molecular simulation / free energy calculations would yield meaningful delta-delta<italic>G</italic>'s even, for a range so small (within 1 kcal / mol over the set of 4 panels). Perhaps the authors could remove some of the cutoff analysis and instead focus on rationalizing the mechanism of action for the CpAM's (allosteric modulators), which somehow appear to be interacting with or modulated by the ion binding locations.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Capsid flexibility and dynamics”, the authors refer to promoter chains C and D, but this is not introduced until Figure 3 (although they refer her only to Figure 2).</p><p>7) In Figure 3, it seems like the color scheme of the angles is related to the symmetry points, which is not the case. Also, the plots are a deviation from the angle, so they should be labeled deltaϴ.</p><p>8) Figure 4 seems to cover only (the last?) 1us of simulation (but says it's 1.1us). It is not evident at all to me that panels B and C show more symmetry breaking than others, e.g., why is C more dramatic than E?</p><p>9) In Figure 8—figure supplement 1, the authors should specify a little better what was done. The sentence: “Two average maps (…) were rendered to 1 ̊A resolution, with a pixel size of 0.25 ̊A.” Does this mean that they were low-pass filtered to 1 A (this would be better wording than &quot;rendered to 1A&quot;) but then the correlation between the two maps was only 2.3? In that figure, the actual values of the FSC at 0.143 should be indicated for all curves (in A). Given the modes are not correlated, why would the authors think local resolution would be a valuable metric to use? Also, for panel D, it seems that they altered the sampling rate (pixel size), so two things are changing here, but no comment is done on either of them (whether there were expectations, etc.).</p><p>Essential revisions of the presentation:</p><p>10) Please simplify the rather extensive analysis into more digestible findings. Some figures could be moved to Supplementary Information (e.g. Figure 3) to help focus the big take-home messages. Along the same lines, Figure 1A should have a scale bar and the authors should discuss in the introduction how many MDa and/or atoms are in the system to quickly characterize the size of the capsid for those less familiar.</p><p>11) The findings relating to cryo-EM are interesting, they probably should not be the main message of the paper. In this part of their analysis, the authors should emphasize that in this new era of increasing resolution in cryo-EM, capsid flexibility might become the rate-limiting factor to achieving true atomic (1-2 A) resolution, and propose that symmetry relaxation methods are attempted.</p><p>12) While some references are cited (e.g., Tama and Brooks, May and Brooks), it would be helpful to have some discussion in the text of theoretical work that has been done on the collective (e.g., normal mode) motions of viral capsids and the extent to which the present all-atom simulations confirm and extend these earlier analyses.</p><p>13) There appear to be no references to recent work being done on asymmetric reconstructions of viral capsids [see, for example, the work on bacteriophage MS2: X. Dai, Z. Li, M. Lai, S. Shu, Y. Du, Z.H. Zhou and R. Sun. In situ structures of the genome and genome-delivery apparatus in a single-stranded RNA virus. Nature, 541 (7635), 112-116 (2017)]. It would be helpful to call the reader's attention to the fact that cryo-EM reconstructions of this kind have been carried out in which icosahedral symmetry is not assumed/imposed. Indeed, this new work is what makes the present manuscript even more interesting, and vice versa.</p><p>14) The title should capture the big discovery presented in the paper, to help funnel the readers to the findings and conclusions. It might be helpful to include explicit mention of the importance of dynamics and asymmetry. E.g., &quot;Chemical-physical characterization of dynamics and asymmetry in the hepatitis B virus capsid, as determined by all -atom molecular dynamics simulations&quot;, or just &quot;Dynamics and asymmetry in the hepatitis B virus capsid, as determined by all -atom molecular dynamics simulations&quot;.</p><p>Optional revision:</p><p>15) PCA analysis on the asymmetric unit or a subset of the entire system should be performed. Such an analysis may reveal clearer modes that could then be used as reduced variables back into the large simulation to find simpler motion correlations. For instance, perhaps showing the motions of the virus only as related to the previously suggested motions (expansion, twisting of Cps, etc.) and showing that they are not occurring (or at least not alone) may be informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32478.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors use unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structural dynamics of the icosahedral HBV capsid.

The Results sections now open with headings that describe the major findings and present from the get-go the important outcomes from analyses.

We have now included additional discussion in each section relating our results to previously reported data characterizing capsid dynamics and capsid influence on solvent environment, particularly from other MD simulation studies. We have suggested insights into biological function of the capsid based on our results, and elaborated on treatments that could be designed to inhibit these functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are more specific major concerns about the work and the presentation of the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What are the biological / biochemical / biophysical implications for the capsid hexamers to be more flexible than pentamers? (Subsection “Capsid flexibility and dynamics”, fourth paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to relate all observations to biological function to extract the most meaning from our results. On this point, we have endeavored to be more specific. Increased flexibility of hexamers actually stems from increased flexibility of CD dimers, particularly in the spike tip. We have created a separate Results section that includes additional analyses to elaborate on dimer spike flexibility and how it is altered by quasi-equivalence. We have included new comments in the manuscript describing our thoughts on this finding, as well as a hypothesis for how spike flexibility, particularly the flexibility of CD dimer spikes, could play a role in the capsid’s cellular signaling process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The determination of larger-scale collective modes still appears to be challenging for this system. The authors present a normal mode analysis in Figure 5, but as they state in the Discussion, the results are difficult to interpret.

This could bring to light similar motions but with more clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their great suggestion and for bringing to light our failure to describe the approach clearly in the text. The analysis presented in the original version of the manuscript was not normal modes analysis, but was already principal component analysis. We have re-written the section to clarify our approach and included more discussion regarding the observation of asymmetry in previous studies of icosahedral capsids. The manuscript now includes commentary regarding the possibility that the symmetric features of HBV capsid modes may be more pronounced once more extensive conformational sampling of the capsid is available. Given the difficulty in interpreting the results of this section, we only draw conclusions based on global capsid motions apparent in the lowest frequency modes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The exchange rates for the water molecules (subsection “Solvent exchange across the capsid”) of 4.7x10^6 / ns seem extremely high. Do these rates imply that there are a lot of water molecules moving in/out per nanosecond? Are these waters bouncing back and forth?

This is something interesting that can only be seen or suggested based on their heroic calculations.</p></disp-quote><p>We are extremely grateful to the reviewers for catching our mistake. The exchange rates for water should be on the order of 10^3, not 10^6, and we have corrected this typo. The reviewers are correct in understanding that these are the numbers of waters moving in and out of the capsid per nanosecond (4.7x10^3 water molecules moving in per nanosecond and 4.7x10^3 waters moving out per nanosecond).</p><p>As we have now made clear in the text, the solvent exchange analysis represents the transition of water molecules from bulk solvent inside to bulk solvent outside the capsid and vice versa. Boundary waters close to the protein surface are neglected, so the water molecules included in the reported exchange rates are not simply bouncing back and forth. We have added comments in the manuscript noting that solvent exchange across the capsid surface occurs both inward and outward through all pore types.</p><p>We have augmented the discussion of these exchange rates with comparisons to solvent exchange rates measured for other virus capsids (HIV-1, PCV2, and poliovirus), and have performed an additional analysis to compare our solvent exchange rates to that of bulk water crossing a spherical surface – we thank the reviewers for this great suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the ion location around the capsid, Figure 7A is not really clear enough to see the positioning of Asp78 and Glu77; could this be improved? Also, I do not understand the deltaG values presented along each panel in Figure 7. What are these values exactly? Is it the density / location of sodium ions at different deltaG cutoffs? More details should be given here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for guiding us in improving the clarity of our Results presentation. We have doubled the size of the indicated figure panel so that sodium localization around spike tips is more visible. With regard to deltaG values, we have provided additional explanation in the text describing how potentials of mean force for free energy of binding can be calculated from occupancy maps. The mathematical procedure we use is also detailed in Materials and methods, and readers are referred to a reference for further information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is questionable if molecular simulation / free energy calculations would yield meaningful delta-deltaG's even, for a range so small (within 1 kcal / mol over the set of 4 panels).

We have eliminated focus on deltaG cutoff analysis and removed a non-essential figure panel from the ion occupancy discussion that contributed to its emphasis. We have also removed indication of CpAM binding sites in the figure illustrating sodium binding, as upon further consideration, it was very misleading. The sodium binding sites are not close enough to the CpAM binding sites to cause us to suspect that they interact at all, although the orientation of the original figure could suggest this. We have altogether removed mention of CpAMs in this section so that the Results presentation remains focused and clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Capsid flexibility and dynamics”, the authors refer to promoter chains C and D, but this is not introduced until Figure 3 (although they refer her only to Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for pointing out our oversight. We have rearranged the Results presentation and the order of figures in the manuscript so that this problem no longer persists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3, it seems like the color scheme of the angles is related to the symmetry points, which is not the case. Also, the plots are a deviation from the angle, so they should be labeled deltaϴ.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their keen observations. We have corrected both issues pointed out for this figure, reduced its complexity, and moved it to the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4 seems to cover only (the last?) 1us of simulation (but says it's 1.1us). It is not evident at all to me that panels B and C show more symmetry breaking than others, e.g., why is C more dramatic than E?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for reading our manuscript so carefully. We have addressed the reported issue with the figure legend. Also, we agree with the reviewers that all figure panels show significant symmetry breaking, and we have thus removed unnecessary emphasis on specific panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 8—figure supplement 1, the authors should specify a little better what was done. The sentence: “Two average maps (…) were rendered to 1 ̊A resolution, with a pixel size of 0.25 ̊A.” Does this mean that they were low-pass filtered to 1 A (this would be better wording than &quot;rendered to 1A&quot;) but then the correlation between the two maps was only 2.3? In that figure, the actual values of the FSC at 0.143 should be indicated for all curves (in A). Given the modes are not correlated, why would the authors think local resolution would be a valuable metric to use? Also, for panel D, it seems that they altered the sampling rate (pixel size), so two things are changing here, but no comment is done on either of them (whether there were expectations, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers again for guiding us in improving the clarity of our manuscript. We have re-written this figure legend, as well as revised the explanation of our approach in the text. Instead of describing maps as being rendered at a certain resolution, we provide a more accurate description: “For density map calculation, the individual atoms were treated as Gaussian density distributions with a width (i.e. diameter) of 1 Å at half maximal density.” We have also now indicated the values of the FSC curves at 0.143 in figure panel A, and repeated the analysis from panel D without the variable of pixel size, now eliminating the need for panel D to demonstrate that altering pixel size has no effect).</p><p>We apologize to the reviewers if the motivation for local resolution analysis was unclear. Local resolution provides information regarding structural order or relative atomic ﬂuctuation of protein residues. The averaging of density maps calculated from simulated capsid conformations causes resolution to blur, and local resolution analysis relates this blurring to the local motions of protein residues. Resolution analysis is unconcerned with correlated motions within capsid dynamics and is, thus, unrelated to modes from principal component analysis. We determined local resolution from calculated density maps in order to draw comparisons to other measurements of local protein fluctuation, such as crystallographic B-factors and Calpha RMSF determined from MD simulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions of the presentation:</p><p>10) Please simplify the rather extensive analysis into more digestible findings. Some figures could be moved to Supplementary Information (e.g. Figure 3) to help focus the big take-home messages. Along the same lines, Figure 1A should have a scale bar and the authors should discuss in the introduction how many MDa and/or atoms are in the system to quickly characterize the size of the capsid for those less familiar.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewers for guiding us to improve the presentation of our work, and for giving us the chance to significantly revise the manuscript. The original manuscript has now been completely re-written. The Results sections now open with headings describing the main findings and the technical nature of the text has been reduced. The manuscript now focuses on presenting discoveries instead of descriptions. We have taken the reviewers’ advice and moved the original Figure 3 to supplement and added a scale bar to Figure 1A. Both MDa and number of atoms of the system are now clearly indicated early in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The findings relating to cryo-EM are interesting, they probably should not be the main message of the paper. In this part of their analysis, the authors should emphasize that in this new era of increasing resolution in cryo-EM, capsid flexibility might become the rate-limiting factor to achieving true atomic (1-2 A) resolution, and propose that symmetry relaxation methods are attempted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments, but feel our findings related to cryo-EM resolution are an important message in the manuscript. An investigation of the role of protein flexibility in limiting cryo-EM resolution is highly relevant to the structural biology field, and comes at a critical time as cryo-EM resolution continues to improve. Our analysis strongly suggests that, regardless of further advances in cryo-EM, achievable resolution will eventually hit a wall due to protein flexibility. We have taken the reviewers’ advice and emphasized in the text that flexibility may become a major limiting factor to achieving true atomic resolution, as well as proposed, in light of our findings regarding asymmetry in the capsid, that symmetry relaxation methods may warrant greater consideration in future structural studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) While some references are cited (e.g., Tama and Brooks, May and Brooks), it would be helpful to have some discussion in the text of theoretical work that has been done on the collective (e.g., normal mode) motions of viral capsids and the extent to which the present all-atom simulations confirm and extend these earlier analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their great suggestion to improve the manuscript. We have augmented the principal component analysis section with more extensive discussion of previous work that applied normal modes analysis to icosahedral capsids. While the modes from our study proved difficult to interpret, we have nevertheless provided some comparison to previously computed normal modes for the HBV capsid. Also, we have added discussion regarding the observation of asymmetry in previous normal modes work on icosahedral capsids, as well as the supposed role of such modes in structural transitions important to function, which likely indicates that the asymmetry we observe in our modes is not unreasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) There appear to be no references to recent work being done on asymmetric reconstructions of viral capsids [see, for example, the work on bacteriophage MS2: X. Dai, Z. Li, M. Lai, S. Shu, Y. Du, Z.H. Zhou and R. Sun. In situ structures of the genome and genome-delivery apparatus in a single-stranded RNA virus. Nature, 541 (7635), 112-116 (2017)]. It would be helpful to call the reader's attention to the fact that cryo-EM reconstructions of this kind have been carried out in which icosahedral symmetry is not assumed/imposed. Indeed, this new work is what makes the present manuscript even more interesting, and vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for another great suggestion. We have added a short discussion of these and other asymmetric reconstructions available in the literature and contextualized our theoretical image reconstruction within the framework of these previous experimental works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The title should capture the big discovery presented in the paper, to help funnel the readers to the findings and conclusions. It might be helpful to include explicit mention of the importance of dynamics and asymmetry. E.g., &quot;Chemical-physical characterization of dynamics and asymmetry in the hepatitis B virus capsid, as determined by all -atom molecular dynamics simulations&quot;, or just &quot;Dynamics and asymmetry in the hepatitis B virus capsid, as determined by all -atom molecular dynamics simulations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for guiding us to select a title that funnels readers to our work. The manuscript title now encompasses the discoveries presented in the paper: “All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the hepatitis virus capsid reveal insights into biological function and cryo-EM resolution limits.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
