territories. The molecular composition of the archaellum and of the motor that drives it appears to be entirely distinct from that of the functionally equivalent bacterial flagellum and flagellar motor. Yet, the structure of the archaellum machinery is scarcely known. Using combined modes of electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM), we have solved the structure of the <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> archaellum filament at 4.2 Å resolution and visualise the architecture and organisation of its motor complex <italic>in situ</italic>. This allows us to build a structural model combining the archaellum and its motor complex, paving the way to a molecular understanding of archaeal swimming motion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27470.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27470.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>Pyrococcus furiosus</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-microscopy</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-tomography</kwd><kwd>helical reconstruction</kwd><kwd>archaellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>research funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daum</surname><given-names>Bertram</given-names></name><name><surname>Vonck</surname><given-names>Janet</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000737</institution-id><institution>University of Exeter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellow Starting Grant and open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daum</surname><given-names>Bertram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005626</institution-id><institution>Universität Regensburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>research funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellack</surname><given-names>Annett</given-names></name><name><surname>Reichelt</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Rachel</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Archaellum Project ID: 311523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chaudhury</surname><given-names>Paushali</given-names></name><name><surname>Albers</surname><given-names>Sonja-Verena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using both electron cryo-tomography and helical reconstruction, the first structure of the entire archaellum machinery with an assembled filament has been determined, providing the structural basis for our understanding of archaeal motility.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Archaea are ubiquitous microorganisms that thrive in diverse habitats around the globe, ranging from extreme environments, such as boiling hot springs, salt lakes or marine hyperthermal vents to ambient environments, such as fresh water springs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perras et al., 2014</xref>) and the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lurie-Weinberger and Gophna, 2015</xref>). While extremophilic Archaea are of great interest for biotechnology, Archaea that are part of the microbiome of the human digestive system have been implicated in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mbakwa et al., 2015</xref>). Fundamental to their prolific diversification is the capability of archaeal cells to move through liquid media. In the course of evolution, Archaea have developed their own locomotion machinery called the archaellum, which is distinct from bacterial and eukaryotic flagella in terms of molecular composition and mode of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whilst eukaryotic and bacterial flagella have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krüger and Engstler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeRosier, 2006</xref>), less is known about the architecture and assembly of their archaeal counterparts. In the past decade, biochemical investigation and conventional negative-stain electron microscopy have established that the archaellum consists of a helical array of multiple copies of 1–5 archaellins with N-terminal sequence homology to bacterial type 4 pili (T4P)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pohlschroder et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to bacterial flagella, recent cryoEM data have shown that archaella are not hollow, indicating that they have to be assembled at their base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poweleit et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown for the Archaeon <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> that swimming motion is driven by ATP hydrolysis instead of ion fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Streif et al., 2008</xref>) and single-molecule studies have recently demonstrated that archaella rotate in a stepwise manner reminiscent of torque-generating ATP synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kinosita et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A multi-protein motor complex located in the cell envelope and powered by ATP hydrolysis drives assembly and rotation of the of the FlaA/FlaB filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>). Biochemistry and bioinformatics suggest that the core of this complex is formed by the AAA motor ATPase FlaI, a putative regulator FlaH, a membrane-bound platform protein FlaJ and the periplasmic FlaG, and FlaF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>). In Crenarchaeota, FlaH is surrounded by a larger ring of FlaX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>), which are absent in Euryarchaeota. Instead, Euryarchaeota encode the additional cytosolic proteins FlaC and FlaD/E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Näther-Schindler et al., 2014</xref>), which in <italic>H. salinarum</italic> interact with chemoreceptors via adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlesner et al., 2009</xref>). Whilst the X-ray structure of individual subunits from <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> FlaF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>), FlaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>) and FlaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>) have been solved, the arrangement of the assembled motor complex is unknown.</p><p><italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> is a hyperthermophilic Euryarchaeon that has been isolated from volcanic marine sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiala and Stetter, 1986</xref>). Its genome has been fully sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robb et al., 2001</xref>) and various tools for genetic manipulation are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kreuzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waege et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipscomb et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>P. furiosus</italic> is therefore of great interest for basic and applied research and widely used as archaeal model organism. <italic>P. furiosus</italic> is highly motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herzog and Wirth, 2012</xref>), grows at an optimum temperature of 95–100°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiala and Stetter, 1986</xref>) and assembles numerous archaella on the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiala and Stetter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Näther et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>P. furiosus</italic> wild type strains, the fla operon encodes for the three archaellins FlaB<sub>0</sub>, FlaB<sub>1</sub> and FlaB<sub>2</sub>, of which FlaB<sub>0</sub> is by far the most abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Näther-Schindler et al., 2014</xref>). At present it is not clear whether the three proteins can all be part of the same archaellum or if each forms distinct filaments of their own. Electron microscopy of freeze-fracture replica and scanning electron micrographs of cells grown on a variety of solid supports showed that <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaella establish surface contacts as well as cable-like cell-cell connections, suggesting that they also function in surface attachment, intercellular communication and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Näther et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We used electron cryo-tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, single-particle cryoEM and helical reconstruction to obtain an <italic>in situ</italic> map of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellar motor complex and a near-atomic resolution structure of its archaellum. In combination, our results provide a first model of the architecture of the archaellar locomotion machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electron cryo-tomography of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic></title><p>Initial cryoEM showed that <italic>P. furiosus</italic> cells grown in rich medium, measure ~1–2 μm across (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) and are thus too thick and too dense for electron cryo-tomography. By cultivating <italic>P. furiosus</italic> on minimal SME pyruvate medium, the cell size was reduced to 500–1000 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Tomograms of these cells revealed details of their morphology and interior. In roughly 80% of the cells, a bundle of up to 50 archaella protrudes from a bulge at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). On the EM grid, cells occur individually or in pairs in a range of division states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Interestingly, cell division of <italic>P. furiosus</italic> initially manifests itself in the formation of two indentations at opposite cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Subsequently, one of the two indentations develops into a deep cleft that finally spans the entire cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Towards the end of cell division, the two daughter cells are connected by a narrow cytosolic bridge, which is surrounded by both a plasma membrane and an S-layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The presence of archaella in <italic>P. furiosus</italic> seems to depend on the division state. Whilst 86% of non-dividing cells exhibit archaella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), this is the case for only ~54% of dividing cells, of which one or both show an archaellar bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Each filament crosses the S-layer and spans the ~34 nm periplasmic gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2017</xref>), the archaella traverse the periplasm at variable angles of 60–90° between the filament axis and the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The polar cap has a thickness of ~3 nm, a variable diameter of 200–600 nm and typically straight edges. The edges end in the cytoplasm and are not continuous with the plasma membrane. In its centre, the polar cap is often kinked into a sharp ridge (Figure 4A).

Although the central motor complex is well resolved, both the filament and the regular S-layer structure were averaged out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This indicates that the filament and motor assembly are not structurally aligned with the S-layer, consistent with the variable angle at which the archaellum crosses the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Whilst some periplasmic densities proximal to the membrane were resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), it is not clear if they correspond to an assembly of FlaF or vestiges of the flexible filament.

These gaps are evidently too narrow to accommodate the ~11 nm filament, indicating that the S-layer itself does not form a specific guiding scaffold for the archaellum and suggesting that individual S-layer subunits would need to be locally disassembled for the archaellum to pass through. Comparing the S-layer structure to the filament width in silico, we found that removal of a single S-layer subunit would generate sufficient space for the archaellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Symmetry breaks and gaps are common in S-layers, as they enable them to form closed cages around cells and are essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pum et al., 1991</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the S-layer lattice is locally dissolved to provide sufficient space for the growing archaellum filament is still unknown and awaits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Location of motor subunits</title><p>Previous work has established that the central core of the archaeal motor assembly consists of a complex of the membrane-integral platform protein FlaJ and the soluble, cytosolic ATPase FlaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>). FlaJ is almost completely buried in the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the high apparent contrast of lipid bilayers in tomograms at high defocus, it was invisible in our average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, a superposition of the X-ray structure of the highly conserved <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> FlaI (<italic>Sac</italic>FlaI; PDB-4IHQ) with the membrane-proximal cytosolic part of the sub-tomogram average places the X-ray structure into a density that closely matches its outline. Docking <italic>Sac</italic>FlaI into this position also places the six N-terminal domains of FlaI into the six bridging densities between the central complex and the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>). This is in good agreement with the current working model of the motor complex, which suggests that these domains act as binding sites for FlaJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>According to recently published in vitro binding experiments, FlaI also interacts with FlaH that most likely forms hexameric rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>). We thus generated a 6-fold symmetric model of the homologous <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> FlaH (<italic>Sac</italic>FlaH; PDB-4YDS) and docked it directly adjacent to <italic>Sac</italic>FlaI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). This superimposes <italic>Sac</italic>FlaH with a second rounded density that has the dimensions of the hexamer. The resulting model of the FlaI-FlaH complex suggests that FlaH binds as a ring on the cytosolic face of FlaI, in line with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>After docking FlaI and FlaH into our sub-tomogram averaging map, a large portion of the motor average remains unassigned, especially in its ring region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). These densities are most likely occupied by the remaining cytosolic subunits FlaC and FlaD/E encoded in the <italic>P. furiosus fla</italic>-operon.

The structure of the FlaB<sub>0</sub> monomer consists of an N-terminal α-helix of 47 amino acids (A6 – A52). The first 25 amino acids of the helix (A6 – I30) are hydrophobic, whereas the second half (Q31 – A52) contains predominantly polar residues and is therefore highly hydrophilic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The TMHMM server predicts most of the hydrophobic sections (V7-L29) as trans-membrane, and the subsequent hydrophilic part of the polypeptide as outward-facing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that in the monomeric, extra-filamentous form of FlaB<sub>0</sub>, V7-L29 may act as a transmembrane helix, while the remaining domains protrude into the periplasm.

The apolar N-terminal α-helix section establishes hydrophobic interactions with six of its neighbours. The resulting α-helix bundle is buried inside the filament and forms its backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). As the α-helices are arranged at an angle of ~15° to the long axis of the archaellum, their hydrophilic C-terminal sections are close to the periphery, where they contact neighbouring α-helices and β-strands via hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). In the outer sheath of the archaellum, each β-barrel interacts with six surrounding neighbours, mainly by hydrophilic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). Similar to bacterial T4P-like filaments, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giltner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelicic, 2008</xref>), the amphipathic character of FlaB<sub>0</sub> would provide the driving force for filament assembly, in which hydrophobic domains are buried in the centre and hydrophilic surfaces exposed to the surrounding medium.

Analysis of the FlaB<sub>0</sub> sequence revealed that these five amino acids were all within a N-X-S/T sequon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), a highly conserved consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the remaining asparagine residues were not part of such a sequon and did not show a similar density nearby. Furthermore, no such densities were observed adjacent to serine, threonine, proline or lysine sidechains, suggesting that O-linked glycosylation is not present in the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum. Due to the flexibility of glycan chains, only the densities of the first one or two sugar subunits were present in our map. The <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites are evenly distributed over the exposed part of the iFlaB<sub>0</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), thus creating a homogeneous, highly glycosylated surface that covers the entire filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).</p><p>The universal sequence of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> N-glycan has been determined previously by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujinami et al., 2014</xref>).

This glycosylation pattern differs considerably from the one shown for the archaellum of <italic>M. hungatei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poweleit et al., 2016</xref>), which harbours six O-glycosylation sites and two N-glycosylated residues.

This ring was not observed in averages of the archaellar motor complex of <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2017</xref>), which may either be due to species-dependent structural differences of motor components or the smaller number of particles used for the <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> average. In the periplasm, the filament is thought to be coordinated by FlaF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>). As no densities spanning the entire periplasm are seen in our sub-tomogram average of the motor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we suggest that FlaF does not form a continuous conduit that connects the membrane and the outer canopy of the S-layer. Instead, this protein may coordinate the archaellum near the membrane, while the main periplasmic part of the filament is flexibly integrated into the S-layer.</p><p>The archaellar motors are juxtaposed to the polar cap, which in <italic>P. furiosus</italic> is only present in combination with an archaellar bundle. This confirms earlier findings in <italic>H. salinarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kupper et al., 1994</xref>) and <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2017</xref>), which also showed co-localisation of archaella and polar cap. This striking co-localisation indicates that archaella and polar cap are co-regulated and suggests a strong functional connection. It is conceivable that the polar cap functions in concentrating archaella at one cell pole and acts as an anchor to fix the motor complexes in the bilayer to prevent futile rotation. In addition, the polar cap may also prevent the mechanical disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by the rapid rotation of multiple archaella.</p><p>The straight sides and tightly bent edges of the polar cap are reminiscent of virus-associated pyramids, the exotic egress structures produced by <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>-specific viruses upon infection of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daum et al., 2014</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that the polar cap is composed of protein, rather than lipid. In addition, the polar cap is associated with protein complexes that form hexameric protein arrays. While the identity of these complexes is unknown, their localisation next to the archaellar motors suggests that they may be mechanistically linked to motor function. Many bacteria employ chemoreceptors to sense metabolic gradients and control the direction of swimming motion. These chemoreceptors are typically arranged in hexagonal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) and closely associated with flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). In Euryarchaeota, genes homologous to bacterial chemoreceptors have been annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlesner et al., 2009</xref>) and chemosensory arrays that are structurally similar to their bacterial counterparts have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briegel et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be investigated if the hexagonal protein arrays found in this study represent an unknown <italic>Pyrococcus</italic>-specific type of chemoreceptor or some other protein linked to motility. Our observations support the hypothesis that the polar cap does not only function as an anchor for the archaellum, but also as a platform that recruits protein complexes that control swimming motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum lacks a central channel, consistent with the archaellum of <italic>M. hungatei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poweleit et al., 2016</xref>) and the <italic>I. hospitalis Iho</italic>670 filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2016</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>. This supports the hypothesis that archaella and other archaeal filaments assemble from their base, in marked contrast to the assembly of bacterial flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The first steps of archaellum assembly comprise N- or O-glycosylation and removal of the positively charged N-terminal MAKKG signal peptide from membrane-bound FlaB<sub>0</sub> monomers. Loss of these positive charges primes the individual archaellins for transfer from the lipid bilayer into the growing filament, aided by the membrane protein FlaJ. This process is driven by the amphipathic surface of the individual archaellins and catalysed by ATP hydrolysis through FlaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Streif et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reindl et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>M. hungatei</italic> filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poweleit et al., 2016</xref>), no O-linked glycosylation was found in <italic>P. furiosus</italic>, indicating that this glycosylation pathway is not present in this organism.</p><p>The extensive glycan cover of the archaellum filaments likely increases their stability. All but one of the glycosylation sites are situated near the binding interface of adjacent FlaB<sub>0</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that N-linked glycans may enhance filament integrity by additional hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lis and Sharon, 1993</xref>). Indeed, deletion mutants of different archaeal species lacking important proteins involved in glycosylation pathways are defective in archaellum formation and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>). A high degree of surface protein N-glycosylation has been suggested to be a protection mechanism against heat in the case of (hyper-) thermophiles, or against high pH and salt concentrations in other archaeal extremophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarrell et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, glycosylation of proteins may convey adhesive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lis and Sharon, 1993</xref>), resulting in the surface-binding capability of archaella previously observed for adherent <italic>P. furiosus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Näther et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, surface glycans also provide strain-specific recognition signatures for cell-cell interactions, in which archaella seem to play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Näther et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In its substance, our model of the archaellum and its motor complex will be universal to all motile Archaea, as the core of the archaellum machinery (FlaA/B, FlaF, FlaG, FlaH, FlaI and FlaJ) is conserved throughout crenarchaeal, euryarchaeal and thaumarchaeal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Jarrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhury et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, it can be expected that the cytosolic ring will be different in Crenarchaea, which lack genes encoding for FlaC D/E but possess the ring-forming protein FlaX instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, together with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kupper et al., 1994</xref>) our data suggest that the polar cap is a unique hallmark of Euryarchaea.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolutionary aspects</title><p>Archaeal filament proteins such as the archaellins <italic>Pfu</italic>FlaB<sub>0</sub> and <italic>Mhu</italic>FlaB<sub>3</sub>, as well as the adhesive protein <italic>Iho</italic>670 share many characteristics with T4 pilins. These characteristics include their overall lollipop-like shape, their amphipathic surfaces and the way they are processed and assembled into a filament. On the sequence level, archaellins and T4 pilins are highly conserved in their N-terminal helix and unconserved in their globular, β-strand-rich domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poweleit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giltner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelicic, 2008</xref>). It is likely that the N-terminal helix domain remained largely unaltered throughout evolution, as it is the essential backbone-forming domain in T4P and archaella. In contrast, the surface-exposed globular domain is less crucial for filament integrity and could therefore diversify into a versatile and strain-specific interaction interface that adapted to various functions and environments. An extreme example of this diversification are the class III signal peptide-containing sugar binding proteins of the bindosome of <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zolghadr et al., 2007)</xref>.</p><p>The ubiquity and conservation of the archaellin/T4 pilin (A/T) blueprint highlights its evolutionary success as an exquisite building block for stable, yet flexible and versatile filaments. The presence of this blueprint in Archaea and Bacteria also raises the intriguing hypothesis that a common A/T-like progenitor protein and filament existed in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), before these two domains of life diverged more than 3 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Makarova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>). Although it is unknown if these primordial filaments were used for rotary propulsion, it has been proposed that pseudopili of T2SS, an evolutionary relative of the archaellar motor, assemble in a rotary ‘spool-like’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nivaskumar et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the ability to gyrate is a general trait of T2SS as well as A/T-like assembly systems. Thus, Archaea appear to have developed the A/T progenitor filament and machinery further into the archaellum, a structurally simple, yet powerful propulsion device. Bacteria on the other hand, have developed this ancestral fibre into T4P, molecular devices used for processes such as twitching motility as well as DNA uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gold et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the architecture of the bacterial T4P assembly machinery differs greatly from the archaellar motor. Whereas the archaellar motor apparently lacks a conduit through the periplasm, the bacterial T4P machinery harbours the PilQ complex, a large, gated molecular machinery that guides the pilus through the peptidoglycan layer and the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolappan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For swimming motion, Bacteria have developed the flagellar machinery, a massive double-membrane spanning macromolecular device that is thought to share a common ancestor with the bacterial type-3 secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erhardt et al., 2010</xref>). The evolutionary reason for the higher complexity of both, bacterial T4P assembly machines as well as flagellar motors is speculative. However, it may be hypothesised that Bacteria needed to come up with additional protein components for their T4P assembly machinery as well as an entirely different propulsion device as they developed a double membrane, which is, with very few exceptions, not found in Archaea.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cultivation of cells</title><p><italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> type strain DSM3638 was obtained from the in-house culture collection at the University of Regensburg.

For each particle, two coordinates were selected, of which the first marked the centre of the periplasm and the second marked the central part of the motor density. Two of three Euler angles (Psi and Theta) were roughly determined by the two contours. Particles were then pre-aligned and averaged using IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>) and Spider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaikh et al., 2008</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies et al., 2011</xref>). This rough average was used as initial reference for PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>), in which particle alignment was refined. 6-fold symmetry was applied by duplicating and rotating particles by 0, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300° around the symmetry axis. The membrane and surrounding noise were excluded by a cylindrical mask around the motor complex.

Using a combination of electron cryo-tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, single-particle cryoEM and helical reconstruction, the authors generated a model of the machinery. This work complements similar studies of related systems published over the last couple of years, including:</p><p>Thermus thermophilus type IVa pilus system (<italic>eLife</italic>. 2015 May 21;4. doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07380),</p><p>Myxococcus xanthus type IVa pilus system (Science. 2016 351(6278):aad2001. doi: 10.1126/science.aad2001),type IVb system of Vibrio cholerae (Nat Microbiol. 2017 2:16269. doi: 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.269),</p><p>Neisseria menigitidis type IVa pilus (Nat Commun. 2016 7:13015. doi: 10.1038/ncomms13015),</p><p>Ignicoccus hospitalis type IV pili (J Mol Biol. 2012;422(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2</xref>):274-281, and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 113(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">37</xref>):10352-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1607756113),</p><p>Methanospirillum hungatei archaellum (Nat Microbiol. 2016 2:16222. doi: 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.222).</p><p>The conclusion that it provides the first model of the entire machinery is, however, overstated, since the authors themselves admit that some components cannot be identified. Much of the data is observational and assignments not confirmed by generation and imaging of isogenic mutants (e.g. FlaCDE) as has been done in other studies cited above. A &quot;large portion of the motor… remains unassigned&quot;. We therefore suggest toning down the claim (both in the Abstract as well as in the main text) that a structural model of the entire archaellum is presented. A structural model of the entire complex would require having every piece of density assigned. The paper must be revised to address these limitations.</p><p>2) &quot;Archaea are ubiquitous microorganisms that are thought to be the ancestors of eukaryotes (Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017).&quot; This remains controversial. They should look at papers such as: Nasir, A., Kim, K.M., Da Cunha, V., and Caetano-Anollés, G. (2016). Arguments Reinforcing the Three-Domain View of Diversified Cellular Life. Archaea 2016. Further, Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017 has been called into question by a number of people, and at least one paper is in press providing alternate interpretations for the metagenomic data analyzed as coming from &quot;Lokiarchaeota&quot; (namely, that there is no single organism that was being sequenced).</p><p>3) (Introduction) &quot;Proton motive force&quot;. In fact, some bacterial flagellar motors are powered by a Na gradient. They should replace &quot;proton motive force&quot; with &quot;ion fluxes&quot;.</p><p>4) &quot;As FlaJ is almost completely buried in the membrane (Reindl et al., 2013), it is concealed by the lipid bilayer in our average&quot;. This makes no sense. It is not as if the authors are using metal shadowing to look at these structures. They are doing cryo-ET, and it is impossible to understand how the bilayer can be &quot;concealing&quot; the protein. They then go on to dock an x-ray structure into the density that is apparently &quot;concealed&quot;.</p><p>5) (Subsection “Location of motor subunits”) The model for the FlaI-FlaH complex is quite weak due to the limited resolution. Can a better justification for the model be provided?</p><p>6) (Subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”) The model for the FlaB filament used the <italic>M. hungatei</italic> structure as a reference. Nowhere is there any comparison between their <italic>P. furiosus</italic> filament and the previous structures from <italic>M. hunatei</italic> or <italic>I. hospitalis</italic>. How similar are these? What is conserved among the three and what varies?</p><p>7) (Discussion) &quot;We suggest that FlaF does not form a continuous channel.&quot; In membrane biology, &quot;channel&quot; has a very specific meaning, and it appears that the authors are not referring to a pore of any sort. Further, it is also possible that the arguments in Banerjee et al. 2015 are flawed. The main argument for this location of FlaF seems to be that it bound S-layer proteins in vitro. But an obvious control, of showing that FlaB does not bind these proteins, was never done.</p><p>8) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, fourth paragraph) The suggestion that some/many chemoreceptors form hexagonal arrays, and therefore that the hexagonal arrays found in this study may be an as yet unknown chemoreceptor, appears pretty weak.</p><p>9) (Discussion) &quot;…Classes the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum as T4P-like filament&quot;. The homology between T4P and archaeal flagellar filaments only involves the N-terminal α-helical domain, including the leader sequence and the processing of this leader by a specific protease. There is no apparent homology, from either sequence or structure, between the large globular domain in archaeal flagellar filaments and any T4P. The &quot;versatility&quot; of the C-terminal domain is due to a gene fusion!</p><p>10) (Discussion) &quot;Bacteria on the other hand have developed the far more complex flagellum based on the type-3 secretion system instead (Chen et al., 2011; Erhardt, Namba and Hughes, 2010).&quot; We do not know of anyone other than the authors who thinks that the flagellum evolved from a T3SS. In fact, if one looks at reference (Erhardt, Namba and Hughes, 2010) which is cited, it states that the dogma in the field has been that the T3SS evolved from flagellar, but some new work suggests a common ancestor for both.</p><p>11) (Subsection “Electron cryo-tomography of Pyrococcus furiosus”, last paragraph) The polar cap seems to be associated with the machinery but its composition is unknown. If it is only present when archaella are present, is it possible to speculate on its composition based on genetic conservation in other species that also have this structure? Are there unassigned ORFs in archaella operons that might encode its constituents?</p><p>12) (Subsection “Integration of the archaellum into the periplasm”, last paragraph) The idea that S-layer subunits would need to be missing to accommodate the filament's passage in the absence of a dedicated channel requires better support. How likely is it that a hyperthermophile could tolerate missing S-layer subunits – would this destabilize the array? What evidence is there that such gaps actually occur? Do other surface structures use native gaps such as these?</p><p>13) The argument that the angles at which filaments cross the periplasm supports random egress needs better support as well; what is the chance that angled filaments are an artefact of processing? How would filaments emerging at random angles affect archaellum function and coordination? Could swimming occur efficiently if the archaella are not aligned?</p><p>14) (Subsection “Location of motor subunits”, first paragraph) Calling FlaJ a &quot;secretin&quot; is confusing, as this term is associated with outer membrane oligomers in gram negative type IV pilus and type II secretion systems. Instead it appears to be orthologous to the platform protein PilC that coordinates subunit assembly in related systems.</p><p>15) (Subsection “Sub-cellular organisation of motor complexes and the polar cap”, last paragraph) Averaging of only 57 units seems low – what is the confidence level of this information?</p><p>16) (Subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”, second paragraph) The assignment of FlaB0 as the main subunit should be supported by imaging of mutants, or stated with less certainty.</p><p>17) (Subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”, last paragraph) The angle at which the helices are arranged should be stated more clearly here. How variable is this arrangement?</p><p>18) (Subsection “N-glycosylation of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”) What is the justification for the assignment of N-glycans to these densities? Where they confirmed by mutation of one or more sites to a non-acceptor? Although complete loss of glycosylation prevents assembly, it is possible to reduce the number of sequons without impeding filament formation.</p><p>19) (Discussion) The Discussion could better position the new information in context with what has been observed in other systems as listed above. How do the details described here advance the field? How do the systems compare? How representative of archaella machineries is this one? What does &quot;coordinated by FlaF&quot; mean? This is a vague term.</p><p>20) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, fourth paragraph) The paper provides no data supporting the &quot;docking station&quot; concept, and chemoreceptors usually have surface exposed ligand binding domains, which I didn't see here as the polar cap is positioned well below the membrane.</p><p>21) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, last paragraph) Can the functional properties conferred by glycosylation be deconvolved from its requirement for filament polymerization? If they don't make filaments in the absence of glycosylation, one cannot conclude that glycosylation is important for adherence.</p><p>22) (Subsection “Evolutionary aspects”, last paragraph) Type IV pili do not rotate – their motors do.</p><p>23) Is there a hole visible in the docked FlaI structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, gold) and what is the diameter? Could the entire filament (diameter 11nm) fit into the FlaI ring or maybe only the helical core?</p><p>24) The last figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>; transmembrane helix prediction) is not necessary and should be deleted.</p><p>25) For the filament structure at 4.2 A, a typical &quot;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>&quot; should be provided with information on data collection statistics, refinement statistics and model quality descriptors (Geometry, Ramachandran, Clash, Molprobity), ideally also EMRinger score, etc. It should also be described what kind of additional restraints were used in the Phenix refinement (e.g. Ramachandran, secondary structure, etc.).</p><p>26) &quot;It is conceivable that the polar cap functions to concentrate archaella at one cell pole and acts as an anchor to prevent mechanical disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by the rapid rotation of multiple archaella.&quot; One might assume that the forces needed to rotate the filaments are very large compared to the forces needed to rotate the (unfixated) motor complex in the lipid bilayer. Rather than just prevent disruption, one would think that the polar cap is required first of all to fix the motors, otherwise only the motors would rotate and the long filaments would stand still; in particular since there does not seem to be any anchoring to the periplasm. Is there any idea why there is a kink in the polar cap?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27470.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Important points to address:</italic></p><p><italic>The following points raised by the reviewers must be addressed in the revised manuscript.

The paper must be revised to address these limitations.</italic> </p><p>We have toned down statements that suggest that we have generated a model of the entire archaellum complex by modifying the following sentences:</p><p>“This allows us to build a structural model of the entire archaellum, paving the way to a molecular understanding of archaeal swimming motion.”</p><p>Changed to: “This allows us to build a structural model combining the archaellum and its motor complex, paving the way to a molecular understanding of archaeal swimming motion.”</p><p>“In combination, our results provide a first structural model of the entire archaellar locomotion machinery.”</p><p>Changed to: “In combination, our results provide a first model of the architecture of the archaellar locomotion machinery.”</p><p>“Together with a wealth of previous biochemical data, our new structures of the archaellar motor complex, the polar cap, the S-layer, and the archaellum itself enable us to build a first structural model of the entire archaellum machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).”</p><p>Changed to: “Together with a wealth of previous biochemical data, our new structures of the archaellar motor complex, the polar cap, the S-layer, and the archaellum itself enable us to build a first model describing the architecture of the archaellum machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) &quot;Archaea are ubiquitous microorganisms that are thought to be the ancestors of eukaryotes (Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017).&quot; This remains controversial. They should look at papers such as: Nasir, A., Kim, K.M., Da Cunha, V., and Caetano-Anollés, G. (2016). Arguments Reinforcing the Three-Domain View of Diversified Cellular Life. Archaea 2016. Further, Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017 has been called into question by a number of people, and at least one paper is in press providing alternate interpretations for the metagenomic data analyzed as coming from &quot;Lokiarchaeota&quot; (namely, that there is no single organism that was being sequenced).</italic> </p><p>We have deleted the statement to avoid controversy.</p><p><italic>3) (Introduction) &quot;Proton motive force&quot;. In fact, some bacterial flagellar motors are powered by a Na gradient. They should replace &quot;proton motive force&quot; with &quot;ion fluxes&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the wording as suggested.</p><p><italic>4) &quot;As FlaJ is almost completely buried in the membrane (Reindl et al., 2013), it is concealed by the lipid bilayer in our average&quot;. This makes no sense. It is not as if the authors are using metal shadowing to look at these structures. They are doing cryo-ET, and it is impossible to understand how the bilayer can be &quot;concealing&quot; the protein. They then go on to dock an x-ray structure into the density that is apparently &quot;concealed&quot;.</italic> </p><p>There are many examples where sub-tomogram averaging of cryo-tomograms did not clearly reveal membrane-buried protein components, especially when native biological systems such as cells or isolated membranes were imaged. This limitation is mainly a consequence the high apparent contrast of lipid bilayers in tomograms at high defocus. To avoid confusion, we changed the wording as follows:</p><p>“As FlaJ is almost completely buried in the membrane, it is concealed by the lipid bilayer in our average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).”</p><p>Changed to: “FlaJ is almost completely buried in the lipid bilayer. Due to the high apparent contrast of lipid bilayers in tomograms at high defocus, it was invisible in our average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).”</p><p>In addition, we would like to clarify that we did not dock structures into the membrane. Instead, we docked the X-ray structures of FlaI and FlaH into the cytosolic part of the complex, which is well resolved. To avoid confusion, we have added the phrase “cytosolic part”:</p><p>“However, a superposition of the X-ray structure of the highly conserved <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> FlaI (SaFlaI; PDB-4IHQ) with the membrane-proximal cytosolic part of the sub-tomogram average places the X-ray structure into a density that closely matches its outline.”</p><p><italic>5) (Subsection “Location of motor subunits”) The model for the FlaI-FlaH complex is quite weak due to the limited resolution. Can a better justification for the model be provided?</italic> </p><p>The orientation of FlaI is based on the interaction known from type II secretion ATPases with their cognate membrane protein. The orientation of the FlaH hexamer was guided by experiments that have not been published yet, but which indicate that this is the interaction interface. We intend to publish these results in a follow-up study.</p><p><italic>6) (Subsection “Structure of the P. furiosus archaellum”) The model for the FlaB filament used the M. hungatei structure as a reference. Nowhere is there any comparison between their P. furiosus filament and the previous structures from M. hunatei or I. hospitalis. How similar are these? What is conserved among the three and what varies?</italic> </p><p>We have created two new supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>) and added two new paragraphs to the Results (–subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”, last paragraph) as well as to the Discussion (subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, fifth paragraph), in which we now compare these three filaments and their component proteins in detail. We would like to emphasise that the filaments of <italic>P. furiosus</italic> and <italic>M. hungatei</italic> are both true archaella and more closely related to each other than to the Iho670 fibre of the immotile <italic>I. hospitalis</italic>, which is most likely an adhesive filament.</p><p><italic>7) (Discussion) &quot;We suggest that FlaF does not form a continuous channel.&quot; In membrane biology, &quot;channel&quot; has a very specific meaning, and it appears that the authors are not referring to a pore of any sort. Further, it is also possible that the arguments in Banerjee et al. 2015 are flawed. The main argument for this location of FlaF seems to be that it bound S-layer proteins in vitro. But an obvious control, of showing that FlaB does not bind these proteins, was never done.</italic> </p><p>The function of FlaF is not known, but it is the only archaellum protein which has been shown to interact with an extracellular component of the cell, the S-layer (Banerjee et al., Structure, 2015) and it was therefore proposed that it helps to anchor the archaellum in the cell envelope. We are not sure how to interpret the comment of the reviewer that these results might be “flawed”. As a control, the cytoplasmic FlaI was shown not to interact with the S-layer and FlaB was not part of the mentioned study. However, it is indeed not known how FlaF interacts with the S-layer or FlaG or FlaB. All these three proteins exhibit a globular domain which is predicted as archaellin domain, and the FlaF structure was even used to model the <italic>Ignicoccus</italic> Type IV pilus filament. Therefore, it is very likely, that all three proteins, FlaG/F and FlaB are extracellular as proven for FlaF and FlaB.</p><p>To avoid confusion with (ion) channels, we changed the in several places of the manuscript:</p><p>“…[H]owever it is not certain that this protein forms a bona fide channel-like complex through the periplasm.”</p><p>Changed to: “…however it is not certain that this protein forms a bona fide conduit through the periplasm.”</p><p>“Since S-layers are two-dimensional porous protein lattices, we wondered if the S-layer pores themselves form channels for archaellar filaments.”</p><p>Changed to: “Since S-layers are two-dimensional porous protein lattices, we wondered if the S-layer pores themselves can form conduits for archaellar filaments.”</p><p>“…[W]e suggest that FlaF does not form a continuous channel…”</p><p>Changed to: “…we suggest that FlaF does not form a continuous conduit that connects the membrane and the outer canopy of the S-layer.”</p><p>“Whereas the archaellar motor lacks a complex channel through the periplasm…”</p><p>Changed to: “Whereas the archaellar motor apparently lacks a conduit through the periplasm…”</p><p><italic>8) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, fourth paragraph) The suggestion that some/many chemoreceptors form hexagonal arrays, and therefore that the hexagonal arrays found in this study may be an as yet unknown chemoreceptor, appears pretty weak.</italic> </p><p>We have toned down the discussion concerning the identity of the hexagonal protein arrays as follows:</p><p>“The protein arrays found in this study may thus represent a yet unknown <italic>Pyrococcus</italic>-specific type of chemoreceptor.”</p><p>Changed to: “It remains to be investigated if the hexagonal protein arrays found in this study represent an unknown <italic>Pyrococcus</italic>-specific type of chemoreceptor or some other protein linked to motility.”</p><p><italic>9) (Discussion) &quot;…Classes the P. furiosus archaellum as T4P-like filament&quot;. The homology between T4P and archaeal flagellar filaments only involves the N-terminal α-helical domain, including the leader sequence and the processing of this leader by a specific protease. There is no apparent homology, from either sequence or structure, between the large globular domain in archaeal flagellar filaments and any T4P. The &quot;versatility&quot; of the C-terminal domain is due to a gene fusion!</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer have re-written the Discussion accordingly (“Evolutionary aspects Evolutionary aspects”).</p><p><italic>10) (Discussion) &quot;Bacteria on the other hand have developed the far more complex flagellum based on the type-3 secretion system instead (Chen et al., 2011; Erhardt, Namba and Hughes, 2010).&quot; We do not know of anyone other than the authors who thinks that the flagellum evolved from a T3SS. In fact, if one looks at reference (Erhardt, Namba and Hughes, 2010) which is cited, it states that the dogma in the field has been that the T3SS evolved from flagellar, but some new work suggests a common ancestor for both.</italic> </p><p>We have rephrased our statement accordingly:</p><p>“Bacteria on the other hand have developed the far more complex flagellum based on the type-3 secretion system instead”</p><p>Changed to: “For swimming motion, Bacteria have developed the flagellar machinery, a massive double-membrane spanning macromolecular device that is thought to share a common ancestor with the bacterial type-3 secretion system”.</p><p><italic>11) (Subsection “Electron cryo-tomography of Pyrococcus furiosus”, last paragraph) The polar cap seems to be associated with the machinery but its composition is unknown. If it is only present when archaella are present, is it possible to speculate on its composition based on genetic conservation in other species that also have this structure? Are there unassigned ORFs in archaella operons that might encode its constituents?</italic> </p><p>The <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> archaellum (fla-) operon does not show unassigned regions that could encode for the polar cap. We suspect that this structure may be found in regions neighbouring the <italic>Pfu</italic> fla-operon that encode for putative proteins or may be under control of the fla-operon transcriptional regulator (EarA; Ding et al., Mol Microbiol, 2016). As blast search of these genes did not reveal significant homology with other known proteins, we are currently attempting to isolate the polar cap structure to analyse its composition via mass spectrometry.</p><p><italic>12) (Subsection “Integration of the archaellum into the periplasm”, last paragraph) The idea that S-layer subunits would need to be missing to accommodate the filament's passage in the absence of a dedicated channel requires better support. How likely is it that a hyperthermophile could tolerate missing S-layer subunits – would this destabilize the array? What evidence is there that such gaps actually occur? Do other surface structures use native gaps such as these?</italic> </p><p>S-layers are inherently imperfect and highly porous protein lattices. They contain frequent symmetry breaks and gaps, which in fact are prerequisites for S-layers to form closed, cage-like structures around archaeal cells that are often irregularly shaped. In addition, gas in S-layers are also required for cell division (see Pum et al., J. Bacteriol., 1991). Missing subunits are therefore very common. We have included the following statement:</p><p>“Symmetry breaks and gaps are common in S-layers, as they enable them to form closed cages around cells and are essential for cell division. However, the mechanism by which the S-layer lattice is locally dissolved to provide sufficient space for the growing archaellum filament is still unknown and awaits further investigation.”</p><p><italic>13) The argument that the angles at which filaments cross the periplasm supports random egress needs better support as well; what is the chance that angled filaments are an artefact of processing? How would filaments emerging at random angles affect archaellum function and coordination? Could swimming occur efficiently if the archaella are not aligned?</italic> </p><p>Although archaella appear to traverse the periplasm at random angles, they are in fact perpendicular to the plane of the polar cap (Briegel et al., bioRxiv, 2017). We have made the same observations in <italic>Methanocaldococcus villosus</italic> with cells that were high-pressure frozen or chemically fixed before embedding and sectioning (unpublished results) and in frozen-hydrated <italic>P. furiosus</italic> cells (this paper). Thus, it is unlikely that the angular variability of the archaella is an artefact of sample preparation.</p><p>This angular variability of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaella is also fully consistent with both, the missing periplasmic conduit as well as the absence of a structure analogous to the bacterial flagellar hook. In contrast to bacterial flagella, archaella are slightly bent along their entire length and are not guided through the S-layer by a specific complex. Thus, it is not surprising that a slight bending in the periplasm is observed. In the absence of a hook, the inherent curvature is likely to increase the efficiency of rotary propulsion. Indeed, <italic>P. furiosus</italic> is a very efficient swimmer (Herzog &amp; Wirth, Appl. Environ. Biol., 2012). However, as all these points are speculative, we would prefer not to elaborate on them in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>14) (Subsection “Location of motor subunits”, first paragraph) Calling FlaJ a &quot;secretin&quot; is confusing, as this term is associated with outer membrane oligomers in gram negative type IV pilus and type II secretion systems. Instead it appears to be orthologous to the platform protein PilC that coordinates subunit assembly in related systems.</italic> </p><p>We have rephrased the wording from “secretin” to “platform protein”.</p><p><italic>15) (Subsection “Sub-cellular organisation of motor complexes and the polar cap”, last paragraph) Averaging of only 57 units seems low – what is the confidence level of this information?</italic> </p><p>The arrays have six-fold symmetry, and we applied this symmetry during sub-tomogram averaging. Thus, the final number of averaged sub-volumes was 342, in line with other sub-tomogram averaging studies and yields a significant level of confidence.</p><p><italic>16) (Subsection “Structure of the P. furiosus archaellum”, second paragraph) The assignment of FlaB0 as the main subunit should be supported by imaging of mutants, or stated with less certainty.</italic> </p><p>FlaB<sub>0</sub> has already been shown to be the main constituent of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum in a previous study involving using N-terminal sequencing and RT-PCR (Näther-Schindler et al., Front Microbiol, 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, we toned down the corresponding statement in the manuscript:</p><p>“This shows that at least the main part of the filament is composed of FlaB<sub>0</sub> rather than a mixture of all three FlaB proteins, confirming biochemical data that identified FlaB<sub>0</sub> as major archaellin of <italic>P. furiosus</italic>”.</p><p>Changed to: “This suggests that at least the main part of the filament is composed of FlaB<sub>0</sub> rather than a combination of all three FlaB proteins, in accordance with previous biochemical data that identified FlaB<sub>0</sub> as the major archaellin of <italic>P. furiosus</italic>”</p><p><italic>17) (Subsection “Structure of the P. furiosus archaellum”, last paragraph) The angle at which the helices are arranged should be stated more clearly here. How variable is this arrangement?</italic> </p><p>The helices are arranged at an angle of 15 degrees with respect to the axis of the filament. This has now been stated in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”. Judging from our structure, this arrangement is not variable.</p><p><italic>18) (Subsection “N-glycosylation of the P. furiosus archaellum”) What is the justification for the assignment of N-glycans to these densities? Where they confirmed by mutation of one or more sites to a non-acceptor? Although complete loss of glycosylation prevents assembly, it is possible to reduce the number of sequons without impeding filament formation.</italic> </p><p>N-glycosylation is the most common form of glycosylation in Archaea and it has been shown previously that most archaella are highly glycosylated (Nikhil et al., FEMS Microbiol Rev, 2001). It has also been demonstrated by Periodic acid-Schiff staining that <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaella are indeed glycosylated (Näther et al., J Bac, 2006). In our structure of the archaellum, all asparagine residues of FlaB<sub>0</sub> that are part of a N-X-S/T (N-glycosylation) sequon, showed a large density next to these residues that could not be assigned by the polypeptide backbone or another side chain. Similar densities have been attributed to glycosylation sites of the archaellum from <italic>M. hungatei</italic> before (Poveleit et al., Nat. Microbiol., 2016). Conversely, none of the asparagines outside a N-X-S/T sequon showed such a large neighbouring densities in our structure. Thus, we are confident about our conclusion that these sites are indeed N-glycosylated. Generating new high-resolution structures of site-specific mutants is obviously not within the scope of this study but will be subject of future research.</p><p><italic>19) (Discussion) The Discussion could better position the new information in context with what has been observed in other systems as listed above. How do the details described here advance the field? How do the systems compare? How representative of archaella machineries is this one? What does &quot;coordinated by FlaF&quot; mean? This is a vague term.</italic> </p><p>We have included a comparison between the bacterial T4P machinery and the archaellar motor in the Discussion, subsection “Evolutionary aspects”, second paragraph.</p><p>We have also included two new figures to compare the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum with that of <italic>M. hungatei</italic> and the <italic>I. hospitalis</italic> fibre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>) and added two new paragraphs comparing these three filaments in the Results (subsection “Structure of the P. furiosus archaellum”, last paragraph) as well as the Discussion section (subsection “Structure of the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> archaellum”).</p><p>We have also included a statement highlighting the significance of our model for the field in the last paragraph of the subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”.</p><p><italic>20) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, fourth paragraph) The paper provides no data supporting the &quot;docking station&quot; concept, and chemoreceptors usually have surface exposed ligand binding domains, which I didn't see here as the polar cap is positioned well below the membrane.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the wording to avoid the speculative term “docking station”.</p><p>“In addition, the polar cap appears to be a docking station for other protein complexes that form hexameric protein arrays.”</p><p>Changed to: “In addition, the polar cap is associated with protein complexes that form hexameric protein arrays.”</p><p>We have also toned down the discussion concerning the identity of the hexagonal protein arrays as follows:</p><p>“The protein arrays found in this study may thus represent a yet unknown Pyrococcus-specific type of chemoreceptor.”</p><p>Changed To: “It remains to be investigated if the hexagonal protein arrays found in this study represent an unknown Pyrococcus-specific type of chemoreceptor or some other protein linked to motility.”</p><p><italic>21) (Subsection “Assembly of the archaellum machinery”, last paragraph) Can the functional properties conferred by glycosylation be deconvolved from its requirement for filament polymerization? If they don't make filaments in the absence of glycosylation, one cannot conclude that glycosylation is important for adherence.</italic> </p><p>We have separated the role of glycans in filament stability and adhesion by rephrasing the corresponding paragraph as follows:</p><p>“The extensive glycan cover of the archaellum filaments likely increases their stability. […] Finally, surface glycans also provide strain-specific recognition signatures for cell-cell interactions, in which archaella seem to play a major role.</p><p><italic>22) (Subsection “Evolutionary aspects”, last paragraph) Type IV pili do not rotate – their motors do.</italic> </p><p>In fact, the cited paper (Nivaskumar, Structure, 2014) does show that pseudopili are assembled in a “spool-like” fashion and thus rotate during assembly. We have amended our wording for clarity:</p><p>“Although primordial T4P were likely not used for rotary propulsion, it has been proposed that pseudopili of T2SS, an evolutionary relative of the archaellar motor, rotate during assembly”.</p><p>Changed to: “Although it is unknown if these primordial filaments were used for rotary propulsion, it has been proposed that pseudopili of T2SS, an evolutionary relative of the archaellar motor, assemble in a rotary “spool-like” fashion.”</p><p><italic>23) Is there a hole visible in the docked FlaI structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, gold) and what is the diameter? Could the entire filament (diameter 11nm) fit into the FlaI ring or maybe only the helical core?</italic> </p><p>There is indeed a hole in the docked FlaI X-ray structure, which in theory would be large enough to accommodate the helical core of the filament. However, it is unlikely that the filament protrudes into this hole as the helices at its end are fully embedded in the lipid bilayer, while FlaI is positioned in the cytoplasm. It is more likely that the helical core of the filament interacts directly with the membrane-integral platform protein FlaJ during assembly and rotation.</p><p><italic>24) The last figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>; transmembrane helix prediction) is not necessary and should be deleted.</italic> </p><p>We do think that this figure is important, as we refer to it in the Results section and have therefore decided to leave it in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>25) For the filament structure at 4.2 A, a typical &quot;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>&quot; should be provided with information on data collection statistics, refinement statistics and model quality descriptors (Geometry, Ramachandran, Clash, Molprobity), ideally also EMRinger score, etc. It should also be described what kind of additional restraints were used in the Phenix refinement (e.g. Ramachandran, secondary structure, etc.).</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> has been included and is referenced in the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><p><italic>26) &quot;It is conceivable that the polar cap functions to concentrate archaella at one cell pole and acts as an anchor to prevent mechanical disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by the rapid rotation of multiple archaella.&quot; One might assume that the forces needed to rotate the filaments are very large compared to the forces needed to rotate the (unfixated) motor complex in the lipid bilayer. Rather than just prevent disruption, one would think that the polar cap is required first of all to fix the motors, otherwise only the motors would rotate and the long filaments would stand still; in particular since there does not seem to be any anchoring to the periplasm. Is there any idea why there is a kink in the polar cap?</italic> </p><p>We have incorporated this reviewer’s suggestion into our Discussion.</p><p>“It is conceivable that the polar cap functions in concentrating archaella at one cell pole and acts as an anchor to fix the motor complexes in the bilayer to prevent futile rotation. In addition, the polar cap may also prevent the mechanical disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by the rapid rotation of multiple archaella.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
