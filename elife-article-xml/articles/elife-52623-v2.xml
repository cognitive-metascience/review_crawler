activity patterns by integrating internal metabolic signals of energy balance with external environmental cues such as time-of-day. Proper circadian alignment of feeding behavior is necessary to prevent metabolic disease, and thus it is imperative that molecular players that maintain neuronal coordination of energy homeostasis are identified. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, decrease their feeding and food anticipatory behavior (FAA) in response to daytime, but not nighttime, restricted feeding. These effects lead to increased weight loss, but do not require p75NTR during development. Instead, p75NTR is required for fasting-induced activation of neurons within the arcuate hypothalamus. Indeed, p75NTR specifically in AgRP neurons is required for FAA in response to daytime restricted feeding. These findings establish p75NTR as a novel regulator gating behavioral response to food scarcity and time-of-day dependence of circadian food anticipation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many animals, specific types of neurons, such as the hypothalamic hunger neurons, are tasked with regulating food consumption, integrating internal signals of hunger. In general, individuals eat if food becomes available when they are hungry; if food is absent, they will start moving to find new resources. Finally, if food always comes at the same time, animals will increase their activity just before it is delivered.</p><p>Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that have many essential roles in the brain. In recent years, they have been shown to interact with the circadian clock, the built-in mechanism that helps animals stay synchronized with the cycle of day and night. A protein known as p75NTR is present in nerve cells, including hypothalamic hunger neurons: there, it helps to relay messages from a neurotrophin which, amongst other roles, controls food intake. However, it was unclear whether p75NTR played a role in regulating feeding behaviors, especially in a circadian manner.</p><p>To investigate this question, Podyma et al. genetically engineered a group of mice lacking p75NTR, and a group missing the protein only in their hypothalamic hunger neurons. Both types of mutants had abnormal control of their feeding behavior: compared to normal mice, they fed less (and lost more weight) after they had been deprived of food overnight, or when they faced food shortage over multiple days. In addition, the mutants failed to move more before being fed. However, these feeding patterns were only affected during daytime, while they were preserved at night. These results reveal a new role for p75NTR in hypothalamic hunger neurons.</p><p>Dissecting the biological processes that control food intake is key since obesity levels are increasing around the world. In particular, the relationship between food intake and the circadian clock is an important avenue of research as time-restricted diets (where food intake is only allowed during specific periods of the day) are growing in popularity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p75NTR</kwd><kwd>food anticipation</kwd><kwd>neurotrophin</kwd><kwd>AgRP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deppmann</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM7267-39</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podyma</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM7055-45</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podyma</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM121937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Güler</surname><given-names>Ali Deniz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-AG055059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>Sung Ok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel neurotrophin signaling axis underpins a behavioral response to food scarcity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal circuits originating in the hypothalamus direct behavioral responses to match an organism's perception of scarce or excess energy environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morton et al., 2006</xref>). For example, scarcity challenges organisms to modulate energy homeostasis, conserving the resources they have and seeking out additional food sources around them. A maladaptive relationship between such energy cues and appropriate behavioral responses is a key feature of many eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Homeostatic food intake is also impacted by time of day, with laboratory housed mice normally eating most of their food during their nighttime active phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challet, 2019</xref>). Conversely, scarcity due to a limited window of food availability (<italic>e.g.</italic> a prey species emerges to forage for only a few hours) is capable of inducing adaptation of this ostensibly circadian feeding circuit. The context of this timing information is so significant that regularly recurring cycles of food availability can lead organisms to modify their behavior and physiology, changing their locomotor activity, glucocorticoid levels, and body temperature to better match the predicted time of food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patton and Mistlberger, 2013</xref>). A growing body of evidence suggests that desynchronization of feeding relative to the normal circadian time of eating adversely impacts metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutton et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While many of the peripheral responses induced by caloric scarcity are known (e.g. elevated glycogenolysis, increased ketone body production), there is a significant gap in our understanding of the neural and molecular mechanisms leading to scarcity-associated behaviors. In response to time restricted feeding (TRF), mice increase their activity in the time window preceding feeding, a phenomenon known as food anticipatory activity (FAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richter, 1922</xref>). This is the hypothesized output of a putative food entrainable oscillator (FEO), which functions in a comparable manner for entrainment to food as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) does for entrainment to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stephan, 2002</xref>). Despite the recognition of FAA, the identification and characterization of the anatomic and molecular correlates of the FEO have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pendergast and Yamazaki, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been hypothesized that the FEO may be anatomically dispersed, with at least one component embedded within hypothalamic circuits to alter feeding behavior in response to peripheral energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pendergast and Yamazaki, 2018</xref>). One of the hypothalamic drivers of feeding that has been implicated in FAA are AgRP neurons of the arcuate hypothalamus. These cells respond to hunger and satiety factors released from peripheral organs and neighboring neurons to drive feeding and associated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, neonatal ablation of AgRP neurons leads to diminished FAA, and more prominently so during the daytime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). The basis for how AgRP neurons alter FAA, and indeed how the FEO can be impacted by time of day, as observed in the AgRP neuron ablated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2014</xref>), remains unknown.</p><p>Herein, we examined the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR, <italic>Ngfr</italic>) in modulating behavioral response to homeostatic challenge. p75NTR is one of the two receptors for brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, which is known to promote satiety and prevent weight gain through its actions in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). While genetic deletion of p75NTR does not alter locomotor activity or metabolism under normal conditions (normal chow, ad lib), its expression cycles in a circadian manner in the SCN, with an increase during the rest phase, and it regulates the oscillation of glucose and lipid homeostasis genes in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Raja et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, metabolically relevant functions of p75NTR have been unmasked when animals are homeostatically challenged. Loss of p75NTR improves glucose and insulin regulation during glucose or insulin tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baeza-Raja et al., 2012</xref>). In response to high fat diet this unmasking effect is even more evident, with resistance to diet-induced obesity observed when p75NTR is ablated in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baeza-Raja et al., 2016</xref>). The involvement of neurotrophic factors in hypothalamic feeding circuits, and the identified roles of p75NTR in circadian and metabolic regulation, together suggest that p75NTR may be a candidate to influence food entrainable behaviors such as FAA.</p><p>To better understand the role of p75NTR in feeding behavior we studied the response of <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO mice to energy deficiency. We found that p75NTR is required to consume normal post-fasting levels of food. Unexpectedly, we also find that p75NTR is necessary for circadian expression of daytime, but not nighttime, FAA. Furthermore, we show that these effects do not require any developmental role of p75NTR, instead requiring it’s function in AgRP neurons. This work documents a novel role of p75NTR in the CNS circuitry controlling feeding behavior, and posits it as a sought after molecular player to elucidate circadian regulation of feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Germline loss of p75NTR does not alter baseline feeding, activity or metabolism</title><p>To establish whether p75NTR is involved in any gross processes of energy homeostasis, we first examined body weight, food intake, and locomotor activity in ad libitum fed mice harboring germline knockout alleles of p75NTR (<italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 1992</xref>). <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO mice have similar body weight to control animals (<italic>Ngfr-</italic>WT) into adulthood, with increased variability as wildtype mice gain weight with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>), and with no differences in total daily activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In particular, mice with neonatal ablation of AgRP neurons are phenotypically normal during ad libitum feeding, but are unable to increase food intake and express FAA during daytime, but not nighttime, TRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). This is a remarkably similar phenotype to what we have observed in our <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO mice on TRF, and led us to suspect that these two mouse models may have defects in the same pathway. Given defective feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), expression in NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and decreased fasting activation of arcuate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we hypothesized that p75NTR might be necessary for robust function of AgRP neurons. To address this hypothesis, we generated mice with an <italic>Agrp</italic>-specific knockout of p75NTR (AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO). During ad libitum feeding these mice similarly show no defect in food intake or body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), however exhibit a similar reduction in refeeding food intake following an overnight fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, during daytime TRF, AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO mice behaved similarly to germline <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO and Adult<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO mice, exhibiting no FAA and having reduced food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). However, we do not observe a statistically significant decrease in body weight. Lastly, as AgRP neurons have been shown to be necessary to promote feeding in response to ghrelin, we tested whether p75NTR in AgRP neurons is necessary for ghrelin responsiveness. We found that intracerebroventricular infusion of 1 ug ghrelin at ZT4 in ad libitum fed mice significantly increased food intake and c-Fos expression in both AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO and control mice, suggesting that p75NTR is not required for ghrelin-mediated AgRP neuron activity and feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that p75NTR is required postnatally and in AgRP neurons for robust behavioral responses to food deficit, while p75NTR in other cell populations may be required for weight loss.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>AgRP neuron specific loss of p75NTR leads to reduced daytime restricted feeding and FAA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ad libitum food intake (left) and body weight (right); n = 10 WT, 13 KO.

One of the primary pathways through which p75NTR has been shown to function is the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrington et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoon et al., 1998</xref>). We first sought to assess whether JNK signaling is perturbed in the arcuate of AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO mice by measuring levels of a JNK signaling target c-Jun through immunofluorescence. We find in the fed state that there is no significant difference in phospho-c-Jun levels between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), and that both wildtype and AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO mice show a similar reduction in phospho-c-Jun in response to fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This suggests that p75NTR is not necessary for JNK activation in AgRP neurons and is in agreement with previous findings that phospho-c-Jun is decreased in AgRP neurons following a fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Unger et al., 2010</xref>). We next turned our attention to other signaling pathways that could be altered in p75NTR-deficient AgRP neurons. Phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in AgRP neurons is required for adaptive feeding behavior in response to fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang and McKnight, 2015</xref>).

In response to energy deficit, we present data that p75NTR in the arcuate hypothalamus modulates feeding behavior. This is not due to a developmental effect of p75NTR since adult ablation recapitulates the behaviors observed in the germline knockout. We further demonstrate that loss of p75NTR affects circadian influenced feeding and activity, exerting a predominant effect on daytime feeding behavior. Moreover, we show that p75NTR is expressed in, and modulates the activity of arcuate neurons. Interestingly, this neuronal activation appears to be necessary solely in the context of the homeostatic challenge of hunger, as we observe differences in daytime feeding only in response to an overnight fast. Ablation of p75NTR specifically in AgRP neurons of the arcuate phenocopies the germline knockout, thereby identifying the site of p75NTR’s requirement for regulating homeostatic feeding and anticipatory behaviors. Finally, we identify p75NTR in AgRP neurons as necessary for mediating fasting-induced arcuate CREB signaling, and suggest that disruption of this pathway is at least in part responsible for the feeding behavior alterations observed in <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO mice.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How are homeostatic feeding behaviors regulated by circadian rhythmicity?</title><p>While hunger has long been recognized as a strong motivator of feeding, it has become clear that circadian inputs may also contribute significantly to driving feeding behavior. In <italic>Ngfr-</italic>KO mice, we show a striking phenotypic difference in the ability to consume equivalent post-fasting amounts of food depending on time of day, with a 21% deficit during the normal rest phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, the distinction between intact nighttime FAA and lost daytime FAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is intriguing, and suggests that food anticipation may depend on separate mechanisms depending on the phase of TRF. These data suggest that p75NTR may be engaged by hunger cues to override inhibitory signals of feeding that are normally present during the daytime, but which may be absent at night. However, it is unknown how the presence of light or the time-of-day may influence a food entrained clock. These signals could ultimately be derived from the central pacemaker in the SCN, which is known to be more active during the normal rest phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inouye and Kawamura, 1979</xref>), to connect to feeding control centers in the hypothalamus, including the arcuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guzmán-Ruiz et al., 2014</xref>), and function as the master circadian clock in response to changes in light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>). However, it is unresolved how the SCN may interact with a food entrained clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storch and Weitz, 2009</xref>).</p><p>AgRP neurons have a diurnal firing pattern (higher during the evening and lower during the morning) which accompanies differential transcriptional profiles in response to refeeding during the day versus at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cedernaes et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, among these changes were a significant enrichment in neurotrophin signaling pathway components (e.g. BDNF, Rac1, Ripk2, Frs2, Rap1 etc.) as determined by the KEGG database. p75NTR has been shown to be important in controlling the expression of core clock genes in the SCN and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Raja et al., 2013</xref>), and may have a similar role in AgRP neurons. It is possible that some of these transcriptional changes may also be mediated by the modulation of CREB signaling that we observed in AgRP neurons. p75NTR has been suggested to interact with PKA to alter CREB activity, and, interestingly, CREB has been shown to have roles in both the core circadian clock machinery in the SCN, and in the peripheral metabolic alterations associated with time restricted feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baeza-Raja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ginty et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Neill et al., 2008</xref>). However, our understanding is limited on how changes in clock genes in metabolically sensitive neurons, such as AgRP neurons, could alter behavioral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the role for p75NTR and other neurotrophins in feeding and circadian biology?</title><p>Neurotrophins function broadly in the development and maintenance of nervous system wiring. It could be considered that p75NTR, canonically involved in synaptic plasticity, may influence feeding by altering some broad measure of AgRP neuron remodeling in response to fasting. Indeed, fasting induced activation of AgRP neurons has been shown to require NMDA receptors and spinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, CREB signaling, which we show is altered in fasted AgRP<italic>-Ngfr-</italic>KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), has been shown to be important for long-term changes in neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakamoto et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, p75NTR can localize to dendritic spines, and loss of p75NTR has been shown to impair NMDA-dependent LTD in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woo et al., 2005</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that the requirement of p75NTR for proper activation of arcuate neurons in response to fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) is due to a role in dendritic remodeling of AgRP neurons, which will be explored in the future.</p><p>It is also possible that neurotrophin family members like p75NTR play non-canonical roles as essential detectors of energy state and in turn regulate feeding behavior. p75NTR, along with TrkB, is one of the two receptors for the neurotrophic factor BDNF, which has been previously implicated in hypothalamic circuits to suppress feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozek et al., 2015</xref>). Here we report that p75NTR acts oppositely to BDNF-TrkB signaling to promote feeding. Additionally, mice lacking the ability to form mature BDNF have intact FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krizo et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that BDNF signaling, either through TrkB or p75NTR, may not be required for FAA. Interestingly, previous work in the peripheral nervous system has delineated several dichotomous functions for p75NTR and TrkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). The results presented here further support this notion by demonstrating that p75NTR acts in support of feeding, as opposed to TrkB’s previously documented suppression of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozek et al., 2015</xref>). It is plausible that p75NTR and TrkB play opposing roles in the coordination of hypothalamic mediated energy coordination. This distinction is made even more notable by recent work demonstrating a time-of-day dependent action of hypothalamic TrkB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). Silencing TrkB neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) during the day, for example, significantly increases food intake, whereas their silencing at night has no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). While it remains unknown whether p75NTR and TrkB might interact at either a cellular or circuit level in the hypothalamus, we can conclude that neurotrophin receptors have critical functions in time-of-day dependent feeding behaviors.</p><p>Understanding the connections between circadian rhythms and metabolism could lead to delineation of how food entrained clocks impact metabolic health. First, deciphering the neuronal regions that mediate diurnal control of feeding and food anticipatory behavior would greatly improve our ability to study this phenomenon. Interactions between the SCN, DMH, and arcuate hypothalamus have long been hypothesized as mediators of circadian control of feeding. Extending our understanding of how neuronal activity in these regions changes normally across the 24 hr light/dark cycle, and how this is altered by changes in feeding patterns, would lend great insight into their circadian regulation. Second, studying the role of important molecular players in circadian regulation of feeding, such as p75NTR, holds promise to find viable targets for modulating these behaviors.

Stereotaxic coordinates relative to Bregma: 0 mm lateral, 1.46 mm posterior and −5.8 mm below the surface of the skull. Cannulas were maintained in place by dental cement anchored to one stainless steel screw fixed to the skull. A dummy cannula was inserted to prevent clogging of the cannula.

dependent upon circuits in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. This study identifies the p75 neurotrophin receptor (ngfr) as a regulatory component in circadian rhythms that influences daytime food anticipatory behavior. These results are novel and unexpected. The revised manuscript demonstrates expression of p75 in the arcuate neurons to control the timing of food intake. The downstream events are questionable, as the regulation of p-CREB is not normally associated directly with p75 signaling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The p75 neurotrophin receptor in AgRP neurons is necessary for homeostatic feeding and food anticipation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Food anticipatory activity (FAA) is an increase in an animal's overall activity in response to temporally restricted access to food. Although FAA is a widely appreciated phenomenon, its neurobiological basis is unknown. Here the authors provide genetic evidence that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contributes to FAA through signaling in AgRP neurons, and acts in a circadian manner. Moreover, conditional deletion of p75NTR in mature mice caused significant deficits, suggesting a role that is not dependent on developmental alteration of brain structure and function. While these studies address an understudied aspect of feeding regulation and the data are intriguing, weaknesses in the rigor of the experimental design and data interpretation make it hard to evaluate the authors' claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is important to quantify colocalization of p75NTR immunoreactivity with NPY-GFP and to specifically examine c-fos induction and CREB activation in AgRP neurons. The arcuate nucleus has many subsets of neurons in addition to AgRP neurons so that c-fos induction and CREB activation could be in non-AgRP neurons. Thus, the data do not demonstrate that fasting activates CREB and neurons through p75NTR-mediated signaling. The authors can use in situ hybridization such as RNAScope to mark AgRP neurons. In addition, how do the authors know the boundary of the arcuate nucleus in Figure 6 images? The two images in Figure 6C are not comparable.</p><p>The authors state that they found, &quot;no alterations of peripheral metabolites between wildtype and p75KO mice,&quot; yet they only assayed a small number of molecules. This statement should be revised to more accurately reflect the limited assessment of metabolic alterations, or include a more extensive metabolomic analysis. The failure to detect a significant difference in some serum analytes shown in Tables 1-2 likely stems from an underpowered study (n=3 vs. n=8-9 for measurements of food intake in the same groups). While absolute levels of leptin may not differ in the fasted state, it is notable that the decrease in leptin in response to fasting in p75KO mice is severely blunted. The fall in leptin is important to promote the drive to re-feed, so the absence of this adaptation could contribute to the blunted response of KOs to time-restricted feeding.</p><p>The evaluation of the contribution of p75 signaling in AgRP neurons is not sufficiently rigorous. The specificity of the effect for AgRP neurons on p-CREB immunoreactivity was not presented. It is critical to understand how AgRP neuronal activity/function is altered because these neurons are known to promote fasting-induced locomotor activity. Examining whether ghrelin can stimulate c-fos and feeding behavior in AgRPp75KOs would help to parse whether p75 contributes to &quot;hunger recognition&quot; pathways or acts independently to promote FAA/responses to hunger (as discussed in paragraph two of subsection “p75NTR is required for homeostatic feeding behavior 159 in a time dependent manner”).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52623.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is important to quantify colocalization of p75NTR immunoreactivity with NPY-GFP and to specifically examine c-fos induction and CREB activation in AgRP neurons.

In Figure 4B we have also included a more detailed analysis of c-Fos changes specifically in NPY-GFP expressing neurons of fed and fasted <italic>Ngfr-KO</italic> and control mice, showing a similar blunting of c-Fos activity. In Figure 6—figure supplement 1, we have also included a more detailed analysis of pCREB signaling in <italic>AgRP-Ngfr-KO</italic> and control mice by quantifying pCREB expression within AgRP neurons using an AgRPcre-tdTomato reporter. In Figure 6 we had estimated the boundaries of the arcuate nucleus based on morphology of dapi stained nuclei, but have removed those boundaries for their lack of precision. We have replaced the images in Figure 6C with images that we believe are more comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that they found, &quot;no alterations of peripheral metabolites between wildtype and p75KO mice,&quot; yet they only assayed a small number of molecules.

While we still find that the absolute levels of leptin in the fed or fasted states do not differ significantly between genotypes, as the reviewer mentions we do find a lack of a statistically significant drop between fed and fasted state leptin levels in the <italic>Ngfr-KO</italic> mice. This might be partially explained by the lower body weights of the germline knockouts at this age (16 weeks), and may contribute towards the feeding defect of these animals.
