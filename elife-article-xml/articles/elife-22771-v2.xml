Many studies of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems illustrate how the combined impact of multiple neuromodulators on brain circuits can generate a recognizable behavioral state, suggesting that the regulation of neuromodulator release is critical for the generation and control of behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the vertebrate central nervous system, the neuromodulator serotonin is released by a small population of neurons that project widely and exert influence on neural circuits throughout the brain. Serotonin is required for central control of basic physiological functions such as thermoregulation and respiratory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myers, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frazer and Hensler, 1999</xref>). Serotonin also functions in the control of affective states and behavioral drives. For example, serotonergic systems control aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kravitz, 1988</xref>), appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lent, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hatcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oh et al., 2015</xref>), and sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uphouse, 2014</xref>). Dysregulation of endogenous serotonin systems is thought to underlie psychiatric illness, notably affective disorders such as major depression and generalized anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neumeister et al., 2004</xref>). Because serotonin plays critical roles in many different neural circuits that influence affect, cognition, and behavior, components of serotonin signaling pathways are important therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celada et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angoa-Pérez and Kuhn, 2015</xref>). Current targets include serotonin receptors, serotonin transporters that mediate vesicular packaging or reuptake after release, and catabolic enzymes that degrade serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celada et al., 2013a</xref>). Mechanisms that control serotonin release <italic>in vivo</italic> could be similarly important therapeutic targets. However, little is known about these mechanisms.</p><p>A simple behavior of the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> offers a powerful model for the study of molecular mechanisms that regulate serotonin circuits <italic>in vivo</italic>. Female reproductive behavior - egg laying - requires serotonin, which is released from a pair of Hermaphrodite-Specific Neurons (HSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desai and Horvitz, 1989</xref>). Egg-laying behavior is highly stereotyped, and when it is disrupted animals visibly bloat with unlaid eggs. This easily identified behavioral change makes the neurochemical systems that generate and modulate egg-laying behavior amenable to genetic analysis. Genes that function in serotonin synthesis, release, and receptor signaling mechanisms mutate to cause egg-laying defects, and unbiased genetic screens for behavioral mutants defective in egg-laying behavior have identified genes and molecules that regulate the function of serotonin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trent et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desai and Horvitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ségalat et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brundage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koelle and Horvitz, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The egg-laying circuit comprises three cell-types: the serotonergic HSNs, the cholinergic ventral cord neurons VC4 and VC5, and electrically coupled vulval and uterine muscles, of which the vulval muscles (VMs) receive direct synaptic input from motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). HSNs synapse both onto VM muscle targets and onto VC4 and VC5 motor neurons. VC4 and VC5 motor neurons synapse onto VMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al., 1986</xref>) and also provide extrasynaptic inhibitory modulation to the HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bany et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shyn et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to modulation from local neurons, HSNs also receive inhibitory peptidergic inputs from multiple sources. The G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 is expressed by HSNs and mediates their inhibition in response to FLP-10 and FLP-17 neuropeptides. FLP-10 inhibitory neuropeptides are secreted from several neuron types, as well as from epithelial cells of the reproductive system. FLP-17 peptides are secreted by a small number of cells and are principally released by a pair of chemosensory neurons, the BAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim and Li, 2004</xref>). Both inhibitory cholinergic and peptidergic modulation of the HSNs are mediated by the G<sub>o</sub> alpha ortholog GOA-1, which acts through two effectors to mediate neuronal inhibition: the diacylglycerol kinase DGK-1 and inward rectifying potassium channels comprising IRK-1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nurrish et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A point mutation in the neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 causes it to transduce excess inhibitory signaling and thereby inactivates the HSNs. Inhibition of HSNs by this mutant receptor requires its endogenous ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>), indicating that EGL-6(gf) receptors are not constitutively active but rather amplify peptidergic inhibition received by HSNs. To identify factors required for inhibitory peptidergic modulation of the HSNs, we sought mutants that were suppressed for the egg-laying defects caused by <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic>. Here, we report that <italic>cca-1</italic>, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel homologous to vertebrate T-type calcium channels, mutates to strongly and specifically suppress the effects of excess peptidergic inhibition onto serotonin neurons. The <italic>cca-1</italic> suppressor mutation symmetrically shifts the voltage dependencies of channel activation and inactivation, resulting in a T-type channel that operates over more hyperpolarized membrane potentials compared to wild-type channels. Re-tuning the voltage dependency of T-type channels restores activity to inhibited HSNs at the cellular level and, at the whole animal level, restores wild-type reproductive behavior to mutants in which HSNs receive excess peptidergic inhibition. We propose that these data reveal a general mechanism by which T-type calcium channels act as functional gates to enable or disable inhibitory neuromodulatory input to cellular targets and circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>n5209</italic> is a potent suppressor of behavioral effects caused by increased peptidergic inhibition</title><p>A mutation in the neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 increases inhibitory signaling to the HSNs in a manner that requires endogenous neuropeptide ligands and G<sub>o</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>). As a consequence of increased inhibition onto the HSNs, <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> mutants bloat with unlaid eggs. To identify factors required for modulation of the HSNs by inhibitory neuropeptides, we performed a chemical mutagenesis screen for suppressors of the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> behavioral phenotype.

Other mutations also activate G<sub>o</sub> signaling in HSNs to cause egg-laying defects. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations affecting the GTPase-activating protein EGL-10, which is a negative regulator of G<sub>o</sub> in HSNs, and an activating mutation in the orphan G protein-coupled receptor EGL-47 cause profound defects in HSN function that strongly depend on G<sub>o</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koelle and Horvitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moresco and Koelle, 2004</xref>). Previously, we found that the inward rectifier potassium channel gene <italic>irk-1</italic> was required for inhibition of HSNs by EGL-6 but was not generally required for inhibitory G<sub>o</sub> signaling in HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>). We tested whether the <italic>n5209</italic> suppressor mutation displays a similar specificity for signaling pathways downstream of the neuropeptide receptor EGL-6.

These data suggest that the gene affected by <italic>n5209</italic>, like <italic>irk-1</italic>, is not generally required for inhibitory G<sub>o</sub> signaling in HSNs but has a privileged function with respect to signaling downstream of receptors for inhibitory neuropeptides.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>n5209</italic> does not change the temporal structure of female reproductive behavior</title><p>We considered the possibility that the <italic>n5209</italic> mutation might constitutively activate the reproductive neuromusculature and bypass its normal regulation. To test this hypothesis, we separated the <italic>n5209</italic> suppressor mutation from the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> mutation and determined whether <italic>n5209</italic> mutants had abnormal reproductive behavior. We observed that <italic>n5209</italic> alone had no measurable effect on the developmental stage of newly laid eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom). These data suggest that <italic>n5209</italic> does not grossly affect the timing of egg-laying behavior. We next used high-resolution behavior analysis to quantify parameters of egg-laying behavior of <italic>n5209</italic> mutants. <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying behavior is a stochastic process that is well described by a model in which the neuromusculature switches between active and inactive states with dynamics dictated by measurable rate constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). We tracked animals carrying the <italic>n5209</italic> mutation to determine whether <italic>n5209</italic> affected state transitions in the egg-laying system and, if so, whether the rate constants determining these transitions were significantly altered by the suppressor mutation. We observed that the behavior of <italic>n5209</italic> mutants, like that of the wild type, switched between active and inactive states and displayed a very similar temporal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We noted that one parameter of the model used to describe the behavior is altered in <italic>n5209</italic> mutants: the time constant that defines the rate with which the egg-laying system ‘resets’ after a behavioral event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a result, <italic>n5209</italic> mutants display slightly longer intervals between egg-laying events when the system is in an active state. We noted that <italic>n5209</italic> animals carry slightly fewer embryos <italic>in utero</italic> than do wild-type animals (average of 7.3 ± 2.3 embryos vs 11.25 ± 3.4 embryos, respectively). This might explain the slight increase in the intracluster time constant. However, the overall structure of the reproductive behavioral program is intact in <italic>n5209</italic> mutants. These data indicate that the <italic>n5209</italic> mutation restores behavior to <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> mutants and does not simply cause unregulated activation of the reproductive neuromusculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1</title><p>Using three-factor crosses, high-resolution SNP mapping, and whole-genome sequencing, we initially mapped the <italic>n5209</italic> suppressor to the X chromosome within an interval that contained four mutations predicted to affect protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We separated these mutations by recombination and found that recombinants with a mutation in <italic>cca-1</italic> were always suppressed for egg-laying defects (4/4 recombinants) while recombinants that lost this mutation were never suppressed (5/5 recombinants). The <italic>cca-1</italic> mutation is a C-&gt;T base change in the seventh exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>cca-1</italic> encodes the pore-forming subunit of a low-voltage activated (LVA) T-type calcium channel and is the only T-type calcium channel gene encoded by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shtonda and Avery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steger et al., 2005</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we calculated the cumulative GCaMP signals (cumulative <italic>△F/F</italic>) in HSN somas and axons as a proxy for neuronal activity over time. In HSN somas of <italic>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</italic> mutants, cumulative <italic>△F/F</italic> was significantly elevated compared to that measured in the somas of <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> HSNs but was still lower than cumulative <italic>∆F/F</italic> measured in the somas of wild-type HSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In HSN axons, however, cumulative <italic>△F/F</italic> of the <italic>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</italic> neurons was strikingly similar to that measured in wild-type axons.

These data show that <italic>cca-1(n5209)</italic> restores activity to HSNs that have been silenced by excess peptidergic inhibition. These data further suggest that T-type channels regulate axonal, that is, presynaptic, calcium in serotonergic HSNs and that altering the voltage-gating of T-type channels may have a larger effect on axonal/presynaptic calcium than it does on calcium signaling in the HSN cell body.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A specific and coordinated change in voltage-dependent activation and inactivation of T-type calcium channels restores physiological activity to neurons of the reproductive neuromusculature that have been silenced by peptidergic inhibition. Importantly, these altered channels also restore wild-type reproductive behavior to mutants with excess endogenous peptidergic inhibition. Put another way, changing the voltage dependencies of T-type calcium channels functionally disengages the neurons in which they are expressed from a powerful modulatory input. Furthermore, in the absence of excess peptidergic inhibition, this change in T-type channel regulation causes no effect on reproductive behavior. How might a seemingly simple adjustment of channel properties exert such a powerful and specific effect on a neural circuit?</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanisms by which T-type currents might gate inhibitory peptidergic modulation</title><p>We propose two mechanisms by which changing the voltage-dependencies of activation and inactivation could restore wild-type function to serotonin neurons inhibited by neuropeptide modulators.</p><p>1) The window current might play a critical role in setting the resting potential of serotonergic HSNs. In the voltage range covered by the overlap of activation and inactivation curves, not all T-type channels fully inactivate, and so some continue to flux ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crunelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uchino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williams et al., 1997</xref>). The T-type window current is known to contribute to the resting membrane potential of vertebrate thalamocortical and reticular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreyfus et al., 2010</xref>). We previously showed that inhibitory neuropeptides require GIRK-like potassium channels to inhibit HSNs, and it is therefore likely that inhibitory neuropeptides hyperpolarize HSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Emtage et al., 2012</xref>). Re-tuned T-type channels might be active at these hyperpolarized potentials and thereby pass a depolarizing current that brings the membrane potential of HSNs back to their pre-modulator baseline. Importantly, in the absence of inhibitory peptides, the resting potential of HSNs would be such that re-tuned T-type channels are inactivated. Re-tuned T-type channels could have little effect on circuit function in the absence of hyperpolarizing modulatory inputs, which is consistent with our observation that re-tuned T-type channels have little effect on <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive behavior in the absence of peptidergic inhibition. </p><p>2) Re-tuned T-type channels might boost small depolarizing inputs onto HSNs that are hyperpolarized by peptidergic inhibition and allow those depolarizing inputs to drive behavior. Because T-type channels are low-voltage-activated, they need only a small depolarization to open, and the current they pass can then bring other ion channels to threshold. Such a role for T-type channels in boosting excitatory inputs has been observed in vertebrate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Llinás and Yarom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). T-type channels can also boost depolarizations generated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms, for example in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagiwara et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou and Lipsius, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangoni et al., 2006</xref>) and their <italic>C. elegans</italic> counterparts, pharyngeal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shtonda and Avery, 2005</xref>). A key distinction between this model and the model proposed above is that here, re-tuned T-type channels do not affect the resting potential of cells that receive hyperpolarizing modulatory input. Rather, the re-tuned channels would boost excitatory inputs that would otherwise be below threshold for triggering behavior. The ability of T-type channels to boost excitation would also be limited to a hyperpolarized range of membrane potentials because of channel inactivation. In the absence of neuropeptide-driven hyperpolarization, re-tuned calcium channels would likely be inactivated and not affect cellular or circuit responses to excitatory inputs. Again, this model is consistent with our observation that re-tuned T-type channels only affect behavior when HSNs receive peptidergic inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input</title><p>Re-tuned T-type channels restored wild-type behavior to animals in which HSNs receive excess inhibition, but the pattern of HSN activity in these animals was strikingly different from that in the wild type. In the wild type, we observed low-frequency, high-amplitude calcium transients in HSN cell bodies and neurites. Under the conditions we used to record HSN activity these calcium transients did not correlate with egg laying or muscle contractions (data not shown), and only rarely did we observe egg laying by immobilized animals. Recently, Collins <italic>et al.</italic> recorded HSN activity in freely moving animals and showed that HSNs are active during periods of behavioral quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, our data and those of Collins <italic>et al.</italic> are inconsistent with a model in which the HSNs function as typical motor neurons to acutely drive target muscle contractions.</p><p>Peptidergic inhibition through the neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 strongly affected calcium transients in HSNs; almost none of the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> mutant HSNs displayed any calcium transients. On its own, the <italic>cca-1</italic> suppressor mutation strikingly reduced the amplitude and increased the frequency of HSN calcium transients. These high-frequency, low-amplitude transients in <italic>cca-1</italic> mutant HSNs were not affected by increased peptidergic inhibition. That is, HSNs carrying re-tuned T-type channels were functionally disengaged from inhibitory peptidergic modulation at the level of cell physiology as well as behavior.</p><p>Although the calcium transients of wild-type and <italic>cca-1</italic> mutant HSNs were clearly different, we found that the cumulative activity of <italic>cca-1</italic> mutant HSNs was comparable to that of wild-type HSNs. These data suggest that reproductive behavior is not driven by fast, phasic signaling from HSNs, as might be suggested by the direct innervation of vulval muscles by serotonergic HSNs. Instead, our data indicate that HSN targets integrate signals from HSNs over longer periods. On average, bursts of reproductive behavior are separated by twenty to thirty minutes of quiescence, suggesting that the timescale over which such an integrative mechanism would function is on the order of tens of minutes. This model raises the interesting question of what molecular and biophysical mechanisms allow the reproductive circuit to integrate HSN activity during behavioral quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>T-type calcium channels might play a widespread role in gating the response to modulatory inputs to neural circuits</title><p>Unlike <italic>C. elegans</italic>, whose genome encodes only one T-type channel, vertebrates possess three genes that encode T-type channels, each of which is expressed in many central circuits.

If so, different T-type channel isoforms might be involved in the gating of multiple modulatory systems in the vertebrate brain. Genetic studies of human populations have found associations between T-type channel variants and neurological or psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheong and Shin, 2013</xref>). Alleles of T-type channel genes are strongly linked to heritable epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khosravani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2009</xref>) and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourinet et al., 2016</xref>). A T-type channel variant is also associated with autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Splawski et al., 2006</xref>). Targeted genetic studies of T-type channels in the mouse brain confirm that these channels play roles in diverse brain circuits. T-type channels are required in thalamic circuits for normal sleep, in midbrain centers for central processing of nociception, and in cerebellar circuits for motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ly et al., 2013</xref>). Our study raises the intriguing possibility that in these brain regions altering T-type channels might affect receptivity of neural circuits to modulatory inputs and that defective gating of neuromodulation might be an underlying cause of pathologies associated with T-type channel dysfunction.</p><p>T-type channel isoforms are differentially regulated by diverse intracellular signaling systems, including systems that couple to protein kinases C and A and heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolfe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DePuy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Reyes, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, T-type channel genes encode transcripts that display a high degree of alternative splicing to generate multiple channel isoforms from a single locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Senatore et al., 2014</xref>). Neurons can, therefore, remodel the complement of T-type channels either through genetic programs and mechanisms that couple neural activity to mRNA splicing, or acutely regulate T-type channels through canonical second messenger signaling pathways and effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murbartián et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Senatore et al., 2014</xref>). Because of this regulation, in the vertebrate brain a gating function of T-type channels with respect to neuromodulation would be subject to a high degree of selective control and possess a large capacity for plasticity.</p><p>The hypothesis that T-type channels gate neuromodulatory inputs to circuits implies that T-type calcium channels could be important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders linked to defects in neuromodulatory systems. Compounds that directly target monoamine and neuropeptide signaling systems are in widespread use for the treatment of psychiatric disease. Based on our studies of a model serotonergic circuit in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we suggest that compounds that alter the voltage-dependencies of T-type channels might synergize with therapeutics that directly target monoamine signaling in the brain. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate the possibility that globally manipulating T-type channel function in the brain could affect specific circuits.

Our data suggest that the origins of this apparent specificity are in the combination of in the biophysical basis of inhibition of serotonin neurons and the manner in which serotonin signals are processed by a downstream circuit. It is highly likely that similar cellular and circuit mechanisms exist in the vertebrate brain, and when the pharmacological tools become available it will be important to test whether manipulating vertebrate T-type channels restores function to neural circuits in and behavior of animal models of psychiatric disorders associated with monoamine dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode culture, strains, and maintenance</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites were grown on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar at 20°C on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Injected oocytes were incubated at 17°C for 3–5 days before recording. Oocytes were kept in ND96 (96 mM NaCl 2.5 mM KCl 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O 5 mM HEPES 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O pH 7.6 adjusted with NaOH) with 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin. Whole-cell current recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method (Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT). Electrodes had a resistance between 0.2 and 1.0 MΩ. Oocytes were continuously superfused with Barium Hydroxide (10 mM Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>1 mM KOH 90 mM NaOH 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4 adjusted with methane sulfonic acid). Data were acquired with a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed off-line with Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and MATLAB (Simulink; Natick, MA). Each oocyte was only included once in the data analysis, that is, there are no technical replicates. In order to be included in the data analysis, oocytes had to exhibit a leak current of less than −0.1 µA when clamped at −90 mV, and they had recover to normal resting membrane potential after the activation and inactivation protocols were done. V<sub>50</sub> for activation and inactivation and the slope factor, <italic>k</italic>, as well as the confidence intervals, were computed using the Boltzmann sigmoidal fit tool in GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA). All experiments using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> were performed according to guidelines of the Committee on Animal Care at New York University Langone Medical Center.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Adult animals with a single row of eggs in the uterus were selected for imaging. <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> animals were imaged 18–24 hr post larval-stage 4 (L4). Wild-type, <italic>cca-1(n5209)</italic>, and <italic>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</italic> animals were imaged 24–30 hr post-L4. Animals were mounted on 5% agarose pads made in M9 medium, immobilized using Vetbond veterinary surgical glue (3 M; St. Paul, MN), and placed under a coverslip. All videos were taken using a 10x objective on a Zeiss Axioscope Imager.M2 using Micromanager (MMstudioversion1.4.18). GCaMP6f was excited by 473 nm light using an EXFO metal halide epifluorescence light source at 12% light intensity. Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Andor; Belfast, Northern Ireland). Animals were imaged at 0.5 Hz for 15 min. Only animals that survived the imaging protocol were included in the study. At least 16 animals per genotype were analyzed. If both HSNs of one animal could be clearly seen, then both were included in the analysis. Neurites were not always visible, even when the soma was. Each animal was only imaged once. GCaMP6f fluorescence was analyzed as follows: Mean background fluorescence was subtracted from mean fluorescence in the region of interest (ROI). Baseline fluorescence in the ROI was determined by taking a linear regression of the entire video and subtracting it from the raw ROI data. This baseline was used to adjust fluorescence signals within the ROI for photobleaching during the experiment. To calculate the cumulative <italic>△F/F</italic> of each trace, the absolute value of the difference between ROI fluorescence at each time point was summed.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers (one has agreed to reveal his identity, Michael Koelle), and the evaluation has been overseen by Oliver Hobert as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very fine paper that utilizes genetics, electrophysiology, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the nervous system of intact animals to investigate how neuropeptides modulate activity of specific serotonergic neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit. This neural circuit is very highly developed as an experimental system to study how specific genes and signals regulate the activity of the circuit and the behavior it controls. The authors take advantage of all the available tricks in this system to carry out studies that would be difficult or impossible outside of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, or even within <italic>C. elegans</italic> in less well-studied neural circuits. The state-of-the-art nature of this study within the neural circuit field in itself makes this study of considerable interest. The results of the study make it of further interest. These results arise from an unbiased genetic screen for genes required for response to neuropeptide inhibition of neural activity, and therefore we find them to be of particular interest and significance, since this approach often leads to novel and physiologically significant findings. The results are indeed novel and interesting and lead the authors to raise the hypothesis that T type calcium channels generally are specific and key regulators of the responsiveness of neurons to neuromodulators.</p><p>Below is a list of comments and technical concerns that the authors should address. Only one of them (item 1) requires additional experimental work (estimated 2-3 weeks). The remaining items on the list can be addressed with minor alterations to the writing.</p><p>1) There is a technical concern about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>. Although it is a bit of a puzzle to figure this out from the information supplied in the supplemental Materials and methods, it appears that the plasmids injected to carry out cell-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>cca-1</italic> in the HSNs are pKEZ93 and pKEZ67, which express antisense and sense versions of <italic>cca-1</italic> from the fairly HSN-specific <italic>egl-6a</italic> promoter. The effect of injecting these constructs is to make the animals go from relatively wild-type egg laying to becoming egg-laying defective, and the authors interpret this as showing the knockdown of <italic>cca-1(n5209)</italic> in the HSN causes this effect, i.e. <italic>cca-1(n5209)</italic> is necessary in the HSN to suppress <italic>egl-69(gf)</italic>. Unfortunately, there is possibly a more mundane explanation. A number of labs working on the HSN neurons have found that high copy transgenes carrying HSN-expressed promoters (including the <italic>egl-6</italic> promoter) can interfere with HSN development. Development of the HSN seems to be unusually susceptible to disruption, so the types of manipulations that would cause no worries for other neurons are indeed potentially problematic for the HSN. Disrupting HSN development would lead to the egg-laying defective phenotype, as the authors themselves show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. So, I feel that interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> would be <italic>strongly</italic> enhanced by a control showing that &quot;<italic>cca-1(RNAi)</italic> in the HSNs&quot; by itself does not cause an egg laying defective phenotype. I would like to see the authors coinject pKEZ93 and pKEZ67 into a background wild-type for both <italic>egl-6</italic> and <italic>cca-1</italic>, at the same concentrations used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, do their staging of freshly laid egg assay on several lines generated in this way, and determine if the RNAi transgene itself causes an egg-laying defective phenotype. This is a relatively quick experiment to do – I would estimate 2-3 weeks.</p><p>2) The genetic screen that produced <italic>n5209</italic> is described only in passing, and no technical details are given, and it is cited as a personal communication. This is work done by the last author, Ringstad, as a postdoc in the Horvitz lab. This is a bit of an unusual way to handle this issue. Isolation of the mutant is the entire basis of the paper, so it is an odd thing to leave out. There needs to be more precise methodology for this screen and some details of the results available to other workers who might want to use this knowledge to design other suppressor of Egl screens.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels F and G show a very nice analysis. However, I have two comments. First, the authors conclude that the intracluster time constant is significantly changed, while the intercluster time constant is not. Is there an appropriate statistical analysis that could be used to determine if the data actually show this? Second, I would like to comment that it appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (although no quantitative data are shown on this point) that <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> worms carry many more unlaid eggs than do <italic>egl-6(gf) n5209</italic> worms. I wonder if the apparent increase in the intracluster time constant in the latter worms is simply a byproduct of the fact that there are less eggs to lay, so that egg-laying muscle contractions are less likely to productively release eggs. That would be a different interpretation from thinking that <italic>n5209</italic> has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals. The authors, to their credit, do <italic>not</italic> try to conclude that <italic>n5209</italic> has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals, but rather simply conclude that the overall pattern of egg laying (alternating inactive and active phases) remains intact.</p><p>4) Subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first paragraph. If the authors used any methods for SNP mapping or analysis of whole genome sequencing based on published methods developed by others, it would be nice if they cited that work in the Results or methods sections. I did eventually find such citations in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement I legend, but they were hard to find.</p><p>5) Subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first sentence. This sentence in the Results says there was only one protein coding sequence variant in the interval to which <italic>n5209</italic> was mapped. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its legend shows that <italic>ubc-17</italic>, C36B7.5, and F49E2.1 are in an interval to which <italic>n5209</italic> mapped and all three contained coding sequence variants that by methods not explained were shown not to affect the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> phenotype and thus to not be <italic>n5209</italic>. The apparent discrepancy between the language in the Results and in the figure/figure legend should be resolved so that this issue does not confuse the readers. Perhaps the resolution has to do with <italic>cca-1</italic> being the only gene with sequence variants in both sequenced <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> suppressor alleles, but that doesn't become apparent until one has read on to later in the paragraph.</p><p>6) The argument that the point mutation in <italic>cca-1</italic> is the causative mutation that suppresses <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> appears to depend principally on this mutation having been isolated twice in two independently isolated suppressor strains. This is a reasonable argument, but there are potential holes in it (i.e. both mutations arose from a single &quot;jackpot&quot; mutation and aren't really independent). I'd prefer it if the authors explicitly address the issue of the criteria they used to determine that the <italic>cca-1</italic> point mutation is indeed the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> suppressor mutation.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend. The authors write that one copy of <italic>n5209</italic> was sufficient to suppress <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic>. I suggest they change the wording to say it was sufficient to <italic>partially</italic> suppress <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that two copies of <italic>n5209</italic> appear to fully suppress, and one copy does not cause nearly as much suppression. When I read the unmodified &quot;suppress&quot;, I feel that full suppression is implied, and that simply saying &quot;suppress&quot; is not accurate here, especially since the authors emphasize the weaker &quot;partial suppression&quot; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>8) Subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, last sentence. &quot;<italic>n5209</italic> does not cause loss of <italic>cca-1</italic> function&quot;. I feel this concluding statement is an oversimplification of the results. The fact is that the deletion mutation does weakly partially suppress <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic>, and <italic>n5209</italic>/+ and <italic>n5209/n5209</italic> cause stronger suppression of <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic>. So, the <italic>n5209</italic> phenotype shares some similarity with the null phenotype and <italic>n5209</italic> may have some loss of function character. I'd be fine with saying &quot;<italic>n5209</italic> does not <italic>simply</italic> cause loss of <italic>cca-1</italic> function.&quot;</p><p>9) In the subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> alters the voltage dependency of the voltage-gated T-type calcium channel”, the authors put a P to S point mutation into a mammalian ortholog of <italic>cca-1</italic> analogous to the <italic>n5209</italic> P to S mutation in <italic>cca-1</italic>, and characterize effects of the mutation on mammalian channel activity. It is implied, but not stated explicitly, that the authors either didn't try or tried and failed to get <italic>C. elegans</italic> CCA-1 functionally expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, decided to functionally characterize the mammalian channel and its mutant instead, and that they are inferring that the P to S point mutation has similar effects on the worm and mammalian channels. There is nothing wrong with the authors' reasoning, but instead of making the readers read between the lines and infer all this, I would prefer it if the authors simply said these things explicitly. Perhaps this is a subjective matter of style, but I prefer things said out in the open so that reading the paper is less of a puzzle for the reader to solve.</p><p>10) A separate technical concern on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-6I</xref>: The authors show a N value for the number of eggs staged. They do not indicate (as far as I can find) whether all the eggs assayed in each Figure panel came from a single transgenic line, or from multiple lines. Because there is line to line variation in expression levels of <italic>C. elegans</italic> extrachromosomal transgenes, it would be better if the authors analyzed multiple lines, and then either pool the data from several lines, tell us they are showing data from a representative line, or if they are picking their &quot;best&quot; line, tell us that. In any case, some more explicit information on how the experiment was done is in order.</p><p>11) The Discussion is largely speculative, although speculation is appropriate and welcome in a Discussion. The first section (subsection “Mechanisms by which T-type currents might gate inhibitory peptidergic modulation”) speculates about how retuned T type channels affect the HSN, but because the HSN is not so far accessible to direct electrophysiological recording, the ideas explored remain untestable. The second section (subsection “How T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input”) analyzes results of the calcium imaging. Because the calcium imaging was done with immobilized animals on agarose pads, a condition in which &quot;normal&quot; egg laying behavior with active and inactive phases cannot occur and in which HSN activity is not correlated with egg laying behavior, there are limits to how well one can interpret what the data mean for normal egg laying behavior. The final Discussion section hypothesizes that T type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels generally &quot;gate&quot; neuromodulation and therefore could be good drug targets for psychiatric diseases that seem to involve neuromodulation. This is an interesting idea, but I am not clear how one would achieve a very specific effect with such drugs since T type channels are presumably expressed very widely in the brain.</p><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it was not clear how the timing parameters for egg-laying were determined (the Methods says using MATLAB scripts, but it is not clear how these work). Also, I'm not sure the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> illustrates the phenotype of the mutant very well; a histogram of interval times on a log scale would probably work better.</p><p>13) I think it would have been useful for the authors to try to relate the behavioral phenotype to the neural phenotype seen in HSN calcium imaging. For instance, recent papers have linked individual egg-laying events to large calcium spikes in HSN, so perhaps the fact that the <italic>cca-1</italic> mutations cause high frequency but low amplitude calcium activity in HSN is consistent with the lower rate of egg-laying within clusters that they observe behaviorally.</p><p>14) In the calcium imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), were any egg-laying events observed? If so it would be interesting to see how they correlate with the calcium traces; if none were seen this should be noted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22771.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Below is a list of comments and technical concerns that the authors should address.

Although it is a bit of a puzzle to figure this out from the information supplied in the supplemental Materials and methods, it appears that the plasmids injected to carry out cell-specific RNAi knockdown of cca-1 in the HSNs are pKEZ93 and pKEZ67, which express antisense and sense versions of cca-1 from the fairly HSN-specific egl-6a promoter.

This is a relatively quick experiment to do – I would estimate 2-3 weeks.</italic> </p><p>We agree that these are important issues. First, we apologize for the lack of clarity with respect to what reagent was used to perform cell-specific RNAi. We have amended the manuscript to make clear that we are using an <italic>egl-6</italic> promoter that we previously used to knock down the potassium channel gene <italic>irk-1</italic> (Emtage et al.2012), and we have included in the Methods section more detail about the RNAi constructs. We have included details in the main methods (subsection “Generation of transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains”), the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (subsection “T-type calcium channels regulate function of the serotonergic neurons that drive female reproductive behavior”), and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Supplementary file 5</xref></p><p>We note that our published study shows that this <italic>egl-6</italic> promoter driving <italic>irk-1</italic> RNAi causes suppression of egg-laying defects, which strongly indicates that the promoter itself does not have a strong deleterious effect on egg-laying behavior.</p><p>Second, to directly address the reviewer’s comment, we have collected additional data. We had generated transgenic animals in which this identical promoter drives expression of fluorophores, not RNAi seeds. We measured egg-laying behavior of these transgenics and found that they have near- normal egg-laying behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Also, we have introduced the <italic>Promegl-6a::cca-1(RNAi)</italic> transgene used to test <italic>cca-1</italic> site-of-action into otherwise wild-type animals. As the reviewers suggested, we tested whether this transgene has strong effects on egg laying by the wild type. We found that RNAi of <italic>cca-1</italic> only has a mild effect on egg laying by the wild-type whereas in <italic>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</italic> mutants RNAi of <italic>cca-1</italic> causes a strong Egl phenotype <italic>i.e.</italic> reverts the suppression caused by <italic>n5209</italic>. These data strongly support our interpretation of the RNAi data in the manuscript. We note that <italic>cca-1</italic> RNAi does have a small effect in the wild type. This is consistent with our observation that <italic>cca-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants display a weak egg-laying defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and we have made note of this is the manuscript.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22771.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22771.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22771.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22771-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>These data indicate that the <italic>egl-6a</italic> promoter used for these studies does not affect the function of the egg-laying system on its own and supports the conclusion that the effects we see are attributed to knock-down of <italic>cca-1</italic> in HSNs. We have added these data to the manuscript as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The genetic screen that produced n5209 is described only in passing, and no technical details are given, and it is cited as a personal communication. This is work done by the last author, Ringstad, as a postdoc in the Horvitz lab. This is a bit of an unusual way to handle this issue. Isolation of the mutant is the entire basis of the paper, so it is an odd thing to leave out. There needs to be more precise methodology for this screen and some details of the results available to other workers who might want to use this knowledge to design other suppressor of Egl screens.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the cursory description of the <italic>egl-6</italic> suppressor screen, which was indeed lacking sufficient details. We have added a description of the screen to the Methods section. We have also removed the citation of the screen as a personal communication, as per the reviewers’ request.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels F and G show a very nice analysis. However, I have two comments. First, the authors conclude that the intracluster time constant is significantly changed, while the intercluster time constant is not. Is there an appropriate statistical analysis that could be used to determine if the data actually show this?</italic> </p><p>We have now included 95% confidence intervals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>.</p><p><italic>Second, I would like to comment that it appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (although no quantitative data are shown on this point) that egl-6(gf) worms carry many more unlaid eggs than do egl-6(gf) n5209 worms. I wonder if the apparent increase in the intracluster time constant in the latter worms is simply a byproduct of the fact that there are less eggs to lay, so that egg-laying muscle contractions are less likely to productively release eggs. That would be a different interpretation from thinking that n5209 has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals. The authors, to their credit, do not try to conclude that n5209 has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals, but rather simply conclude that the overall pattern of egg laying (alternating inactive and active phases) remains intact.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers also commented that perhaps the number of eggs carried in uterocan explain the difference in the intracluster time constant between the wild type and <italic>n5209</italic> mutants. Because we have been principally using developmental stage of embryos as a measure of time spent in utero, we had not measured the number of eggs carried by <italic>n5209</italic> mutants. Indeed, we find that <italic>n5209</italic> mutants have fewer eggs in uterothan do wild-type hermaphrodites. Under the conditions that we study behavior, <italic>n5209</italic> mutants carry 7.3 ± 2.3 embryos in utero and wild-type animals carry 11.6 ± 3.4. The reviewer’s explanation is, therefore, plausible. We have included these numbers in the Results section (subsection “n5209 does not change the temporal structure of female reproductive behavior”) and noted that a reduction in the number of eggs in uteromight explain the altered rate constant.</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “n5209 affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first paragraph. If the authors used any methods for SNP mapping or analysis of whole genome sequencing based on published methods developed by others, it would be nice if they cited that work in the Results or methods sections. I did eventually find such citations in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> legend, but they were hard to find.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the methods for SNP mapping and WGS were difficult to find and apologize for this oversight. We have clarified our description of how the <italic>n5209</italic> mutation was mapped and moved this text to the main methods (subsection “Fine mapping of the suppressor mutation <italic>n5209”</italic>).</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “n5209 affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first sentence. This sentence in the Results says there was only one protein coding sequence variant in the interval to which n5209 was mapped. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its legend shows that ubc-17, C36B7.5, and F49E2.1 are in an interval to which n5209 mapped and all three contained coding sequence variants that by methods not explained were shown not to affect the egl-6(gf) phenotype and thus to not be n5209. The apparent discrepancy between the language in the Results and in the figure/figure legend should be resolved so that this issue does not confuse the readers. Perhaps the resolution has to do with cca-1 being the only gene with sequence variants in both sequenced egl-6(gf) suppressor alleles, but that doesn't become apparent until one has read on to later in the paragraph.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we show three coding sequence variants in addition to the <italic>cca-1</italic> variant, but in the text we say that there was only one coding variant in the interval to which <italic>cca-1</italic> was mapped. These other mutations were used as markers for mapping and could be separated from <italic>n5209</italic> by recombination. We apologize for this confusion, which arises from our poor description of our mapping strategy. We have clarified the text (subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first paragraph) and the figure legend.</p><p><italic>6) The argument that the point mutation in cca-1 is the causative mutation that suppresses egl-6(gf) appears to depend principally on this mutation having been isolated twice in two independently isolated suppressor strains. This is a reasonable argument, but there are potential holes in it (i.e. both mutations arose from a single &quot;jackpot&quot; mutation and aren't really independent). I'd prefer it if the authors explicitly address the issue of the criteria they used to determine that the cca-1 point mutation is indeed the egl-6(gf) suppressor mutation.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the manuscript would benefit from a concise and clear statement of the case in favor of <italic>cca-1</italic> as the affected gene. We have added a synopsis of the evidence that leads us to conclude that <italic>cca-1(n5209)</italic> is the causative mutation. In brief:</p><p>A) <italic>cca-1</italic> is the only mutation affecting protein-coding sequence within the interval to which the suppressor maps. We have included in the text recombination frequencies from fine-mapping experiments of <italic>n5209</italic> that show how we defined this genetic interval (subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, first paragraph).</p><p>B) <italic>n5209</italic> and <italic>n6122</italic> mutations are both X-linked suppressors of the <italic>egl-6(gf)</italic> phenotype and the corresponding mutants contain identical point mutations in <italic>cca-1</italic>. The reviewers suggest that this might be a “jackpot” mutation, but we are confident this is not the case. First, we know that the two strains come from different P0 plates and are not siblings. Second, we have sequenced the genome of each mutant and find that each strain contains a large number of new mutations, including in loci linked to <italic>cca-1</italic>. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>n6122</italic> and <italic>n5209</italic> mutations were the result of independent mutagenic events. We have clarified the text to better explain our data and our conclusion that these mutations are independent (-subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”).</p><p>C) Finally, our genetic analysis suggests that loss of <italic>cca-1</italic> function would revert the suppression caused by <italic>cca-1(n5209).</italic> RNAi of <italic>cca-1</italic> shows that this is indeed the case. We do not introduce this as evidence that we have correctly identified the gene affected by <italic>n5209</italic> at this point in the narrative. We discuss this experiment in the context of interrogating <italic>cca-1</italic> site of action, but we note that these data further support our interpretation of the mapping data.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend. The authors write that one copy of n5209 was sufficient to suppress egl-6(gf). I suggest they change the wording to say it was sufficient to partially suppress egl-6(gf). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that two copies of n5209 appear to fully suppress, and one copy does not cause nearly as much suppression. When I read the unmodified &quot;suppress&quot;, I feel that full suppression is implied, and that simply saying &quot;suppress&quot; is not accurate here, especially since the authors emphasize the weaker &quot;partial suppression&quot; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ reasoning and have made the change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend).</p><p><italic>8) Subsection “n5209 affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, last sentence. &quot;n5209 does not cause loss of cca-1 function&quot;. I feel this concluding statement is an oversimplification of the results. The fact is that the deletion mutation does weakly partially suppress egl-6(gf), and n5209/+ and n5209/n5209 cause stronger suppression of egl-6(gf). So, the n5209 phenotype shares some similarity with the null phenotype and n5209 may have some loss of function character. I'd be fine with saying &quot;n5209 does not simply cause loss of cca-1 function.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We agree, and we have changed this text (subsection <bold>“</bold><italic>n5209</italic> affects the T-type calcium channel CCA-1”, last sentence).</p><p><italic>9) In the subsection “n5209 alters the voltage dependency of the voltage-gated T-type calcium channel”, the authors put a P to S point mutation into a mammalian ortholog of cca-1 analogous to the n5209 P to S mutation in cca-1, and characterize effects of the mutation on mammalian channel activity. It is implied, but not stated explicitly, that the authors either didn't try or tried and failed to get C. elegans CCA-1 functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes, decided to functionally characterize the mammalian channel and its mutant instead, and that they are inferring that the P to S point mutation has similar effects on the worm and mammalian channels. There is nothing wrong with the authors' reasoning, but instead of making the readers read between the lines and infer all this, I would prefer it if the authors simply said these things explicitly. Perhaps this is a subjective matter of style, but I prefer things said out in the open so that reading the paper is less of a puzzle for the reader to solve.</italic> </p><p>We failed to functionally express CCA-1 in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. Fortunately, the sequence affected by <italic>n5209</italic> is almost perfectly conserved between CCA-1 and its mammalian homolog, which is readily expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. We apologize for the lack of clarity with respect to why we studied the effect of the <italic>n5209</italic> mutation on a vertebrate homolog. We have changed the text to better explain this experiment (subsection “<italic>n5209</italic> alters the voltage dependency of the voltage-gated T-type calcium channel”).</p><p><italic>10) A separate technical concern on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-I</xref>: The authors show a N value for the number of eggs staged. They do not indicate (as far as I can find) whether all the eggs assayed in each Figure panel came from a single transgenic line, or from multiple lines. Because there is line to line variation in expression levels of C. elegans extrachromosomal transgenes, it would be better if the authors analyzed multiple lines, and then either pool the data from several lines, tell us they are showing data from a representative line, or if they are picking their &quot;best&quot; line, tell us that. In any case, some more explicit information on how the experiment was done is in order.</italic> </p><p>The data listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G-I</xref> are from a representative transgenic line, but we have collected data from other lines made with the same RNAi constructs. We have made more explicit that the data in this figure come from a single transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend). To show that the line is indeed representative we are including data from the other lines that we tested in an addendum for reviewers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response images 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">4</xref>). We did not feel that these data would add value to the manuscript, but we agree that it is an important technical consideration.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22771.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22771.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22771.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22771-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22771.031</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22771.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22771.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22771-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22771.032</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22771.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22771.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22771-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>11) The Discussion is largely speculative, although speculation is appropriate and welcome in a Discussion. The first section (subsection “Mechanisms by which T-type currents might gate inhibitory peptidergic modulation”) speculates about how retuned T type channels affect the HSN, but because the HSN is not so far accessible to direct electrophysiological recording, the ideas explored remain untestable.</italic> </p><p>We agree. As of yet, neither we nor others have been able to analyze HSNs using electrophysiological recordings. However, given our calcium imaging data and the very clear literature linking T-type channels to control of resting potential and excitability, we feel that our discussion of these points is reasonable. We agree that there are many exciting experiments waiting to be done, especially with respect to the question of whether certain modulatory systems are preferentially affected by certain biophysical mechanisms that regulate excitability and resting potential.</p><p><italic>The second section (subsection “How T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input”) analyzes results of the calcium imaging. Because the calcium imaging was done with immobilized animals on agarose pads, a condition in which &quot;normal&quot; egg laying behavior with active and inactive phases cannot occur and in which HSN activity is not correlated with egg laying behavior, there are limits to how well one can interpret what the data mean for normal egg laying behavior.</italic> </p><p>This comment refers to the fact that we performed our experiments on immobilized animals, and it is possible that different patterns of activity might be observed in freely behaving animals. We agree. Since we submitted our manuscript, Collins, Koelle and colleagues have published an elegant analysis of activity in the egg-laying system of unrestrained animals (Collins et al.<italic>, eLife</italic> 2016). Importantly, neural activity that is uncorrelated with behavior is also seen in unrestrained animals, and we have tailored this part of our Discussion to describe the similarities between the activity we recorded in restrained animals and what is seen in unrestrained animals. We have also made clear that under the experimental conditions we used it is rare to see egg-laying events. These changes are in the first paragraph of the subsection “How T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input”.</p><p><italic>The final Discussion section hypothesizes that T type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels generally &quot;gate&quot; neuromodulation and therefore could be good drug targets for psychiatric diseases that seem to involve neuromodulation. This is an interesting idea, but I am not clear how one would achieve a very specific effect with such drugs since T type channels are presumably expressed very widely in the brain.</italic> </p><p>This is a fascinating question. T-type channels are expressed throughout the mammalian brain, and we show that they are also expressed widely in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where we see a very specific effect of a mutation on reproductive behavior. This is the basis for our speculation. We also note that several therapeutics indicated for specific affective or cognitive disorders act on widespread targets (lithium nicely treats mania and is thought to act on voltage-gated sodium channels; electroconvulsive therapy is used to treat major depression that is refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). But we agree with the reviewers’ suggestion and have altered the text to better address this point (subsection “T-type calcium channels might play a widespread role in gating the response to modulatory inputs to neural circuits”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it was not clear how the timing parameters for egg-laying were determined (the Methods says using MATLAB scripts, but it is not clear how these work).</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this, and we have clarified the Methods (subsection “Behavior assays”).</p><p><italic>Also, I'm not sure the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> illustrates the phenotype of the mutant very well; a histogram of interval times on a log scale would probably work better.</italic> </p><p>We have now included this as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and referred to this alternate representation of the data in the <bold>subsection “</bold><italic>n5209</italic> does not change the temporal structure of female reproductive behavior”and in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>13) I think it would have been useful for the authors to try to relate the behavioral phenotype to the neural phenotype seen in HSN calcium imaging. For instance, recent papers have linked individual egg-laying events to large calcium spikes in HSN, so perhaps the fact that the cca-1 mutations cause high frequency but low amplitude calcium activity in HSN is consistent with the lower rate of egg-laying within clusters that they observe behaviorally.</italic> </p><p><italic>14) In the calcium imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), were any egg-laying events observed? If so it would be interesting to see how they correlate with the calcium traces; if none were seen this should be noted.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we only observed one egg-laying event during our recordings, perhaps as a result of our recording conditions. As noted above in point #11, recent published work from Collins, Koelle and colleagues show that HSNs are active even when the animal is not laying eggs. We have related our observations to these published data in the Discussion (subsection “How T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
