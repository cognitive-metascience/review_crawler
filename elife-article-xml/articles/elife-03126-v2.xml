The large flight muscles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> develop from adult muscle progenitor (AMP) cells set-aside embryonically. The thoracic segments are all allotted the same small AMP number, while those associated with the wing-disc proliferate extensively to give rise to over 2500 myoblasts. An initial amplification occurs through symmetric divisions and is followed by a switch to asymmetric divisions in which the AMPs self-renew and generate post-mitotic myoblasts. Notch signaling controls the initial amplification of AMPs, while the switch to asymmetric division additionally requires Wingless, which regulates Numb expression in the AMP lineage. In both cases, the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc acts as a niche expressing the ligands Serrate and Wingless. The disc-associated AMPs are a novel muscle stem cell population that orchestrates the early phases of adult flight muscle development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03126.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03126.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03126.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscle tissues must grow and change to accommodate the needs of an animal at various stages in its life. For example, fruit flies begin life as larvae and their muscles must help them move their soft bodies. Later, when the flies mature into adults, the muscles must provide power for flight and support for the insects' external skeletons.</p><p>Like other animal tissues, muscles develop from non-specialized stem cells which at first have the potential to become almost any cell type, but later change to become more specialized. Studies of fruit flies, in particular, have yielded insights on how pools of stem cell are created and regulated. Fruit flies are small and easier to study than larger organisms, and as a result, scientists have learned a lot about their genetics and cell biology. Gunage et al. have now identified the stem cell pools that develop into flight muscle tissue, and found that these cells were set aside for the muscles when the fruit fly embryo was still developing.</p><p>Fruit flies have large forewings that power flight, and small modified hindwings (called halteres) that help the insect to balance when flying. Gunage et al. reveal that a small, but similar, number of cells are set aside to make both both the tiny muscles that will move the halteres and the much larger flight muscles that move the forewings. However, the cells that contribute to the flight muscles divide to give far more muscle progenitor cells than their haltere counterparts, and make a couple of thousand cells that eventually fuse to form muscle fibers.</p><p>Gunage et al. looked at how the flight muscle progenitors multiplied by genetically engineering some of the stem cells in fruit fly larvae so that when each cell divided, its two daughter cells would fluoresce with different colors. One daughter cell would glow green and the other glow red. Gunage et al. found that at first the cells multiply equally, with half the new cells coming from a ‘red’ stem cell and the other half from a ‘green’ cell—meaning that the number of cells increases exponentially. Later, the balance shifted so that either more red cells than green cells were produced, or vice versa. This results in a ‘linear’ increase in number of muscle progenitor cells. Furthermore, Gunage et al. identified the proteins that orchestrate the switch from equal to unequal multiplying of these cells at the different times points in the fruit flies’ development.</p><p>The next challenge is to see if these stem cells that form the muscles are also available for repair of mature muscle tissue after it is damaged. If this is so, these stems cells might perform a similar function to muscle satellite cells, which are found in the mature muscles of mammals and other vertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03126.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03126.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>numb</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunage</surname><given-names>Rajesh D</given-names></name><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large flight muscle of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are made by the regulated amplification of a newly identified stem cell population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells populations can expand exponentially through symmetric division or asymmetrically divide to self-renew and produce a daughter cell, which differentiates to contribute to tissue formation or regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoblich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Egger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76a">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7b">Brand and Livesey, 2011</xref>).

The molecular mechanisms of regulating stem-cell proliferation have been studied in neural-, intestinal-, hematopoietic- and epithelial-stem cells of vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tulina and Matunis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohlstein and Spradling 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takashima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farkas and Hutter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Homem and Knoblich 2012</xref>). The regulation of stem-cell proliferation is usually through signals from a ‘stem-cell niche’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordero et al., 2012</xref>). Significant progress in understanding these mechanisms of regulation of stem-cell proliferation and self-renewal has been made in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, in the developing optic lobe, stem cell-like neuroepithelial cells first increase in number through symmetric divisions and are then transformed into so-called neuroblasts which undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate differentiated neurons and glial cells in this part of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egger et al., 2011</xref>).

Myogenesis occurs in two phases; an embryonic one, which makes the muscles required for the larval life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bate et al., 1991</xref>) while a postembryonic phase leads to formation of muscle required for the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>). The AMPs, lineal derivatives of the mesoderm, are generated embryonically and proliferate postembryonically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bate et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1999</xref>). Little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the AMPs proliferate and to give rise to the large number of cells which are needed to contribute to the massive adult flight muscles. During late embryogenesis the AMPs required for the formation of flight muscles are set aside in the mesothoracic segment (T2) and those required for haltere muscle development in the metathoracic segment (T3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73a">Roy et al., 1997</xref>). The numbers of AMPs at this early stage in T2 and T3 are same but the AMPs in T2 proliferate profusely while those in T3 far less. Studies on the ‘four-winged-fly’ have clearly shown the key role played by the wing-disc ectoderm in regulating myoblast proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dutta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73a">Roy and VijayRaghavan 1997</xref>). Yet, the mechanisms that regulate the amplification of muscle precursors to generate large ‘pools of myoblasts’, a feature common to adult muscles in the fly as well as to vertebrate skeletal muscles, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>) have not been studied in the fly or indeed other systems.</p><p>In this report, we use clonal MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) techniques to study the proliferative activity of AMPs during postembryonic development. We focus on the AMPs associated with the wing imaginal disc in the second thoracic segment, which give rise to the large indirect flight muscles. We show that an initial amplification of the number of these AMPs occur through symmetric divisions and is followed by a switch to asymmetric divisions, in which the AMPs self-renew and generate postmitotic myoblasts required for the formation of adult myofibers. The sequential nature of these two division modes results in a change in the arrangement of AMP lineages from an initially monostratified layer adjacent to the wing disc epithelium to a markedly multistratified layer comprising both AMPs and their post mitotic myoblast progeny. While the initial amplification of AMPs through symmetric divisions is controlled by Notch signaling, the switch to the subsequent asymmetric division mode of AMP division additionally requires Wingless. In both cases the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc acts as a stem cell niche and provides the ligands, Serrate and Wingless, for the two signaling pathways that operate in the AMPs. We identify the AMPs as a novel muscle stem cell population whose proliferation pattern orchestrates the building of the large flight muscles in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wing disc associated AMPs proliferate during larval development to reach a population size of 2500</title><p>AMPs are lineal descendants of progenitor cells, derived from proneural gene-expressing equivalent groups in the embryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruiz-Gómez and Bate, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carmena et al., 1998</xref>). In the thoracic segments of the embryo, each of these progenitor cells divides asymmetrically to generate a muscle founder cell involved in embryonic myogenesis and an AMP which has active Notch (N) signaling and continues to express the mesodermal marker Twist (Twi). In contrast to their muscle founder cell siblings, the AMPs do not differentiate in the embryo; rather they are set aside and at the end of embryonic development become associated with the imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bate et al., 1991</xref>). The Twi-expressing AMPs associated with the wing imaginal discs co-express Vestigial (Vg) in late embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>). In the early embryonic stage (Stage11) Wg induced Dll (Distalless) expression leads to separation of the primordium for different discs and those for wing imaginal discs start expressing Vg and results in defining of the population for wing disc primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos-Ortega, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kubota et al., 2000</xref>). To determine the number of AMPs present in the thoracic segments at the end of embryogenesis, we identified these cells using <italic>Twi</italic>-GAL4 &gt; UAS-mCD8::GFP.</p><p>In each thoracic segment a total of approximately 10 cells were Twi-positive and dorsally located indicating that these correspond to the dorsal AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Williams et al., 1991</xref>; Creig and Akam et al., 1993). To further characterize the extent of post-embryonic proliferation of the flight-muscle AMPs, we determined the number of Twi-positive cells associated with the T2 wing disc at different larval stages. Immediately after larval hatching (24 hr AEL) a total of 10 (±2) Twi-positive cells were found on the wing disc implying that these had not yet initiated proliferative divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the late second instar stage (72 hr AEL) the number of Twi-positive cells associated with the wing disc had increased to approximately 250 (±15) and at the late third instar stage (144 hr AEL) approximately 2500 (±90) Twi-positive cells were found on the wing disc indicative of intense proliferative activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). We conclude that the 10 AMPs present on the wing disc at the end of embryogenesis and the beginning of larval development initiate a proliferation process during subsequent larval stages which results in some 2500 Twi-positive cells at the end of larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F,G</xref>). These findings suggest that each embryonically born AMP, on the average, would give rise to a lineage of approximately 250 cells during larval development.

Notably, even in the multistratified organization manifested in the third larval instar, PH3 positive cells were seen only in cells located adjacent to the epithelium and not in cells located in more distal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–D″</xref>). This implies that almost all mitotically active cells are located proximal to the disc epithelium, while the cells in the more distal layers are likely to be postmitotic. Taken together with the findings on cell division modes in the AMP lineages, these results also suggest that both symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions only take place in cells located adjacent to the wing disc epithelium.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03126.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Proliferating AMPs are located in a monolayer adjacent to the wing disc epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B′</bold>) Optical section of late second instar wing imaginal disc (∼72 hr AEL, schematic in <bold>A</bold> with AMPs in green), showing monostratified (single layer) arrangement of AMPs (marked in green and denoted as M for mesoderm, <bold>B</bold>) stained for Twi (anti-Twist, green), Dcad2 (anti-Dcad2, red) (Disc-epithelium [E]) and TO-PRO3 (a nuclear stain, blue). n = 10, Schematic in <bold>B′</bold>.

Centrosome position and, hence, the axis of cell division were revealed by a GFP-tagged peri-centrosomal (CNN-GFP) label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Megraw et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>Dmef2</italic>-Gal4 was used to drive UAS-CNN-GFP expression. Throughout the second instar stage, the axis of cell division in the mitotically active cells is oriented parallel to the surface of the wing disc epithelium such that both daughter cells remain in contact with the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H′</xref>). In contrast, from early third instar stage onward, the axis of cell division shows an oblique to orthogonal orientation relative to the disc surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L′</xref>). Consequently, only one of the two daughter cells remains in contact with the disc epithelium while the other daughter cell loses epithelial contact and, hence, might contribute to the population of cells located in layers distal to the disc epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Proliferating AMPs generate clones of postmitotic myoblasts localized in distal layers</title><p>Given that proliferative mitotic activity in the AMP lineages only takes place in the cells located next to the epithelium we performed experiments to confirm that the cells in the more distal layers are indeed their postmitotic progeny. For this, we first performed EdU (5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) incorporation experiments to visualize cells actively engaged in DNA replication as well as their progeny. EdU incorporation was carried out in early third instar larva (in a 5 hr pulse) and visualized in AMP cells on wing discs co-labeled with for Twi immunoreactivity. When cells were examined directly after EdU incorporation (pulse, no chase), labeling was only found in cells adjacent to the disc epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This result confirms the finding that mitotically active cells are located next to the epithelium. If the incorporation of EdU was followed by 48 hr without EdU (pulse, chase) and the cells then examined, labeling was seen in all layers. However, in this case, the majority of labeled cells were in the most distal layer, less labeled cells were in an intermediate layer and the lowest number of labeled cells was found in the layer adjacent to the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

In early larval development (first and second instar), AMPs undergo a marked amplification in cell number through symmetric divisions. These divisions are oriented parallel to the wing disc epithelium and hence the AMPs form a monolayer of proliferating cells that remain in contact with the disc epithelium. In late larval development (third instar) AMPs switch to an asymmetric mode of proliferative cell division in which they self-renew and generate postmitotic daughter cells. These asymmetric divisions are oriented obliquely to the wing disc surface such that the self-renewing daughter cells remain in contact with the disc epithelium while the postmitotic daughters become located in the more distal layer of non-replicating myoblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Notch signaling is required for proliferative activity of AMP lineages</title><p>Previous work has shown a requirement for Notch (N) in adult flight muscle development; in N mutants a depletion of wing disc myoblasts is seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anant et al., 1998</xref>).

Wingless (Wg) is a signaling protein that can act to control developmental patterning and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharma and Chopra, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zecca et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Amerogen and Nusse, 2009</xref>).

The haltere (T3) disc and the wing (T2) disc, start off with a similar numbers of myoblasts in the late embryo. Studies on muscle development in the ‘four-winged fly’, where the function of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is removed from the haltere disc, showed that AMP population is controlled by the disc-epidermis. When the haltere ectoderm is transformed to T2 with the AMPs continue to retain a T3 identity, the AMPs nevertheless transform to a T2 population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73a">Roy et al., 1997</xref>). Despite these early studies examining the role of signaling from the disc-ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>) in flight muscle specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schnorrer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>), the mechanism of population expansion have not been hitherto investigated. This is an important general problem as it addresses how diversification of internal tissues in segmented animals takes place.</p><p>Our results show that, in early development the AMPs on the wing-disc go through a phase of exponential amplification from about 10 cells to 250. This amplification, where the daughters of each stem are both stem cells, takes place by the division of cells parallel to the disc-epithelium stem-cell niche and requires Ser-N signaling. As the expression of Wg in the presumptive notum known to occur in the late second instar larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tomoyasu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>) changes in the AMPs proliferative behaviour are seen. A switch to asymmetric cell- division results in a ‘self-renewed’ stem cell and a post-mitotic sibling poised to differentiate to contribute to multinucleate muscles. The plane of cell division is no longer parallel to the ectoderm, resulting a stratified layer of cells, with the disc-proximal layer consisting of stem cells.</p><p>Our findings support a model in which the embryonically generated AMPs acting as postembryonic muscle stem cells generate adult-specific myoblasts in a two-step process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). AMPs initially manifest a symmetric cell division mode, which serves to amplify the progenitor pool in the first and second larval stages, and subsequently transit to an asymmetric cell division mode during the third larval stage during which they self-renew and generate the postmitotic myoblasts required for adult muscle formation. In both steps, signaling is required from the notum region of the wing disc epithelium, which acts as a transient niche. Thus, Ser localized in epithelial cells of the disc is necessary for activation of N signaling in AMPs throughout larval development, and diffusible Wg from the disc epithelial cells in the third larval instar is necessary for the expression of Nb in AMP lineages and, hence, for their transition from symmetric to asymmetric division modes. The idea of epithelium tissue as transient niche for the regulation of proliferation is something similar to that known in intestinal stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>). In this paper authors provide evidence for the role of progeny of ISC progenitor as a very transient signaling center regulating stem cell proliferation via decapentaplegic.</p><p>Since these findings reveal remarkable parallels to other tissue stem cell systems in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we consider the disc-associated AMPs to be a novel type of muscle stem cell that orchestrates the early phases of adult flight muscle development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is a newly identified and key role for Wg in the presumptive notum. Its other roles include a requirement for expression of the muscle-attachment gene <italic>stripe</italic> (<italic>sr)</italic>, in the presumptive notum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ghazi and VijayRaghavan, 2003</xref>) and for maintenance of the indirect-flight muscle marker Vg, in AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Wg causes this switch in cell- division pattern by the transcription of Nb in the stem-cell layer, and its asymmetric distribution by well-established mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Skeath and Doe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couturier et al., 2012</xref>) thereby inhibiting Notch activation in the post mitotic progeny.</p><p>Many types of tissue stem cells, in a manner similar to that shown here for the AMPs, have the capability of proliferating through symmetric cell divisions, thereby expanding the stem cell pool, and then switching to asymmetric cell divisions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe development, a set of 30–40 epithelial progenitor cells generated in the embryo begin to proliferate in a symmetric cell division mode during early larval development to generate a neuroepithelial cell pool of approximately 700 cells. These neuroepithelial cells sequentially transform into neuroblasts, which generate differentiated neural cells of the medulla through asymmetric divisions. This transition from symmetric to asymmetric divisions involves cellular events such as the reorientation of the mitotic spindle and multiple molecular signaling processes including the dynamic regulation of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>). Since this transition from symmetrical ‘proliferative’ divisions to asymmetrical ‘differentiative’ divisions is also manifest in neural stem cell pools of the developing retina and neural tube in vertebrates, it may be a general strategy for generating a large final number of differentiated progeny from a small initial number of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult intestine and that of the mouse are other examples of use of both modes of cell amplification in response to adult environmental inputs such as diet and consequent insulin-pathway signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Brien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yilmaz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results are consistent with the population of cells proximal to the epithelium being stem cells: These disc-proximal cells self-renew and also give rise to siblings, which differentiate. However, as of now, we do not have a marker that specifically labels these proposed stem cells. In this situation our results are also consistent with the view that the myoblasts are a pool of cells, in which only those closest to the signaling center receive signals that impact their division.</p><p>One of the characteristics of the relationship between stem cells and their niche is the orientation of cell-division. This ensures the balance between self-renewal and differentiation as progeny, which lose contact with the signaling niche, is canalized to a particular fate, whereas those still in contact remain as self-renewing stem cells. In germline stem cell (GSC) in the ovarioles and testis, the contact of stem cells with the tightly regulate stem cell number and coordinated maturation of the progeny to form gametes. Loss of regulation in this axis results in mis-regulated cell number amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">López-Onieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Losick et al., 2011</xref>). The intestinal stem cell niche in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> have a cryptic stem cell niche where a differentiating progeny signal back to the stem cell through EGF signaling, acting as mitogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang and Edgar, 2009</xref>). Neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are widely considered as neural stem cells as they are shown to go through a series of self-renewing divisions while siblings differentiating to form neurons. Remarkably, this is also seen in the culture, suggesting that this is an intrinsic property and not niche dependent. However, surrounding glia in vivo are proposed to have a regulatory effect on the stem cell abilities of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There have also been previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that address how stem cell division relates to regulation of population size. It is known from the studies in germline stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilboa and Lehmann, 2006</xref>) and neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egger et al., 2011</xref>) there is change in division rates during larval development. In the early instars there is an amplification that slows down in the third instar. The ovary of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> has 16–18 units, ovarioles, which are formed during the larval stages. Each ovariole contains two or three germline stem cells, which are in contact with somatic cells that regulate their establishment, maintenance and differentiation. For example, the developmental origin of the ovaries are the primordial germ cells (PGCs), which till the third instar contribute to most of the cells required for gonad formation and in pupal stage separate into ovarioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilboa and Lehmann, 2006</xref>). The numbers of PGCs double every 24 hr after hatching till the mid-third instar after which it slows down, finally forming 100 cells starting from12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilboa and Lehmann, 2006</xref>). Such examples and our results tempt us to speculate that an early amplification and a later slowing down maybe a general feature of regulation of stem cell proliferation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Our results and the underlying mechanisms could also be of general applicability in understanding myogenesis in other contexts. In vertebrates, the Hox identity of the ectoderm could influence proliferation in the mesoderm, in a manner similar to that observed by us, to create the appropriate population of progenitors for the morphogenesis of muscles of very different sizes. Our study suggests the testable hypothesis that vertebrate myoblast pools also develop by symmetric and asymmetric division of muscle progenitor stem cells.</p><p>In vertebrate muscle, satellite cells form a quiescent muscle stem-cell population important for the regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7a">Brack and Rando, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Le Grand and Rudnicki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Duojia Pan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Gunagee et al. investigated the growth and specification of adult muscle progenitor (AMP) cells of the large <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle. These cells are set aside during embryogenesis and undergo extensive proliferation in larval development to generate ∼2500 myoblasts associated with the wing-disc in the mesothoracic segment. They authors show that the AMPs undergo a series of symmetric divisions, regulated by Serrate-Notch signaling, resulting in their expansion. This is followed by a series of asymmetric divisions, regulated by Wg and numb, leading to presumably muscle cells. Their data therefore implicate the epidermal tissue of the wing imaginal disc as a stem cell niche that orchestrates the proliferation and differentiation of the AMPs.</p><p>Overall, this study is well conducted and should be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers raised several questions that the authors may consider for improvement.</p><p>1) A direct implication of the authors' model, which was not tested in the paper, is that loss of wingless from the wing disc should change the asymmetric division pattern of AMPs, which can be revealed by the two-color MARCM analysis as the authors have done for examining Serrate-Notch-signaling. This experiment would greatly strengthen the authors' model concerning the role of Wingless in the switch to asymmetric division.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-L</xref>, the authors showed that symmetric and asymmetric division phases correlate with orientation of the mitotic spindle. What the frequencies of the type of division shown here? Are 3E-G (similarly, 3I-K) derived from the same sample or different samples?

This experiment would greatly strengthen the authors' model concerning the role of Wingless in the switch to asymmetric division</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that we have not explicitly demonstrated that loss of Wingless from the wing disc causes change in the asymmetric division pattern of AMPs. While other data indirectly support this claim, we appreciate that showing this directly would greatly strengthen the proposed model. We have resolved this matter as described below and have modified the text accordingly and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9–figure supplement 2</xref>. (The experiment suggested by the reviewer demands substantial genetic recombination experiments bringing Wg alleles with the TWINSPOT fly. Our experience with such recombination experiments using the TWINSPOT flies always resulted in the loss of the one of the fluorescent protein coding genes culminating in the loss of one color. While this was frustrating alternative approaches fortunately worked. )</p><p>We have performed an experiment to understand the division pattern when the Wg pathway is downregulated. In the wild type, in early instars, the division axis is parallel to the epithelium. In the third instar there is a change in the division axis, effectively perpendicular to the epithelium and the division outcome is asymmetric. We down-regulated Wg function by overexpressing DNTCF and show by using CNN-GFP that the axis of the division in this background is parallel to the epithelium, similar to that seen in the early instars. Wg, in the presumptive notum is expressed only from the late 2<sup>nd</sup> instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>), therefore this result shows that down-regulation of Wg prevents the switch in cell-division orientation from parallel to the epithelium to perpendicular to the epithelium. This result greatly strengthens the results already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> that reduction of Wg signaling reduces Numb expression and also the layers of AMPs that come about as a consequence of asymmetric proliferation.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E-L</italic></xref><italic>, the authors showed that symmetric and asymmetric division phases correlate with orientation of the mitotic spindle.
