pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40070.001</object-id><p>The glymphatic system is a brain-wide clearance pathway; its impairment contributes to the accumulation of amyloid-β. Influx of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) depends upon the expression and perivascular localization of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Prompted by a recent failure to find an effect of <italic>Aqp4</italic> knock-out (KO) on CSF and interstitial fluid (ISF) tracer transport, five groups re-examined the importance of AQP4 in glymphatic transport. We concur that CSF influx is higher in wild-type mice than in four different <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO lines and in one line that lacks perivascular AQP4 (<italic>Snta1</italic> KO). Meta-analysis of all studies demonstrated a significant decrease in tracer transport in KO mice and rats compared to controls. Meta-regression indicated that anesthesia, age, and tracer delivery explain the opposing results. We also report that intrastriatal injections suppress glymphatic function. This validates the role of AQP4 and shows that glymphatic studies must avoid the use of invasive procedures.</p></abstract><kwd-group

The glymphatic system consists of three principal sequential anatomic segments: (i) CSF inflow along the perivascular spaces surrounding penetrating arteries, (ii) dispersion of CSF through the wider interstitium, and (iii) efflux of ISF along the large-caliber draining veins to re-enter the CSF within the ventricular and cisternal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). Ultimately, interstitial solutes cleared to the CSF exit the brain through meningeal lymphatic vessels flanking the venous sinuses, along cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and across the cribriform plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Louveau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>). Astrocytic endfeet ensheath the cerebral vasculature, and the abundantly expressed astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) localizes primarily to the perivascular endfoot membrane domain abutting the basal lamina. As this anatomic arrangement provides a route for rapid water movement between the perivascular space and the glial syncytium, AQP4 has been proposed to support perivascular fluid and solute movement along the glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nedergaard, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several groups have independently shown that the astrocytic AQP4 is essential for fast glymphatic transport. Iliff et al. demonstrated a significant suppression of both perivascular CSF tracer influx and interstitial mannitol and amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in <italic>Aqp4</italic> knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent work demonstrated that <italic>Aqp4</italic> gene deletion exacerbated glymphatic pathway dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and promoted the development of neurofibrillary pathology and neurodegeneration in the post-traumatic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>). Plog et al. similarly found that <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice exhibit slowed transport of interstitial solutes to the blood after TBI, reflected by a significant reduction in plasma biomarkers of TBI, including GFAP, neuron-specific enolase, and S100β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plog et al., 2015</xref>). Xu et al. reported that deletion of <italic>Aqp4</italic> exacerbated Aβ plaque accumulation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the APP/PS1 murine model of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Achariyar et al. found significantly reduced distribution of FITC-ApoE3, <sup>125</sup>I-apoE2, <sup>125</sup>I-apoE3, <sup>125</sup>I-apoE4, as well as <sup>14</sup>C-inulin in <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice following tracer injection to the CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achariyar et al., 2016</xref>). Lundgaard et al. reported that glymphatic clearance of lactate was reduced in <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lundgaard, 2016</xref>). Finally, Murlidharan et al. demonstrated that <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice exhibit significantly impaired clearance of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) infused into the ventricles, and concluded that glymphatic transport profoundly affects various aspects of AAV gene transfer in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murlidharan et al., 2016</xref>). A recent MRI study showed the AQP4 facilitator, TGN-073, potentiated the transport of interstitial fluid from the glia limitans externa to pericapillary Virchow-Robin space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huber et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The critical role of AQP4 in supporting perivascular CSF-ISF exchange was recently questioned in a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>, in which the authors failed to detect any reduction in CSF tracer influx into the brain parenchyma of <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Because a key element of the glymphatic hypothesis is the role of astroglial water transport in supporting perivascular CSF-ISF exchange, we consider it critical to re-examine the role of AQP4 in this process, with an aim to resolve the discrepant reports. Using data generated from five independent laboratories, we have undertaken such a re-evaluation of the effects of <italic>Aqp4</italic> deletion on perivascular glymphatic exchange. Results of this analysis consistently confirm that <italic>Aqp4</italic> deletion impaired perivascular glymphatic flow relative to that in wild-type mice. Our conclusion is strengthened by the use of four independently generated <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO lines, including the line used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>, as well as the α-syntrophin (<italic>Snta1</italic>) KO line, which lacks AQP4 perivascular localization despite normal expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amiry-Moghaddam et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref> also questioned the existence of tissue bulk flow based injecting tracers of varying molecular sizes into cortex or striatum. We questioned this approach based on the prior finding that traumatic brain injury is linked to an immediated and sustained reduction in CSF influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, our analysis showed that insertion of glass pipettes into the brain markedly reduced brain-wide CSF tracer influx. Thus, interstitial fluid transport should not be studied following invasive procedures in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study included data from five laboratories using four independently generated <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO lines and one <italic>Snta1</italic> KO mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thrane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2000</xref>).

We next sought to determine if parenchymal CSF influx kinetics are altered when perivascular AQP4 localization is lost. Here, we used dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to measure the influx of the contrast agent gadoteridol (Gad) into brain parenchyma after intracisternal injection. We performed serial T1-weighted imaging at 10 min intervals following administration of the contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–h</xref>). At 30 min after the start of the injection, elevated levels of Gad were detected in both WT mice and <italic>Snta1</italic> KO mice, particularly along the ventral surface of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e–f</xref>), but by 60 min Gad signal within the parenchyma of <italic>Snta1</italic> KO mice was significantly reduced compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h,n</xref>).

Taken together, these data illustrate a role for α-syntrophin in facilitating CSF-ISF exchange and, by extension, support the reported role of AQP4 in this process.

The tracers were delivered by glass pipettes inserted through a cranial burr hole. The surgical procedure associated with insertion of glass pipettes is obviously traumatic. Since acute and chronic traumatic injury markedly suppress CSF influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>), we questioned the validity of studying interstitial tracer dispersion using an invasive approach. To this end, we compared CSF tracer (BSA-647, 66 kDa) influx in three groups of mice anesthetized with KX: (i) controls with no surgery beyond CM injection, (ii) insertion of a glass pipette (12 µm diameter tip) and injection of 20 nl (4 nl/min) HiLyte 488-amyloid-β<sub>1-40</sub> in aCSF, or (iii) same as group two but HiLyte 488-amyloid-β<sub>1-40</sub> was not added to the 20 nl aCSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

The analysis showed that the two groups exposed to invasive surgery exhibited markedly suppressed CSF tracer influx compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The suppression of CSF tracer influx in animals with insertion of the glass pipettes was symmetric with no difference in tracer influx between the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemisphere (p &gt; 0.05, 3–5 slices per animal, n = 7, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These observations show that invasive procedures acutely suppresses brain-wide CSF influx and that tracer injection should not be used in the study of the glymphatic system.​</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Meta-analysis</title><p>A potential cause of conflicting results could be due to varying methodology used in each study.

Experiments were done in a total of 144 mice (92.4%) and rats (7.6%) from five different <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO lines (UIO: 50.7%; UCSF mouse: 25.7%; RIKEN: 9.03%, UCSF rat: 7.64%, and NMU: 6.94%) with a wide age range (6–24 weeks), the age of the rat line was not reported. Results were obtained using three different anesthetic protocols (ketamine/xylazine: 68.8%; tribromoethanol: 24.3%; chloral hydrate: 6.94%) and it was not possible to determine sex due to variable reporting. Experiments consisted of the delivery of fluorescently- (86.1%) and radioisotope-labeled (13.9%) tracers that ranged in size (4.5–70 kDa) and concentration. Tracer delivery varied in total volume (5–10 µl) and the injection rate (1–2 µl/min) while experiment duration ranged from 15 to 30 min. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were used in the meta-analysis to account for different outcome measures (e.g. fluorescence intensity, thresholded area, % injected radiation), and demonstrated a significant overall decrease in tracer entry in <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice compared to controls (SMD with 95% confidence interval: −1.70 [−2.49; −0.90]; p&lt;0.0001) with a high degree of interstudy heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 73.1%; p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Leave-one-out and meta-regression sensitivity analyses were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. As expected based on the direction and magnitude of the effect estimates reported in the studies, the high degree of heterogeneity was primarily caused by three datasets extracted from Smith et al. We could not confidently determine from the text of these studies whether these experimental figures were based on separate, independent experiments, or whether they were data collected in the same set of mice. Due to this uncertainty, we conducted leave-one-out analyses that would recapitulate all possible scenarios. The analysis showed that when these data sets were excluded, there was a reduction in heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 65.7%, 70.3%, and 71.4%; p = 0.0007, p = 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001). When all three data sets from this publication were excluded, the heterogeneity becomes non-significant (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.4622). Due to the relevance of this study, we included all data sets in the final results reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Using meta-regression to further explore sources of heterogeneity, we tested whether the: KO line, age, anesthesia type, tracer properties, injection paradigm, experiment duration, and detection method were significant covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The KO line used (p = 0.0001, Test of Moderators), the age of the mice (p = 0.0006), the anesthetic protocol (p &lt; 0.0001), and the injection rate (p &lt; 0.0001) explained a significant proportion of the observed variance between the datasets. The variables that explained the largest proportion of heterogeneity were anesthesia type and injection rate. The three data sets that reported null results used tribromoethanol (Avertin), an anesthetic that was not used in any other studies (all of which found a significant association). The same three data sets were also the only ones to report variable injection rates (10 µl delivered over 5–7 min) in comparison with the remaining studies that used exact injection rates. Thus, it is possible that the choice of anesthesia type and injection rate could explain the heterogeneity. Animal age was also a significant source of heterogeneity, accounting for 85.28% of the variance between studies. This may be in part explained by the fact that two out of the three data sets that demonstrated no association were completed in mice that were older than the mice used in the majority of other studies and reported the largest age range (12–24 weeks). Although it is not possible to determine the exact role that these covariates played in the observed results, both anesthesia and aging have been shown to modify the degree of intracisternal tracer entry, providing another potential explanation for the observed heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benveniste et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kress et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the heterogeneity stemming from the KO line may also be explained by the fact that the majority of UCSF KO mice (72.9%) were in the null studies. Interestingly, the fourth study (UNC, this report) that utilized the UCSF KO mouse line, but an alternate anesthetic (ketamine/xylazine) observed a significant effect. Unfortunately, due to low study number we were unable to include two covariates (e.g. anesthesia type and KO line) in the meta-regression to test this interaction. Additional covariates including tracer properties, the injection paradigm, and the detection method were not significant sources of heterogeneity suggesting that multiple experimental methodologies should be able to observe an effect between KO and control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7-2"><title>ISF efflux</title><p>There were nine eligible studies produced by four independent research groups that injected tracers or contrast agents into the brain of <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO or wild-type rodents in order to evaluate brain clearance or ISF efflux (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These experiments were conducted in a total of 87 rodents from both mouse (72.4%) and rat (27.6%) KO lines. There were two murine lines (UIO: 57.5%; UCSF: 14.9%) and one rat line (Beijing: 27.6%) generated by three separate groups. Age of the mouse lines ranged broadly (0–24 weeks), while the age of the rat line could not be confirmed but a weight range of 250–300 g was reported. Four anesthetic protocols were used for these experiments (ketamine/xylazine: 57.5%; hypothermia: 6.9%; tribromoethanol: 8.0%; sodium pentobarbital: 27.6%). Fluorescence-conjugated tracers (14.9%), radio-labeled (57.5%) tracers, and gadolinium-based contrast agents (27.6%) that ranged in size (0.18–45 kDa), concentration, and where they were delivered within the brain (striatum: 40.2%; cortex: 39.1%; thalamus: 13.8%; lateral ventricle: 6.9%). Tracer delivery varied in total volume (0.02–3 µl) and injection rate (0.017–3 µl/min), differing based on the injection site or whether the experiment was done in mice or rats. Experiment durations ranged between 45 and 240 min and one of the studies (Smith et al.) did not report this. Results from the overall meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in the transport of the injected substance in <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice relative to controls (−1.88 [-2.88; −0.87]; p = 0.0003) with high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 70.0%, p = 0.0008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Similar to the previous model, leave-one-out analysis of the two null datasets reduced the heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 60.1%; p = 0.0143 and I<sup>2</sup> = 65.3%; p = 0.0053, respectively) and removing both datasets made the heterogeneity non-significant (I<sup>2</sup> = 17.2%; p = 0.299). The same covariates used in the first model were used for meta-regression analysis, in addition to an injection site variable. Meta-regression was unable to identify significant sources of heterogeneity; most likely because of two datasets from Teng et al. that found a difference in thalamus, but not in striatum, in the same rat line using identical methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teng et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the potential biological significance of this, the study was the only one to use rats, MRI as the detection method, and had an experiment duration that was 4-fold longer than the other studies. Therefore, we decided to run a reduced model on all available mouse experiments using fluorescence or radioactivity detection methods. The meta-analysis was still highly significant and showed decreased clearance in the <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mouse lines (−1.92 [-3.02; −0.82]; p = 0.0006) with a lower degree of heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 64.1%, p = 0.0103). The KO line used (p = 0.0205), age (p = 0.0075), the anesthetic protocol (p = 0.0075), the injection rate (p = 0.0056), the experiment duration (p = 0.0075), and the detection method (p = 0.0205) explained a significant proportion of the observed variance between the datasets. Similar to previous results, tribromoethanol again seemed to function as a proxy for the null study from Smith et al. since none of the others used this anesthetic. The mouse KO line from UCSF explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity compared to the other lines, likely because the null dataset accounted for half of the studies that used this line. Age of the experimental animals was also a significant source of heterogeneity and can be explained by the wide age range (0–24 weeks) found between the studies but the lack of specific age reporting could also potentially explain this. Injection rate accounted for the largest proportion of heterogeneity in this analysis. The injection rate used by Smith et al. (5 × 100 ms pulses at 1 Hz and 10 psi), was highly significant in the meta-regression model compared to the reference injection rate (0.017 µl/min, p = 0.0007), whereas all other injection paradigms were not significantly different. The Smith paradigm was therefore the driver of the explanatory value of the injection rate covariate in the meta-regression model. Similar to anesthesia type, this variable also functioned as a proxy for the null study since all other datasets reported an exact volumetric injection rate. The reported injection protocol was used for experiments performed in both mice and rats despite different injection volumes (~20 nl vs. 30,000 nl) suggesting that the rate varied significantly between experiments. The time the tracer was allowed to circulate after the injection (experiment duration) was also a highly significant source of variation between studies. The experiment duration that accounted for all the heterogeneity was the unreported time from the null study. Only one separate study evaluated a time point that did not report a significant difference between KO and control (30 min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). However, this study did report a difference at 60 min after injection, so it is possible that if Smith et al. used shorter experimental durations this could account for the observed heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). The detection method (i.e. fluorescence and radioactivity) used was also found to be a significant source of heterogeneity. The largest contributor to heterogeneity were fluorescent detection methods, mostly likely due to the fact that the study that obtained a null result used this approach despite most studies using radiolabeled tracers. The remaining covariates: tracer properties, the injection volume, and the injection site were not significant sources of heterogeneity in this analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study evaluated the role of the astrocytic water channel AQP4 in the dispersion of fluorescent tracers or contrast agents by five independent groups.

A separate study by the OHSU group also found that reduced perivascular polarization of AQP4 was a significant predictor of AD status in postmortem human brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zeppenfeld et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Independent replication studies of biological phenomena are essential, both to confirm novel experimental findings, as well as to extend and refine initial observations and interpretations. The original report from the URMC group on the glymphatic system showed that deletion of astrocytic water channels suppressed both the influx of CSF tracers injected into the cisterna magna and the efflux of tracers infused directly into striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). Follow-up of that finding by the NMU group documented that Aβ accumulation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were significantly increased in a double-hit murine model with <italic>Aqp4</italic> deletion and Aβ over-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The URMC/OHSU groups subsequently reported that deletion of <italic>Aqp4</italic> aggravated neurofibrillary pathology following TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the UNC group showed that deletion of <italic>Aqp4</italic> significantly reduced clearance of AAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murlidharan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, these reports conceptually address the same idea, although the replications entailed different approaches and methodologies. The dissenting report from Dr. Verkman’s laboratory belongs to the rarer category of replication studies, which (as their title states) seeks to test directly the glymphatic hypothesis and the AQP4-dependence of solute transport in brain. Since their study was intended to gauge the veracity of the original findings, it should be expected that it follow the experimental design and data analysis of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picho et al., 2016</xref>), and their methodology should be presented in sufficient detail to allow the reader to assess the fidelity of their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brandt et al., 2014</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref> failed to meet these requirements in several key respects. First, their methodologies deviate from the original report in critical ways. In particular, Iliff et al. used ketamine/xylazine (KX) anesthesia rather than tribromoethanol (Avertin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). Xylazine is an α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist that blocks release of norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus projections across the neuraxis. This is an important point, because norepinephrine has been identified as the key humoral regulator of glymphatic solute transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), and norepinephrine attenuates glymphatic function. However, with the exception of the photo-bleaching experiments carried out only in WT mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref> anesthetized their mice with Avertin, an injectable anesthetic with an unknown mechanism of action. Avertin is not approved for use in several European countries and is restricted to terminal procedures in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arras et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer and Fish, 2005</xref>). The importance of the anesthetic agent in the present context was first highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Groothuis et al. (2007)</xref>, who reported that parenchymal solute efflux was 100-fold slower in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital than those that received ketamine/xylazine. Anesthesia-dependent effects were also noted by Benveniste et al., that reported a marked difference in influx of contrast agents in isoflurane-anesthetized animals versus low-dose isoflurane plus dexmedetomidine (an α<sub>2</sub> agonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benveniste et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of anesthesia is supported by the experiments reported here: The UNC group used ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and observed AQP4-dependent glymphatic transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), despite using the same <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mouse line as in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>. In addition, the methodology of Smith et al. was not presented in sufficient detail to assess the fidelity of the replication. Key methodological details, such as the injection approach and rate,anesthesia, or the age of the animals were not provided for data collected in rats. Neither did the investigators assess whether <italic>Aqp4</italic> was deleted in CNS albeit this was the first report utilizing <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO rats. In fact, no such data have been published so far to our knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). For these reasons, the present study is not a replication study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>. Instead, we used the methodology reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al. (2012)</xref> and further optimized it in subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kress et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iliff et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>It is also important to note that the recovery period that follows general anesthesia differs from the awake state. A recent study reported that increasing anesthesia concentration decreased glymphatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gakuba et al., 2018</xref>), as opposed to the original finding that the glymphatic system is maximally active during natural sleep or anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). However, the recent study injected CSF tracers under inhalation anesthesia followed by a short recovery period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gakuba et al., 2018</xref>). This is not a valid approach, because awakening from general anesthesia is associated with cognitive disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Numan et al., 2017</xref>) and inhaled anesthetics in particular are linked to a high rate of delirium upon emergence from anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brioni et al., 2017</xref>). Close evaluation of the imaging in Gakuba et al. shows a failed intracisternal injection, as enhancement of contrast agent is evident in the paraspinal muscles and extracranial spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gakuba et al., 2018</xref>). In our experience, experimenter error during cisterna magna injections is a significant source of variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xavier et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, careful consideration of the anesthesic regimen and long periods of post-anesthesia recoveries are essential when studying the glymphatic system.</p><p>The initial study articulating the glymphatic model confirmed seminal work by Cserr and colleagues that interstitial tracers are cleared from brain tissue at rates that are independent of molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cserr et al., 1981</xref>). While these early studies support the role of bulk flow in the clearance of interstitial solutes from the brain interstitium, they lacked the spatial resolution necessary to resolve whether bulk flow was occurring throughout the entire brain interstitium or was restricted to a subset of compartments permissive to flow. A large body of indirect experimental evidence supports the occurrence of bulk flow in the periarterial space in the brain (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hladky and Barrand, 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson and Hrabětová, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref> themselves provide such evidence, stating that 'occasionally, when the injected dextran entered the perivascular space of vessels near the injection site, both large and small dextrans traveled substantial distances away from the injection site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). There is also indirect evidence that this flow is peristaltic, propelled by pulsations of the arterial walls (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadaczek et al. (2006)</xref>). This mechanism has recently been confirmed by direct observations of pulsatile flow in periarterial spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedussi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mestre et al., 2018</xref>). Using two-photon microscopy and particle-tracking velocimetry, Mestre et al. gathered hundreds of thousands of velocity measurements at sampling rates up to 30 Hz over half hour experiments, mapping the perivascular flow in space and time in great detail: their results show that the flow pulses in synchrony with the heartbeat, is driven by pulsations of the arterial wall, and produces a net (average) flow in the same direction as the blood flow. This flow is in accordance with several earlier fluid-dynamic models and experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilston et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Olbricht, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rennels et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iliff et al., 2013b</xref>), and with in vivo dynamic imaging studies, including MRI experiments in human subjects, demonstrating the rapid distribution of CSF tracers into and through the brain interstitium along peri-arterial routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iliff et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eide and Ringstad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ringstad et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to perivascular spaces, white matter tracts also serve as permissive routes for interstitial solute and fluid movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohata and Marmarou, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg and Kyner, 1980</xref>).</p><p>As a consequence of the now well-established bulk flow along periarterial spaces, there must be an outlet for this directional flow: conservation of mass - as expressed by the continuity equation - demands that this volumetric flow must continue through other parts of the glymphatic system – that is, in the neuropil and the perivenous spaces. Although the full volumetric net flow must pass through the neuropil, flow speeds will be lower there because of the much larger total cross-sectional area of the available extracellular flow channels, and due to the availability of the gap junction-coupled astroglial syncytium as an intracellular route for water and solute movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asgari et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, a meta-analysis that include the more than 200 <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice and rats studied so far added further support to the finding that glymphatic influx and efflux are both highly dependent upon AQP4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). The meta-analysis identified the anesthesia protocol, wide age range of the experimental animals and the injection paradigm are potential causes for the conflicting data reported by Smith et al. However, it is important to note that glymphatic transport is affected by multiple pathways other than AQP4. For example, the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), brain injury in the setting of trauma or ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Holstein-Rathlou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2018</xref>), amyloid-β accumulation and acute amyloid-β toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2016</xref>), omega-3 fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2017</xref>), plasma osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Plog et al., 2018</xref>), and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kress et al., 2014</xref>) are important regulators of glymphatic transport. How AQP4 on a cellular level facilitates CSF-ISF exchange remains to be firmly established. The primary role of AQP channels is to lower the driving forces for fluid transport across the plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verkman et al., 2017</xref>). AQP4 is highly enriched in astrocytic endfeet facing the perivascular space and thus strategically positioned to facilitate CSF exchange with interstitial fluid. Accordingly, loss of the polarized expression of AQP4 in reactive astrocytes lead to a reduction in parenchymal CSF tracer influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iliff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kress et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, deletion of AQP4 potentiated the increases in intracranial pressure in a murine model of hydrocephalus consistent with the notion that AQP4 supports and facilitates intraparenchymal fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloch et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The claim by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith and Verkman (2018)</xref> that solute transport in the parenchyma is primarily driven by diffusion rather than convection (bulk flow) is based on their finding of a dependence of this transport on the size of the solute particles. They claim that diffusive transport depends strongly on particle size, whereas convective transport does not, so long as the ratio of the particle size to the pore or channel size is less than about 0.5. In support of this claim, they cite a single reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechadilok and Deen, 2009</xref>), which does not actually support their claim, but instead shows a significant dependence of flow resistance on particle size for much smaller particles. The influence of solutes or suspended particles on flow through narrow channels is a complicated problem in hydrodynamics, entailing many factors, including solute concentration, electrical charge, shape of the particle, channel geometry, tortuosity, and possible obstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson and Hrabětová, 2017</xref>). Hence, it would require a very sophisticated theoretical model to evaluate the role of bulk flow in the transport observed experimentally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>. Their findings are in general agreement with recent modeling studies suggesting that at the smallest microscopic scales, encompassing small numbers of vessels and the interposed neuropil, diffusion is sufficient to account for observed solute movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asgari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holter et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is important to note that these findings do not exclude a contribution of bulk flow within the entire interstitium, and do not determine whether the experimental approaches used to detect flow on the microscopic scale are sufficiently sensitive to detect bulk flow occurring at very low flow rates. Also, the majority of the studies contradicting the glymphatic model are based on theoretical modeling and not experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asgari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faghih and Sharp, 2018</xref>). We suspected that the surgical procedures required for intraparenchymal tracer injections utilized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref> might suppress influx of CSF tracers. To formally test this potential caveat, CSF tracer influx was analyzed in mice in which a glass pipette was inserted in striatum 1 hr earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The analysis showed that insertion of a glass pipette suppressed CSF tracer influx significantly and independently of intrastriatal injection of aCSF with or without HiLyte 488-amyloid-β<sub>1-40</sub> compared to non-surgical controls. We conclude that dispersion of tracers in CNS should not be studied using invasive procedures. Thus, as articulated by Holter et al. in their recent modeling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holter et al., 2017</xref>), there is a need to develop more appropriate technical approaches for evaluating slow interstitial bulk flow over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratner et al., 2017</xref>), such as DCE-MRI in nonhuman primates or human subjects. Until then, the glymphatic model of CNS fluid and solute flow should properly include the rapid exchange of CSF with the brain ISF along perivascular spaces, with CSF principally entering along peri-arterial spaces and ISF draining towards the ventricular and CSF compartments along peri-venous pathways and along cranial and spinal nerves, supported by AQP4-dependent astroglial water transport. On this last element, the present findings from five independent groups do not concur with the negative findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al. (2017)</xref>. Instead, our compiled data provides strong and consistent support for our claim that solute transport in the rodent brain is facilitated by the polarized expression of AQP4 in astrocytic endfeet.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The mean integrated optical density (MIOD) of TRd3 at a total of 80 sites were sequentially measured from 4 mm anterior to 8 mm posterior to the bregma. In addition, the telencephalon from five mice per genotype was cut into 100 µm coronal sections using a vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, washed, and cover-slipped with the slices coated in PBS/glycerol. Images of 6–8 coronal sections collected sequentially from 1.7 mm anterior to 0.7 mm posterior of the bregma were imaged by a Leica DM4000B digital microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) under a 1.25x objective, with uniform exposure time, offset, and gain. The distribution of the tracer (TRd3) was quantified using NIH Image J software as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, the fluorescent tracer coverage within the whole section was detected using the same threshold and constant settings for minimum and maximum intensities. Subregional analysis of CSF tracer distribution was analyzed in coronal section at the level of 0.5 mm anterior to the bregma. Tracer penetration along perivascular spaces and into brain parenchyma was quantified on high-magnification images of the hypothalamus, which were captured with 10x objective. The fluorescence intensity within the perivascular space was measured along large vessels (diameter &gt;20 µm) extending 500 µm below the brain surface. Two or three separate vessels from each image were analyzed and the data averaged.

Since these were evaluated using different outcome measures between fluorescence (fluorescence intensity and thresholding approaches), radioisotope, and MRI experiments we opted for a standardized mean difference (SMD) using the Cohen’s D method for the final analysis. After data was extracted, analysis was done in R (R-Project). Due to high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> &gt;70%), a random effects model was selected after attempting to reduce heterogeneity by implementing alternate standardized mean difference formulas (e.g. Glass’s delta, Hedge’s G); however, these attempts did not eliminate heterogeneity. Sources of heterogeneity were then explored using mixed-effects model meta-regression. Candidate predictors of heterogeneity included: anesthesia type, species, strain, age, tracer properties, injection properties, injection location, and experimental method. Inclusion of more than one covariate in the meta-regression resulted in model non-convergence due to the relatively small number of studies and the distribution of these factors across studies so covariates were included one at a time.

The main purpose of this particular report is to provide evidence that counters a previous report in <italic>eLife</italic> in which deletion of Aqp4 was found to have no effect on such solute movement. The reason that this matters is that the present authors use this evidence to support a major role for Aqp4 and astroglial endfeet in their hypothetical model of a 'glymphatic' system of active, astrocyte-assisted convection 'transport' of molecules along perivascular spaces for clearance. The authors have proposed (elsewhere) a critical role for this proposed system in clearance of β-amyloid.</p><p>In principle, I find the current work sufficiently well done, and the topic of sufficient importance and interest, that the results presented here warrant publication. Nevertheless, I also find that the authors markedly over-state certain aspects of their findings and use terms that are not supported by the findings. For this reason, there are a number of major specific concerns that need to be addressed before moving forward.</p><p>1) It is not appropriate to use the term &quot;Aqp4-dependent&quot; in the title, Abstract (second sentence), or anywhere else in the text. The results presented do not demonstrate a &quot;dependence&quot; of solute movement on Aqp4. The most direct and appropriate quantitative evaluation of the effects of Aqp4 deletion in this context appears in Figure 5 and shows an approximate reduction of only 25%. Although this reduction is significant, it is very far from absolute. There is still a majority of detectable solute movement in the absence of Aqp4. Based on this and the other results, the authors can at best say that Aqp4 &quot;facilitates&quot; solute transport, which is the term they use in the final sentence of their paper, or &quot;supports&quot;, which is the term they use at the end of the Abstract. The title should not say more than &quot;Aqp4-facilitated&quot;, or &quot;Aqp4-supported&quot;.</p><p>2) As a biologist, I am also not comfortable with the use of the word 'transport' in the manner being done throughout this paper. To me, 'transport' is a term used in biology for something that requires energy and occurs across a barrier, for example transport of molecules across a membrane assisted by a transporter molecule. Here, there is no obvious barrier to the movement of solutes, and there is no obvious requirement for energy to assist what is essentially the passive movement of solutes along a convection flow of fluid current or along a concentration gradient. I would argue that the term 'transport' should also not be used in the title or anywhere in the paper and should be substituted with 'movement' or flux. To me there is a clear distinction between the transport of water across the membrane via Aqp4 and the flow of ISF and the movement of solutes, which to me does not constitute 'transport'. It is noteworthy that the present authors generally use the term 'movement' of solutes throughout the main text. I would be interested to hear other reviewers' comments about this, and of course the authors can provide arguments that they think justify the use of the term 'transport'.</p><p>3) NMU data, Figure 2. The results of this experiment seem selectively quantified and over generalized. I am not convinced that the two survey images in 2A show equivalent regions of the brain in the WT and <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. To me it seems likely that the two images shown may be misleading. Both survey images show that the most intense labeling occurs in the subarachnoid space and that this is far more intense along the ventral brain surface. The WT image (left) is clearly taken from a frontal region where there is intensely labeled subarachnoid space between the two hemispheres. In contrast, the <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> image appears to be taken from a region that is relatively similar, but far enough posterior that the hemispheres have already joined and there is no subarachnoid space between the hemispheres. If this is the case, then the comparison is misleading and inappropriately exaggerates the visual appearance of fluorescence intensity in favor of the WT mouse. The images presented are pixelated and blurry, so that the precise location is not readily detectable in the absence of a counterstain such as DAPI. This comparison matters because if the author used these sections for their quantification, that too will have been skewed in favor of the WT mice. The authors need to present images where it is clear to see that they have been take from precisely the same region and where the selective presence of midline subarachnoid tissue does not bias the interpretation in favor of one mouse versus another. In addition, the authors should ensure that this type of bias did not occur in the quantification. The main text states that Figure 2b is taken from hypothalamus, whereas the legend says it is taken from hippocampus. Clearly there is a brain surface involved and so hippocampus seems unlikely. Ideally it would be preferable for the authors to show high magnification images taken from the same sections that are shown in the survey images, and to indicate by using boxes on the survey images where the high magnification images were taken from. Regarding the quantification, the individual data points for each animal should be shown in all of the graphs to represent the scatter. The authors should also indicate which cortical region was used for the perivascular space and parenchymal measurements. Ideally this would correspond to the areas shown in the images. From the results it appears that the measurements were taken only from a ventral brain region. This is somewhat misleading. The survey images that are provided suggest that the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the brain exhibit almost no differences in the penetration of fluorescence from the subarachnoid space. I think other cortical regions should be evaluated from other regions where on the survey images there appears to be no difference in the degree of fluorescence penetration in the WT and <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. If this is not done, then the authors should discuss why there are such large differences in cortical areas and why they feel it is appropriate to select only the region with the largest difference and then generalize their conclusions from this region to the whole brain. Lastly, the authors should make an explicit statement that they ensured that all images used for comparison were collected and evaluated using the same settings for fluorescence intensity and contrast etc.</p><p>4) Individual data points must be added to all graphs in all figures. At present it is not possible to judge the scatter and variation of most of the data. This applies to Figures 2, 3, 4 and 6. This information was provided for the present Figure 5 and was also provided for all data in the Smith et al. paper whose work is being challenged. It is a requirement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General comments:</p><p>1) In this group of studies, the authors address intracranial fluid flow including CSF influx to the brain after delivery of tracers to the cisterna magna and tracer transport after injection into the interstitial fluid in the brain parenchyma in four independently generated Aqp4 KO lines as well as an α-syntrophin KO line.</p><p>2) Compilation of data from the five independently-conducted experiments showed that deletion or mislocalization of AQP4 suppressed the influx of CSF tracers or contrast agents.</p><p>3) The authors interpret these data as supportive evidence for the glymphatic model in which astroglial water transport via AQP4 supports the perivascular influx of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and the efflux of interstitial space fluid (ISF).</p><p>4) The heterogeneity of the individual studies has to be taken into consideration. The authors do address the concern of conflicting results due to varying methodology used in each study. The paper would be improved if the same methodologies were performed for the independently generated Aqp4 KO lines.</p><p>5) Most critically: (1) the authors' hypothesis that anesthetic effects (tribromoethanol vs. ketamine/xylazine) account for the difference between Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017) results and the current findings is not tested; and (2) no further data are provided in support of the AQP4 dependence of parenchymal clearance of solutes (brain to CSF efflux), as all of the data in the current manuscript relate to CSF to brain penetration (influx).</p><p>6) Please see specific comments below.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) NMU group injected fluorescent tracer Texas Red-dextran intracisternally which displayed reduced influx in the Aqp4 KO mice as shown in Figure 2 following a thirty-minute infusion. However, this group did not detail location of individual slices collected (6-8 per mouse) as described by the RIKEN group in Figure 3D and UNC group in Figure 4D. These methodological details should be clarified.</p><p>2) The authors claim that &quot;High magnification imaging of the hypothalamus revealed that Aqp4 KO impaired the influx…(Figure 2B)&quot; but Figure 2B is neither high magnification nor does it clearly show the hypothalamus. More data would be required to assess this claim.</p><p>3) RIKEN and Keio group claim to show that BDA distribution was compromised in Aqp4 KO mice following infusion in Figure 3. However, details of infusion (they say &quot;infusion&quot; in Figure 3A but &quot;injection&quot; in the figure legend) are not clear. Also, was only 1 time point (30 min) performed?</p><p>4) Figure 3B is not convincing for a difference between WT and Aqp4 KO.</p><p>5) Figure 3C could have been formatted more appropriately to give more clarity (configured similar to Figure 2D). Depth at half-maximum intensity is shown in Figure 3E whereas fluorescence intensity at multiple distances from the brain surface could have provided more information if demonstrated better in Figure 3C. Thus, measurement criteria for penetration depth are heterogeneous across Figures 3C-E.</p><p>6) UNC group used the same Aqp4 KO line used in Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017) in order to assess the reproducibility of the experiments by using methodology reported by Iliff et al. (Iliff et al., 2012). A main justification for disputing the dissimilarity of results is the anesthesia used in the Smith et al. study. The authors argue that the use of tribromoethanol (Avertin) could have effected parenchymal solute efflux yet they didn't test this themselves. It would have been valuable for the UNC group to perform the same experiments using both ketamine/xylazine and tribromoethanol to further support their conclusions. This should have been performed to directly test the idea that the disparity in results is anesthetic state dependent.</p><p>7) URMC group claims to show (Figure 5) that Aqp4 deletion reduces entry of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated BSA from CSF to brain. However, comparison of Figures 5E and 5G and 5F and 5H does not show a convincing difference.</p><p>8) In addition, they only looked at mean pixel intensity (MPI) relative to bregma (Figure 5I) and depth was not taken into consideration, unlike the data in other figures in this manuscript. It would have been beneficial to look at MPI respective to definitive depths over a relative distance. This would be a more direct measurement of extent or depth of penetration.</p><p>9) OHSU used the Snta1 KO mouse line to access the role of perivascular astrocytic localization of Aqp4 in mediating CSF flux into the parenchyma using DCE-MRI following intracisternal injection of gadoteridol. Figure 6 successfully demonstrates reduced accumulation of Gad in Snta1 KO mice across multiple brain regions.</p><p>10) However, Gad is a contrast agent and is not a direct measure of CSF flow itself, thus the conclusion that α-syntrophin facilitates CSF-ISF exchange is not clearly supported.</p><p>11) Also, again there is potential confusion created by using both the terms &quot;injection&quot; and &quot;infusion&quot; to describe the experiments (subsection “OHSU: Reduced glymphatic CSF influx in Snta1 KO mice with loss of polarized expression of AQP4 in vascular endfeet of astrocytes”), this should be corrected.</p><p>12) All of the experiments done in this paper involve penetration of tracers from CSF injection/infusion into brain parenchyma. None of the experiments directly tests the <italic>clearance</italic> of intraparenchymally infused agents from brain to CSF. This was a prominent finding of Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017), that there was no significant difference in clearance of solutes in AQP4 KO mice following intraparenchymal infusion. In other words all experiments in this manuscript are CSF to brain, but the claims are bidirectional (Figure 7) that there is also decreased ISF clearance from brain to CSF in the absence of AQP4. Why did none of the current experiments investigate or substantiate this claim?</p><p>13) The Discussion reiterates the fact that the UNC group were unable to replicate Smith's findings however they did not follow Smith's methodologies so reproducibility is debatable since methods deviated. This omission reduces the claim of the current manuscript to be a &quot;refutation&quot; of Smith et al.'s findings.</p><p>14) An obvious experiment that would eliminate the effects of anesthesia would be to implant an infusion catheter in the cisterna magna and allow animals to recover for several days, and then carry out infusion of tracers in the complete absence of any anesthesia whatsoever and then rapidly perfuse at different time points and assess parenchymal penetration depth criteria. While this may be technically difficult in mice, stereotactically targeted infusions have been performed in awake behaving mice in many locations, and in any event this would be feasible in rats (and AQP4 KO rats have been described). This experiment would clearly move the field forward beyond disparate data relative to anesthetic usage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40070.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A number of critical issues must be resolved before a final decision can be made regarding publication</p><p>Data issues</p><p>The images of the wild type and APQ4-/- muse shown in Figure 2A, B must be from the same brain areas and must be in good focus and have high dynamic range (you may consider taking the logarithm of the image or using γ ~ 0.5).

The term “dependent” is commonly used when the dependence is on more than one variable. For example, in the thermodynamics of simple substances, any one thermodynamic variable can be expressed as a function of any two of the other thermodynamic variables, and it is perfectly correct to say, for example, that the density of a gas is “temperature-dependent” when we know that it also depends on the pressure. In the more complicated case of glymphatic flow, the flow no doubt depends on several variables, and we have shown that Aqp4 expression is certainly one of them. The primary purpose of our paper is to refute the claims in the Smith et al., 2017 paper, which claims that solute transport is “aquaporin-4-independent” in its title: therefore, it is highly appropriate that we use the term &quot;Aqp4-dependent&quot; in our title. If we were to use a different term, it would be confusing to the readers.</p><p>For clarity, we have in response to the reviewer’s comment added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that glymphatic transport is affected by multiple pathways other than AQP4. For example, the sleep-wake cycle (Xie et al., 2013), brain injury in the setting of trauma or ischemia (Iliff et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017), exercise (He et al., 2017; von Holstein-Rathlou, Petersen and Nedergaard, 2018; Yin et al., 2018), amyloid-β accumulation and acute amyloid-β toxicity (Xu et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016), omega-3 fatty acids (Ren et al., 2017), plasma osmolarity (Plog et al., 2018), and aging (Kress et al., 2014) are important regulators of glymphatic transport.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To emphasize the mass action nature of water transfer, please use &quot;flux&quot; rather than &quot;transport&quot;, which implies direct energy usage (as in an ATP driven ion exchange).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully argue that it is preferable to retain the term “transport” in the title of our paper and in the text, with the following justification. We are dealing with bulk flow in an organ (brain) and not carrier or pump mediated transport across a plasma membrane. We use the term precisely as it is used in most papers dealing with solute transport in the brain. Indeed, the primary purpose of our paper is to refute the claims in the Smith et al., 2017 paper, which itself uses the term &quot;transport&quot; in its title (&quot;Test of the 'glymphatic' hypothesis demonstrates diffusive and aquaporin-4-independent solute transport in rodent brain parenchyma&quot;) and in the first sentence of its Abstract (&quot;Transport of solutes through brain involves diffusion and convection&quot;). It would be inconsistent and confusing if we were to replace &quot;transport&quot; with a different term in our title. There is a long list of papers that use the term transport in the same context that we have: for example, it is used in the titles of several papers that we cite in our paper (the papers by Asgari et al., Benveniste et al., Holter et al., Murlidharan et al., Plog et al., Ratner et al., and Schley et al.). Also, we point out that the reviewer is incorrect in stating that there is no energy requirement to assist in the movement of solutes along a convective flow: the flow itself requires energy to drive it, in the form of the work done by pressure forces to overcome the resistance due to viscosity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>State explicitly that in this report, all of the data is on influx of CSF as part of the proposed glymphatic system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the sentence: “This study focused on re-evaluating the role AQP4 in glymphatic influx of CSF tracers”. In addition, we assessed how intraparenchymal tracer injection affected CSF tracer influx. The latter analysis was included, because the Smith et al., publication refuted the existence of bulk flow based on dispersion of tracers delivered by intraparenchymal injection. We replicated the procedures used by Smith et al. but analyzed its effect of CSF tracer influx. Our analysis showed that the procedures associated with intraparenchymal injection – including preparation of a cranial burr hole, penetration of dura with the glass pipette and tissue injury when the pipette is inserted – consistently suppressed CSF tracer inflow. Based on these observations, we conclude that it is not possible to establish whether convective flow exists in the tissue based on the acute invasive procedures utilized in the Smith et al., 2017 publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please answer all questions from the specific comments of Reviewer #2.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] In principle, I find the current work sufficiently well done, and the topic of sufficient importance and interest, that the results presented here warrant publication. Nevertheless, I also find that the authors markedly over-state certain aspects of their findings and use terms that are not supported by the findings. For this reason, there are a number of major specific concerns that need to be addressed before moving forward.</p><p>1) It is not appropriate to use the term &quot;Aqp4-dependent&quot; in the title, Abstract (second sentence), or anywhere else in the text. The results presented do not demonstrate a &quot;dependence&quot; of solute movement on Aqp4. The most direct and appropriate quantitative evaluation of the effects of Aqp4 deletion in this context appears in Figure 5 and shows an approximate reduction of only 25%. Although this reduction is significant, it is very far from absolute. There is still a majority of detectable solute movement in the absence of Aqp4. Based on this and the other results, the authors can at best say that Aqp4 &quot;facilitates&quot; solute transport, which is the term they use in the final sentence of their paper, or &quot;supports&quot;, which is the term they use at the end of the Abstract. The title should not say more than &quot;Aqp4-facilitated&quot;, or &quot;Aqp4-supported&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by the objection to our use of the term &quot;Aqp4-dependent.&quot; The critique rests on the assertion that we can only use the term if the solute movement depends <italic>only</italic> on Aqp4, which we do not claim. The term “dependent” is commonly used when the dependence is on more than one variable. For example, in the thermodynamics of simple substances, any one thermodynamic variable can be expressed as a function of any two of the other thermodynamic variables, and it is perfectly correct to say, for example, that the density of a gas is “temperature-dependent” when we know that it also depends on the pressure. In the more complicated case of glymphatic flow, the flow no doubt depends on several variables, and we have shown that Aqp4 concentration is certainly one of them. The primary purpose of our paper is to refute the claims in the Smith et al., 2017 paper, which claims that solute transport is “aquaporin-4-independent” in its title: therefore, it is highly appropriate that we use the term &quot;Aqp4-dependent&quot; in our title. If we were to use a different term, it would be confusing to the readers.</p><p>For clarity, we have in response to the reviewer’s comment added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that glymphatic transport is affected by multiple pathways other than AQP4. For example, the sleep-wake cycle (Xie et al., 2013), brain injury in the setting of trauma or ischemia (Iliff et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017), exercise (He et al., 2017; von Holstein-Rathlou, Petersen and Nedergaard, 2018; Yin et al., 2018), amyloid-β accumulation and acute amyloid-β toxicity (Xu et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016), omega-3 fatty acids (Ren et al., 2017), plasma osmolarity (Plog et al., 2018), and aging (Kress et al., 2014) are important regulators of glymphatic transport.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As a biologist, I am also not comfortable with the use of the word 'transport' in the manner being done throughout this paper. To me, 'transport' is a term used in biology for something that requires energy and occurs across a barrier, for example transport of molecules across a membrane assisted by a transporter molecule. Here, there is no obvious barrier to the movement of solutes, and there is no obvious requirement for energy to assist what is essentially the passive movement of solutes along a convection flow of fluid current or along a concentration gradient. I would argue that the term 'transport' should also not be used in the title or anywhere in the paper and should be substituted with 'movement' or flux. To me there is a clear distinction between the transport of water across the membrane via Aqp4 and the flow of ISF and the movement of solutes, which to me does not constitute 'transport'. It is noteworthy that the present authors generally use the term 'movement' of solutes throughout the main text. I would be interested to hear other reviewers' comments about this, and of course the authors can provide arguments that they think justify the use of the term 'transport'.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully argue that it is preferable to retain the term “transport” in the title of our paper and in the text, with the following justification. We are dealing with bulk flow in an organ (brain) and not carrier or pump mediated transport across a plasma membrane. We use the term precisely as it is used in most papers dealing with solute transport in the brain. Indeed, the primary purpose of our paper is to refute the claims in the Smith et al., 2017 paper, which itself uses the term &quot;transport&quot; in its title (&quot;Test of the 'glymphatic' hypothesis demonstrates diffusive and aquaporin-4-independent solute transport in rodent brain parenchyma&quot;) and in the first sentence of its Abstract (&quot;Transport of solutes through brain involves diffusion and convection&quot;). It would be inconsistent and confusing if we were to replace &quot;transport&quot; with a different term in our title. There is a long list of papers that use the term transport in the same context that we have: for example, it is used in the titles of several papers that we cite in our paper (the papers by Asgari et al., Benveniste et al., Holter et al., Murlidharan et al., Plog et al., Ratner et al., and Schley et al.).

The results of this experiment seem selectively quantified and over generalized. I am not convinced that the two survey images in 2A show equivalent regions of the brain in the WT and Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. To me it seems likely that the two images shown may be misleading. Both survey images show that the most intense labeling occurs in the subarachnoid space and that this is far more intense along the ventral brain surface. The WT image (left) is clearly taken from a frontal region where there is intensely labeled subarachnoid space between the two hemispheres. In contrast, the Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup> image appears to be taken from a region that is relatively similar, but far enough posterior that the hemispheres have already joined and there is no subarachnoid space between the hemispheres. If this is the case, then the comparison is misleading and inappropriately exaggerates the visual appearance of fluorescence intensity in favor of the WT mouse. The images presented are pixelated and blurry, so that the precise location is not readily detectable in the absence of a counterstain such as DAPI. This comparison matters because if the author used these sections for their quantification, that too will have been skewed in favor of the WT mice. The authors need to present images where it is clear to see that they have been take from precisely the same region and where the selective presence of midline subarachnoid tissue does not bias the interpretation in favor of one mouse versus another. In addition, the authors should ensure that this type of bias did not occur in the quantification. The main text states that Figure 2b is taken from hypothalamus, whereas the legend says it is taken from hippocampus. Clearly there is a brain surface involved and so hippocampus seems unlikely. Ideally it would be preferable for the authors to show high magnification images taken from the same sections that are shown in the survey images, and to indicate by using boxes on the survey images where the high magnification images were taken from. Regarding the quantification, the individual data points for each animal should be shown in all of the graphs to represent the scatter. The authors should also indicate which cortical region was used for the perivascular space and parenchymal measurements. Ideally this would correspond to the areas shown in the images. From the results it appears that the measurements were taken only from a ventral brain region. This is somewhat misleading. The survey images that are provided suggest that the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the brain exhibit almost no differences in the penetration of fluorescence from the subarachnoid space. I think other cortical regions should be evaluated from other regions where on the survey images there appears to be no difference in the degree of fluorescence penetration in the WT and Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. If this is not done, then the authors should discuss why there are such large differences in cortical areas and why they feel it is appropriate to select only the region with the largest difference and then generalize their conclusions from this region to the whole brain. Lastly, the authors should make an explicit statement that they ensured that all images used for comparison were collected and evaluated using the same settings for fluorescence intensity and contrast etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for raising this critique. We have addressed all issues in the revised manuscript. We are providing the requested detailed information with regard to slice collection and imaging of WT and Aqp4 KO mice in the Materials and methods section. The high magnification images of the hypothalamus have been marked in the low magnification images. We also performed a subregional analysis of CSF tracer in the ventral, lateral and dorsal parts of the forebrain. All data are now displayed as scatter plots. Furthermore, an additional data set has been included. The distribution of CSF tracer (TRd3) at the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the whole-brain is now compared in WT and <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice using ex vivo near infrared fluorescence imaging. The corresponding images, quantitative data, and methodological description have been added. To facilitate the review, the new Materials and methods section is as follows:</p><p>“Tissue processing and image analysis of fluorescent tracer. A subset of WT and Aqp4KO brains (N = 4 per genotype) were scanned by an ex vivo near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging system (Azure biosystems c600, CA, USA). […] The imaging and subsequent analysis was performed by an investigator who was blind to animal genotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Individual data points must be added to all graphs in all figures. At present it is not possible to judge the scatter and variation of most of the data. This applies to Figures 2, 3, 4 and 6. This information was provided for the present Figure 5 and was also provided for all data in the Smith et al. paper whose work is being challenged. It is a requirement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, individual data points are now displayed in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Specific comments:</p><p>1) NMU group injected fluorescent tracer Texas Red-dextran intracisternally which displayed reduced influx in the Aqp4 KO mice as shown in Figure 2 following a thirty-minute infusion. However, this group did not detail location of individual slices collected (6-8 per mouse) as described by the RIKEN group in Figure 3D and UNC group in Figure 4D. These methodological details should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The methodological details of section collection and imaging analysis have been added to the revised manuscript. The requested data has been added to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that &quot;High magnification imaging of the hypothalamus revealed that Aqp4 KO impaired the influx…(Figure 2B)&quot; but Figure 2B is neither high magnification nor does it clearly show the hypothalamus. More data would be required to assess this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the data analysis presented in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RIKEN and Keio group claim to show that BDA distribution was compromised in Aqp4 KO mice following infusion in Figure 3. However, details of infusion (they say &quot;infusion&quot; in Figure 3A but &quot;injection&quot; in the figure legend) are not clear. Also, was only 1 time point (30 min) performed?</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the figure legend to indicate that tracer is introduced by continuous “injection”. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In Figure 3A, we now added a blue horizontal bar to indicate the timing and duration of tracer injection. In the respective Materials and methods section, as well as in Figure 1, and in ‘Supplementary file 1’, we have indicated that the CM injection lasted 10 minutes. Yes, the analysis was performed at a single 30 min time point, in line with all the other groups in this submission. This is also the same time point used by both Iliff et al., 2012 and Smith et al., 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3B is not convincing for a difference between WT and Aqp4 KO.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the dynamic range of the micrographs in Figure 3B to visualize tracer penetration in the parenchyma. The same dynamic range was applied for both WT and <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3C could have been formatted more appropriately to give more clarity (configured similar to Figure 2D). Depth at half-maximum intensity is shown in Figure 3E whereas fluorescence intensity at multiple distances from the brain surface could have provided more information if demonstrated better in Figure 3C. Thus, measurement criteria for penetration depth are heterogeneous across Figures 3C-E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now reanalyzed and presented our data in a similar style as Figure 2D/E to indicate fluorescence intensity from the brain surface at multiple distances. Indeed, the half distance measure is rather confusing, and we agree that analyzing from the depth 100 µm gives a better insight of tracer penetration difference between WT and <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. For this very reason, we now drop Figures3D and E. A new plot, featuring parenchymal fluorescence signal intensity of layer 2 and below, is displayed as Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) UNC group used the same Aqp4 KO line used in Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017) in order to assess the reproducibility of the experiments by using methodology reported by Iliff et al. (Iliff et al., 2012). A main justification for disputing the dissimilarity of results is the anesthesia used in the Smith et al. study. The authors argue that the use of tribromoethanol (Avertin) could have effected parenchymal solute efflux yet they didn't test this themselves. It would have been valuable for the UNC group to perform the same experiments using both ketamine/xylazine and tribromoethanol to further support their conclusions. This should have been performed to directly test the idea that the disparity in results is anesthetic state dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that anesthesia is a big factor contributing to the variability. In fact, we have studied in detail the effect of anesthesia on the glymphatic system in a separate submission to another journal. We uploaded the manuscript (Hablitz et al.) as a Related Manuscript File when the manuscript was originally submitted. This manuscript compares glymphatic influx in mice anesthetized with 6 different anesthetic agents. The study included more than 100 mice and documents that ketamine/xylazine is the preferable anesthetics in the study of the glymphatic system. CSF tracer influx under tribromoethanol anesthesia (the one used in Smith et al.) is consistently lower than in ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. We have uploaded the submitted manuscript (Hablitz et al.) again, with the intent that the reviewers have access to it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) URMC group claims to show (Figure 5) that Aqp4 deletion reduces entry of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated BSA from CSF to brain. However, comparison of Figures 5E and 5G and 5F and 5H does not show a convincing difference.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comments, Figure 5 has been updated. We have included an independent replication of the original experiment. In this experiment, we used a novel in vivo transcranial imaging approach to evaluate CSF tracer influx between wildtypes and <italic>Aqp4</italic> KO mice in Figure 5A and B. We also included a Texas Red 3 kDa dextran tracer in addition to BSA-647 in Figure 5C-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In addition, they only looked at mean pixel intensity (MPI) relative to bregma (Figure 5I) and depth was not taken into consideration, unlike the data in other figures in this manuscript. It would have been beneficial to look at MPI respective to definitive depths over a relative distance. This would be a more direct measurement of extent or depth of penetration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, we have now included a tracer penetration depth analysis in Figure 5H and I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) OHSU used the Snta1 KO mouse line to access the role of perivascular astrocytic localization of Aqp4 in mediating CSF flux into the parenchyma using DCE-MRI following intracisternal injection of gadoteridol. Figure 6 successfully demonstrates reduced accumulation of Gad in Snta1 KO mice across multiple brain regions.</p><p>10) However, Gad is a contrast agent and is not a direct measure of CSF flow itself, thus the conclusion that α-syntrophin facilitates CSF-ISF exchange is not clearly supported.</p></disp-quote><p>Gadoteridol is similar to the fluorescent tracers used in optical imaging studies here employed as a CSF tracer. It is not possible to image water itself and tritiated water moves too quickly across the BBB (seconds) for data collection. Thus, all prior studies are similar to this study based on quantification of tracer dispersion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Also, again there is potential confusion created by using both the terms &quot;injection&quot; and &quot;infusion&quot; to describe the experiments (subsection “OHSU: Reduced glymphatic CSF influx in Snta1 KO mice with loss of polarized expression of AQP4 in vascular endfeet of astrocytes”), this should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we have in the revised manuscript restricted our use to the term “injection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) All of the experiments done in this paper involve penetration of tracers from CSF injection/infusion into brain parenchyma. None of the experiments directly tests the clearance of intraparenchymally infused agents from brain to CSF. This was a prominent finding of Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017), that there was no significant difference in clearance of solutes in AQP4 KO mice following intraparenchymal infusion. In other words all experiments in this manuscript are CSF to brain, but the claims are bidirectional (Figure 7) that there is also decreased ISF clearance from brain to CSF in the absence of AQP4. Why did none of the current experiments investigate or substantiate this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We have in the past avoided the use of intraparenchymal injections because the injections (which require opening of the skull and tissue damage) affects CSF tracer influx. Prompted by the reviewer’s question, we have now included a new Figure 7 that formally documents that the invasive methodology utilized by Smith et al., profoundly alters CSF influx and therefore cannot be utilized to study bulk flow clearance in brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The Discussion reiterates the fact that the UNC group were unable to replicate Smith's findings however they did not follow Smith's methodologies so reproducibility is debatable since methods deviated.</p></disp-quote><p>The Smith at al. publication was presented as a replication study: i.e. the title (&quot;Test of the 'glymphatic' hypothesis demonstrates diffusive and aquaporin-4-independent solute transport in rodent brain parenchyma&quot;. Please refer to the Discussion of the revised manuscript for a discussion on what a proper replication study is. Our study did not intend to replicate Smith et al., who used (i) an inappropriate anesthetic regiment for study of the glymphatics, (ii) used a novel and untested approach for the cisterna magna injections based on variable injection rate, and (iii) prepared cranial burr holes and introduced glass pipettes to study the glymphatic system. We have, in response to the reviewer, clearly stated that the aim of our study was not to replicate the Smith et al. study. The strength of our study is that it shows that AQP4 is an essential component of the glymphatic system, since 5 independent labs in 5 different transgenic mouse lines and six independent experiments found that deletion or mislocation of AQP4 reduced CSF tracer influx. The data presented in this manuscript is further supported by meta-analysis (Figure 8).</p><p>Discussion: “For these reasons, the present study is not a replication study of Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017). Instead we used the methodology reported in Iliff et al., 2012 (Iliff et al., 2012) and further optimized it in subsequent studies (Neely et al., 2001; Brandt et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) An obvious experiment that would eliminate the effects of anesthesia would be to implant an infusion catheter in the cisterna magna and allow animals to recover for several days, and then carry out infusion of tracers in the complete absence of any anesthesia whatsoever and then rapidly perfuse at different time points and assess parenchymal penetration depth criteria. While this may be technically difficult in mice, stereotactically targeted infusions have been performed in awake behaving mice in many locations, and in any event this would be feasible in rats (and AQP4 KO rats have been described). This experiment would clearly move the field forward beyond disparate data relative to anesthetic usage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The proposed studies are not included here because our aim was to establish the importance of AQP4 in glymphatic activity under anesthesia, not during wakefulness when CSF inflow is very low (Xie et al., 2013). Unfortunately, Dr. Verkman has to our knowledge not yet validated that AQP4 was deleted in the rats utilized in Smith et al., 2017.</p></body></sub-article></article>
