<italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> remains enveloped by host-derived membranes whose functional properties are poorly understood. <italic>P. infestans</italic> secretes a myriad of effector proteins through these interfaces for plant colonization. Recently we showed that the effector protein PexRD54 reprograms host-selective autophagy by antagonising antimicrobial-autophagy receptor Joka2/NBR1 for ATG8CL binding (Dagdas et al., 2016). Here, we show that during infection, ATG8CL/Joka2 labelled defense-related autophagosomes are diverted toward the perimicrobial host membrane to restrict pathogen growth. PexRD54 also localizes to autophagosomes across the perimicrobial membrane, consistent with the view that the pathogen remodels host-microbe interface by co-opting the host autophagy machinery. Furthermore, we show that the host-pathogen interface is a hotspot for autophagosome biogenesis. Notably, overexpression of the early autophagosome biogenesis protein ATG9 enhances plant immunity. Our results implicate selective autophagy in polarized immune responses of plants and point to more complex functions for autophagy than the widely known degradative roles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phytophthora infestans</kwd><kwd>nicotiana benthamiana</kwd><kwd>selective autophagy</kwd><kwd>effector biology</kwd><kwd>plant immunity</kwd><kwd>haustoria</kwd><kwd>RXLR Effector</kwd><kwd>autophagosome</kwd><kwd>defense-related autophagy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dagdas</surname><given-names>Yasin F</given-names></name><name><surname>Belhaj</surname><given-names>Khaoula</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name><name><surname>Bozkurt</surname><given-names>Tolga O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dagdas</surname><given-names>Yasin F</given-names></name><name><surname>Belhaj</surname><given-names>Khaoula</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M002462/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pandey</surname><given-names>Pooja</given-names></name><name><surname>Tumtas</surname><given-names>Yasin</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanguankiattichai</surname><given-names>Nattapong</given-names></name><name><surname>Duggan</surname><given-names>Cian</given-names></name><name><surname>Leary</surname><given-names>Alexandre Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Segretin</surname><given-names>Maria E</given-names></name><name><surname>Contreras</surname><given-names>Mauricio P</given-names></name><name><surname>Savage</surname><given-names>Zachary</given-names></name><name><surname>Bozkurt</surname><given-names>Tolga O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Defense-related selective autophagy mediated by the antimicrobial autophagy cargo receptor NBR1/Joka2 is diverted to pathogen penetration sites to restrict plant colonization by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants intimately interact with a diverse range of pathogens, which typically produce specialized structures, such as haustoria, to invade the host cell space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Panstruga and Dodds, 2009</xref>). These specialized structures are surrounded by membranes derived from the host endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bozkurt et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Whisson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozkurt et al., 2011</xref>), which mediate inter-organismal communication enabling nutrient and macromolecule trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Micali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Koh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Le Fevre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gutjahr and Parniske, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pumplin et al., 2012</xref>). However, our understanding of the origin and biogenesis of these host-microbe interfaces remains limited. In particular, the extent to which host accommodation membranes are shaped by the invading microbes is unclear.</p><p>Similar to many other filamentous plant pathogens, the potato late blight pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> produces haustoria, hyphal extensions that invaginate the host cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Whisson et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, the host accommodation membrane, also known as the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) sharply contrasts with the adjacent plasma membrane in both protein and lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozkurt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schornack et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the EHM is not uniform, and multiple membrane sources probably contribute to its biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bozkurt et al., 2015</xref>). The emerging model is that multiple trafficking pathways are diverted to haustoria with some degree of specificity.</p><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) is an evolutionary conserved membrane trafficking pathway that mediates removal or relocation of cytoplasmic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>). Bulk autophagy, typically activated by starvation, involves non-selective engulfment of cytoplasmic materials to double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which are then carried to the vacuole for recycling. In contrast, selective-autophagy employs specialized autophagy cargo receptors that bind ATG8 on autophagosome membranes, and recruit specific cargoes to autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, to destroy viral particles and restrict viral infection, the plant autophagy cargo receptor Joka2/NBR1 activates antimicrobial autophagy, also known as xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hafrén et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, we recently showed that Joka2/NBR1 mediated selective autophagy pathway contributes to defense against <italic>P. infestans.</italic> However, the molecular basis of this Joka2/NBR1 mediated defense-related autophagy remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). To counteract selective autophagy, <italic>P. infestans</italic> deploys PexRD54, a secreted protein that belongs to the large RXLR-WY family of virulence effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). PexRD54 carries an ATG8 interacting motif (AIM) and attenuates defense-related autophagy by depleting Joka2 from autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, both PexRD54 and Joka2 preferably bind and stimulate formation of autophagosomes marked by potato ATG8CL over ATG8IL, highlighting the selective nature of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>). However, the fate of PexRD54 and Joka2 labelled autophagosomes during pathogen attack remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATG8CL-autophagosomes localise to haustoria in infected plant cells</title><p>To investigate subcellular dynamics of autophagy during infection, we first visualized transiently expressed GFP:ATG8CL in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells during <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection. GFP:ATG8CL labelled autophagosomes frequently accumulated around the haustoria (73% of observations, <italic>N</italic> = 60) labelled by the EHM marker REM1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas in uninfected cells ATG8CL labelled randomly distributed puncta and the central vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We previously showed that the EHM could be discriminated from the cytosol and adjacent vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bozkurt et al., 2015</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy imaging of haustoriated cells in which the tonoplast and EHM are slightly parted away from each other revealed that perihaustorial ATG8CL-autophagosomes with varying size and shape remain tightly associated with the EHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Unlike GFP:ATG8CL, autophagy deficient GFP:ATG8CLΔ mutant failed to accumulate around the haustoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). GFP:ATG8CLΔ appeared randomly distributed as puncta that occurred around haustoria in only 14% of the observations (<italic>N</italic> = 51) and did not associate with the EHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The GFP control construct showed only diffuse cytoplasmic signal and did not label any perihaustorial puncta (0% <italic>N</italic> = 20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test whether other autophagosomes are targeted toward the haustoria, we investigated subcellular localisation of ATG8IL labelled autophagosomes. Unlike frequently observed GFP:ATG8CL puncta (73% of observations, <italic>N</italic> = 60) that is abundantly present around the haustoria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), GFP:ATG8IL appeared in only 28% the imaged haustoria (<italic>N</italic> = 65), typically with no more than a few puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that during pathogen infection ATG8CL-autophagosomes are selectively directed toward the pathogen interface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37476.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ATG8CL-autophagosomes accumulate around the haustoria.</title><p>GFP:ATG8CL, GFP:ATG8CLΔ, GFP:EV (empty vector) or GFP:ATG8IL are co-expressed with the EHM marker RFP:REM1.3 via agroinfiltration in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves infected with <italic>P. infestans</italic>.

Joka2 is a modular protein with multiple domains including an N-terminal Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain, central zinc finger (ZZ) and NBR1 domains followed by two C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA) that flank an AIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zientara-Rytter and Sirko, 2014</xref>). PB1 and ZZ domains are implicated in self-oligomerisation and protein-protein interactions, whereas UBA domains and the AIM bridge Joka2 to the autophagic machinery and the ubiquitinated cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Autophagosomes labelled by the full length Joka2 fused to BFP (Joka2:BFP) accumulated around the haustoria at high frequency (92%, <italic>N</italic> = 50) and localised to the EHM, unlike the BFP vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

A recent study has shown that the plant ATG9 homolog, the only transmembrane domain containing ATG protein, localises to autophagosome biogenesis sites and remains in mobile puncta adjacent to mature autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we used ATG9:GFP as a marker for phagophore assembly sites (PAS) and monitored its localisation during infection. Transient expression of ATG9:GFP in haustoriated cells revealed that ATG9 is ubiquitously found at the perihaustorial puncta (in &gt;92% of imaged haustoria) neighbouring ATG8CL and Joka2 labelled perihaustorial autophagosomes with a partial yet clear overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). This finding suggests that in addition to accommodating mature ATG8CL autophagosomes, perihaustorial compartments are hotspots for autophagosome biogenesis.

These findings suggest that previously discovered antagonistic interaction between PexRD54 and Joka2 principally takes place across the EHM, where PexRD54 depletes Joka2 from ATG8CL-autophagosomes to undermine antimicrobial autophagy.

These findings highlight convergent evolution of autophagy related host defenses, guided by autophagy cargo receptors, targeted towards the invading plant and animal pathogens. Furthermore, our results illustrate that adapted plant pathogens deploy effector proteins to remodel processes taking place at the perimicrobial host membranes and antagonize the focal immune responses deployed by the host to destroy the invaders.</p><p>Recruitment of ATG9 labelled vesicles to perihaustorial region suggests the pathogen interface serves a scaffold for autophagosome formation and defense related autophagy responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Thus, it is possible that in different plant families different ATG8 isoforms are specialized to carry out defense-related tasks. A phylogenetic analysis of solanaceous plants revealed family-specific groups of ATG8 members that form four distinct clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kellner et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike ATG8CL, another solanaceous ATG8 clade member, ATG8IL, does not accumulate at the haustorial interface during <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection. Thus, not all autophagic trafficking components are diverted to the haustorial interface. Autophagosomes labelled by ATG8IL do not respond to pathogen infection and remain cytosolic, further highlighting the specialization of ATG8 isoforms in plants that was proposed by Kellner et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kellner et al., 2017</xref>).

Such pathogen modified double-layered autophagosomes could fuse with the EHM discharging single layered vesicles into the extrahaustorial matrix. Fusion of autophagosomes with the EHM could provide a membrane source for EHM biogenesis and may account for the extracellular vesicles (EVs) that have been recently reported in several host-microbe interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deeks and Sánchez-Rodríguez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rutter and Innes, 2017</xref>).

Then, ATG9:GFP, BFP:PexRD54, BFP:PexRD54<sup>AIM2</sup>, Joka2:BFP and Joka2<sup>AIM</sup>:BFP, Joka2<sup>Δ1-487</sup>:BFP constructs were generated by Gibson assembly of each gene PCR fragment into EcoRV digested GFP/BFP vectors (N-terminal fusion for PexRD54 and PexRD54<sup>AIM</sup>, C-terminal fusion for ATG9, Joka2<sup>Δ1-487</sup>, Joka2 and Joka2<sup>AIM</sup>). All genes except ATG9, which was amplified from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cDNA, were amplified from existing constructs previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bozkurt et al., 2015</xref>), using primer pairs GA_RD54_F with GA_RD54_R for PexRD54, GA_RD54_F with GA_LIR2_R for PexRD54<sup>AIM</sup> and GA_Joka2_BFP_F with GA_Joka2_BFP_R for both Joka2, Joka2<sup>AIM</sup>, and GA_Joka2<sup>Δ1-487</sup>_F, and GA_ATG9_F with GA_ATG9_R. Silencing constructs for <italic>ATG4</italic> and <italic>ATG9</italic> were amplified using the primer combinations hpATG4_F/hpATG4_R and hpATG9_F/hpATG9_R and cloned into the pRNAiGG vector, following the protocol from Pu Yan et al.

A hairpin RNAi construct targeting a conserved region in ATG9a/b was designed to silence both <italic>ATG9</italic> homologs. Silencing of <italic>ATG4</italic> and <italic>ATG9 was</italic> verified using RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using GeneJET Plant RNA purification Mini Kit (Thermo Scientific). 2 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT was performed with the following conditions: 50 min at 55°C followed by 20 min at 70°C. Primers pairs used for cDNA amplification were RT_ATG4_F/RT_ATG4_R, RT_ATG9A_F/RT_ATG9A_R, and RT-ATG9B F/RT-ATG9B R. <italic>GAPDH</italic> was used to normalize transcript abundance.

Specific excitation wavelengths and filters for emission spectra were set as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Koh et al., 2005</xref>). BFP, GFP and RFP probes were excited using 405, 488 and 561 nm laser diodes and their fluorescent emissions detected at 450–480, 495–550 and 570–620 nm, respectively. Sequential scanning between lines was done to avoid spectral mixing from different fluorophores and images acquired using multichannel. Maximum intensity projections of Z-stack images were presented in each figure. Z-stack sections were processed to enhance image clarity, sections that caused blurriness (top and bottom ones), were removed for generation of maximum intensity projections. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (1.50 g) and Adobe Photoshop (CS6).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Transient gene-expression assays in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic></title><p>Transient gene-expression was performed <italic>in planta</italic> by infiltration of leaves of 3–4 week old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> with cultures of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 strain carrying T-DNA constructs, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozkurt et al., 2011</xref>).

Effector biology, mode action, localization/translocation and importantly, the underlying mechanistic details responsible for this intriguing class of regulators. Previously, this group made an interesting discovery, coupling effector research with another emerging (emerged) area of research that is operative in both plants and animals, namely autophagy. Utilizing an effector from <italic>P. infestans</italic>; (Pex RD54). In mechanistic studies the authors were able to show that this oomycete effector binds to a host protein, to trigger autophagosome formation. Interestingly during infection where autophagosomes usually deliver their cargo, instead <italic>P. infestans</italic> triggers autophagosome formation that results in the depletion of autophagy cargo including Joka2 a selective ATG receptor. How does this work? How is this used to establish compatibility?</p><p>Finally, in the current manuscript, data is presented that suggests that Autophagosomes are &quot;diverted&quot; to the pathogen interface and in a resistant response results in starvation. Conclusions include the idea that the pathogen reprograms host selective autophagy purely for the benefit of the pathogen. This a very nice paper in many ways and will likely be a seminal contribution to the field merging Molecular Plant Pathology and autophagic cell death.</p><p>1) My main concern is the microscopy. Not being a microscopist … but can the resolution be improved? It is hard to determine what is happening during these interactions. Would TEM help?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This research advance builds upon previous work where the <italic>P. infestans</italic> effector PexRD54 specifically binds to the plant protein ATG8CL to induce autophagosome formation. Here, the authors demonstrate that ATG8CL, but not AGT8IL, localize to haustoria after transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> plants infected with <italic>P. infestans</italic> using the expression of the remorin protein REM1.3 as a marker for <italic>P. infestans</italic> haustoria. The autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 also accumulates at haustoria upon infection. Previous papers have demonstrated targeted vesicular trafficking to the site of pathogen infection, indicating that trafficking of cellular components to the site of pathogen ingress is a common phenomenon.</p><p>The microscopy images are striking and in general the experiments are well performed. However, all the data rely upon transient overexpression in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. Does this occur during natural infection under native expression?</p><p>The biological relevance of this relocalization is also not clear. Identifying the cargo of autophagosomes relocalized to the site of pathogen infection is required to understand the role of selective autophagy during <italic>P. infestans</italic> infection.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Some of the authors in this manuscript previously found that an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> binds to autophagosome-localized ATG8 protein instead of autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 in order to counteract plant defenses for its infection. In this manuscript Dagdas et al., reported that autophagosomes labeled with GFP-ATG8CL are directed toward the pathogen interface for membrane sources of extra haustorial membrane (EHM).</p><p>Although the authors' concept/hypothesis that autophagosomal membranes can be one of the origins and source of the host-microbe interfaces is quite interesting, new mechanistic insights for it are not provided. For example, how are the pathogen-manipulated autophagosomes diverted to the pathogen interface? Additionally, convincing data are still missing to support the authors' claim. If the authors' hypothesis is true, GFP-ATG8CL should be well colocalized with EHM marker REM1.3. GFP-ATG8CL signal is not completely overlapped with REM1.3-RFP signal. It seems to be localized in cytoplasm between EHM and vacuolar membrane. To make a solid paper, immuno-EM analyses using anti-antibodies of autophagosomal membrane marker are necessary.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>This manuscript has been improved significantly from previous submission. The work uncovers selective autophagy targeted to haustoria as a defense mechanism, represents one of the first papers to tackle plant cargo receptors, and is a significant contribution to our understanding of how autophagy may contribute immunity. We are happy to offer publication of the manuscript after the authors have addressed the following issues:</p><p>1) It is helpful to explain in the Introduction differences of &quot;selective autophagy&quot;, &quot;antimicrobial-autophagy&quot;, and &quot;xenophagy&quot;.

We recently showed that the Irish potato famine pathogen <italic>P. infestans</italic> subverts host autophagy related defences by secreting an effector protein (Dagdas et al., eLife, 2016, 5:e10856; Maqbool et al., JBC, 2016, 291:20270). In this manuscript, we provide an exciting cellular biology dimension to our previous model and show that defense-related selective autophagy pathway is diverted to the plant-microbe interface in order to limit the pathogen growth, instead of taking the default vacuolar degradation route. In turn, the pathogen antagonizes the antimicrobial-autophagy launched to destroy itself by deploying an effector protein that disarms the defense-related autophagosomes across the perimicrobial host membrane. Interestingly, the autophagosome biogenesis machinery, marked by the conserved early autophagosome protein ATG9, is also diverted to hostmicrobe interface. Furthermore, we assign a previously unknown antimicrobial function to ATG9 protein, as its overexpression significantly improved plant immunity to pathogen infection.</p><p>The extent to which autophagy contributes to immunity and/or serves adapted pathogens is currently under debate. In Dagdas et al. (eLife, 2016), we showed that the effector protein PexRD54 of <italic>P. infestans</italic> outcompetes host autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 in binding the core autophagy adaptor ATG8. This results in suppression of Joka2-mediated immunity. Interestingly, the effector also stimulates the formation of the autophagosomes, which suggests that the pathogen could subvert host autophagy for its own benefit. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagosomes are diverted towards haustoria, specialized hyphal extensions that grow inwards host cells. This reveals a new pathway that is re-routed towards the pathogen interface and provides evidence for extensive remodelling of the host endomembrane system by plant pathogens.</p><p>In addition to showing importance of focal autophagic defense responses, our work has wider implications. It sheds light on membrane biogenesis in plant cells that accommodate microbial structures and explains the differences in protein composition between plant plasma membrane and perimicrobial</p><p>membranes. This work also points to a possible source for the enigmatic extracellular vesicles that have been reported in host-microbe interfaces of symbiotic and parasitic interactions.</p><p>Although the essence of this story is similar to our previous submission that was rejected, this is almost a new manuscript, not a cosmetically re-decorated version of the previous one. We have added several new composite figures and modified the text accordingly. A summary of the new data and figures are as follows:</p><p>1) We provide RNAi based genetic evidence demonstrating autophagosome targeting to haustorial interface is dependent on the core autophagy components ATG4 and ATG9. This is now presented in Figure 2.</p><p>2) We have performed high resolution imaging of ATG8CL/Joka2/PexRD54 autophagosomes to show that they associate with the perimicrobial host membrane. These data are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p>3) We have performed domain-function analyses of Joka2 to show that domains that mediate oligomerization and protein-protein interaction are important for haustorial accumulation of Joka2. Furthermore, we did pathogenicity assays that shows focal accumulation of Joka2 is important for its positive role in antimicrobial immunity. These data are now presented in Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><p>4) We have performed high-resolution imaging and pathogenicity assays that showed perihaustorial niche is a hot spot for autophagosome biogenesis and overexpression of early autophagosome biogenesis marker ATG9 enhances plant immunity. These data are now presented in Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript has been improved significantly from previous submission.

We updated all the figures and changed all blue channels to teal and green channels to yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 present critical data to support the conclusion that PexRD54 and ATG8CL co-localize in puncta at the perihaustorial membrane. This should be moved to main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figure as suggested. These data are now presented in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Discussion section the authors allude to phylogenetic analyses that they have performed on the ATG8 family in plants. It would be helpful to explicitly state whether ATG8CL is conserved across flowering plants, or whether it is specific to the Solanaceae family. I gather that it is not broadly conserved. If it is not, do they speculate that other ATG8 members fulfill this role in other plant families?</p></disp-quote><p>We included following text in the Discussion “The expansion of plant ATG8 members seems to have occurred earlier in evolution, and each plant family carries a unique set of ATG8 isoforms that have been diversifying over millions of years. Thus, it is likely that in different plant families different ATG8 isoforms are specialized to carry out defense-related tasks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Images in Figure 3 were collected 3-4 days post infection. Based on Figure 3—figure supplement 4, protein levels differ significantly. Please comment whether this affect interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is unlikely because we excluded the cells that didn’t look healthy or showed no Joka2 expression. Additionally, we measured the frequency of haustoria that has Joka2 puncta rather than quantifying the abundance of Joka2 puncta/cell. Consistently, our image quantification does not show any significant differences in number of haustoria that accommodate Joka2:BFP puncta in images obtained three (32/35 of haustoria, 91.4%) vs four (14/15 of haustoria 93.3%) days post infection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
