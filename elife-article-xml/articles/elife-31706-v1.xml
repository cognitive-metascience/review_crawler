Here, we investigate its function upon cardiac induction of human embryonic stem cells. We find that ISL1 does not stabilize the transient cardiac precursor cell state but rather serves to accelerate cardiomyocyte differentiation. Conversely, ISL1 depletion delays cardiac differentiation and respecifies nascent cardiomyocytes from a ventricular to an atrial identity. Mechanistic analyses integrate this unrecognized anti-atrial function of ISL1 with known and newly identified atrial inducers. In this revised view, ISL1 is antagonized by retinoic acid signaling via a novel player, MEIS2. Conversely, ISL1 competes with the retinoic acid pathway for prospective cardiomyocyte fate, which converges on the atrial specifier NR2F1. This study reveals a core regulatory network putatively controlling human heart chamber formation and also bears implications for the subtype-specific production of human cardiomyocytes with enhanced functional properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>directed cardiac differentiation</kwd><kwd>cardiac subtype specification</kwd><kwd>Islet-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CIM-IMPRS graduate school</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quaranta</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGC II</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greber</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss and gain-of-function investigation uncovers a regulatory network controlling human heart chamber specification in which the cardiac precursor gene ISL1 accelerates ventricular induction and antagonizes retinoic acid-driven atrial commitment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The four chambers of the mammalian heart are specified from the first and second heart fields (FHF/SHF) encompassing distinct precursor cell populations that give rise, respectively, to the left ventricle (FHF) and the mostly SHF-derived right ventricle, left and right atria, and outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>). The LIM domain transcription factor ISL1 (Islet-1) is a prime player in and marker of the SHF from which, accordingly, both ventricular and atrial cells originate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). The view that the SHF not only gives rise to the right ventricle and outflow tract, but also to most cells of the atria, is a result of revised lineage-tracing experiments in the mouse embryo using improved <italic>Isl1</italic>-Cre driver lines (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, mouse embryos deficient for <italic>Isl1</italic> show severe cardiac defects highlighting the functional importance of ISL1 in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Proliferating ISL1<sup>+</sup> cells not only form cardiomyocytes (CMs) but they also bear multipotent differentiation potential for generating the smooth muscle and endothelial cell lineages, as shown in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laugwitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretti et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2006</xref>). Interestingly, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as induced pluripotent stem cells may give rise to ISL1<sup>+</sup> cells with multipotent properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretti et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequently, these findings, as well as the fact that ISL1<sup>+</sup> cells undergo significant expansion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>), have stimulated efforts to stably propagate them in vitro and potentially pave the way for regenerative medical approaches. ISL1 has thus been used as a main self-renewal marker in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qyang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A prime morphogen playing into SHF development is retinoic acid (RA). It is synthesized by the somites of the mouse embryo, to then signal to the posterior part of the SHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duester, 2008</xref>). At around E7.5, RA restricts the cardiac progenitor pool marked by ISL1, to subsequently promote atrial specification of the posterior SHF. Conversely, in embryos deficient in synthesizing RA, the ISL1-expressing domain of the late SHF, the anterior SHF, is expanded and atrial induction compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryckebusch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sirbu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zaffran et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, human pluripotent stem cells undergoing cardiac induction are responsive to RA - much like in the in vivo situation. Hence, activation of RA signaling promotes atrial specification at the expense of a default ventricular cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, Devalla and colleagues have recently shown that NR2F1 (also known as COUP-TFI) is a pivotal RA-induced transcription factor. It activates at least part of an atrial-specific gene expression program including, for instance, the potassium ion channel-encoding <italic>KCNA5</italic> gene mediating atrial-specific action potential properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devalla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marczenke et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, in a recently established differentiation protocol, hESCs homogeneously pass through a transient ISL1 stage before acquiring a terminally differentiated cardiomyocyte (CM) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). This fact prompted us to functionally investigate the role of ISL1 in hESCs undergoing cardiac differentiation. By combining directed cardiac differentiation of hESCs, targeted genetic manipulation, and functional genomics analysis, we show that ISL1 does not sustain self-renewal of cardiac precursor cells. Rather, it acts as an accelerator of cardiomyocyte differentiation and concurrently takes on a central position in the cardiac subtype specification network. Hence, we find that ISL1 is negatively linked to known and previously unrecognized drivers of atrial induction, NR2F1 and MEIS2, and that it, thereby, acts as a functional opponent of retinoic acid signaling in competing for ventricular versus atrial specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ISL1 accelerates pan-cardiac gene induction in hESCs without affecting proliferation</title><p>Given its key role in vertebrate cardiogenesis and its implication in the cardiac precursor cell state, we sought to investigate the function of ISL1 upon cardiac induction of human ES cells. To this end, a functional knockout-causing deletion was induced in HuES6 cells using CRISPR/Cas9n (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Clonal ISL1 knockout (KO) hESCs were then differentiated using a high-efficiency monolayer protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). At day 5, the approximate peak expression time point of ISL1 in this protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rao et al., 2016</xref>), ISL1 was undetectable in KO cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using time course gene expression analysis of various cardiac markers, we noticed with interest that ISL1 KO cells were not entirely deficient in undergoing differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Rather, they displayed a delayed induction of structural as well as regulatory cardiac genes but eventually, they also started to contract spontaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). These results were confirmed at the protein level where wild-type (WT) controls showed robust abundance of cardiac markers by day 6, the usual time point of spontaneous beating initiation in the protocol, whereas ISL1 KO showed a still incomplete pattern by day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Hence, ISL1 is not absolutely required for CM differentiation in hESCs but its depletion slows down the process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31706.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ISL1 accelerates cardiac differentiation of hESCs without affecting cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRISPR-mediated knockout of <italic>ISL1</italic> in hESCs.

To understand whether this may conversely imply an active role of ISL1 in driving the differentiation process, we generated a stable cell line on ISL1 KO background in which an <italic>ISL1</italic> transgene could be selectively induced by doxycycline addition. This strategy would allow to investigate the function of ISL1 in a stage-specific manner, by mimicking the transient induction pattern of endogenous <italic>ISL1</italic>, for instance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; compare to ISL1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The resulting cell line, termed ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup>, showed robust ISL1 expression following a 1-day exposure to DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Transient <italic>ISL1</italic> induction in these cells during cardiac differentiation fully restored WT-like gene expression kinetics based on a panel of markers, which also confirmed the specificity of the underlying genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, some of these genes, notably the key cardiac regulators <italic>MEF2C</italic> and <italic>NKX2.5</italic>, showed immediate-early responses to the reintroduction of ISL1 as they became significantly upregulated after only 1 day of DOX addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). This acceleration effect regarding the upregulation of key cardiac genes also became apparent at the protein level as well as by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-31706-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31706.006</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Spontaneously beating ISL1 KO hESC-CMs rescued by transgenic <italic>ISL1</italic> induction at days 3 and 4.</title><p>Stereo microscopic view of ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> cells treated with DOX<sub>d3,4</sub> (day 8 of cardiac differentiation).</p></caption></media><p>To obtain a more global insight, we recorded genome-wide expression time-series using WT and ± DOX<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Stringent filtering of these data yielded a set of approximately 70 known cardiac and uncharacterized genes, all showing accelerated induction kinetics as driven by ISL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Moreover, cell number as well as cell cycle stage quantification in differentiating WT and ISL1 KO cells revealed only marginal differences between these, which thus could not explain the pronounced differences in cardiac gene induction seen at days 5–6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These analyses therefore suggest that ISL1 accelerates CM formation in differentiating hESCs by activating downstream pro-cardiac genes, rather than through promoting proliferation or stability of the cardiac precursor cell state, for instance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ISL1 does not stabilize the cardiovascular progenitor cell state</title><p>To further investigate this latter possibility and to illuminate the putative multipotency of ISL1<sup>+</sup> cells, we screened a panel of candidate signaling factors for their ability to either stabilize the precursor state and prevent further differentiation, or to induce different differentiation outcomes, notably cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, or endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These data were confirmed in independent experiments, at RNA and protein levels: RA-treated WT CMs consistently showed a pronounced expression of atrial-specific markers and a strong decline in ventricular-specific gene expression - and this was phenocopied by the ISL1 knockout, with only some variation in the degree of the phenotypes from experiment to experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). These data establish a novel and crucial role of ISL1 at the cardiac precursor state, namely, to promote ventricular CM subtype specification and counteract an atrial fate, thereby competing with RA signaling for prospective CM identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, ISL1 depletion alone was apparently sufficient to promote an atrial-like expression pattern - without need for exogenous RA stimulation during cardiac induction. We next sought to investigate whether this change in gene expression would also translate into distinct functional properties. In addition, we wondered if RA stimulation and ISL1 depletion would synergize to yield an enhanced atrial phenotype. To this end, we compared untreated WT CMs, ISL1 KO CMs, RA<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated WT CMs, and RA<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated ISL1 KO CMs to one another. The latter type indeed showed enhanced expression levels of the atrial regulator <italic>NR2F1</italic> and of <italic>KCNA5</italic> which encodes a key atrial-specific potassium ion channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, respectively). KCNA5 accounts for the shortening of atrial CM-specific action potentials as compared to ventricular ones, which also translates into faster spontaneous beating of atrial-like hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marczenke et al., 2017b</xref>). Likewise, ISL1 KO and RA<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated hESC-CMs showed increased beating frequencies as compared to ventricular-like controls. Interestingly, RA<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated ISL1 KO CMs contracted at even faster rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Furthermore, using single-cell patch clamp analysis, ISL1 KO CMs displayed atrial-type action potentials, similar to RA-CMs. In line with the increased <italic>KCNA5</italic> expression levels, however, action potential durations in RA<sub>d3,4</sub>-treated ISL1 KO CMs were even further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>). Finally, to reveal a clear-cut functional feature, we blocked KCNA5 channels using a pharmacological inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devalla et al., 2015</xref>).

Indeed, isolated ISL1<sup>+</sup> cells have been shown to be amenable to (limited) expansion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qyang et al., 2007</xref>). However, ISL1 merely served as a marker of the cardiac precursor cell state in these studies, which does not necessarily imply any active role in sustaining self-renewal of these populations. Hence, our finding that transient <italic>ISL1</italic> induction, and even its continuous enforced expression, does not block the differentiation process but actually accelerates the induction of prominent cardiomyocyte-specific genes, may seem surprising but does not per se present a conflicting result with previously published work. In support of this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon et al. (2009)</xref> proposed that ISL1 may actually be counterproductive for sustaining the cardiac precursor state.</p><p>Interestingly, our observations in the hESC system are also confirmed by enhanced cardiomyocyte yields obtained after constitutive <italic>Isl1</italic> overexpression in mouse ES cells, suggesting a universal cardiac differentiation-promoting role of this factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). How is this effect brought about? Our ChIP-seq analysis in conjunction with our differential time course expression data suggests that ISL1 does not immediately promote the induction of structural CM genes: Although some of these - <italic>MYH6</italic>, <italic>MYL4</italic>, and others - start becoming upregulated as early as at day 4/5 of directed cardiac induction, their induction patterns were either unaffected by depleting/reintroducing <italic>ISL1</italic> or we did not observe any ISL1 binding to their loci, with only few putatively minor exceptions (<italic>MYLK3</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). Rather, ISL1 appears to affect the expression of a small but crucial set of transcriptional regulators in differentiating hESCs, notably <italic>MEF2C</italic> and <italic>NKX2.5</italic> (and <italic>NKX2.6</italic>) - albeit likely via an alternative human-specific enhancer in case of <italic>MEF2C</italic> and with borderline evidence for direct binding in case of <italic>NKX2.5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyons et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, several studies have revealed a negative feedback mechanism by mouse NKX2.5 on the cardiac progenitor state and on <italic>Isl1</italic> in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2012</xref>), which is also in line with the rapid decline of <italic>ISL1</italic> in early NKX2.5<sup>+</sup> hESC-CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). This mechanism might therefore imply that cardiac <italic>ISL1</italic> expression is transient by nature, that is, inevitably fated to promote a successive conversion into an early cardiomyocyte identity. Thus, attempts to stabilize the ISL1<sup>+</sup>/NKX2.5<sup>-</sup> cardiac precursor cell state long-term in a cell culture setting would need to neutralize the pro-differentiation function of ISL1, which has thus far failed in our hands using candidate signaling molecules or cocktails thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qyang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Paradigm for second heart field development?</title><p>A compelling question is whether hESCs on their way to differentiating into cardiomyocytes actually take a FHF or a SHF-like route. At first sight, ISL1 itself could be considered as a marker to address this issue because it is a prime player in the SHF. Sensitive Cre driver lines, however, additionally suggest a transient expression of <italic>Isl1</italic> in the FHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prall et al., 2007</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the very transient expression of <italic>Isl1</italic> in the FHF - and likewise in the posterior SHF - is not associated with any major function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodou et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, our observed impairment of cardiac induction following of <italic>ISL1</italic> depletion in hESCs would best fit to the idea that hESCs tend to differentiate via a SHF-like path - at least in our particular protocol. In general, however, there is a scarcity of markers definitely distinguishing the SHF from the FHF and hence, this hypothesis seems hard to substantiate. It is noteworthy, at least, that the expression of some SHF-associated genes like <italic>FGF8</italic>, <italic>FGF10</italic>, or <italic>HAND2</italic> was indeed compromised in our ISL1 KO time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Nonetheless, it may also be that even tightly controlled hESC differentiation protocols do not strictly adhere to in vivo developmental routes. Moreover, it is conceivable that different differentiation protocols may give rise to distinct differentiation intermediates or mixtures thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

Restriction of <italic>Isl1</italic> by RA in mouse and/or zebrafish is thought to be mediated via a repression of FGF signaling and/or via an induction of the LIM domain protein-encoding gene <italic>Ajuba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sirbu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witzel et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>AJUBA</italic> (<italic>JUB</italic>) was only expressed at low levels in our ± RA differentiation time courses and was not positively regulated by RA. Furthermore, <italic>FGF8</italic> did become repressed by RA but FGF signaling tended to affect <italic>ISL1</italic> expression levels in a negative rather than in a positive manner, as based on the aforementioned assay. Instead, we find that in differentiating hPSCs, the slightly delayed and transcriptionally moderate repression of <italic>ISL1</italic> by RA is mediated by MEIS2, a known but still underinvestigated player at the cardiac precursor stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dupays et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paige et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wamstad et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, we propose that RA exerts its <italic>ISL1</italic>-repressing function through this indirect mechanism, at least in the human ESC system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Interestingly, though, the regulatory link between RA signaling and <italic>Meis2</italic> has also been revealed in a different context, limb development, raising the possibility that it might also be operative in the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunningham and Duester, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding of this study is that ISL1 functionally serves to antagonize atrial induction, most immediately by suppressing the upregulation of <italic>NR2F1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devalla et al., 2015</xref>), in a RA-independent fashion. Importantly, our competition experiments indicate that the enforced expression of <italic>ISL1</italic> may neutralize the pro-atrial effects of RA. These data therefore reveal that <italic>ISL1</italic> repression is a key functional requirement - not merely a correlative event - for enabling atrial induction. Furthermore, ISL1 depletion and RA signaling synergized to give rise to cells with enhanced atrial features. The antagonism between RA signaling and ISL1 converging on <italic>NR2F1</italic> hence appears to form the core of a regulatory module controlling cardiac subtype specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, overlapping with the delay in pan-cardiac differentiation, <italic>ISL1</italic> disruption alone was sufficient for promoting a mild atrial-like CM phenotype at the expense of a ventricular identity.

Interestingly, <italic>Isl1</italic>-deficient SHF cells in vivo fail to form right ventricular progeny, yet they show sustained competence for atrial specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, our hESC-based findings - that <italic>ISL1</italic> is a key pro-ventricular/anti-atrial player - appear to conform with observations made in the mouse embryo. As a seeming discrepancy with our data and interpretation, though, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorn et al.

However, this discordance may be explained by the fact that these authors used long-term <italic>Isl1</italic> overexpression, as opposed to our mimicking of the endogenous <italic>ISL1</italic> expression pattern using pulsed - not constitutive - transgene induction: Indeed, ISL1 induction in already formed CMs or long-term overexpression confusingly suppressed ventricular-specific markers, similar to observations made by Dorn and colleagues using mouse cells.

Microarray hybridizations on Illumina V4 human HT-12 bead arrays were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer, with 14 hr of in vitro transcription. Cy3-stained chips were scanned using HiScan SQ instrumentation. Background subtraction, cubic spline normalization, and scatter plot analysis were carried out using GenomeStudio software. Statistics were based on an implemented Illumina custom model with multiple testing corrections. Processed data were filtered in MS Excel by setting experience-based thresholds for expression changes and minimal gene expression levels. Human heart data were taken from a previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piccini et al., 2015</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of genes was performed with one minus correlation metrics and the unweighted average distance (UPGMA), also known as group average, linkage method. Violin plots were generated from filtered gene sets using a Matlab-based algorithm based on a modification of the Matlab function distribution Plot.m by Jonas Dorn, and graphics tools for calculating distributions of relative gene expression differences . For functional annotation, array probe sequences were converted into GRCh37/hg19 genome coordinates employing the Ensembl BioMart interface to then be used as input for GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLean et al., 2010</xref>). Statistically significant hits were subjectively filtered for biological relevance and presented based on the obtained p values. Expression levels of individual genes are presented as array intensity signals ± bead standard deviation.

Maturated CMs were dissociated from maintenance cultures using a 10 x TrypLE Select digestion to obtain a single-cell / small aggregate suspension. Coating solution from the electrode chips was replaced by a ~3 µl suspension droplet containing 25,000–50,000 cells in CM splitting medium.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Joshua Waxman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Quaranta et al. reinvestigated the function of the LIM transcription factor ISL1 (ISLET-1) during cardiac differentiation using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model of early cardiogenesis. To investigate the function of ISL1, an ISL1 knockout hESC line was generated. Using a novel differentiation protocol of hESCs, the authors observe that depletion of ISL1 slows down the differentiation process. This phenotype is reverted when induction of ISL1 transgene is made on days 3-4. Based on these results they conclude that ISL1 is not required to stabilize the cardiac precursor cell state but rather accelerates cardiomyocyte formation, defining ISL1 as a pro-differentiation factor. To validate the hypothesize that the ISL1-depletion causes a switch in cardiomyocyte subtype identity, a series of experiments, including microarray analysis and competing induction by retinoic acid (RA), were performed. Therefore, they propose that ISL1 promotes ventricular cardiomyocyte specification and counteract an atrial fate induced by RA. in vivo experiments and functional genomics analysis show that ISL1 functionally antagonizes atria specification driven by RA signaling. A regulatory module of this competition involving repression of Isl1 and activation of Nk2f1 by MEIS1, and repression of Nk2f1 by ISL1, is proposed in conclusion.</p><p>The work is carefully and thoughtfully done and directed by strategic analyses. In general, this study is an interesting investigation because ISL1 is a crucial factor for heart development. Although it shows alignment with in vivo analysis of the role of RA in SHF development and has the merit to revise the view of ISL1 function during cardiac differentiation in pluripotent stem cells, there remains discrepancy with previous works. Indeed, overexpression of Isl1 in mouse ESCs results in normally beating cardiomyocytes, highly enriched in the atrial subtype at the expense of the ventricular lineage. Hence, this discordance should be addressed more critically. It is important to know if data are exclusive to hESCs or can also be applied to in vivo context. Furthermore, for this to be a compelling contribution, new regulatory links established in this study between MEIS1 and Isl1, and between ISL1 and Nr2f1, should be substantially strengthened.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “ISL1 accelerates pan-cardiac gene induction in hESCs”, last paragraph. Authors should include GO term analysis for the 73 cardiac and uncharacterised genes that are differentially expressed between WT and Dox-induced ISL1 in the KO background. The authors' claim for accelerated CM formation needs stronger justification.</p><p>2) Subsection “ISL1 KO phenocopies an atrial wild-type CM phenotype induced by retinoic acid”, last paragraph. The effects on action potentials after inhibition of KCNA5 seem weak. Would this be expected from knowledge of the involvement of this channel in atrial action potentials?</p><p>3) How does the ISL1 ChIP data compare to other data sets in target cell, size and overlap? The low number of apparent targets may be a technical and therefore a conceptual weakness. How can this be strengthened?</p><p>4) What is the outcome on MEIS2 after over-expression of ISL1. This important link seems to be missing. The authors suggest a unidirectional network. But perhaps ISL1 can also inhibit MEIS2. There would be many examples in the literature of segregation of cell fates through mutual TF antagonism (e.g. cardiac vs. blood).</p><p>5) The work of Mohun and antagonism between NKX2-5 and MEIS TFs should be considered and cited. How does it sit with this model? An important point for discussion as the ISL1 binding site revealed by ChIP in the current study is very similar to the NKE.</p><p>6) The regulatory relationships between ISL1 and Nr2f1 and between MEIS1 and Nr2f1 should be functionally tested using gain and loss of function and better analysis of ChIP and putative regulatory elements. The authors performed ISL1 ChIP-seq analysis to identify direct target genes. However, the choice of the ISL1 enhancers is not totally explained. For example, why the NRF2 (-476kb) or MEF2C (-225kb) were selected? The ISL1 bound region in Nr2f1 is ~0.5Mb away from the gene body and no functional data is provided to suggest it acts as a distal repressor. A more detailed analysis should be made. It is important to know whether other cardiac TF-binding sites are found around this region. Enhancer function should be tested in vivo or in vitro.</p><p>7) The authors used a published protocol for hESC differentiation, however characterization of cardiomyocytes origin (FHF vs. SHF) is missing in this study and potentially bears on how the current data meshes with in vivo studies on RA function in the SHF.</p><p>8) It is surprising to observe that peak of ISL1 expression, at day 5, corresponds to the activation of differentiated markers (cTnT, cTnC…). Please comment.</p><p>9) The time-course of ISL1 overexpression is not fully analyzed. It will be important to assess whether its overexpression affects the fate of multipotent cardiovascular progenitors at an earlier stage. Indeed, induction of ISL1 on days 3-4 is not sufficient to understand its function.</p><p>10) Proliferation of cardiac progenitors after ISL1 expression and deletion should be correctly addressed. Gene expression here is being used only to define identity, but could also reflect flux in cell populations.</p><p>11) The authors observe that ISL1 suppresses the atrial induction by RA signaling. However initially it was shown that late induction of ISL1 (3 weeks) antagonises the expression of ventricular specific gene Mlc2v (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The timing of induction of ISL1 expression in all subsequent experiments should be clarified and it should be indicated how early induction relates to atrial inhibition. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, Dox induction of ISL1 is done at d3 and d4.</p><p>12) Functional activity of differentiated cardiomyocytes was used to identify the subtype identity of these cells. However large images of differentiated cardiomyocytes should be provided.</p><p>13) Antagonism between RA signaling and ISL1 was mainly addressed through RA activation. It is important to examine the effect of RA deficiency in this context.</p><p>14) The choice of MEIS2 should be better explained.</p><p>15) Their observation that ISL1 accelerates CM differentiation in hES-derived cardiomyocytes is pretty much exactly what would be expected. From extensive in vivo and in vitro work, ISL1 is a marker of second heart field progenitors whose transient expression is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Thus, one would not really expect a primary requirement in the amplification of the progenitor population. In fact, signals that promote the proliferation of this population, such as canonical Wnt signaling, inhibit ISL1 expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation. This should be better discussed.</p><p>16) While it's true that ISL1 KO mice still have some atrial cells, these are thought to be first heart field-derived. More importantly, the ISL1 KO mice have significant atrial defects, arguing against their conclusion. Furthermore, in zebrafish, ISL1 is required for atrial differentiation at the venous pole. Please discuss.</p><p>17) Loss of Meis factors only tempers the induction ability of retinoic acid, suggesting RA must induce/repress other critical factors. Please comment.</p><p>18) Whether NR2F1 is required for the atrial differentiation effect observed in ISL1 KO cells should be tested. It is not clear that Nr2f1 can be accepted as a master regulator of atrial differentiation, at least by itself in hES cells, and the major factor driving cardiomyocyte specialization in this context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31706.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “ISL1 accelerates pan-cardiac gene induction in hESCs”, last paragraph.

The gene set is highly enriched for cardiac myocyte terms, thereby strengthening our interpretation of ISL1 being an accelerator of cardiac differentiation. As detailed below, we have also carried out experiments to rule out alternative explanations, notably positive effects of ISL1 on precursor cell proliferation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Together with the previous data, we think the differentiation-accelerating function of ISL1 is now well documented and analyzed. We thank the reviewer for encouraging these additional efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “ISL1 KO phenocopies an atrial wild-type CM phenotype induced by retinoic acid”, last paragraph. The effects on action potentials after inhibition of KCNA5 seem weak. Would this be expected from knowledge of the involvement of this channel in atrial action potentials?</p></disp-quote><p>In the present study, we observed clear effects of IKur blockade on the RA- and ISL1-KO action potentials, especially in the early repolarization phase. This in agreement with previous findings in RA-treated HES-CMs and hiPSC-CMs, where IKur was inhibited by blockers [Devalla et al., PMID 25700171] or by genetic manipulation [Marczenke et al., PMID 28729840]. It is also largely similar as found in freshly isolated human atrial myocytes [Wang et al., PMID 8222078; Ford et al., PMID 23364608; Ford et al., PMID 26455450]. The effects of IKur blockade are most pronounced in the early repolarization phase of atrial action potentials, because IKur is active at these potentials (-30 mV and more positive) [Wang et al., PMID 8222078]. Effects on the final repolarization phase are less clear, and can differ between studies. This is because IKur inhibition raises the plateau level to more positive voltages and consequently there is an increase of the repolarizing rapid delayed rectifier potassium current. This may counteract the action potential prolonging effect of IKur inhibition [for review, see Nattel et al., PMID 10575199]. We are aware that the IKur blockade-induced elevation of the action potential plateau seems more pronounced in freshly isolated human atrial myocytes [Ford et al., PMID 26455450] than in hES-CMs and hiPSC-CMs. The exact reason it unknown. We noticed stronger effects in our previous hiPSC-based study [Marczenke et al., PMID 28729840], so it might be an issue with the HuES6 background used here throughout. Furthermore, developmental changes in IKur have been described with a larger contribution to repolarization in adult state [Trépanier-Boulay et al., PMID 15364616]. The overall role of IKur in atrial hPSC action potential repolarization may thus be smaller than in freshly isolated human atrial myocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How does the ISL1 ChIP data compare to other data sets in target cell, size and overlap? The low number of apparent targets may be a technical and therefore a conceptual weakness. How can this be strengthened?</p></disp-quote><p>As acknowledged in the first paragraph of the subsection “ISL1 functionally antagonizes atrial specification driven by RA signaling”, technical reasons for the rather low fold enrichments cannot be fully excluded. Through personal communication with ISL1 experts, we have learned that there is virtually no commercially available ISL1 antibody that would be highly suited for ChIP, and our protocol tends to give better enrichments in case of other targets. To our knowledge, our data set represents the first ISL1 ChIP-seq analysis in a cardiac context. (There is no published mouse one, for instance, to compare our data set with.) Moreover, many target genes showed differential gene expression when comparing ISL1+ and ISL1-deficient cells, while ISL1 KO cells served as an excellent specificity control in the ChIP-seq analysis. Furthermore, the set of target genes was enriched for meaningful annotation terms and the identified motif resembles previously identified ones (Mazzoni et al., PMID 23872598). Finally, with regards to the overlap with the differential expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we also wish to point out that the effects of ISL1 disruption / induction on the cells' transcriptome are not really massive at an appropriate early time point (d 5). Hence, we think the rather small size of the ChIP-seq data could simply reflect the reality rather than presenting a &quot;conceptual weakness&quot;, so we would like to stick to our interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the outcome on MEIS2 after over-expression of ISL1. This important link seems to be missing. The authors suggest a unidirectional network. But perhaps ISL1 can also inhibit MEIS2. There would be many examples in the literature of segregation of cell fates through mutual TF antagonism (e.g. cardiac vs. blood).</p></disp-quote><p>A valid and interesting point, also because <italic>MEIS2</italic> is part of the ChIP-seq set of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). New data generated are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>: There is a very modest effect of ISL1 on <italic>MEIS2</italic>. Since the effect was not statistically significant, we did not incorporate it into our model. So, the ISL1 KO phenotype and the rescue by pulsed ISL1 induction appears to be MEIS2-independent. In this particular case, gene regulation appears to be unidirectional, with MEIS2 being able to downregulate ISL1 and not vice versa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The work of Mohun and antagonism between NKX2-5 and MEIS TFs should be considered and cited. How does it sit with this model? An important point for discussion as the ISL1 binding site revealed by ChIP in the current study is very similar to the NKE.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to cite the paper by Dupays et al. in our Discussion (subsection “Antagonism with RA signaling and cardiac subtype-specification module”, first paragraph) as it provides strong support for a functional role of MEIS1/2 in cardiac development. Although our study is ISL1-centred, in the revised manuscript we now also provide an analysis of terminally differentiated MEIS1/2 DKO cells that showed a mild but interesting phenotype (positive staining for CM markers but no spontaneous beating – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). An extended discussion of MEIS2 would certainly be justified if there was a mutual regulation between <italic>ISL1</italic> and <italic>MEIS2</italic>. Since it is mostly unidirectional, though (see previous point and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we would rather want to restrict our discussion to MEIS2 as a mediator of the ISL1-repressing effect by RA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The regulatory relationships between ISL1 and Nr2f1 and between MEIS1 and Nr2f1 should be functionally tested using gain and loss of function and better analysis of ChIP and putative regulatory elements. The authors performed ISL1 ChIP-seq analysis to identify direct target genes. However, the choice of the ISL1 enhancers is not totally explained. For example, why the NRF2 (-476kb) or MEF2C (-225kb) were selected? The ISL1 bound region in Nr2f1 is ~0.5Mb away from the gene body and no functional data is provided to suggest it acts as a distal repressor. A more detailed analysis should be made. It is important to know whether other cardiac TF-binding sites are found around this region. Enhancer function should be tested in vivo or in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>As to MEIS2, we think the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> provides strong evidence for the repressive effect on <italic>ISL1</italic>. Based on searches for a published MEIS1 motif in the <italic>ISL1</italic> locus, we have now carried out ChIP-qPCR analyses of various candidate regions (without being able to validate the antibody). None of the &gt;15 tested regions gave a significant enrichment, so we are not including these data, while acknowledging that the uncovered regulatory link between <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>ISL1</italic> is based on clear-cut transcriptional effects: Importantly, this part of the overall model is supported both by gain and loss-of-function experimentation using MEIS2 TET-ON as well as MEIS1/2 double-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C and 4D</xref>, respectively). With regards to the DKO analysis, we felt it was important to validate that these mutant cells are still capable of forming cardiac-like cells, which we now provide as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>The presentation and qPCR confirmation of selected ISL1 targets regions was based on the unbiased analysis of the ChIP-seq data set. As already mentioned, we sought to use the most stringent assay for evaluating the functionality of the -476kb element upstream of <italic>NR2F1</italic>, namely, to delete this region on an ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> background. The ultimate experiment was then to ask whether in this -476kb mutant line, <italic>ISL1</italic> induction on ISL1 KO background would fail to downregulate <italic>NR2F1</italic> at the cardiac precursor stage. The experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and regrettably, it did not reveal the predicted defect. Hence, we have toned down on our interpretation (subsection “ISL1 functionally antagonizes atrial specification driven by RA signaling”, second paragraph) although transcriptionally, the effect is highly reproducible and strong. This fact is also underscored by additional data generated during this revision. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows that endogenous RA signaling is not involved in <italic>NR2F1</italic> upregulation in the <italic>ISL1</italic> knockout, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref> highlights the cooperativity of ISL1 KO and RA signaling in promoting <italic>NR2F1</italic> induction. We hope the reviewer acknowledges our attempts to strengthen the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors used a published protocol for hESC differentiation, however characterization of cardiomyocytes origin (FHF vs. SHF) is missing in this study and potentially bears on how the current data meshes with in vivo studies on RA function in the SHF.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is an interesting question which developmental route hESCs actually take for acquiring a cardiomyocyte identity. We are devoting an entire paragraph to discussing this matter (subsection “Paradigm for second heart field development?”). As stated in this section, the difficulty in assessing the point resides in the lack of definite markers distinguishing between FHF and SHF. ISL1 itself is the prototype marker for the SHF (Cai et al., PMID 14667410), yet Dorn et al. (PMID 25524439) have recently shown that <italic>Isl1</italic> is also expressed in the FHF – albeit very transiently and likely without playing any important role there. So, the issue needs to be treated with caution and accordingly, we are discussing it in a rather careful manner. Notably, in our protocol, <italic>ISL1</italic> expression is very prominent and lasts for several days. Moreover, the cells are – like the SHF – functionally responsive to RA to become fated into atrial CMs. Hence, we believe this present study itself, with its thorough analysis of ISL1 function and its integration with RA signaling, may serve as an indication that the cells take a SHF route upon directed differentiation. At least our model fits best to this idea. It would be interesting to investigate if alternative protocols – notably BMP-driven ones – yield different <italic>ISL1</italic> expression kinetics or significantly lower expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is surprising to observe that peak of ISL1 expression, at day 5, corresponds to the activation of differentiated markers (cTnT, cTnC…). Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, and it is for this reason why we interpret these rapid kinetics as ISL1 being a functional driver of terminal cardiac differentiation. In our protocol, ISL1 expression commences at day 3 and reaches near-maximum levels as early as by day 4. In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, we now show the kinetics of <italic>ISL1</italic> induction at increased temporal resolution. This way, it can now be better appreciated that <italic>ISL1</italic> precedes the upregulation of terminal differentiation genes and conversely, their induction kinetics becomes delayed in an ISL1-deficient scenario. Interestingly, though, our time course and ChIP-seq analyses suggests that ISL1 may not directly activate many structural CM genes (with few exceptions like <italic>MYLK3</italic> – l. 356, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) but may rather control additional players like <italic>MEF2C</italic> and <italic>NKX2.X</italic> genes. These immediate-early targets show an even earlier induction compared with structural CM genes, i.e. they start becoming expressed approximately one day earlier (see day 4 data of <italic>MEF2C</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>/H, NKX2.5 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). As stated at the end of the Discussion section, we think our study certainly encourages the functional investigation of additional players involved in the cardiac program.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The time-course of ISL1 overexpression is not fully analyzed. It will be important to assess whether its overexpression affects the fate of multipotent cardiovascular progenitors at an earlier stage. Indeed, induction of ISL1 on days 3-4 is not sufficient to understand its function.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure whether we can agree to this point. Overall, given the rapid course of events in cardiac differentiation, we felt careful time course analyses would present the best means of analyzing the downstream effects of ISL1. In this regard, the TET-ON system proved to be a great tool allowing us to compare ISL1+ and ISL- scenarios in otherwise identical cell populations. (That is, any potential technical / cell batch etc. variability between e.g. WT and KO cells becomes eliminated this way.) We used DOX induction at days 3 and 4 in most experiments, as this most closely mimics the transient expression of endogenous ISL1 in WT cells. Revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> now shows this pattern at increased temporal resolution. Indeed, pulsed <italic>ISL1</italic> induction nicely rescued all phenotypes of ISL1 KO cells and our genome-wide time course analysis strongly supports this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Nonetheless, we have also investigated the consequences of continuous ISL1 overexpression up until the early CM stage, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>: There was no indication that ISL1 would arrest the differentiation process in any way. In further support of this notion, we now also show that ISL1 does not influence the expression levels of other precursor markers (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and that it does not significantly influence cell proliferation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). While we do acknowledge that long-term (i.e. non-physiological) ISL1 overexpression interferes with ventricular subtype specification as observed by Dorn et al. using mouse cells (PMID 25524439), we think our short-term analyses provide compelling evidence for ISL1 acting as an accelerator of cardiac differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Proliferation of cardiac progenitors after ISL1 expression and deletion should be correctly addressed. Gene expression here is being used only to define identity, but could also reflect flux in cell populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have carried out cell counting combined with cell cycle analysis based on propidium iodide staining (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). There were no significant differences between WT and ISL1 KO cells. While these results do not fully argue against a role of ISL1 in cell proliferation in general, they demonstrate that, in context of our directed differentiation protocol, the differences in cardiac induction kinetics are not due to an altered proliferation ability of ISL1 KO cells. We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors observe that ISL1 suppresses the atrial induction by RA signaling. However initially it was shown that late induction of ISL1 (3 weeks) antagonises the expression of ventricular specific gene Mlc2v (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The timing of induction of ISL1 expression in all subsequent experiments should be clarified and it should be indicated how early induction relates to atrial inhibition. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, Dox induction of ISL1 is done at d3 and d4.</p></disp-quote><p>DOX at days 3 and 4 was consistently used throughout unless stated otherwise (also see response to point 9 above). This fact is now clearly stated: &quot;Unless stated otherwise, the endogenous <italic>ISL1</italic> expression pattern was mimicked by pulsed DOX administration on days 3 and 4 using ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> cells.&quot; In addition, DOX timing is indicated in virtually all figures or accompanying legends (e.g. as &quot;DOX<sub>d3,4</sub>&quot;). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where this fact admittedly may not have been fully clear, we have added the following statement to the legend: &quot;In case of using ISL1<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> cells, all ISL1<sup>+</sup> data in this figure are based on a day 3-4 treatment with DOX&quot;. In some cases throughout this study, we used continuous long-term or late-stage DOX treatment like for instance in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, which is indicated in the treatment scheme in that same figure. Beyond that, the exact ISL1 overexpression duration in the short-term did not actually appear to be too critical: As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>, continuous <italic>ISL1</italic> overexpression from day 3-7 did by no means interfere with terminal cardiac differentiation but accelerated the process – just as a day 3-4 treatment did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the time window of maximum RA responsiveness (d 3-4) matched well with the time window of endogenous <italic>ISL1</italic> induction (see optimization data for RA-mediated atrial induction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>) and we think this fact relates to the elucidated functional antagonism between RA and ISL1 as reflected by our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Functional activity of differentiated cardiomyocytes was used to identify the subtype identity of these cells. However large images of differentiated cardiomyocytes should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We can agree to showing the pictures at higher magnification since we already show bulk analysis of the same kinds of samples in the previous panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) using immunoblotting. As requested, in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the specificity of the stainings can now be better appreciated – some subcellular structure in case of MLC2v as typical for the still rather early time point of analysis (3 wk), and a perinuclear / speckled subcellular pattern for the secreted factor ANP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Antagonism between RA signaling and ISL1 was mainly addressed through RA activation. It is important to examine the effect of RA deficiency in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>A good point which is also relevant in light of a recent study by the Keller laboratory (PMID 28777944). In order to examine RA deficiency, we first validated and then employed the pan-RA receptor antagonist AGN 193109 (AGN) (Agarwal et al., PMID 8647816). Hence, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, we first show that AGN strongly diminishes the RA-driven induction of the early atrial specifier <italic>NR2F1</italic> (and <italic>NR2F2</italic>) in a dose-dependent fashion. In the actual experiment, AGN treatment then did not rescue the phenotype of ISL1 KO cells. In particular, it did not lead to the repression of <italic>NR2F1</italic> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, these results importantly demonstrate that ISL1 suppresses <italic>NR2F1</italic> through a RA-independent regulatory axis. We thank the reviewer for the interesting suggestion.</p><p>Surprisingly, AGN treatment in ISL1 KO cells actually lead to a further increase of <italic>NR2F1</italic> (qPCR and Western blot) and of the independent atrial marker <italic>DHRS9</italic> (qPCR). This outcome may be explained by the fact that in absence of RA, the RA receptors exert a repressive effect on their target genes (reviewed by Cunningham and Duester, PMID 25560970; Nagy et al., PMID 9150137). In this case, the inhibition of the receptors mediated by AGN could act by abolishing this repressive effect in the absence of RA, leading to increased gene expression of the targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The choice of MEIS2 should be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now provided in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: We used a 3-fold expression difference between the +RA and -RA samples at day 5 as a first filtering criterion, while additionally requiring a pronounced immediate-early effect on gene expression in the range of hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Their observation that ISL1 accelerates CM differentiation in hES-derived cardiomyocytes is pretty much exactly what would be expected. From extensive in vivo and in vitro work, ISL1 is a marker of second heart field progenitors whose transient expression is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Thus, one would not really expect a primary requirement in the amplification of the progenitor population. In fact, signals that promote the proliferation of this population, such as canonical Wnt signaling, inhibit ISL1 expression and cardiomyocyte differentiation. This should be better discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an insightful comment and we tend to fully agree to this view – albeit mostly after having carried out this present study. In the literature, we failed to find hardly any evidence for a pro-differentiation function of ISL1 but rather, it is commonly used as <italic>the</italic> gene marking the progenitor state implying a functional role for stabilizing it. This is reviewed in our Introduction and in the beginning of our Discussion (Cao et al., PMID 23896987; Cohen et al., PMID 17607356; Qyang et al., PMID 18371348; Zhang et al., PMID 26942852). These studies also suggested a positive role of WNT signaling to promote ISL1 and cardiac precursor identity. It is for this reason that we also investigated various signaling molecules, including previously published cocktails, for their ability to stabilize the transient ISL1<sup>+</sup> cell state and that we carefully examined whether sustained <italic>ISL1</italic> expression would arrest cardiac differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To our knowledge, there is only one study that explicitly questions any positive role of WNT signaling in promoting cardiac precursor identity and of ISL1 being a stabilizer this stage (Kwon et al., PMID 19620969). We are citing this work in the last paragraph of the subsection “Differentiation-promoting function of ISL1”. In addition, we have added a sentence in the Discussion to underscore the controversial views in the field: &quot;In support of this view, Kwon et al. (2009) proposed that ISL1 may actually be counterproductive for sustaining the cardiac precursor state.&quot; After all, our study presents the first investigation of ISL1 function in the human system and given the conflicting views in the field, we hope this work will help to clarify the functional roles of this key factor – beyond its differentiation-accelerating effect highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) While it's true that ISL1 KO mice still have some atrial cells, these are thought to be first heart field-derived. More importantly, the ISL1 KO mice have significant atrial defects, arguing against their conclusion. Furthermore, in zebrafish, ISL1 is required for atrial differentiation at the venous pole. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon carrying out the present study we have learned about a revised view of SHF development that says the vast majority of atrial cells, too, are SHF-derived (e.g. in Burridge and Wu, PMID 26631515; Zaffran et al., doi:10.3390/jdb2010050). As stated in the Introduction (first paragraph), this paradigm change was apparently based on improved <italic>Isl1</italic>-Cre driver lines that were introduced several years after establishing ISL1 as a pan-SHF marker (Cai et al., PMID 14667410; Yang et al., PMID 16556916). At about E7.5, however, retinoic acid kicks in to act on the posterior part of the SHF where it promotes atrial specification while confining <italic>Isl1</italic> expression to the anterior portion (Hochgreb et al., PMID 13129847; Sirbu et al., PMID 18498088; Ryckebusch et al., PMID 18287057). Hence, despite initially marking the entire (early) SHF, ISL1 may ultimately be incompatible with atrial specification and our competition experiments show that this is indeed the case. Admittedly, the situation that the early SHF is all ISL1<sup>+</sup> whereas it later becomes divided into an ISL1<sup>-</sup> (posterior) and ISL1<sup>+</sup> (anterior) domain is a bit confusing and may impede the understanding of ISL1 function. It is for this reason that we think the hESC system can make a significant contribution here.</p><p>Overall, our data highlight a positive role of ISL1 in ventricular specification – in line with its prominent expression in the anterior SHF – and a negative one for atrial induction, in agreement with the exclusion of <italic>Isl1</italic> from the posterior SHF. Hence, we do think our model actually agrees well with the mouse <italic>Isl1</italic> knockout phenotype. Notably, our findings are related to the dynamic subtype specification process, not to preceding events. For instance, atrial defects seen in <italic>Isl1</italic> knockout mice could also be due to a reduced number of early pan-SHF progenitors or due to an impaired migration ability of these cells. Although our study is exclusively based on the hESC system, we extensively (and carefully) discuss our findings in light of the in vivo context (subsection “Paradigm for second heart field development?”), which has now been extended by clarifying a seeming discrepancy with the Dorn et al. study (PMID 25514439) – subsection “Antagonism with RA signaling and cardiac subtype-specification module”, third paragraph. In sum, we attempt to incorporate current views of heart chamber development to the best of our knowledge, whereas in principle, we would not deny that there might also be alternative ways of interpreting our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Loss of Meis factors only tempers the induction ability of retinoic acid, suggesting RA must induce/repress other critical factors. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We would agree. In the <italic>MEIS1/2</italic> double knockout, the ISL1 target <italic>MEF2C</italic> does not reach normal expression levels under RA, for instance, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms downstream of RA leading to functional <italic>ISL1</italic> depletion and release of the atrial program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> is meant to best reflect our findings in terms of the two competing branches converging of <italic>NR2F1</italic>. Certainly, though, RA does more than merely triggering <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>NR2F1</italic> expression and hence, the disclosure of the complete +/- RA expression time courses in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> is also meant to serve as a transparent starting point for further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Whether NR2F1 is required for the atrial differentiation effect observed in ISL1 KO cells should be tested. It is not clear that Nr2f1 can be accepted as a master regulator of atrial differentiation, at least by itself in hES cells, and the major factor driving cardiomyocyte specialization in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the illustration of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, the importance of <italic>NR2F1</italic> downstream of RA is based on the revealing work by Devalla et al. (PMID 25700171) in hESCs showing that it controls several key atrial ion channel genes like <italic>KCNA5</italic>. In full agreement with this, our study highlights the importance of <italic>ISL1</italic> suppression to release its repressive block on <italic>NR2F1</italic>. We do not deny that there may be additional mechanisms and factors involved. Moreover, in an effort meant to be complementary to the Devalla et al. study, we successfully knocked out <italic>NR2F1</italic> in our ISL<sup>KO/I.TET-ON</sup> line. We then sought to ask whether this defect would impede atrial induction as promoted by the <italic>ISL1</italic> knockout. As already mentioned, though, following a total of three rounds of genetic manipulation (ISL1 KO + ISL1 TET-ON + NR2F1 KO), these cells failed to differentiate properly in our hands, which unfortunately prevented us from incorporating these significant efforts into the revised manuscript. We are aware, therefore, that we are lacking the ultimate proof at this point but hope the reviewer will acknowledge that we tried hard in extending our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
