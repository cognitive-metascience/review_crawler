Often this variation displays an affective gradient with some individuals being more influenced by positive and others by negative events. For example, many people display an optimism bias, updating their beliefs to a greater extent following positive than negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sharot and Garrett, 2016</xref>). The opposite effect, a tendency to be more influenced by negative events, has been argued to cause illnesses such as depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mathews and MacLeod, 2005</xref>). However, relatively little work has explored why individuals might develop affective biases in the first place. This question is of particular importance as understanding the mechanisms which lead to the development of affective bias is an essential first step in the development of novel treatments designed to alter this process and thus reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. One way of answering <italic>why</italic> individuals develop affective bias is to consider <italic>when</italic> affective biases might be the appropriate way to think about the world. In this study we draw on recent advances from the computational neuroscience of learning to investigate whether affective biases may be understood in terms of how informative an individual judges an event to be. Below we describe the conceptual framework of this proposal and then suggest how this may be used to account for the occurrence of affective biases.</p><p>Recent computational work has demonstrated that individuals’ expectations are influenced more by those events which carry more information; that is, those events which improve predictions of future outcomes to a greater degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">MacKay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). One factor which influences how informative an event is is the changeability, or volatility, of the underlying association which is being learned. For example, imagine trying to learn what your colleagues think about your performance at work, based solely on their day-to-day feedback. One colleague seems to have a stable positive view of you, complimenting you on your work on 80% of the occasions you meet and never increasing or decreasing this frequency. In this case, each particular event (being complimented or not) provides little new information about what your colleague thinks about you, as you will always have an 80% chance of being complimented the next time you meet. In contrast, a second colleague’s appraisal of you seems to be more changeable, with periods when they think highly of you and compliment you regularly and others when they rarely compliment you at all. In this case each event provides more information; if you have recently been complimented by this colleague it is more likely that their opinion of you is currently high and they will compliment you the next time you meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When learning what your colleagues currently think about you, you should be more influenced by whether the second, more volatile, colleague compliments you or not, because this provides more useful information than the behaviour of the stable colleague.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27879.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of one trial from the learning task used in this study. Participants were presented with two shapes (referred to as shape ‘A’ and ‘B’) and had to choose one. On each trial, one of the two shapes was be associated with a ‘win’ outcome (resulting in a win of 15 p) and one with a ‘loss’ outcome (resulting in a loss of 15 p). The two outcomes were independent, that is knowledge of the location of the win provided no information about the location of the loss (see description of panel C below). Using trial and error participants had to learn where the win and loss were likely to be found and use this information to guide their choice in order to maximise their monetary earnings. (<bold>B</bold>) Overall task structure. The task consisted of 3 blocks of 80 trials each (i.e. vertical, dashed, dark lines separate the blocks). The y-axis represents the probability, <italic>p</italic>, that an outcome (win in solid green or loss in dashed red) will be found under shape ‘A’ (the probability that it is under shape ‘B’ is 1-<italic>p</italic>). The blocks differed in how volatile (changeable) the outcome probabilities were. Within the first block both win and loss outcomes were volatile, in the second two blocks one outcome was volatile and the other stable (here wins are stable in the second block and losses stable in the third block). The volatility of the outcome influences how informative that outcome is. Consider the second block in which the losses are volatile and the wins stable. Here, regardless of whether the win is found under shape ‘A’ or shape ‘B’ on a trial, it will have the same chance of being under each shape in the following trials, so the position of a win in this block provides little information about the outcome of future trials. In contrast, if a loss is found under shape ‘A’, it is more likely to occur under this shape in future trials than if it is found under shape ‘B’. Thus, for the second block losses provide more information than wins and participants are expected to learn more from them. (<bold>C</bold>) The four potential outcomes from a trial. Win and loss outcomes were independent, and so participants had to separately estimate where the win and where the loss would be on each trial in order to complete the task. This manipulation made it possible to independently manipulate the volatility of the two outcomes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27879-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>Within a reinforcement learning framework, the influence of events on one’s belief is captured by the learning rate parameter, with a higher learning rate reflecting a greater influence of more recently experienced events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). Humans adjust their learning rate precisely as described above, using a higher learning rate for events, such as those occurring in a volatile context, which they estimate to be more informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). The neural mechanism by which this modification of learning rate is achieved is thought to depend on activity of the central norepinepheric system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>), with increased phasic activity of the system, which may be estimated using pupilometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>), reporting the occurrence of more informative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>) and acting to enhance the processing of these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>This computational framework provides an overarching logic for when an individual might develop an affective biases; individuals should bias their processing towards those affective events that they estimate to be most informative. As well as providing a novel reformulation of why affective biases may develop, this framework also suggests a potential novel method for modifying such biases; for example, if a higher estimate of the information content of negative relative to positive events leads to negative affective bias, interventions which redress these estimates should also reduce the negative bias.</p><p>However, a number of critical questions concerning this account remain outstanding. Firstly, no previous study has demonstrated that humans maintain separate estimates of the information content of positive and negative events. While a number of studies have examined the effect of volatility on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>), they have all utilised only one type of outcome (i.e. rewards or punishments) and thus their results could be accounted for by learners maintaining an estimate of how volatile the general environment is and learning more rapidly to all outcomes in those environments they judge to be more volatile, rather than estimating the information content of specific outcomes. We tested whether these specific estimates were maintained using a novel learning task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in which participant choice led to both positive and negative outcomes, with the volatility of the outcomes (and therefore their information content) being independently manipulated in separate task blocks. Secondly, for estimates of the information content of positive and negative events to lead to the development of affective biases, the estimates themselves must be malleable. We assessed this malleability by testing whether the volatility manipulation described above altered participants’ estimated information content, as reflected by the learning rates they used. Lastly, while activity of the central NE system has been argued to represent estimates of volatility, it is not clear whether or how this system might multiplex separate representations of the volatility of different classes of event, such as the positive and negative outcomes examined here. We investigated this using pupilometry as a measure of NE activity while participants completed the task. We hypothesised that humans maintain separable estimates of the information content of positive and negative outcomes, that we could measure and manipulate these estimates using our task and that phasic NE activity yoked to a specific type of outcome would track the volatility of that outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>30 participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for demographic information) completed a two option learning task in which, on every trial, one option would be associated with a monetary win and one with a loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The win and loss outcomes occurred independently which required participants to learn separately which shape was associated with each outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The information content of the outcomes was varied across the three blocks by altering the volatility of the stimulus-outcome associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We estimated separate learning rates for the positive and negative outcomes by fitting a computational model (see Materials and methods) to participant choice in each task block. This allowed us to test whether participants independently altered the learning rates they used for the win and loss outcomes in response to how informative that outcome was (i.e. its volatility). Pupilometry data was collected during the task as a measure of activity in the central NE system.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27879.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic details of participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Measure</th><th valign="top">Mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Age</td><td valign="top">30.52 (9.51)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gender</td><td valign="top">76% Female</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">QIDS-16</td><td valign="top">5.03 (3.95)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Trait-STAI</td><td valign="top">35.79 (10.63)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>QIDS-16; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, 16 item self-report version.

Specifically, learning rates were higher for win (F(1,28) =15.47, p=0.001) and loss (F(1,28) =18.02, p&lt;0.001) outcomes when they were volatile (informative) than when they were stable (not informative). Similarly the learning rate for wins was higher than that for losses when wins were more volatile than losses (F(1,28) =26.02, p&lt;0.001) and the learning rate for losses was higher than for wins when losses were more volatile (F(1,28) =6.74, p=0.015). These results demonstrate that participants maintain independent estimates of the information content of positive and negative outcomes and that it is possible to alter these estimates using a simple volatility manipulation. In contrast to the effects on learning rate there were no significant effects of the task on the inverse temperature parameter of the learning model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; F(1,28) =0.01, p<italic>=</italic>0.92) indicating that, as intended, the volatility manipulation specifically altered learning rate.

As a result the task contains trials in which both positive and negative outcome encourage the same behaviour in future trials (e.g. when the win is associated with shape A and the loss with shape B, both outcomes encourage selection of shape A in the following trial) as well as trials in which the positive and negative outcomes act in opposition (e.g. when both outcomes are associated with shape A, then the win outcome encourages selection of shape A in the next trial and the loss outcome encourages selection of shape B). This second type of trial provides a simple and sensitive means of assessing how the volatility manipulations alters the impact of win and loss outcomes on choice behaviour in the task blocks. Specifically an increased influence of win outcomes (e.g. when wins are volatile) should lead to: (<bold>a</bold>) A decreased tendency to change (shift) choice when both win and loss outcomes are associated with the chosen shape in the current trial and (<bold>b</bold>) An increased tendency to change (shift) choice when both win and loss outcomes are associated with the unchosen shape in the current trial. This analysis does not depend on any formal model and thus can be used to complement the model based analysis reported in the main paper. We calculated the proportion of shift trials separately for trials in which both outcomes were associated with the chosen (‘both’) or unchosen (‘nothing’) shape for each of the three blocks (dark columns = both informative; grey columns = losses informative; white columns = wins informative). Consistent with the model based analysis, there was a significant interaction between trial type and block (F(1,28)=10.52, p=0.003). Participants switched significantly less frequently when both outcomes were associated with the chosen option in the win relative to loss informative blocks (F(1,28)=6.1, p=0.02) and switched significantly more frequently when both outcomes were associated with the unchosen option in the win relative to loss informative blocks (F(1,28)=4.69, p=0.04). This indicates that the results reported in the main paper are unlikely to be dependent on the exact form of the behavioural model used to derive the learning rate parameter.

One form, which is sometimes called ‘unexpected uncertainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>) is caused by changes in the associations being learned (i.e. volatility) and is the main focus of this paper (see main text for a description of how volatility influences learning). A second form of uncertainty, sometimes called ‘expected uncertainty’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>) arises when an association between a stimulus or action and the subsequent outcome is more or less predictive. For example, this form of uncertainty is lower if an outcome occurs on 90% of the times an action is taken and higher if the outcome occurs on 50% of the time an action is taken. Normatively, expected uncertainty should influence learning rate—a less predictive association (i.e. higher expected uncertainty) leads to more random outcomes which tell us less about the underlying association we are trying to learn, so learners should employ a lower learning rate when expected uncertainty is higher. In the learning task described in this paper both the expected and unexpected uncertainty differ between blocks. Specifically, when an outcome is stable in the task it occurs on 50% of trials, whereas when it is volatile it varies between occurring on 85/15% of trials. Thus the stable outcome is, at any one time, also less predictable (i.e. noisier) than the volatile outcome. This task schedule was used as a probability of 50% for the stable outcome improves the ability of the task to accurately estimate learning rates (it allows more frequent switches in choice). Further both forms of uncertainty would be expected to reduce learning rate in the stable blocks and increase it in the volatile block of the task. However, this aspect of the task raises the possibility that the observed effects on behaviour described in the main paper may arise secondary to differences in expected uncertainty (noise) rather than the unexpected uncertainty (volatility) manipulation. In order to test this possibility we developed a similar learning task in which volatility was kept constant and expected uncertainty was varied. In this magnitude task (panel a), participants again had to choose between two shapes in order to win as much money as possible. On each trial 100 ‘win points’ (bar on top of fixation cross with green fill) and 100 ‘loss points’ (bar under fixation cross with red fill) were divided between the two shapes and participants received money proportional to the number of win points – loss points of their chosen option. Thus, a win and loss outcome occurred on every trial of this task, but the magnitude of these outcomes varied. During the task, participants had to learn the expected magnitude of wins and losses for the shapes rather than the probability of their occurrence. This design allowed us to present participants with schedules in which the volatility (i.e. unexpected uncertainty) of win and loss magnitudes was constant (three change points occurred per block) but the noise (expected uncertainty) varied (Panel b; the standard deviation of the magnitudes was 17.5 for the high noise outcomes and 5 for the low noise outcomes). Otherwise the task was structurally identical to the task reported in the paper with 240 trials split into three blocks. We recruited a separate cohort of 30 healthy participants who completed this task and then estimated their learning rate using a model which was structurally identical (i.e. two learning rates and two inverse temperature parameters) to that used in the main paper (Model 1). As can be seen (Panel c), there was no effect of expected uncertainty on participant learning rate (block information x parameter valence; F(1,28)=1.97, p=0.17) during this task. This suggests that the learning rate effect reported in the paper cannot be accounted for by differences in expected uncertainty and therefore is likely to have arisen due to the unexpected uncertainty (volatility) manipulation. Inverse decision temperature did differ between block (Panel d; F(1,28)=5.56, p=0.026). As can be seen there was a significantly higher win inverse temperature during the block in which the losses had lower noise (F(1,28)=9.26,p=0.005) and when compared to the win inverse temperature when wins had lower noise (F(1,28)=5.35,p=0.028), but no equivalent effect for loss inverse temperature. These results indicate that, if anything, participants were more influenced by noisy outcomes. Interestingly a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>) described a learning tasks in which a normative effect of outcome noise was seen (i.e. a higher learning rate was used by participants when the outcome had lower noise). The task used by Nassar and colleagues differed in a number of respects to that used here (only rewarding outcomes were received and participants had to estimate a number on a continuous scale, based on previous outcomes rather than make a binary choice) which may explain why an effect on learning rate was not observed in the current task. Regardless of the exact reason for the lack of effect of noise in the magnitude task, it suggests that the effect described in the main paper is likely to be driven by an effect of unexpected rather than expected uncertainty.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27879-fig2-figsupp2-v3"/></fig></fig-group></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Does activity of the central NE system, as Estimated by Pupil Dilation, Track the Volatility of Positive and Negative Outcomes?</title><p>Next, we investigated the extent to which central NE activity, as estimated using pupilometry, was related to the information content of positive and negative outcomes in the learning task. Consistent with the behavioural findings a significant interaction between block volatility and outcome valence was found for the degree to which participants’ pupils dilated in response to outcome receipt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; F(1,27)=6.16; p=0.02). In other words, participants’ pupils dilated more on receipt of an outcome when that outcome was volatile (informative) relative to when it was stable (not informative). This effect was not further modified by the time bin following outcome (block volatility x outcome valence x time; F(5,135)=1.13, p=0.35). Analysing the positive and negative outcomes separately indicated that the effect of block volatility was significant for the loss outcomes (F(1,27)=10.46, p=0.003), but not for the win outcomes (F(1,27)=0.38, p=0.54). Indeed a direct statistical comparison of the size of the volatility effect between the positive and negative outcomes indicated a greater effect of volatility on the negative relative to positive outcomes (outcome volatility x valance; F(1,27)=4.34, p=0.047). This effect was seen on the background of a generally greater pupil dilation to receipt of a loss relative to a win (main effect of valence; F(1,27)=16.7, p&lt;0.001).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27879.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pupil response to outcome delivery during the learning task.</title><p>Lines illustrate the mean pupil dilation to an outcome when it appears on the chosen relative to the unchosen shape, across the 6 s after outcomes were presented.

However a number of other factors may also influence pupil dilation such as the order in which the outcomes were presented and the surprise associated with the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>). In order to ensure that these additional factors could not account for our findings we ran a regression analysis of the pupil data from the learning task. In this analysis we derived, for each participant, trialwise estimates of the outcome volatility and outcome surprise of the chosen option using the Ideal Bayesian Observer reported by Behrens et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>). These estimates were entered as explanatory variables alongside variables coding for outcome order (i.e. win displayed first or second), outcome of the trial (outcome received or not) and an additional term coding for the interaction between the outcome volatility and outcome of the trial (i.e. analogous to the pupil effect reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Separate regression analyses were run for each 2 ms timepoint across the outcome period, for win and loss outcomes and for each participant. This resulted in timeseries of beta weights representing the impact of each explanatory factor, for each participant and for win and loss outcomes. As can be seen, consistent with the results reported in the paper this analysis revealed a significant volatility x outcome interaction for loss outcomes (F(1,27)=6.249, p=0.019), with no effect for wins (F(1,27)=0.215, p=0.646). This result indicates that the pupil effects reported in the main paper are not the result of outcome order or surprise effects on pupil dilation.

These estimates produce a bias resulting in preferential learning, with a higher learning rate being used for the outcome which is most informative. These estimates are also malleable and thus may represent one route by which affective biases develop. A physiological measure of central NE activity was associated with this process, although this was only seen convincingly for loss outcomes.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that humans adapt their learning in response to subtle statistical aspects of the environment, such as employing an increased learning rate in volatile, or changeable, contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). These previous findings could be explained by learners maintaining an estimate of how volatile the general environment is and learning more rapidly from all outcomes experienced in those environments they judge to be more volatile. However, the results of the current study, in which learning rates for positive and negative outcomes were seen to be altered independently, cannot be accounted for by a general estimate of environmental volatility. Rather, this behaviour requires the parallel representation of the estimated volatility of distinct outcomes which are then used to specifically tune the learning from that outcome. More generally these results suggest that human learners are able to maintain independent estimates of the information content of different events and use these estimates to rationally adjust their learning, in this case producing a valence dependent affective bias.</p><p>In the current study we investigated the link between the learning rate used by participants, which provides a behavioural index of how informative they estimate an outcome to be, and pupil dilation which has been shown to correlate with central norepinepheric activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). Pupil dilation in response to outcome receipt differed as a function of the information content of the outcome, although this was only significant for losses. Specifically, when losses were informative, the difference in pupil dilation between trials in which a loss was received and when it was not received was greater than when the losses were not informative. This result is similar to previously reported findings of an increased pupil response to outcomes in a volatile context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>), although these earlier studies reported a general increase in pupil dilation rather than a dilation conditioned on receipt of the outcome. A possible explanation of this difference is that, as discussed above, in order to complete the tasks used in previous studies, which involved only one class of outcome, only an estimate of the general environmental volatility is required, whereas to perform the current task a volatility signal dependent on the outcome presented is needed. In other words, the volatility signal found in the pupil data from the current study is of the form required for participants to accurately perform the task. This suggests a degree of flexibility of the pupillary volatility signal, in that it may reflect the general volatility of a learned association or the volatility of specific dimensions of more complex associations depending on task demands. It is not clear whether these general and specific volatility signals are produced by a single or separate neural systems, although it may be possible to address this question using a task in which the total volatility of all task outcomes is manipulated independently of the volatility of individual outcomes.</p><p>The effect of outcome volatility on pupil dilation in the current study was significantly greater for loss than win outcomes with the correlation between this signal and behaviour also being significantly greater for losses. This surprising result raises the possibility that central norepinepheric activity is particularly related to the information content of negative, as opposed to positive outcomes. However, while we are not aware of previous studies which have reported pupillary volatility signals to positive and negative outcomes from a single task as in the current study, previous work has reported the presence of pupillary volatility signals in reward only tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the norepinpeheric system does respond to the volatility of positive outcomes, but that this response is less pronounced than that for negative outcomes. One explanation for this may be that, as discussed above, the volatility signal in the current task modified pupillary response to outcome receipt vs. non-receipt. The receipt of a loss led to a significantly greater pupil dilation than that produced by a win (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and thus the volatility effect, which modifies the relative dilation observed when an outcome is received, may be less apparent for wins. Of course, this explanation leaves open the question as to why the pupillary response to similar magnitude losses and wins is asymmetric in the first place. A similar pupillary asymmetry has been reported in decision making tasks designed to assess behavioural loss aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tversky and Kahneman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yechiam and Telpaz, 2011</xref>). It may be, therefore that the greater pupillary response to both the occurrence of a loss and to loss volatility is related to the general overweighting of loss relative to win outcomes reported in the broader decision making literature. If correct, this would suggest that increasing the relative magnitude of the pupillary response to the receipt of a win relative to a loss (for example, by increasing the salience of wins by increasing their magnitude) would also increase the size of the pupillary response to win volatility.</p><p>The pupilometry measure included in the current study raises the possibility that estimated information content may be influenced by pharmacological as well as cognitive interventions. Pupil size is influenced by the activity of a number of central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>) and previous work exploring the neural systems which control response to volatility have predicted a key role for NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>) suggesting it as an obvious pharmacological target. A single study has reported an effect of atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, on learning in a volatile environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jepma et al., 2016</xref>) although no previous work has examined the effect of a pharmacological intervention on learning to positive vs. negative outcomes. It would be interesting to test whether a pharmacological manipulation of norepinepheric function was able to modify the outcome specific volatility effect demonstrated in this paper as such an effect may indicate a clinically useful interaction between pharmacological and cognitive interventions. A pharmacological approach could also be used to investigate related mechanistic questions such as the greater pupillary response to loss than win outcomes and the greater pupillary signal for loss outcome volatility discussed above. Specifically, a greater impact of a pharmacological manipulation on learning rates for losses than wins would provide experimental evidence for a preferential role for the NE system in estimates of the information content of losses.</p><p>The parallel representation of estimated information content of two distinct outcomes, provides a potential mechanism by which individuals may come to be generally more influenced by events of one class than another. This finding may be relevant to clinical questions. In the case of depression, patients have been shown to be more influenced by negative events, for example tending to remember more negative than positive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 1995</xref>), attend to negative more than positive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gotlib et al., 2004</xref>) and learn more from negative and less from positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eshel and Roiser, 2010</xref>). As the negative biases described above are believed to be causally related to symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mathews and MacLeod, 2005</xref>), and interventions designed to alter negative biases can reduce symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Browning et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">NICE, 2009</xref>), these results raise the possibility that novel interventions which target exstimated information content may act to alter negative affective biases and thus reduce symptoms of the illness. Of course, identifying potential targets for treatment and showing that they may be altered experimentally as done in this paper is only the first step in the development of new treatments. The next step, analogous to a phase 2a study in drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciociola et al., 2014</xref>), is to assess the initial efficacy of a potential intervention which engages the target in a clinical population. A study designed to do this is currently underway using the volatility manipulation described in this paper (study identifier NCT02913898).</p><p>While the results of the current study provide evidence that the information content of different events can be estimated in parallel during learning, the level of abstraction at which these estimates function is not clear. For example, does the task used in the current study alter the estimated information content of all positive and negative outcomes, or just those used in the task? This question is relevant to the potential clinical application of interventions which modify this estimate, as the affective biases associated with emotional disorders are seen across a wide variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mathews and MacLeod, 2005</xref>) and thus an intervention which modifies one particular instance of bias is unlikely to be useful therapeutically. It is clearly unlikely that completing a single block of a learning task, as done in the current study, will produce a broad and generalised alteration of the estimated information content of all outcomes. Rather, in order to test the degree to which alteration of estimated information content generalises it will be necessary to repeatedly expose participants to situations in which one class of outcome (e.g. positive) is more informative and then measure whether this alters learning performance in separate tasks and, ultimately, whether it impacts on clinical symptoms. The intervention used in the ongoing clinical study described above involves repeatedly completing the ‘positive volatile’ block from the current study over the course of two weeks (see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Browning et al., 2012</xref> for a similar design) which will provide an initial assessment of this question.</p><p>The information content of an outcome is not solely a function of the volatility of its occurrence. Other factors, such as the strength of the association between a stimulus, or action, and the subsequent outcome, sometimes called the ‘expected uncertainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>) of the association, will also influence how informative the outcome is. Outcomes in the learning task reported in this paper vary in terms of both volatility and expected uncertainty, with both of these factors predicted to influence learning rate in the same direction (i.e. both factors should increase learning rate in the volatile blocks). An additional experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) in which volatility was kept constant but expected uncertainty varied found no effect on learning rate suggesting that the current findings were likely to be due to the effects of volatility rather than expected uncertainty. However, it would be interesting in future studies to explore whether it was possible to use manipulations of expected uncertainty, in the same way that volatility is used in this study, to induce a preference for positive over negative events. This may provide an alternative approach to engaging and altering expected information content than the volatility based effect reported here.</p><p>The current study demonstrates that human learners maintain separable estimates of the information content of distinct positive and negative outcomes and provides an initial proof of principle as to how these estimates may be modified. The study illustrates a little explored application of computational techniques in cognitive neuroscience; they may be used to identify potential novel treatment targets and by so doing spur the development of new and more effective treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>30 English-speaking, individuals aged between 18 and 65 were recruited from the local community via advertisements.

On each trial of the task participants were presented with two abstract shapes (letters selected from the Agathodaimon font) and chose the shape which they believed would result in the best outcome. On each trial, the win and loss outcomes were independently positioned (both had 15 p magnitude) such that a particular shape could be associated with one, both or neither of the win and loss outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As the two outcomes were independent participants had to separately learn the likely location of the win and the loss in the current trial. This learning was driven by the outcomes of previous trials and was used by participants to determine the most advantageous shape to choose on the current trial. Throughout the task the number and type of stimuli displayed during each phase of the trials was kept constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) in order to minimise variations in luminance between trials.</p><p>In total, the participants completed three blocks of 80 trials each, with a rest session between blocks. The same two shapes were used for all trials within a block, with different shapes being used between blocks. The outcome schedules were determined such that the probability that wins and losses were associated with shape A within a block always averaged 50%. In the volatile blocks the association between shape A and the outcome changed from 15% to 85% and back again in runs ranging from 14 to 30 trials. As described in the introduction, outcomes in the volatile blocks were more useful when predicting future outcomes, making them ‘informative’, whereas in the stable blocks outcome probabilities were fixed at 50%, making the outcomes ‘uninformative’ in terms of predicting future trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The eye tracking device was configured to record the coordinates of both of the eyes and pupil area at a rate of 500 Hz. The abstract shapes of the learning task were drawn on either side of a fixation cross which marked the middle of the screen and were offset by around 7° visual angle. The two outcomes (win and loss) were displayed on the screen in randomised order for a jittered interval of 2–6 (mean 4) seconds.

Missing data points (including blinks) were linearly interpolated. The resulting trace was subjected to a low pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off of 3.75 Hz and then z transformed across the session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). The pupil response to the win and the loss outcomes were extracted separately from each trial, using a time window based on the presentation of the outcomes. This included a 1 s baseline period before the presentation of the outcome, and a 6 s period following outcome presentation. Baseline correction was performed by subtracting the mean pupil size during the 1 s baseline period prior to the presentation of each outcome, from each time point in the post outcome period. Individual trials were excluded from the pupilometry analysis if more than 50% of the data from the outcome period had been interpolated (mean = 7% of trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>). One participant was excluded from the pupilometry analysis as more than 99% of their trials were excluded on this basis. The first 10 trials from each block were not used in the analysis as initial pupil adaption can occur in response to luminance changes in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). The preprocessing resulted in two sets of timeseries per participant, one set containing pupil dilation data for each included trial when the win outcomes were displayed and the other when the loss outcomes were displayed. A difference timeseries, calculated as the mean pupil response when the outcomes appears on the chosen versus unchosen shape in each block was then calculated which allowed for assessment of how the volatility of a specific outcome influenced dilation in response to receiving vs. not receiving that outcome (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for a complementary regression analysis of this data).</p><p>Preprocessing resulted in difference timeseries of pupil dilation data which represented the differential pupil dilation occurring during trials when the outcome (win or loss) was received relative to when it was not received over the six seconds after presentation of the outcomes. These timeseries were binned into 1 s bins to facilitate analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Parameters derived from the computational models were transformed before analysis so that they were on the infinite real line (an inverse logit transform was used for learning rates and a log transform for inverse temperatures). Where possible figures illustrate non-transformed parameters for ease of interpretation. The effect of the volatility manipulation on these transformed parameters was tested using a repeated measures ANOVA of data derived from the last two task blocks (i.e. when volatility was manipulated). In this ANOVA block volatility (win volatile block, loss volatile block) and parameter valence (wins, losses) were within subject factors and block order (win volatile first, loss volatile first) was a between subject factor. The critical term of this analysis is the block volatility x parameter valence interaction which tests for a differential effect of the volatility manipulation on the win and loss parameters.</p><p>The binned pupil timeseries data was analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA with time bin (1–6 s), block volatility (win volatile, loss volatile) and valence (wins, losses) as within subject factors and block order as a between subject factor. Again a block volatility x valence interaction tests for a differential effect of the volatility manipulation on the pupil dilation in response to wins vs. losses. We tested whether the volatility effect was larger for loss than win outcomes using a similar ANOVA in which block volatility was replaced by ‘outcome volatility’ (i.e. outcome volatility is high when the volatility of a given outcome, wins or losses, is high). In order to perform between subject correlations of the pupilometry data the mean relative dilation across the entire six second outcome period was also calculated for each participant and each block. In all analyses significant interactions were followed up by standard post-hoc tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by a MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship awarded to MB (MR/N008103/1).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Michael Frank and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Pulcu and Browning lay the groundwork to examine affective biases in depression in a novel and very informative manner. Specifically, they suggest that the affective bias towards negative events seen in depression across many different paradigms reflects a tendency to judge negative events as more &quot;informative&quot;. They designed an experiment in which the valence and the informativeness of outcomes were independent: at times, positive outcomes were more informative, at times negative ones. What they find is that individuals accurately infer the informativeness of the different events, and update their predictions accordingly. When wins are informative (because the cue indicating wins can change), then wins lead to stronger behavioural adaptation. The same is true for losses. Given that learners should generally put more weight on observations that are more predictive or informative, the paper proposes that overweighting of negative events might reflect an overestimate of their informativeness. Strikingly, they (approximately) replicate their previously reported association of pupil dilation with volatility, but find this relationship to be valence-dependent, as it was true of negative outcomes, but not for wins.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is a pleasure to read. It is well written, the methods are beyond reproach, and the combination of computational modelling with behaviour, neurophysiological measures and psychopathology is to be commended. However, there were a few important issues for which we would like clarification in order to proceed.</p><p>1) Both reviewers noted that the remarkable finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of a valence-dependent effect of volatility on pupil dilation did not seem to be tested statistically. There was a significant effect for losses and not gains, but we did not see a direct contrast between the two. If we've correctly understood the reported interaction in the subsection “Does Activity of the Central NE System, as Estimated by Pupil Dilation, Track the Volatility of Positive and Negative Outcomes?”, it does not test specifically for gain/loss asymmetry but is rather analogous to the 2nd and 3rd groups of bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The volatility factor is &quot;block volatility&quot; (wins-volatile versus losses-volatile). So if there were merely an overall effect of outcome volatility, it would come through here as an interaction of block type x valence. This could probably be dealt with by setting up the factors as &quot;outcome volatility&quot; and &quot;outcome valence&quot; rather than &quot;block volatility&quot; and &quot;outcome valence&quot;, and reporting the interaction. Secondarily, the conclusions section asserts that pupillary response was larger overall for losses (Discussion, third paragraph) but I don't see where this was tested.</p><p>2) Similarly, the finding that pupil dilation predicts learning rate for losses and not gains does not itself show that the correlation is stronger for one than the other (this can be tested e.g. via Fisher r-to-z transformation). Moreover, it is somewhat unclear what it means that the behavioral effect of volatility is just as strong in win vs. loss conditions but that the pupil doesn't care about wins – can the authors speculate about what this means for separate mechanisms of learning rate adjustment for non-aversive outcomes? (and how does this fit with previous data linking pupil dilation to learning).</p><p>3) Both reviewers also noted that the framing does not quite match up with the main results. The Abstract concludes, &quot;Humans maintain independent estimates of the information content of positive and negative outcomes&quot;. This implies people might estimate the informativeness of positive and negative outcomes as general categories, which would go a long way toward explaining affective bias. But what the paper actually shows is quite a bit narrower, that people can track the relative informativeness of two individual outcomes. It's not clear if valence has a privileged role compared to any other feature that might individuate the outcomes (and perhaps there is even a sensory confound in differences between auditory and visual characteristics of the outcomes), nor is it clear if people generalize informativeness estimates across events of the same valence. So it would be appropriate to reduce the breadth of this conclusion (which shows up in a number of places in the paper, including the next-to-last sentence of the Abstract and the first paragraph of the Discussion) and to discuss or qualify this potential limitation.</p><p>4) Relatedly, it is not really obvious that these wins and losses engage much 'affect', and indeed it is unclear whether anything lasting has really changed within the individuals other than that they performed the task well and correctly inferred the task structure. To support the statement about such a procedure changing affective biases, it would probably need some independent measure of that change, e.g. a change in one of the measures of negative affective bias typically associated with depression, e.g. memory or attention or learning on a separate task. An alternative would be to provide some psychopathological correlate, e.g. with rumination or dysfunctional attitudes, neuroticism or so, akin to how they were able to show an association with STAI in their previous paper. Given the broad nature of the issue there really is a long list of potential measures one could choose from. In the Materials and methods, the QIDS and the STAI were acquired – maybe these could be used?</p><p>5) For the control experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, it would be helpful to have additional information about how noise and volatility were parameterized, and what parameters were used. In other words, what was the generative model for the outcome schedules? I also didn't understand why this was referred to as a control experiment. It seems instead like a second test of the main hypothesis: if people adjust learning based on outcome informativeness, then noise level should make a difference. Given that it doesn't, it seems like this should be interpreted as a caveat or limitation on adaptive learning (rather than as a control for an alternative explanation).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Affective Bias as a Rational Response to the Statistics of Rewards and Punishments&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor, Michael Frank as the Reviewing editor, and two anonymous reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers both agreed that the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, reviewer 1 points out that the framing of the manuscript in terms of depression – given the lack of association with clinical measures – continues to miss out on an opportunity to highlight what the findings speak to more directly. In addition to the reviewer comments below, in the consultation session amongst reviewers and editor it was suggested that you could emphasize any or all of the following aspects:</p><p>The study shows that people are able to adjust learning rates in a way that is more clearly indicative of the latent causes compared to previous studies in this domain (i.e. it is feasible that the typical volatility learning rate association could have arisen from a generalized response to arousal or overall changeability of the world leading to more learning writ large, but here adjustment is clearly more sophisticated and rational).

It is well written, the methods are beyond reproach, and the combination of computational modelling with behaviour, neurophysiological measures and psychopathology is to be commended. However, there were a few important issues for which we would like clarification in order to proceed.</p><p>1) Both reviewers noted that the remarkable finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of a valence-dependent effect of volatility on pupil dilation did not seem to be tested statistically. There was a significant effect for losses and not gains, but we did not see a direct contrast between the two. If we've correctly understood the reported interaction in the subsection “Does Activity of the Central NE System, as Estimated by Pupil Dilation, Track the Volatility of Positive and Negative Outcomes?”, it does not test specifically for gain/loss asymmetry but is rather analogous to the 2nd and 3rd groups of bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The volatility factor is &quot;block volatility&quot; (wins-volatile versus losses-volatile). So if there were merely an overall effect of outcome volatility, it would come through here as an interaction of block type x valence. This could probably be dealt with by setting up the factors as &quot;outcome volatility&quot; and &quot;outcome valence&quot; rather than &quot;block volatility&quot; and &quot;outcome valence&quot;, and reporting the interaction. Secondarily, the conclusions section asserts that pupillary response was larger overall for losses (Discussion, third paragraph) but I don't see where this was tested.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have added an additional analysis to the manuscript which confirms that the difference in magnitude of the volatility effect for the win and loss outcomes was statistically significant:</p><p>“Indeed a direct statistical comparison of the size of the volatility effect between the positive and negative outcomes indicated a greater effect of volatility on the negative relative to positive outcomes (outcome volatility x valance; F(1,27)=4.34, p=0.047).”</p><p>Please note that the main block volatility x valence effect reported in the original paper should have been p=0.02 rather than p=0.04, we have corrected this and apologise for the error. A brief description of the above analysis has been added to the Materials and methods section of the paper:</p><p>“We tested whether the volatility effect was larger for loss than win outcomes using a similar ANOVA in which block volatility was replaced by “outcome volatility” (i.e. outcome volatility is high when the volatility of a given outcome, wins or losses, is high).”</p><p>We have also added in the requested analysis confirming that pupil dilation to losses was greater than to wins:</p><p>“This effect was seen on the background of a generally greater pupil dilation to receipt of a loss relative to a win (main effect of valence; F(1,27)=16.7, p&lt;0.001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the finding that pupil dilation predicts learning rate for losses and not gains does not itself show that the correlation is stronger for one than the other (this can be tested e.g. via Fisher r-to-z transformation). Moreover, it is somewhat unclear what it means that the behavioral effect of volatility is just as strong in win vs. loss conditions but that the pupil doesn't care about wins – can the authors speculate about what this means for separate mechanisms of learning rate adjustment for non-aversive outcomes? (and how does this fit with previous data linking pupil dilation to learning).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now conducted the Fisher r-to-z transformation analysis which confirms that the correlations are significantly greater for losses than wins:</p><p>“This correlation was significantly greater for losses than for wins (Fisher r-to-z transformation z=2.27, p=0.02).”</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the interpretation of this difference is not straightforward. While we also agree that the results raise the possibility of specificity in the pupillary response to negative vs. positive outcomes we think that caution is warranted in this interpretation. We have elaborated our thoughts on this in a thoroughly revised section in the Discussion of the paper (fifth and sixth paragraphs). In summary, we suggest a) that the previous work describing increased pupil dilation for volatile relative to stable rewards suggests that the central NE system does in fact respond to the volatility of positive outcomes, b) that the smaller effect of volatility for positive outcomes in the current study may relate to fact that the volatility signal in the current study is conditioned on receipt of the outcome and the overall dilation to rewards is smaller than that to losses and finally c) this proposal may be tested in future work by varying the salience (e.g. by varying the magnitude) of positive vs. negative outcomes which would have the effect of varying the dilation to the outcomes or by testing the impact of pharmacological manipulations on win vs. loss learning rate:</p><p>“The effect of outcome volatility on pupil dilation in the current study was significantly greater for loss than win outcomes with the correlation between this signal and behaviour also significantly greater for losses. […] Specifically, a greater impact of a pharmacological manipulation on learning rates for losses than wins would provide experimental evidence for a preferential role for this system in estimates of the information content of losses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both reviewers also noted that the framing does not quite match up with the main results. The Abstract concludes, &quot;Humans maintain independent estimates of the information content of positive and negative outcomes&quot;. This implies people might estimate the informativeness of positive and negative outcomes as general categories, which would go a long way toward explaining affective bias. But what the paper actually shows is quite a bit narrower, that people can track the relative informativeness of two individual outcomes. It's not clear if valence has a privileged role compared to any other feature that might individuate the outcomes (and perhaps there is even a sensory confound in differences between auditory and visual characteristics of the outcomes), nor is it clear if people generalize informativeness estimates across events of the same valence. So it would be appropriate to reduce the breadth of this conclusion (which shows up in a number of places in the paper, including the next-to-last sentence of the Abstract and the first paragraph of the Discussion) and to discuss or qualify this potential limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is an interesting outstanding question related to the level of abstraction at which the observed effect operates. We have amended the description of our findings throughout the study to highlight that participants learned differently from “distinct” outcomes and have added a new section to the Discussion in which this question is covered. As this issue is closely linked to the next point raised by the reviewers, this novel section is reproduced after point 4 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Relatedly, it is not really obvious that these wins and losses engage much 'affect', and indeed it is unclear whether anything lasting has really changed within the individuals other than that they performed the task well and correctly inferred the task structure. To support the statement about such a procedure changing affective biases, it would probably need some independent measure of that change, e.g. a change in one of the measures of negative affective bias typically associated with depression, e.g. memory or attention or learning on a separate task. An alternative would be to provide some psychopathological correlate, e.g. with rumination or dysfunctional attitudes, neuroticism or so, akin to how they were able to show an association with STAI in their previous paper. Given the broad nature of the issue there really is a long list of potential measures one could choose from. In the Materials and methods, the QIDS and the STAI were acquired – maybe these could be used?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this issue and agree that the degree to which the effect observed in this study generalises to different situations (or even to clinical symptoms) is not clear. The focus of our work was to test basic mechanistic questions (do people actually maintain separate estimates of the information content of different outcomes? Can we modify these and are they linked to central NE function?) which are potentially relevant to why affective biases may develop. As a result of this focus our study was set up using a single session, within subject design. All participants therefore completed a single “positive volatile” block and a single “negative volatile” block. As it was implausible that completion of a single block of a learning task would significantly alter subjective symptoms of depression we did not collect these after completion of each of the separate blocks (NB subjective symptoms of depression generally change over the course of weeks of treatment). We have highlighted the question of effect generalisation in a new Discussion section in which we describe the outstanding questions (also related to point 3 above) and how they might be answered using different study designs:</p><p>“The results of the current study provide evidence that the information content of different events can be estimated in parallel during learning, however the level of abstraction at which these estimates function is not clear. […] The intervention used in the ongoing clinical study described above involves repeatedly completing the “positive volatile” block from the current study over the course of two weeks (see; Browning et al., 2012 for a similar design) which will provide an initial assessment of this question.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the control experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, it would be helpful to have additional information about how noise and volatility were parameterized, and what parameters were used. In other words, what was the generative model for the outcome schedules? I also didn't understand why this was referred to as a control experiment. It seems instead like a second test of the main hypothesis: if people adjust learning based on outcome informativeness, then noise level should make a difference. Given that it doesn't, it seems like this should be interpreted as a caveat or limitation on adaptive learning (rather than as a control for an alternative explanation).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added in details of the generative process used to determine magnitude size in this task (added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>):</p><p>“This design allowed us to present participants with schedules in which the volatility (i.e. unexpected uncertainty) of win and loss magnitudes was constant (three change points occurred per block) but the noise (expected uncertainty) varied (Panel b; the standard deviation of the magnitudes was 17.5 for the high noise outcomes and 5 for the low noise outcomes).”</p><p>We had added this task to tease apart the effects of expected and unexpected uncertainty reported in the main paper, but agree that perhaps calling this a “control” task is confusing. We have now renamed it descriptively as the “magnitude” task which is described in the main paper as an “additional” task.</p><p>We have also added in an additional discussion about the results from this task and how it might be interpreted in light of the paper by Nassar and colleagues which reported an effect of expected uncertainty on reward learning using a very different task to that reported here. Given this finding we don’t think the result of our task can be taken as strong evidence for a limitation to the adaptive learning account, but rather that our task is more sensitive to differences in unexpected than expected uncertainty. This additional discussion has been added to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>:</p><p>“Interestingly a previous study (Nassar et al., 2012) described a learning tasks in which a normative effect of outcome noise was seen (i.e. a higher learning rate was used by participants when the outcome had lower noise). […] Regardless of the exact reason for the lack of effect of noise in the magnitude task, it suggests that the effect described in the main paper is likely to be driven by an effect of unexpected rather than expected uncertainty.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers both agreed that the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, reviewer 1 points out that the framing of the manuscript in terms of depression – given the lack of association with clinical measures – continues to miss out on an opportunity to highlight what the findings speak to more directly. In addition to the reviewer comments below, in the consultation session amongst reviewers and editor it was suggested that you could emphasize any or all of the following aspects:</p><p>The study shows that people are able to adjust learning rates in a way that is more clearly indicative of the latent causes compared to previous studies in this domain (i.e. it is feasible that the typical volatility learning rate association could have arisen from a generalized response to arousal or overall changeability of the world leading to more learning writ large, but here adjustment is clearly more sophisticated and rational). Other aspects that the study is relevant to mentioned by reviewers are the known neurobiology of learning from rewards and losses more generally, loss aversion, unified scalar value codes, the relative roles of dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline in this sort of task.

We have thoroughly revised the Introduction and Discussion section of the manuscript in order to make the following changes:</p><p>1) General framing of the study: We have changed the framing of the study so that it is now introduced in terms of affective bias (i.e. the tendency to learn differently from rewards relative to losses) rather than as directly relevant to depression. We have completely removed discussion of depression in the Introduction (and Abstract) with the exception of noting that it is associated with negative affective biases and that understanding biases is essential in developing new treatments (as noted, this was the motivating factor for the study). We have reordered the Discussion to highlight the mechanistic sections relative to the “clinical application” sections. We have also removed completely the sections in which we suggested that the volatility effect described in the paper provides a compelling account of the development of negative bias in depression (we agree with reviewer 1 that it cannot account for all elements of the negative biases seen in depression). The sections of the Discussion which do cover potential clinical applications of the current findings are now focused only on the development of new treatments (and using computational approaches to achieve this).</p><p>2) Additional sections added to the Introduction/Discussion sections: In response to the editorial suggestion that a number of more mechanistic issues would provide a better framing of the study we have made the following changes:</p><p>a) We have added additional text to both the Introduction and Discussion sections highlighting that previous volatility findings may have arisen due to learners estimating general environmental volatility, whereas our results demonstrate a more sophisticated learning system which requires outcome specific estimates of volatility.</p><p>b) We have discussed the asymmetry of the pupilometry data (i.e. a larger overall response as well as greater volatility signal to losses relative to gains) with reference to similar findings in the loss avoidance literature.</p><p>Overall, we hope that we have improved the paper by refocusing on the mechanistic issues which are most closely linked to our results while maintaining those treatment relevant aspects which speak to future clinical application.</p></body></sub-article></article>
