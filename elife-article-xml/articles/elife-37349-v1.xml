pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37349.001</object-id><p>Generating a comprehensive description of cortical networks requires a large-scale, systematic approach. To that end, we have begun a pipeline project using multipatch electrophysiology, supplemented with two-photon optogenetics, to characterize connectivity and synaptic signaling between classes of neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and human cortex. We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies. Here, we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell classes and layers we sampled, and that most mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons, however, exhibited facilitation. These results contribute to a body of evidence describing recurrent excitatory connectivity as a conserved feature of cortical microcircuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37349.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer sheet of brain tissue, the neocortex, is composed of circuits formed from trillions of connections among billions of neurons, of which there are about one hundred different neuron types. The scale and complexity of cortical circuitry pose experimental challenges, leading to an incomplete understanding of how cortical cell types are connected and the computations that take place at the connections.</p><p>About half of the cell types in the brain are excitatory, which means they can activate other cells. The cortex consists of several distinct layers of cells, within which excitatory cells cooperate to process the signals they receive from other cortical layers and brain areas. Using recordings of electrical activity arising from the connections between pairs of excitatory neurons, Seeman, Campagnola et al. measured the likelihood and strength of connectivity among related groups of excitatory cell types in slices of cortex taken from human and mouse brains.</p><p>The initial results confirm previous findings that individual layers of human cortex can have more and stronger excitatory connections than the same layers of mouse cortex. In most layers of mouse cortex, repeatedly activating the excitatory cells leads to progressively weaker responses. However, in the upper layers of mouse cortex, the opposite effect is sometimes seen: more excitatory activity causes the connections to generate stronger responses. By feeding these data into a computer model, Seeman, Campagnola et al. described and compared the activity of the groups of related excitatory cell types.</p><p>These results are the first of a new, large-scale project where findings can be integrated across experiments to gain a more detailed picture of cortical circuitry and computation. Neuroscientists will be able to use the results to build advanced computer models of cortical circuits. Such models will, for example, generate predictions for how the attributes of excitatory connectivity revealed by Seeman, Campagnola et al. influence how information is processed in the cortex. In so doing, the models will add to our understanding of how the human brain works both in health and in disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>short term plasticity</kwd><kwd>cortical wiring</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01MH105982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campagnola</surname><given-names>Luke</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Hongkui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Gabe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-throughput pipeline for the characterization of cortical connectivity in mouse and human cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Generating well-informed, testable hypotheses about how the cortex represents and processes information requires experimental efforts to characterize the connectivity and dynamics of cortical circuit elements as well as efforts to build models that integrate results across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sejnowski et al., 1988</xref>). Estimates of connectivity and synaptic properties vary widely between experiments due to differences in model organisms, experimental parameters, and analytic methods. This variability limits our ability to generate accurate, integrative computational models.</p><p>Addressing this problem requires standardized experimental methods and large-scale data collection in order to characterize synaptic connections between the large number of potential cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). Although it may be possible to infer part of these results based solely on anatomical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Markram et al., 2015</xref>), evidence has shown that the rate of connectivity and properties of synaptic signals can depend on the identity of the pre- and postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen and Sjöström, 2015</xref>). To collect standardized data at scale, we have established a pipeline to characterize local, functional connectivity in the adult mouse and human cortex. Initially, we seek to characterize connectivity among cell classes, that is, groups of related cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we report on the characteristics of local excitatory inputs among pyramidal neurons from within the same layer (recurrent connections) obtained during the pipeline's system integration test—an end-to-end test of the pipeline's hardware, software, and workflow carried out prior to initializing the pipeline.</p><p>Recurrent excitatory connectivity is thought to be important in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2018</xref>) and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). It is a common feature in computational models of cortical working memory, receptive field shaping, attractor dynamics, and sequence storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camperi and Wang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pernice et al., 2018</xref>). Empirical measurements of recurrent connectivity and synaptic properties are needed in order to constrain and validate these models. However, characterizing recurrent connectivity in a standardized, high-throughput manner is challenging because the synaptic connections can be sparse and weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braitenberg and Schüz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, most measurements of recurrent connectivity have been performed in juvenile rodents, leading to a recent debate over the rate of connectivity in the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The data reported here demonstrate that sparse recurrent connectivity is present among excitatory neurons in all layers of adult mouse and human cortex. Using a novel automated method for systematically estimating connectivity across experiments, we further demonstrate that different populations of adult mouse pyramidal neurons exhibit characteristic distance-dependent connectivity profiles and short-term dynamics. Finally, we quantify and compare differences in short-term dynamics with a mechanistic computational model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> whole-cell recordings from up to eight excitatory neurons simultaneously. We probed 2836 putative connections in mouse V1 from excitatory cell classes defined by transgenic labeling, morphology, and cortical layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). We further probed 616 putative connections in human frontal and temporal cortex from excitatory cell classes defined by morphology and cortical layer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Recurrent connectivity was tested and observed in layer 2/3 through layer 6 of mouse primary visual cortex and layer 2 through layer 6 of the human cortex. To assess connectivity, trains of action potentials were evoked in each cell, one at a time, while recording synaptic responses in all other cells. Connections were identified by the presence of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked with a short latency and low jitter following the presynaptic spike, consistent with monosynaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We encountered no examples of EPSPs eliciting spikes in any recorded pyramidal cells, further indicating that evoked polysynaptic activity should be rare in these experiments.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37349.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The number of connections probed and the number of connections used in subsequent analyses per the analysis flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>.</title><p>For each column, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> letter indicates the end level in the analysis flow diagram while the main figure reference indicates <italic>n</italic> connections included in that figure.

Detection limits are influenced by several factors including the kinetics of EPSPs, the amplitude and kinetics of background noise, the frequency and properties of spontaneous EPSPs, and the number of evoked presynaptic spikes. One consequence is that we expect to generally underestimate connectivity, and in some cases, cell class differences in synaptic strength can be misinterpreted as differences in connectivity. Another consequence is that it may not be possible to obtain an accurate measurement of the distribution of synaptic weights, since the weakest synapses are undetectable.</p><p>To address these issues, we characterized the sensitivity of our experiments by testing whether a machine classifier could detect simulated EPSPs of varying, known strength (see Materials and Methods). The classifier was trained to detect connections based on features extracted from the averaged response to evoked spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; features listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and from the distributions of features measured on individual responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For each putative connection probed, we collected recordings of background activity when no cells were being stimulated and superimposed EPSP-like deflections. These recordings were then processed for features (Figure 3 – table supplement 1) which were fed to the classifier to generate connectivity predictions. By testing several sets of artificial EPSPs in which we systematically varied the average amplitude, we were able to measure the relationship between EPSP strength and the probability that a connection could escape detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37349.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of synapse detection limits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot showing measured EPSP amplitude versus minimum detectable amplitude for each tested pair.

Likewise, EPSPs with shorter rise time (or other properties that distinguish the EPSP from background) are more likely to be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Dividing the measured distribution by the probability of detection yields a corrected distribution (dark grey) with an overall 10% increase in connectivity. Although this estimate becomes unstable as the detection probability nears zero, an interesting result is that the left edge of the distribution trends downward even in the region where detection probability is high, suggesting that the sensitivity of our experiments is adequate to capture the majority of synapses and that we have accurately represented the underlying distribution of synaptic strengths. We are cautious, however, in our interpretation of this result--the analysis relies on several assumptions about the behavior of the classifier and the realism of the simulated EPSPs. Ultimately, the approach must be validated against a larger dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Connection probability of excitatory synapses</title><p>Estimates of connectivity vary widely across studies, in part due to methodological differences.

Across cell classes we saw depression in Rorb, Tlx3, and Sim1 synapses, whereas layer 2/3 synapses showed modest facilitation on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom left). The two Ntsr1 connections (data not shown) also showed facilitation as has been previously reported for layer 6 CT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">West et al., 2006</xref>). The amplitude ratio of the last pre-recovery pulse (8) to the first, for individual connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left), highlights the heterogeneity in layer 2/3 dynamics where some synapses depressed strongly (ratio &lt; 1) and others facilitated (ratio &gt; 1). Individual dynamics in Rorb, Tlx3, and Sim1 generally showed more depression than layer 2/3 (KW p=0.04). In addition to probing induction of short-term plasticity, we also measured recovery from short-term effects at various time delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom, blue dots) for layer 2/3, Rorb, Sim1, and Tlx3 connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom). All types showed a similar time-course of recovery as measured by the ratio of the first recovery pulse (9) to the first induction pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, right).</p><p>Although we observed depression in both layer 5 classes, previous reports in rat somatosensory cortex showed that recurrent connections between thick tufted layer 5b cortical neurons can facilitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lefort and Petersen, 2017</xref>). The availability of free calcium in the presynaptic terminal impacts release probability and thus short-term dynamics of a synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rozov et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesized that 0.3 mM EGTA in the intracellular solution may buffer presynaptic calcium accumulation and reduce the magnitude of facilitation observed in our layer 5 connections. We tested this in a subset of recurrent Sim1 connections (23 connections found/210 probed) and Tlx3 connections (five connections found/52 probed) in which there was no EGTA in the internal solution ([Ca<sup>++</sup>]<sub>e</sub> = 2.0mM). Over the course of a 50 Hz train, we saw overall depression in both Tlx3 and Sim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) such that the 8:1 pulse ratio was statistically indistinguishable in the two EGTA concentrations (Tlx3 KS test p=0.47; Sim1 KS test p=0.35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We did observe, however, that Tlx3 synapses show transient facilitation during the second pulse of the train (paired-pulse ratio; KS test p=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We did not see a significant difference in paired-pulse ratio for Sim1 connections in the absence of EGTA (KS test p=0.35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). This suggests that Tlx3 and Sim1 cell classes have different synaptic dynamics but are nonetheless dominated by depression.</p><p>To more fully capture the dynamic processes contributing to short-term plasticity and how they may differ among connection types we turned to a model of short-term dynamics which has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hennig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Richardson et al., 2005</xref>). For homogeneous populations, we expect that applying the model to an average response will accurately represent the short-term dynamics of a particular cell class. Layer 2/3, Rorb, Tlx3, and Sim1 synapses were modeled with depression (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 4</xref>, Materials and methods) and use-dependent replenishment (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 5</xref>, Materials and methods). For the more homogeneous cell classes (Rorb, Tlx3, and Sim1), the model performed well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Sim1 connections r<sup>2</sup> = 0.845, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>) in capturing depression during the eight initial pulses at various frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) as well as modeling recovery at various delays for 50 Hz stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, open circles). Heterogeneity among layer 2/3 synapses made it difficult to constrain the model and thus were not included in further analysis. From this model, we can extract free parameters such as P<sub>0</sub> which estimates release probability and 𝜏<sub>r0</sub> which estimates the time course of recovery from depression. Rorb connections had the largest release probability (P<sub>0</sub> = 0.30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left) which is consistent with faster entry into depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom pulse 2).

We observed sparse recurrent connections between excitatory neurons in layers 2/3 through 6 in adult mouse visual cortex and layers 2 through 6 of adult human cortex. We supplemented mouse multipatch experiments with high-throughput 2P optogenetic stimulation to sample connectivity at greater distances than is generally feasible using the multipatch approach. Most excitatory recurrent connections in mouse cortex were dominated by short-term synaptic depression.</p><p>Estimates of connectivity derived from multipatch experiments in brain slices should be considered as a lower bound on the underlying population connectivity due to sensitivity to false negatives from several sources. These effects may contribute to differences in reported connectivity across studies. A fraction of synaptic connections are expected to be severed during slicing; one estimate of connectivity perturbed by slicing approaches 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>). The effect on measured connection probability depends on the thickness of the slice, the depth of recorded cells from the cut surface, the morphology of recorded cells, and the distance between them. Although we minimize lost connections by patching deep in the slice (&gt;40 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>) and by selecting cells in close proximity, this is still a likely source of false negatives in our data. Another fraction of synapses are expected to be either too weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isaac et al., 1995</xref>) or too distal from the recording pipette to be detected. The magnitude of this effect is difficult to estimate, but our initial analysis hints that our methods are sensitive enough to capture the majority of synapses. To obtain more accurate estimates of connectivity, it will be necessary to combine these results with other methods such as <italic>in vivo</italic> multipatch recordings, transsynaptic tracing, and serial section electron microscopy. These methods are also limited, but in each case the constraints are different and potentially complementary.</p><p>There is a wide range of reported rates of recurrent connectivity among excitatory neurons in rodent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). One suggestion is that differences between the juvenile and adult rodent can explain the variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid changes associated with development, we carried out our experiments in the adult (about two months old) cortex. Nevertheless, our conclusion that recurrent connectivity is sparse but not absent is similar to results from experiments in other adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and juvenile animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morishima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>). A notable difference, however, is that we never observed rates of recurrent connectivity as high or synaptic amplitudes as large as those reported in juvenile rodents, consistent with the observation that the rate of recurrent connectivity and synaptic strength declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourgeois and Rakic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>).</p><p>All excitatory cell classes investigated in this study, in human and in mouse, exhibited recurrent connectivity but the rate of recurrent connectivity depended on the class. For example, in two subcortically projecting neuron classes, the connectivity rate was approximately 10% in Sim1 (layer 5) expressing cells, whereas Ntsr1 expressing cells (layer 6) had the lowest rate of intralaminar connectivity among all excitatory cell classes tested in this study. This low connectivity is consistent with previous work on layer 6 CT cells using multipatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">West et al., 2006</xref>) and single cell rabies tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vélez-Fort et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that recurrent connectivity may be a general property of excitatory neurons that is regulated depending on the target region.</p><p>How do the rates of recurrent connectivity in mouse compare to other species? In human cortex, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>) find that the frequency of connectivity among excitatory neurons is at least two and half times greater than the highest connectivity rate observed in the adult mouse. It may be that high rates of recurrent connectivity in human are a circuit feature of higher mammals as this is also reported to be the case in cat and monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kisvárday et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGuire et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>). Another possibility, however, is that the observed difference between mouse and human is more related to the different cortical regions. Future work will examine how relatively high recurrent connectivity might be counterbalanced by short-term dynamics and/or inhibitory feedback.</p><p>In our study, the distance-dependent connection probability profiles fall off with distance and are consistent with connectivity depending on the extent of overlap between neighboring axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peters, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binzegger et al., 2004</xref>, Braitenberg and Schüz 1998, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Pelt et al., 2013</xref>). It is unlikely that the distance-dependent connectivity profiles we observed are an artifact of tissue preparation as it has previously been demonstrated that the truncation of neuronal processes reduces overall connectivity but maintains the spatial pattern of connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stepanyants et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>). Further effort is required to determine whether our connectivity profiles cannot be predicted from neuronal morphology as has been observed in, for example, intralaminar connections between corticostriatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Like most similar studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>) that have preceded this work, we have measured connectivity and synaptic properties within broad cell classes that include multiple subtypes. Although we found differences between these classes, we expect that in some cases, important cell-type-dependent differences will be obscured by this approach. Initially, we can mitigate this by characterizing the distribution of properties and relating these to morphological and electrophysiological properties that relate to narrower cell classes or types. However, transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevée et al., 2018</xref>) has refined and expanded the catalog of cell types, necessitating the development of new methods to measure synaptic properties with greater cell type resolution and with enough throughput to address the sizeable combinatorial space of connections between types.</p><p>In the primary visual cortex of the adult mouse, we found that recurrent connections, except for Ntsr1 connections and a subset of L2/3 connections, depressed after eight action potentials across a range of frequencies. Although depression dominates the net response, it is important to consider that facilitation, depression, and other mechanisms may simultaneously contribute to overall short-term dynamics. Furthermore, the availability of calcium in the presynaptic terminal can strongly influence the balance between mechanisms in a cell-class-dependent manner (e.g., Tlx3 vs. Sim1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite differences in intracellular EGTA buffering between our study and others, the STP we observed in mouse recurrent synapses is mostly consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">West et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lefort and Petersen, 2017</xref>) with the primary exception being the lack of facilitation in paired pulses in layer 5 neurons. Interestingly, when facilitation was unmasked by lowering the intracellular EGTA concentration it was not in the mouse line with thick-tufted pyramidal neurons (Sim1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouwens and Berg, 2018</xref>) as we expected from work in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lefort and Petersen, 2017</xref>), suggesting that the recurrent connectivity STP may differ across brain regions for the same projection class.</p><p>Ultimately, we seek a description of the cortical circuit from which mechanistic computational models can be built and hypotheses about cortical function can be tested. Although many parts of the circuit have been described in the past, incompatibilities between experiments have made it difficult to assemble a complete, coherent picture of the whole. We have taken steps toward ensuring that our results can be interpreted in the context of future experiments, but more work is needed to generate a consistent description of the cortical circuit. To that end, we have begun a large-scale project to replicate these measurements across a wider variety of cell types in the mouse and human cortex; the results of our early-stage data collection presented here suggest that systematic and standardized characterization will provide a detailed, quantitative, and comprehensive description of the circuit wiring diagrams and will facilitate the investigation of circuit computation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>Adult mice of either sex (mean age P46.7 ± 6.4; SD) were housed and sacrificed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Allen Institute (Seattle, WA), in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Tissue distortion and damage was minimized by moving through the tissue on a trajectory that was collinear with long axis of the pipette with minimal positive pressure. In transgenic mice, cells were also targeted based on fluorescent reporter expression. All cells were confirmed as excitatory post-experiment either by their EPSPs onto other recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or by their pyramidal morphology, visualized using either biocytin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or fluorescent dye from the pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cell intrinsic fluorescence was confirmed post-hoc via manual inspection of image stacks to evaluate signal overlap of the transgenic fluorescent reporter and the fluorescent dye introduced via pipettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed at −70 mV to preferentially measure excitatory inputs. Resting membrane potential was maintained within 2 mV of −70 mV using automated bias current injection during the inter-trial interval. Custom software, Multi-channel Igor Electrophysiology Suite (MIES; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MIES">https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MIES</ext-link>), written in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), was used for data acquisition and pipette pressure regulation. A brief, 10 ms test pulse was used to monitor access (24.18 ± 9.24 MΩ) and input (166.59 ± 84.0 MΩ) resistance over the duration of the recording. During recordings, cells were stimulated using brief current injections (1.5 or 3 ms) to drive trains of 12 action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) at frequencies of 10, 20, 50, or 100 Hz to induce short-term plasticity (STP). Stimulus amplitudes (mean ± SD, 1.2 ± 0.5 nA) were adjusted to ensure spiking on every pulse across a range of cell types and frequencies. A delay period inserted between the 8th and 9th pulses allowed testing of recovery from STP. In most recordings this delay period was 250 ms; for 50 Hz stimulation, longer delay periods (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 ms) were used as well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

A classifier (described below) was later used to highlight possible identification errors, which were then manually corrected. Connection probabilities within 100 µm intersomatic distance were compared between cell types using Fisher’s exact test of 2 × 2 contingency tables (connected, unconnected).

Additionally, individual response recordings were analyzed by measuring the amplitude and time of the peak of each exponentially deconvolved response over a 3 ms window beginning 1 ms after the presynaptic spike, compared to a 10 ms window preceding the stimulus pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom). Although these individual measurements were often noisy (average background RMS noise 607 ± 419 µV), their distribution over hundreds of trials could be compared to similar distributions measured from background noise (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Distributions were compared using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (from the ‘scipy.stats’ Python package) and the p values were used as input features for the classifier.</p><p>After training on 1854 manually labeled examples, the classifier was tested against a withheld set of 2642 examples and achieved an overall accuracy of 95% (56/61 true positive, connected; 2457/2581 true negative, not connected). False positives and negatives were manually reassessed and the annotations corrected when appropriate. Whereas false negatives were usually the result of a classifier failure, false positives were frequently found to have been misclassified during the initial manual annotation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of synapse detection sensitivity</title><p>To measure the minimum detectable PSP size for each connection probed, artificial PSPs were added to recordings of background noise taken from the postsynaptic cell. PSPs were generated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> with a foot-to-peak rise time of 2 ms (except where specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). PSP latencies were selected from a gaussian distribution centered at 2 ms with a 200 µs standard deviation. PSP amplitudes were generated by the product of two random variables: one binomially distributed (p=0.2, n = 24) to mimic stochastic vesicle release, and the other normally distributed (mean = 1, SD = 0.3) to account for differences in vesicle size and receptor efficacy. PSPs were then scaled uniformly to achieve a specific mean amplitude. The resulting simulated responses were qualitatively similar to typical synaptic responses encountered in our dataset, although they lacked the synapse-to-synapse variability in CV, due to the selection of fixed distribution parameters listed above.</p><p>For each connection probed, the number of simulated PSPs generated was the same as the number of presynaptic spikes elicited during the experiment. These PSPs were then fed through the same preprocessing and classification system that was used to detect synaptic connections in real data, and the classification probability was calculated from the classifier (using sklearn.svm.SVC.predict_proba). This process was repeated eight times (with PSPs generated randomly each time) and the average classification probability was recorded. This yields an estimate of whether a synaptic connection would be detected or overlooked, given the combination of sample count, background noise characteristics, and PSP strength and kinetics.</p><p>By repeating this process for several different values of mean PSP amplitude, we could identify, for each putative connection probed, a plausible minimum detectable PSP amplitude. This minimum detectable amplitude was defined as the PSP amplitude at which the classifier would detect the synapse in 50% of trials (interpolated from adjacent amplitudes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EPSP amplitude run-down over duration of experiment</title><p>The amplitude of the EPSPs initiated by the first pulse of the stimulus trains through-out the duration of the experiment were characterized by fitting the exponential fit (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) to individual EPSPs. Individual EPSPs are often noisy, thus, only connections where individual EPSPs looked well fit were used to assess rundown. In order to further discount variations in the measurements of individual responses, the run-down was characterized via a linear regression of EPSP amplitude versus time for sweeps with a holding potential between −75 and −65 mV. We observed run-down in all synapse types in percent per minute as follows: layer 2/3 to layer 2/3: median 1.9, average 3.7, std 3.8, Rorb to Rorb: median 4.0, average 3.9, std 0.81, Sim1 to Sim1: median 1.4, average 0.61, std 3.2, Tlx3 to Tlx: median 1.5, average 1.9, std 5.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Theoretical synaptic modeling</title><p>Among the wealth of mechanisms described to contribute to short-term plasticity, we chose to focus on depression and use-dependent replenishment, as these models provide the best fits when corrected for the number of parameters used.

A 63x, 1.0 NA water immersion objective (Zeiss) was used for all experiments. Two-photon images were acquired with PrairieView software (Bruker Corp), and stimulation targets were manually placed on these reference images to target ReaChR-positive cells. Photoactivation stimuli were triggered by a TTL pulse generated within MIES acquisition software. The voltage output controlling the photoactivation Pockels cell was recorded within MIES for post-hoc alignment of physiological recordings with the timing of photoactivation. To characterize the effectiveness and specificity of stimulation parameters, we made loose seal recordings on to EYFP/ReaChR-labelled neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). For all data presented here, the photostimulation pattern consisted of a spiral 5 μm in diameter with five revolutions traced over a 25 ms duration. We first determined the minimum light power necessary to evoke reliable firing of action potentials. This minimum power varied across cells from 2.6 to 20.3 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A photostimulus of 18 mW intensity was sufficient to evoke spiking in 92% of cells tested (12/13 cells). The average latency of firing at this power was 12.9 ± 6.1 ms and the associated jitter was 0.98 ± 0.58 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>Within the same experiments, we characterized the spatial specificity of these stimulation parameters. First, to determine the probability of off-target photoactivation of cells within the same focal plane, we delivered stimuli in a radial grid pattern containing seven spokes with stimuli spaced 10, 20 and 30 µm away from the center of the recorded cell ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Spike probability fell to 0.5 at a lateral distance of 12.0 µm. Finally, we determined the axial resolution of our photoactivation paradigm by offsetting the focus of the objective relative to the recorded cell. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>), axial resolution was inferior compared to lateral resolution (spike probability = 0.5 at 26.7 µm) but was still near cellular resolution ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>For two-photon mapping experiments, 1–2 neurons were patched and membrane potential was maintained near −70 mV with auto bias current injection. Neurons were filled with 50 µM Alexa-594 to visualize cell morphology ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The orientation of the apical dendrite was utilized to align photostimulation sites across experiments in downstream analyses. Each putative presynaptic neuron was stimulated 10–20 times, with the parameters described above. Photostimulation was performed in 'rounds' during which EYFP-labelled neurons within a single field of view were sequentially targeted (3–12 neurons/round). Stimulation protocols were constrained such that the inter-stimulus interval between neurons was ≥ 2 s and the inter-stimulus interval for a given neuron was ≥ 10 s.</p><p>Importantly, the photostimulus utilized in our mapping experiments generated spiking in most - but not all – Tlx3 neurons tested (92% spike probability; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To estimate a false negative rate associated with incomplete photosensitivity, we utilized the multipatch dataset to establish a prior probability of Tlx3 recurrent connectivity (4.74%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Assuming connection probability to be independent of photosensitivity, we estimate the false negative rate as</p><p>(1-photosensitivity)*prior probability of connectivity = (1–0.92)*0.0474 = 0.0038 or 0.38%.</p><p>Notably, this low false negative rate is partly due to the observed sparsity of recurrent connectivity between Tlx3-positive neurons. Higher error rates are to be expected when using two-photon optogenetics to probe high-probability synaptic connections.</p><p>Photostimulus responses were scored as connection, no connection or as containing a direct stimulation artifact by manual annotation. To assist in these user-generated calls, we incorporated a signal-to-noise measure for our optogenetic mapping data. Current clamp traces were low pass filtered at 1 kHz and baseline subtracted. The voltage-deconvolution technique (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) was then applied. The value of τ was set between 10 and 40 ms. Deconvolved traces were high-pass filtered at 30 Hz, and peaks larger than three standard deviations above pre-stimulus baseline were used for further analysis ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We then measured the number of peaks in both ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ regions. The ‘signal’ region was a 100 ms window 5–105 ms after the onset of the photostimulus, and the ‘noise’ region was a 100 ms window 145–45 ms before the stimulus onset. To compensate for jitter known to be present in two-photon mediated stimulation, we determined a 10 ms subset within each 100 ms window that gave the maximum number of unique trials containing threshold-crossing events. The median of the peak within this 10 ms window was found across all trials in both ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ regions, and the mean of a 25 ms window preceding both regions was subtracted to produce our final signal and noise values.</p><p>We plotted the signal against the noise for all stimulus locations ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and found that most points with a high signal-to-noise ratio contained either a synaptic response or an artifact produced by direct stimulation of the recorded (opsin-expressing) cell. 88% (15/17) manually identified connections had a signal to noise ratio &gt; 1.5 ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). By contrast, the same was true of only 1.8% (31/1720) of cells scored as ‘no connection’. Therefore, our signal-to-noise analyses highlight quantitatively distinct features of our connection calls. The presence of direct stimulation artifacts prevents us from unambiguously identifying synaptic connections between nearby neurons. Therefore, when estimating connection probability by two-photon optogenetics, we did not include putative presynaptic cells within 50 µm of the recorded neuron where the direct stimulation artifact was largest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). It is also important to consider differences in detection limits between multipatch and two-photon optogenetics. The amplitudes of EPSPs from optogenetically identified connections ranged from 0.10 to 0.78 mV (mean amplitude 0.30 ± 0.21; SD). Multipatch recordings allowed spike-aligned averaging over many trials and resulted in detection of synaptic responses &lt; 0.10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Therefore, while two-photon optogenetics provides dense sampling over large inter-somatic distances, estimates of connectivity are likely biased toward large and reliable synaptic connections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Allen Institute founder, Paul G Allen, for his vision, encouragement and support.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sparse recurrent excitatory connectivity in the microcircuit of the adult mouse and human cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We understand that this manuscript represents a good deal of work, but also feel that requires significant editorial attention to make it self-consistent and transparent.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Seeman et al., have explored visual cortex excitatory connectivity across multiple layers and cell types using acute slices, patch-clamp recordings, 2-photon optogenetic activation, and computer simulations. The authors explore both mouse and human connectivity, although only specifically visual cortex in the rodent, not human. Human tissue was resected from different brain regions of patients with epilepsy or tumours. The authors find that connectivity is higher and short-term depression lower in supragranular layers. The authors also find that connective strength in human tissue is stronger, as previously shown.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the figures are largely quite clear. The novelty of these results lies in the combination of studying several cortical layers simultaneously in mouse as well as human tissue. The authors should address all the major concerns raised by the reviewers by either extending and strengthening the weaker sections or by removing the weakest data, and then fairly and completely discussing the methodology for what remains. We remind you that <italic>eLife</italic> also publishes Research Advances that would, in principle, allow you to follow this study with one that strengthens the weaker aspects of what is now here, should you wish to remove them, as might be advisable.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Developing a standardized pipeline for analyzing the synaptic connectivity of the cortex and other brain regions would represent an advance in the field. However, in many places, the authors do not justify their choices for their experimental procedures. How slices are cut may affect connectivity rates. For example, studies in slices from older mice have used an NMDG-based solution, different from the one used in the current study (Jiang et al., 2015) as well as common alternatives including kynurenic acid- and sucrose-based solutions (see, for example, Galaretta and Hestrin, 2002 (2-7 months old); Crandall et al., 2017). When developing this standardized pipeline, what was the justification for adopting the experimental procedures for preparing the mouse and human slices? Were comparisons made among different approaches including comparisons of slice thickness, slice orientation, depth of recording, and so on that may affect connectivity rates? These variables should be assessed before settling on a standardized pipeline. Furthermore, the authors do not include enough experimental detail to enable the reader to evaluate the standardized pipeline and compare it to prior studies (see below).</p><p>2) This finding in L6 PCs that connectivity is low is not so strange given the prior literature, e.g. Velez-Fort et al., 2014. The authors genetically target the less connected form of L6 PC and then report that they cannot find many connections, but this is expected when targeting CT L6 neurons. The most rigorous way to address this would probably be to additionally target and record from L6 PCs other than the ones that express Ntsr1. Alternatively, it would be possible to take out all data on L6, because it is presently quite limited anyway.</p><p>3) Technically our major concern lies with the composition of the whole-cell recording solution used. The authors use an internal containing 0.3 mM EGTA. Previous work on unitary excitatory output of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons has demonstrated that this concentration has a major influence on uEPSP amplitude and dynamics in a target specific manner (Rozov et al., 2001) – decreasing use-dependent facilitation. It is possible that the use of EGTA in the internal solution has flattened the disparity between the use-dependent dynamics of in each layer, and also may have implications for comparison across species. This is a major problem that requires addressing.</p><p>4) It has been shown that connectivity depends on the pre- and post-synaptic cell type (see, for example, Brown and Hestrin. 2009). However, here the authors are likely mixing synapse types in their analyses. Cre is expressed in more than one cell type in the Ntsr1-Cre line (Chevée et al., 2018, Tasic et al., 2016) and the Tlx3-Cre line (Tasic et a.l, 2017). Layer 2/3 includes more than one cell type (see, for example, Yamashita et al., 2013; Yamashita et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016; Tasic et al., 2017). Thus, the connectivity rates and the average synaptic properties shown here may not represent connectivity rates among specific cell types but rather represent mixtures of synapse types within a layer.</p><p>5) The machine learning approach is basically a form of advanced template matching that looks for an event with the right properties. But at no stage can we see that the machine-learning algorithm knows exactly where the presynaptic spike is. Detection should explicitly model the fact that the time of the action potential is known, since it would strengthen its performance, in turn affecting estimates.</p><p>6) Figure 4EF data set is small, and the resulting connectivity rate in panel F is low compared to the prior literature (e.g. Perin, Berger and Markram, 2011). Either this n should be increased, or maybe simply remove panels E-F?</p><p>7) What about bidirectional connections? Both Song, 2005 and Lefort, 2009 make a big deal of those, it would seem strange not to mention them.</p><p>8) E.g. albino animals are known to have different connectivity patterns, so if some of these transgenic lines (Materials and methods section, etc.) were created on an albino background, then please discuss. Differences attributed to layers could in reality be due to the transgenic mouse line used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37349.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Seeman et al. have explored visual cortex excitatory connectivity across multiple layers and cell types using acute slices, patch-clamp recordings, 2-photon optogenetic activation, and computer simulations.

Please let us know if there are additional areas where the manuscript would benefit from further detail. Also, please consider that the data reported here are not production pipeline data. A purpose of the integration test is to assess methods and the methodological analysis is ongoing. We will share the results of the methodological analysis in a white paper (our standard practice) as well as in a pipeline platform paper in the future. A motivating factor for publishing integration test data was to expose our project to early peer review and open it to the scientific community for feedback. We are delighted with the detailed and helpful reviewer comments. Thank you.</p><p>In regards to specific areas of concern mentioned in the comment:</p><p>Our slicing conditions were the same conditions as our Cell-Types pipeline (Gouwens et al., 2018). The methods were based on Hajos and Mody, (2009) and Ting et al., (2014).</p><p>We’ve added an analysis of the effect of slice location and recording depth to the manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This finding in L6 PCs that connectivity is low is not so strange given the prior literature, e.g. Velez-Fort et al., 2014.

Alternatively, it would be possible to take out all data on L6, because it is presently quite limited anyway.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we've added references to West et al., 2006 and Velez-Fort et al., 2014 and drawn attention to the fact that recurrent connectivity is more common for L6 CC neurons than L6 CT (Ntsr1) neurons.</p><p>We continue to favor including the Ntsr1 data for several reasons: (1) It is the first time connectivity versus distance has been quantified for this cell class (2) The use of high SNR whole-cell recordings rather than sharp electrodes. (3) Our work is the first functional characterization of recurrent connectivity for this mouse line in the adult mouse primary visual cortex. (4) Although the low number of NTSR1 synapses we have recorded from prevents an analysis of synaptic properties, the large number of connections probed yields high confidence in our measurement of connectivity. Accurate estimates of connectivity as a function of distance are a critical component of network models.</p><p>We've begun to take the more rigorous approach suggested, but we ran out of time; non-fluorescent cells require morphological calls, which have lower throughput and adds weeks onto the processing pipeline. We plan to include this data in an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Technically our major concern lies with the composition of the whole-cell recording solution used.

This is a major problem that requires addressing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the internal solution buffer concentration selected for the integration test will impact the short-term dynamics. We’ve now emphasized this point in serval places in the manuscript.</p><p>We also conducted additional experiments characterizing STP without EGTA in the intracellular solution in layer 5 mouse lines. We selected the layer 5 mouse lines because the STP in 0.3 mM EGTA differed from previous work in layer 5 (Reyes and Sakmann, 1999, Lefort and Petersen, 2017). We’ve included this data in a new supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and added associated discussion.</p><p>To facilitate comparisons across pipeline datasets and for logistical considerations we sought to minimize the differences with existing cell-types pipelines (http://celltypes.brain-map.org/). Since the cell-types pipeline (http://celltypes.brain-map.org/data) had already begun production with 0.3 mM EGTA, we selected the same concentration for the integration test. Nevertheless, because we share the reviewer's concerns, we will characterize the STP without EGTA in the internal solution during production pipeline experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It has been shown that connectivity depends on the pre- and post-synaptic cell type (see, for example, Brown and Hestrin. 2009). However, here the authors are likely mixing synapse types in their analyses. Cre is expressed in more than one cell type in the Ntsr1-Cre line (Chevée et al., 2018, Tasic et al., 2016) and the Tlx3-Cre line (Tasic et a.l, 2017). Layer 2/3 includes more than one cell type (see, for example, Yamashita et al., 2013; Yamashita et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016; Tasic et al., 2017). Thus, the connectivity rates and the average synaptic properties shown here may not represent connectivity rates among specific cell types but rather represent mixtures of synapse types within a layer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the Introduction to emphasize that we are assessing connectivity among cell classes (groups of related cell types). We also corrected an accidental use of the term `cell-type` when we should have written `cell class` (Discussion section). Our experiments have a similar resolution to previous reports (e.g., Brown and Hestrin’s labeled classes equate roughly to our layer 5 Cre populations in terms of class size). We’ve added a section to the discussion addressing the implications of assessing connectivity at the level of cell class.</p><p>The work we present here is part of larger framework: A goal of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to use physiological and anatomical data modalities, including connectivity and connection dynamics, to evaluate their association with transcriptomically defined cell types. Where we observe diversity in the synaptic dynamics within a class, we will then follow up with experiments that allow us to identify if the different dynamics are associated with different transcriptomically defined cell types. We adopted our current strategy to reduce the number of synapse types we must explore with (transcriptomic) cell type resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The machine learning approach is basically a form of advanced template matching that looks for an event with the right properties. But at no stage can we see that the machine-learning algorithm knows exactly where the presynaptic spike is. Detection should explicitly model the fact that the time of the action potential is known, since it would strengthen its performance, in turn affecting estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the Materials and methods section to indicate that 3 ms window over which responses are analyzed is placed 1 ms after the rising phase of the presynaptic action potential (see also Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Peak amplitudes and latencies measured from this window provide reasonably effective features for classification, especially when compared to the same values measured from background noise. However, we find that typical latency jitter is on the order of 100 μs, so we agree that there is potential here to improve classification accuracy by further constraining the response window. At the same time, this introduces the possibility of entirely missing connections if the initial latency estimate is inaccurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4EF data set is small, and the resulting connectivity rate in panel F is low compared to the prior literature (e.g. Perin, Berger and Markram, 2011). Either this n should be increased, or maybe simply remove panels E-F?</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the sample size of the 2-photon experiments used to probe recurrent connectivity among Tlx3 neurons at distances greater than can be feasibly examined with multipatch. The enhanced sample size improves the confidence in the connectivity estimate.</p><p>To our knowledge, previous applications of 2P optogenetics for circuit mapping were proof of principle in nature. We believe this is one of the first biological results. Furthermore, this is the first corroboration of the 2P optogenetic circuit mapping with multipatch data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What about bidirectional connections? Both Song, 2005 and Lefort, 2009 make a big deal of those, it would seem strange not to mention them.</p></disp-quote><p>A major limitation of measuring reciprocal connectivity on heterogeneous populations of cells is that it can yield results that appear to differ from random chance even if they do not (Hoffmann and Triesch, 2017). Furthermore, very high sampling is required to confidently measure differences in the reciprocal connectivity of sparsely connected cells.</p><p>We’ve added our reasoning for not including reciprocal analysis to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) E.g. albino animals are known to have different connectivity patterns, so if some of these transgenic lines (Materials and methods section, etc.) were created on an albino background, then please discuss.

By making all our mice congenic, we can be sure that any phenotype that does arise is a result of the various drivers/reporters of the mouse, rather than its genetic background. We’ve updated the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
