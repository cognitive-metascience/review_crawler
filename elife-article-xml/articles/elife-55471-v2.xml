Here, combining chemical and genetic gain- and loss-of-function assays, we show that in rat hippocampal neurons the MPS is an actomyosin network that controls axonal expansion and contraction. Using super-resolution microscopy, we analyzed the localization of axonal non-muscle myosin II (NMII). We show that active NMII light chains are colocalized with actin rings and organized in a circular periodic manner throughout the axon shaft. In contrast, NMII heavy chains are mostly positioned along the longitudinal axonal axis, being able to crosslink adjacent rings. NMII filaments can play contractile or scaffolding roles determined by their position relative to actin rings and activation state. We also show that MPS destabilization through NMII inactivation affects axonal electrophysiology, increasing action potential conduction velocity. In summary, our findings open new perspectives on axon diameter regulation, with important implications in neuronal biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin ring</kwd><kwd>axonal cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>axonal diameter</kwd><kwd>axonal electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>non-muscle myosin-ii</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-028623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>Monica M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/MED-NEU/28623/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>Monica M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>António J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006129</institution-id><institution>FCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/114912/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>Ana Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006129</institution-id><institution>FCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/136760/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>Sara C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006129</institution-id><institution>FCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/135491/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mateus</surname><given-names>José C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013060</institution-id><institution>EMBL Heidelberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Christian Boulin Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>Sara C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The axonal cytoskeletal contains an actomyosin-II network that controls circumferential axonal contraction and expansion with the potential of regulating fluctuations in diameter during action potential firing, trafficking, and degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When considering an adult axon, its diameter can oscillate depending on organelle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenberg et al., 1990</xref>), neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields, 2011</xref>), deformations generated by movement or degeneration. The mechanisms controlling axonal diameter throughout the neuronal lifetime remain however unclear. The mature axon shaft is supported by a submembraneous actin-spectrin network- the membrane periodic skeleton (MPS)- composed of actin rings regularly spaced by spectrin tetramers approximately every 190 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Although its assembly and function are largely unknown, the MPS may provide mechanical support for the long thin structure of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>). In the initial MPS model, each ring was hypothesized to be composed of actin filaments capped by the actin-binding protein adducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, combining platinum-replica electron and optical super-resolution microscopy, the MPS actin rings were shown to be made of two long, intertwined actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vassilopoulos et al., 2019</xref>). According to this novel view, adducin might be responsible to enhance the lateral binding of spectrin to actin. We have previously demonstrated that adducin is required to maintain axon caliber as its absence in vitro leads to actin rings of increased diameter, while in vivo it results in progressive axon enlargement and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leite et al., 2016</xref>). We have additionally found that in vitro, the radius of axonal actin ring narrows over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leite et al., 2016</xref>), supporting that the MPS has dynamic properties. Since reduction in axon diameter with time occurs both in WT and α-adducin knock-out (KO) neurons, MPS dynamics is probably regulated by additional actin-binding proteins.</p><p>The role of actin in the control of axonal radial tension is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). NMII is a hexamer composed by two heavy chains, two regulatory light chains (RLC) and two essential light chains (ELC), being a conserved molecule for generating mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The NMII contractile ATPase activity and the assembly of myosin filaments that coordinate force generation is activated by phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that the axonal MPS, similarly to actin rings present in other biological contexts, is an actomyosin-II network that regulates circumferential axonal contractility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MPS affects signal propagation velocity, a property with important functional implications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modulation of NMII activity regulates the expansion and contraction of axonal diameter</title><p>The MPS of both WT and α-adducin KO neurons contracts in vitro at a rate of 6–12 nm/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leite et al., 2016</xref>). Given the general role of NMII in promoting contractility, we tested whether axon thinning in vitro was dependent on NMII activity. For that, NMII-mediated ATP hydrolysis and thereby actomyosin-based motility, were inhibited by blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Straight et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of the drug, axon thinning of hippocampal neurons from DIV8 to DIV22 was abolished as determined using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This supports that axon thinning in vitro occurs through a NMII-mediated mechanism. Additionally, DIV8 hippocampal neurons treated with blebbistatin had a 1.3-fold increase in axon diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Alternative modes of drug-mediated modulation of myosin activity were tested, including ML-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saitoh et al., 1987</xref>), calyculin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>), and myovin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Islam et al., 2010</xref>). The function of NMII is controlled by MLC kinase (MLCK) that phosphorylates the NMII RLCs leading to conformational changes and self-assembly in myosin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ML-7, a selective MLCK inhibitor that decreases pMLC levels in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), led to an increase in axonal diameter similar to that produced by blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). As protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is the major myosin phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of NMII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsumura and Hartshorne, 2008</xref>), calyculin A, a potent PP1 inhibitor that results in increased phosphorylation of NMII RLCs and increased myosin contractility, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of calyculin A, sustained activation of NMII resulted in a decrease to 0.8-fold in axonal diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), supporting that NMII activity can positively and negatively regulate axonal caliber. Of note, the effect of calyculin A was reverted by blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Myovin-1, a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity of myosin V that inhibits myosin V-dependent intersynaptic vesicle exchange in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>), had no effect on the MPS diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) suggesting a NMII-specific effect. In further support of the MPS dynamic nature, the effect of blebbistatin was reverted as drug treatment was released from DIV8 to DIV12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). In summary, we show that axon diameter can be controlled both at the level of NMII activation through phosphorylation, and at the level of its power-stroke activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modulation of NMII activity regulates axon diameter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of NMII structure and activity regulation. NMII contains two heavy chains (HC), two RLCs and two ELCs. The head domain includes an actin-binding site and an ATPase motor domain. ELCs and RLCs are bound to NMII head domains. In the absence of RLC phosphorylation, NMII is in a non-competent conformation. Upon RLC phosphorylation by MLCK, NMII unfolds to generate a competent form. NMII is then able to assemble into bipolar filaments, which bind to actin. MLC phosphatase that includes a regulatory subunit -MYPT1- can revert this activation. NMII activity can be modulated by drugs including ML-7, a specific MLCK inhibitor; calyculin A (CalA) an inhibitor of RLC phosphatase, and blebbistatin (Bleb) that inhibits NMII-mediated ATP hydrolysis.

Whereas inhibiting NMII activity or knocking down adducin led to a 1.3-fold increase in axonal caliber, being the latter case in agreement with our previous studies in adducin KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leite et al., 2016</xref>), the combination of both treatments did not result in a cumulative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, different genes encode three different NMII heavy chain isoforms, NMHCIIA, NMHCIIB and NMHCIIC that determine the NMII isoform (NMIIA, NMIIB and NMIIC, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Different NMII isoforms have unique kinetic properties and specific cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). To understand the role of different NMII isoforms in the MPS, we induced their down-regulation using specific shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-L</xref>). Downregulation of either NMIIA or NMIIB induced a 1.3-fold increase in axon caliber, similar to that induced by either blebbistatin or ML-7 treatment, whereas downregulation of NMIIC was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous studies highlighting the distinctive mechanochemical profile of NMIIC and lower ability in generating contractile force when compared with NMIIA and NMIIB isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billington et al., 2013</xref>). As such, knockdown of either NMIIA or NMIIB was sufficient to induce a comparable outcome as drug-mediated inhibition of all NMII isoforms, whereas NMIIC probably does not participate in NMII-mediated regulation of axon diameter. shRNA-mediated knockdown of NMII RLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) had a similar effect to the knockdown of myosin heavy chains, leading to MPS expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) is the regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase and is responsible for the dephosphorylation of MLC. The inactivation of its enzymatic activity increases NMII phosphorylation and consequently its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Knocking down MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, K, L</xref>) caused a decrease to 0.8-fold in axon diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Of note, rescue experiments performed using co-transfection with shRNA-resistant constructs reverted the phenotype of the corresponding shRNA, confirming their specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Our data support that both NMIIA and NMIIB, contribute to the MPS actomyosin network.</p><p>The possible tilting of actin rings in relation to the axonal axis was measured in all the conditions where drug- or shRNA-mediated modulation of NMII activity was performed. No variations in the angle of actin rings in relation to the axonal axis were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L,M</xref>) suggesting that NMII probably does not contract between adjacent rings. Of note, tilting may be hindered by the existence of the βII-spectrin scaffold. Also, having several active NMII filaments attached to adjacent axon rings, may generate a net force that would be averaged out and thus close to zero. Importantly, neither drug- nor shRNA-mediated modulation of NMII activity, resulted in alterations of MPS periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,O</xref>, respectively), thus arguing that a possible participation of NMII in axonal longitudinal tension does not interfere with the 190 nm length of extended spectrin tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Propagation velocity is altered by manipulation of NMII activity</title><p>Neuronal electrophysiology is intimately related to morphology. Besides the relation between conduction velocity and axonal caliber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgkin, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Waxman, 1980</xref>), sodium channels are distributed in axons in a periodic pattern coordinated with the MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). To uncover possible electrophysiological implications of manipulating NMII activity, we used a combination of in vitro microelectrode arrays (MEA) and microfluidics (μEF platforms) to characterize axonal propagation velocity between DIV11 and DIV14. This μEF platform was previously shown by us to allow axon alignment on top of a sequence of microelectrodes, providing detailed electrophysiological information about signal conduction on isolated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) while also recording global activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heiney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lopes et al., 2018</xref>). Blebbistatin-treated and untreated neurons were electrophysiologically competent regarding signal conduction and no significant differences in global electrical activity were found, as determined by assessing their mean firing rate (MFR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). However, axonal conduction velocity between treated and untreated axons was different, with distinct velocity distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). From DIV11 on, blebbistatin-treated neurons consistently showed higher propagation velocities when compared to vehicle-treated cells. In unmyelinated axons, velocity conduction is proportional to the square root of the axonal diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgkin, 1954</xref>) and blebbistatin treatment produces a 1.3-fold increase in axon diameter that is not altered throughout time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our data favors that NMII modulation affects axonal electrophysiology through changes in axonal diameter. This effect should be further explored by using additional modulators of NMII activity and shRNA-mediated downregulation approaches.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Blebbistatin treatment increases axonal signal propagation velocity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single propagating event recorded along four electrodes inside a microchannel.

Despite the enrichment of pMLC at the AIS, not only non-phosphorylated MLC, but also active pMLC could be observed throughout the entire axon shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By applying SMLM to the AIS of DIV8 hippocampal neurons and focusing on their lateral outermost points up to the axonal surface, pMLC displayed a bilateral ~200 nm periodicity and a circular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Periodic (~190 nm) pMLC staining, coincident with phalloidin staining restricted to the AIS, has been previously shown using STORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a direct binding of pMLC to actin. Here, we show that pMLC periodicity is not restricted to the AIS, extending to the axon shaft, being visible in the lateral outer part of the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>- highlighted by white ruler; and <bold><italic>3E</italic></bold>). Interestingly, in some axonal regions, pMLC showed a periodic distribution, consistent with anchoring in different positions of adjacent actin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>- highlighted by red ruler; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The absence of a generalized striped pattern for pMLC (in contrast to what is observed for axonal actin and βII-spectrin staining), supports that in each actin ring a limited number of pMLC molecules is anchored. Alternatively, technical limitations of the antibodies used may preclude the visualization of the entire pool of pMLC molecules present in the structure. However, in some regions of the axon shaft of hippocampal neurons, pMLC not only displays the expected striped pattern but also is colocalized with actin, supporting that throughout the axon, pMLC is bound to actin rings that compose the MPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

The analysis of the NMIIA labeling envelope, that is, the smooth curve outlining the extremes of NMIIA labeling, showed variable orientations with respect to the axonal longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). This supports that NMIIA filaments are not strictly aligned with the axonal axis. 3D reconstructions were performed to quantify spatial properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–N</xref>). SMLM showed sites of colocalization of NMIIA heavy chain and βII-spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>), which suggests the existence of NMII filaments crosslinking adjacent rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>, model a).

This led to the hypothesis that these filaments might correspond to myosins associated with the MPS, cross-linking neighboring rings, which goes along our observations.

NMII filaments within individual actin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>, model b), represent the conformation capable of generating the highest contractile force leading to actin filament sliding along the ring. Assuming that the MPS actin rings are composed of two parallel, intertwined actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vassilopoulos et al., 2019</xref>), NMII activity could provide for contraction by putting the two actin filaments in registry with each other.

Additionally, scaffolding and contractile roles may switch via change in activity of the NMII motors. Pharmacological NMII inhibition may lead to ring expansion given loss of both scaffolding and contractile roles; as a consequence, the inner axonal tension will lead to increased axon diameter. When axonal diameter is restored, contractile NMII filaments may perform ring contraction, favored by transient absence of scaffolding filaments. Eventually, scaffolding NMII may be restored and contraction may slow down to its original low rate. In physiological responses (such as axon diameter increase upon cargo trafficking) at an initial stage, scaffolding NMII may be reduced to a minimum, while contractile filaments cannot prevent ring expansion. At a second stage (when cargo moves), contractile NMII may lead to a fast return to the original diameter. Eventually, scaffolding filaments may be restored and the contraction rate will return to a very low value. One should however bear in mind that despite the fact that NMII activity modulates MPS diameter, and that pMLC colocalizes with MPS actin both in the AIS and in the axon shaft, the interplay between NMII and deep axonal actin filaments may also occur. In this scenario, the possibility that these alternative axonal actin arrangements may also serve as myosin anchors cannot be ruled out and should be certainly explored in the future. In summary, our data supports that NMII regulates circumferential axonal contraction and expansion. These findings have important implications on our understanding of neuronal biology, including fluctuations in axonal diameter observed during trafficking, action potential firing and axon degeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Briefly, the hippocampus of each individual E18 embryo was digested 15 min in 0.06% trypsin from porcine pancreas solution (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# T4799) and triturated. Either 12,500 cells/coverslip (for STED imaging) or 50,000 cells/coverslip (for SMLM imaging) were plated onto 50 µg/mL poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# P2636-100MG) pre-coated 1.5H glass 13 mm rounded coverslips (Marienfeld, for STED imaging) or 22 × 22 mm coverslips (Corning, for SMLM imaging) in 24- or 6-well plates (Nunc). Neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 21103–049) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 0080085SA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 15140–122) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 25030024).

In the following day, media was supplemented with 10 µM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# R2625) and renewed every other day for 5 days. At day 6, the media was changed for DMEM:F12 with 2% B-27, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and brain derived neurotrophic (BDNF, Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B3795, 50 ng/ml); at day 9 differentiated cells were used for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Modulation of MNII activity using pharmacological agents</title><p>To modulate myosin activity, blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich, <bold>cat#</bold> B0560, 3 µM), ML-7 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# I2764, 4 µM), or myovin1 (Calbiochem, cat# 475984, 4 µM), were added to hippocampal neurons at DIV3 and at DIV8 1 hr prior to fixation. Calyculin A (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# C5552, 5 nM) was added to hippocampal neurons at DIV8, 25 min prior to fixation. For all drugs, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, VWR International, cat# A3672.0050) was used as a vehicle. In control conditions, vehicle alone was used at the same concentration as in the respective experimental condition. For the analysis of the effect of blebbistatin in in vitro thinning, the drug or its vehicle were additionally added at DIV16 and at DIV22 1 hr prior to fixation. To evaluate the reversibility of the effect of blebbistatin, at DIV8 the drug was either replaced by vehicle, or fresh drug was added to the culture. To confirm the inhibitory effect of ML-7 on RLC phosphorylation, hippocampal neurons were incubated with either vehicle or ML-7 (4 µM) at DIV8 1 hr prior fixation and immunofluorescence against pMLC was conducted as detailed below. To evaluate reversibility of the effect of calyculin A on axonal diameter, hippocampal neurons were treated with blebbistatin (3 µM) and calyculin A (5 nM) at DIV8; 25 min later the cells were fixed. To evaluate a possible cumulative effect of adducin and NMII in axonal diameter, sh-mediated knockdown of α-adducin was performed at DIV3 (detailed below) and either blebbistatin or vehicle were added at DIV4 and DIV8 1 hr before fixation. shRNA-mediated downregulation shRNA constructs against NMIIA, NMIIB, NMIIC, RLC, MYPT1 and α-adducin were used. Sequences were the following: for NMIIA 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCGATACTACTCAGGGCTTAT</named-content>-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rai et al., 2017</xref>); for NMIIB 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCCAACATTGAAACATACCT</named-content>-3’ (VectorBuilder); for NMIIC 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCGGGCTCATTTATACCTACT</named-content>-3’ (VectorBuilder); for RLC 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCACGGAGCGAAAGACAAA</named-content>-3′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2008</xref>); for MYPT1 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAGCCTTGATCAGAGTTATAAC</named-content>-3′ (Vector Builder) and for α-adducin 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGAAGAAGAGGGTGTCTAT</named-content>-3’ (TRCN0000108809, Sigma). In each case, rescue experiments were performed using shRNA-resistant constructs containing 2–3 mismatches in relation to the respective shRNA. For NMIIA, NMIIB and MYPT1 these were designed and ordered from Vector Builder; for RLC, the shRNA-resistant construct was obtained from Addgene (#35680). In control conditions, the pLKO.1 empty vector (Addgene) or a shRNA scramble plasmid (VectorBuilder) were used. At DIV3 hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with specific shRNAs and pEGFP-C1 (0.5 µg:0.25 µg/wells) or in the case of rescue experiments, additionally with the respective shRNA-resistant construct (0.5 µg/well) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# L3000001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were fixed at DIV8. In all conditions, transfected (EGFP-positive) and non-transfected (EGFP-negative) cells in the same well were used for analysis. To validate shRNAs, CAD cells, PC-12 cells and hippocampal neurons were used. CAD and PC-12 cells were seeded at a density of 250000 cells/well while hippocampal neurons at a density of 12500 cells/well in 24-well plates and co-transfected with specific shRNAs and pEGFP-C1 (1.5 µg:0.5 µg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 116678030) for cell lines, and Lipofectamine 3000 for hippocampal neurons. To evaluate shRNA efficiency, either Western blot analysis of CAD or PC-12 cells (for adducin, NMIIA and NMIIB) or RT-PCR (for NMIIC and MYPT-1) were performed. Additionally, immunofluorescence of primary hippocampal neurons was conducted for NMIIA, NMIIB, NMIIC, RLC and MYPT1, as detailed below. For immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# T9284-100ML), protease inhibitors (cOmplete, Mini, Roche, Merck, cat# 04693124001) and 2 mM orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# S6508-10G) in PBS), run in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Amersham Protran Premium 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, VWR International, cat# GEHE10600003).

The secondary antibodies donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Immuno Research, cat# 711-035-152, 1:5000) and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (Jackson Immuno Research, cat# 715-035-151, 1:5000) were employed. Quantifications were performed using Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software version 4.6 (Bio-Rad). In the case of RT-PCR, RNA from CAD and PC12 cells was extracted using NZY Total RNA Isolation Kit (NZY Tech, cat# MB13402). RNA concentration and purity were determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometry, and integrity was assessed using BioRad's Experion RNA chip. cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11904018).

After three 5 min PBS washes, coverslips were mounted in 80% glycerol for STED microscopy; for SMLM imaging, coverslips were mounted in GLOX/MEA buffer (detailed below) in depression slides and sealed with twinsil (Picodent, cat# 13001000) and for immunofluorescence, the coverslips were mounted in fluoroshield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, cat# H-1200) and sealed with nail varnish. In the case of shRNA validations, images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio ImagerZ1 widefield microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with oil-immersion 63x/1.4 (Plan-Apochromat) and with Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and a TCS Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). To validate the effectiveness of shRNA-mediated downregulation of NMIIA, NMIIB, NMIIC, RLC and MYPT1, the cell body from transfected and non-transfected cells, was delineated with the segmented line tool from Fiji, and the mean fluorescence intensity was measured. To confirm that ML-7 inhibits the phosphorylation of NMII, the AIS was delineated with the segmented line from Fiji and the mean fluorescence intensity was compared in treated and non-treated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>STED imaging</title><p>STED imaging was performed on an inverted Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X (Leica Microsystems), using DIV8 hippocampal neurons, unless otherwise indicated. Hippocampal neurons were imaged, at a fixed distance of 80–100 µm from the cell body, with a HC PLAPO CS2 100x NA 1.4 STED WHITE oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems) using confocal and STED modes. The 2D vortex STED images with lateral resolution enhancement were recorded with 20 nm pixel size in xy and dwell times of typically 600 ns. First, the STED far-red channel (Abberior STAR 635P) was recorded with 633 nm excitation using the pulsed white light laser with 80 MHz repetition rate and STED depletion was performed with a synchronized pulsed 775 nm depletion laser. The detection bandpass was set to 650 to 750 nm and the pinhole was set to 0.93AU. The following acquisition settings were applied: 16 x line averaging and detector gating on a Hybrid Detector (HyD, Leica Microsystems) of 0.3 ns to 6 ns. The second STED channel (Abberior STAR580) was recorded in line sequential mode with 561 nm excitation and 775 nm depletion using a detection window from 580 to 620 nm. All other settings remained constant. We alternatively used an Abberior Instruments ‘Expert Line’ gated-STED coupled to a Nikon Ti microscope with an oil-immersion 60x 1.4 NA Plan-Apo objective (Nikon, Lambda Series) and a pinhole size set at 0.8 Airy units. The system features 40 MHz modulated excitation (405, 488, 560 and 640 nm) and depletion (775 nm) lasers. The microscope’s detectors are avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) which were used to gate the detection between ~700 ps and 8ns. To analyze ring periodicity, the maximum intensity of peaks was determined and the interpeak distance was measured. To determine axon diameter, the distance between the outer points (brighter, in the focus plane) that formed the MPS was determined. Only axons unequivocally focused in the maximum wide plan were considered. Under distinct control conditions axon diameter varied, which is probably inherent to the different cultures used throughout the study. Given the use of specific controls in each experimental setting, this variation did not interfere with the interpretation of results. The tilting of actin rings was determined by measuring the angle of each actin ring regarding the axonal axis using the angle tool from Fiji. The tilting angle α was measured relative to the longitudinal axon axis. Angles larger than 90° were mirrored to the first quadrant to yield an effective angle α<sub>eff</sub>=90-|90-α|.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>SMLM imaging with dSTORM/GSDIM</title><p>For super-resolution SMLM-imaging with the Leica SR GSD using the dSTORM/GSDIM protocol, 18 mm coverslips (50000 cells/slide) were stored in PBS after fixation and immunolabelling at 4°C. The coverslips were mounted onto a single depression slide (76 mm ×26 mm) and the cavity filled with 90–100 µl GLOX-MEA buffer (0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/g7141?lang=pt&amp;region=PT">G7141</ext-link>, 40 μg/ml catalase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/02071?lang=pt&amp;region=PT">02071</ext-link>) 10% w/v glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/49163?lang=pt&amp;region=PT">49163</ext-link>), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl and 10 mM β-mercaptoethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# M9768-5G)). The buffer was freshly prepared before imaging. Imaging was performed with a Leica SR GSD system using a HC PL APO 160×/NA 1.43 oil objective. The images were recorded with an Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera at 40 Hz using a central 180 pixel x 180 pixel subregion. For excitation, a 532 nm laser (500 mW maximum power output) and a 642 nm laser (500 mW maximum power output) were used and attenuated using an AOTF when appropriate. The two fluorophores were recorded sequentially and image acquisition, single molecule analysis and image reconstruction was performed with Leica LAS X 1.9.0.13747.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Spinning disk imaging</title><p>Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (6500 cells/well) and DIV6-hippocampal neurons (50000 cells/well) were co-transfected with CMV-eGFP-NMIIA (Addgene, cat# 11347) and NMIIA-mApple (a kind gift from Dr John Hammer) using 1 µg:1 µg of each construct/well and Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days later, in the case of SH-SY5Y cells, and four days later (at DIV10) in the case of primary hippocampal neurons, the cells were fixed. Transfected cells were then imaged using an Olympus SpinSR10 spinning disk confocal super‐resolution microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an PlanAPON 60 ×/1.42 NA oil objective (Olympus), a CSU-W1 SoRa-Unit (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) with 3.2x magnification and ORCA‐Flash 4.0 V3 Digital CMOS Camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Preparation of microelectrode–microfluidic devices and electrophysiology recordings</title><p>Custom designed µEF devices were prepared following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lopes et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, coated MEA chips (MultiChannel Systems MCS GmbH, Germany), with 252 recording electrodes of 30 µm in diameter and a center-to-center inter-electrode spacing of 100 µm, were combined with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chambers with an appropriate microgroove spacing for compartmentalization and monitoring of axonal activity. MEAs were coated with 0.01 mg/ml of poly-D-lysine (PDL, Corning) overnight at 37°C, and then washed with sterile water. Microfluidic devices were sterilized with 70% ethanol and were gently attached to PDL-coated MEAs, creating a µEF chamber composed of two separate compartments connected by 700 μm length ×9.6 μm height ×10 μm width microchannels. The medium reservoirs were loaded with 150 μl of 5 μg/ml laminin isolated from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The unbound laminin-1 was removed, and chambers were refilled with Neurobasal medium and left to equilibrate for at least 2 hr at 37°C before cell seeding. Hippocampal neurons at DIVs 11, 12 and 14 were used in the electrophysiology experiments, where either blebbistatin (3 μM), or vehicle were added. Recordings were performed using a MEA2100 recording system (MultiChannel Systems MCS GmbH, Germany). The µEF devices prepared with these MEAs had 16 microchannels with 7 electrodes positioned along each microchannel, as well as 126 electrodes dedicated to the somal compartment. For each time point, recordings were obtained at a sampling rate of 20 kHz for the characterization of the overall network activity. Then, high-temporal resolution recordings were obtained at a sampling rate of 50 kHz, for a duration of 60 or 120 s, for the calculation of the conduction velocity. Throughout the experiments, the temperature was maintained at 37°C and all recorded activity was spontaneous activity. Data analysis was carried out in MATLAB R2018a (The MathWorks Inc) using custom scripts (available in GitHub at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/paulodecastroaguiar/Calculate_APs_velocities_in_MEAs">https://github.com/paulodecastroaguiar/Calculate_APs_velocities_in_MEAs</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Calculate_APs_velocities_in_MEAs">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Calculate_APs_velocities_in_MEAs</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar, 2020</xref>) and the µSpikeHunter tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heiney et al., 2019</xref>). Raw signals were band-pass filtered (200–3000 Hz) and spikes were detected by a threshold set to 6 × STD of the electrode noise. Electrodes with a mean firing rate (MFR) of at least 0.1 Hz were considered active. For the propagation velocity calculations, the extracted spike times were further corrected based on the voltage waveforms. To be considered a propagating event the following requirements had to be fulfilled: detection over the entire microchannel (7 electrodes); time delay between electrode pairs lower than or equal to 1 ms (minimum propagation velocity of 0.1 m/s); isolated spike in a 3 ms time window (as to ensure spike identity in all electrodes). Propagation velocity was then calculated by dividing the first-to-last electrode distance (600 μm span) by the delay between spike times. This stringent detection method eliminated any ambiguity during bursts and excluded sequences with missing spike times on at least one electrode, which drastically reduced the size but strengthened the quality of the action potentials dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All measurements were performed with the researcher blinded to the experimental condition.

the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The mature axon shaft of a neuron is supported by a sub-membraneous actin-spectrin network, composed of actin rings regularly spaced by spectrin tetramers. This structure may provide mechanical support for axons, but the precise molecular composition of this sub-membraneous actin-spectrin network, and it’s similarities/differences to actin filament structures of other cell-types have remained elusive. This study reports that non-muscle myosin II (NMII) localizes to actin/spectrin rings of neuronal membrane periodic skeleton, and is important for regulating the expansion and contraction of axonal diameter. Moreover, by using super-resolution microscopy approaches, the authors provide evidence that NMII heavy chains are often present along the longitudinal axonal axis, being able to crosslink adjacent rings. Together, this study provides important new information on the molecular composition and functions of the membrane periodic skeleton of axons.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The membrane periodic skeleton is an actomyosin network that regulates axonal diameter and conduction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pirta Hotulainen (Reviewer #2); Dylan Tyler Burnette (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in its present form.</p><p>This manuscript reports that non-muscle myosin II (NMII) localizes to actin/spectrin rings of neuronal membrane periodic skeleton, and is important in regulating the expansion and contraction of axonal diameter.

The findings presented in the manuscript are potentially of significant importance in the neurobiology field, but in my opinion the second part of the manuscript focusing on the localization and orientation of NMII molecules in axons is too preliminary for publication in its present form. Thus, significant amount of additional imaging experiments aiming to better unravel the orientation of NMII molecules in axonal membrane periodic skeleton are required to strengthen the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the periodic ring structure is clearly visible with BII-spectrin immunostaining (Figure 1), the periodicity is not obvious from pMLC and NMIIA/NMIIB antibody stainings presented in Figures 3 and Figure 4. Moreover, due to the bipolar nature of NMII filaments, pMLC should be visible as doublets with a spacing of 200-300 nm (see e.g. Beach et al., 2014; Fenix et al., 2016), but this is not obvious from the images presented in Figure 3. To more convincingly detect the localization of NMII in axons, the authors could perhaps consider using fluorescent NMII fusion proteins for these studies.</p><p>2) The NMII imaging experiments would be much more informative if the authors could simultaneously visualize the myosin motor domains and rods (see e.g. Fenix et al., 2016). Such experiments would provide more information about the actual orientation of NMII molecules along the axon, and help distinguishing between the possible orientations presented in Figure 4K.</p><p>3) In a schematic model (Figure 4K) the lengths of NMII filaments are highly variable. This does not match with the published literature, which to my knowledge suggest that the NMIIA and NMIIB bundles have regular lengths of approximately 300 nm (e.g. Billington et al., 2013). Thus, the authors should revise the model by taking into account the regular lengths of NMII filaments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Costa et al. manuscript is a short but carefully done report describing the role of acto-myosin contractility in the regulation of axonal diameter. Authors have used two molecules inhibiting myosin II contractility, one drug to activate myosin II contractility and one negative control drug against myoV contractility. Drug experiments were confirmed using shRNA approach and shRNAs were also tested against many units of myosin II complex, namely: myosin heavy chain, regulatory light chain and protein dephosphorylating (inactivating) myosin light chain (knock-down results more contractile myosin II). Authors also tested which of three myosin II isoforms, A, B or C, were responsible for axonal contractility (A and B positive, C not). All these attempts show the same result, myosin II contractility causes shrinking of axons. When the contractility is released by the way or another, axon diameter increases. To me, these results look very convincing.</p><p>1) Figure 1:</p><p>A. It is not clear what exactly the model on the right shows. If it visualizes contractility, actin filaments should slide closer to each other but here myosin II complex jumps forward.</p><p>L. and M. Myosin II manipulations did not affect periodicity of actin rings – but how about tilting of actin rings? I am not sure if tilting can be analyzed from STED images (how &quot;straight&quot; lines (actin rings) are) but I would be curious to see the result. I hope that it gives an insight of the directionality of myosin II contractility. If myosin II contracts inside rings, there should not be any tilting, but if myosin II contracts between rings, rings might tilt (change their angle).</p><p>L and M. are labeled as describing periodicity but to be exact, the analysis measures the average distance between peaks, not periodicity.</p><p>Figure legend mentions number of axons but it is not clear how many independent experiments these axons were taken from.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1: the title says: &quot;Modulation of NMII activity regulates both the expansion and the contraction of axonal diameter&quot;, but the figure doesn't mention anything about the diameter of axons. Maybe good to change the title of the Figure.</p><p>3) Figure 2: Authors speculate that &quot; One possibility is that inhibition of NMII activity might also affect the distribution of axonal sodium channels.&quot; This would be relatively easy to test by antibody staining of sodium channels and analysis of distribution. This experiment is optional.</p><p>4) Figure 4:</p><p>4B is dim and blurry, any possibilities to have a better image of phalloidin + myosin IIA?</p><p>4C: Just commenting that NMIIB staining looks exactly as it looks in our laboratory. For some reason, field expects that myosin II would show nice repeating periodicity but it does not. Staining looks a bit scattered as shown here, although there is also periodicity. I think we need to accept this and start to elucidate what does it mean.</p><p>4G XZ projection and 4J: where is the cell surface and inner &quot;mid-point&quot;? Give directions.</p><p>5) Figure 3:</p><p>I cannot see the concluded periodicity for pMLC from figures. To me it looks similar to myosin II heavy chains and my conclusion would be that pMLC and heavy chain are in complex and myosin II complex can be in different orientations. It would be interesting to have pMLC+ heavy chain together in super-resolution. Image might be complicated depending on the sites of labels but at same time, it could give an idea for the orientation of the complex.

The findings presented in the manuscript are potentially of significant importance in the neurobiology field, but in my opinion the second part of the manuscript focusing on the localization and orientation of NMII molecules in axons is too preliminary for publication in its present form. Thus, significant amount of additional imaging experiments aiming to better unravel the orientation of NMII molecules in axonal membrane periodic skeleton are required to strengthen the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the periodic ring structure is clearly visible with BII-spectrin immunostaining (Figure 1), the periodicity is not obvious from pMLC and NMIIA/NMIIB antibody stainings presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Moreover, due to the bipolar nature of NMII filaments, pMLC should be visible as doublets with a spacing of 200-300 nm (see e.g. Beach et al., 2014; Fenix et al., 2016), but this is not obvious from the images presented in Figure 3. To more convincingly detect the localization of NMII in axons, the authors could perhaps consider using fluorescent NMII fusion proteins for these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>pMLC is expected to have a periodicity of ~190 nm if myosin is anchored to actin rings. Please note that this periodicity is still compatible with the existence of ~300 nm bipolar NMII filaments in axons (Figure 4O). A 190 nm periodic pMLC staining, coincident with phalloidin, was previously shown restricted to the AIS (Berger et al., 2018). This observation suggested that in the AIS, pMLC is bound to actin rings. Here we show that pMLC extends to the axon shaft (Figure 3D-F). Interestingly, in some axonal regions, pMLC showed a periodic distribution consistent with anchoring of myosin to different regions of consecutive actin rings (Figure 3D- highlighted by red ruler; and Figure 3F). The absence of a generalized striped pattern for pMLC (as is observed for axonal actin and βII-spectrin staining), supports that in each actin ring a limited number of pMLC molecules is anchored. Alternatively, technical limitations of the antibodies used may preclude the visualization of the entire pool of pMLC molecules present in the structure. Nonetheless, we now provide new imaging data showing that in some regions of the axon shaft, pMLC can be observed with the expected striped pattern, colocalized with actin (Figure3G). This supports that pMLC is bound to actin rings throughout the axon shaft. This issue is further discussed in the revised version of the manuscript (subsection “Phosphorylated NMII light chains are colocalized with actin within the MPS and organized as circular periodic structures persisting throughout the axon shaft”)</p><p>In the case of NMII heavy chains, please note that we imaged it using antibodies that recognize the middle portion of the NMII bipolar filament (Figure 4A-D). Unless NMII heavy chains would be positioned only within individual actin rings, a periodic pattern coincident with phalloidin is not expected. As suggested by the Reviewer, hippocampal neurons and the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y were transfected with fluorescent NMII fusion constructs that allow visualizing simultaneously the N- (eGFP tag) and C-terminal (mApple tag) of NMII heavy chain (Beach et al., 2014). NMII was then visualized using spinning disk super-resolution microscopy. In the revised version of the manuscript, we show that in axons, NMIIA can assemble into bipolar filaments of ~300 nm in length (Figure 4H and 4I). Similarly, to the data obtained by STORM (Figure 4D), fluorescent NMII fusion proteins revealed the existence of multiple consecutive myosin filaments, with different orientations in relation to the axonal axis. These results are presented and discussed in subsection “NMII heavy chains have multiple orientations in relation to individual actin rings and to the axonal axis, being able to crosslink adjacent rings”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The NMII imaging experiments would be much more informative if the authors could simultaneously visualize the myosin motor domains and rods (see e.g. Fenix et al., 2016). Such experiments would provide more information about the actual orientation of NMII molecules along the axon, and help distinguishing between the possible orientations presented in Figure 4K.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer and detailed above, we have imaged axonal myosin after transfection with fluorescent NMII fusion constructs (Figure 4 H and 4I). Our data shows the existence of bipolar NMII filaments of ~300 nm in length positioned along the axonal axis (supporting our previous STORM analysis of the NMII heavy chain- Figure 4D). Although the simultaneous observation of the two NMII fluorophores and either actin or βII-spectrin staining was technically not possible to implement, this new data demonstrates that multiple consecutive myosin filaments are positioned along the axonal axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In a schematic model (Figure 4K) the lengths of NMII filaments are highly variable. This does not match with the published literature, which to my knowledge suggest that the NMIIA and NMIIB bundles have regular lengths of approximately 300 nm (e.g. Billington et al., 2013). Thus, the authors should revise the model by taking into account the regular lengths of NMII filaments.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, the models have been revised to accommodate the regular maximum lengths of approximately 300 nm of NMII filaments as well as an average axonal diameter of 450 nm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Costa et al. manuscript is a short but carefully done report describing the role of acto-myosin contractility in the regulation of axonal diameter. Authors have used two molecules inhibiting myosin II contractility, one drug to activate myosin II contractility and one negative control drug against myoV contractility. Drug experiments were confirmed using shRNA approach and shRNAs were also tested against many units of myosin II complex, namely: myosin heavy chain, regulatory light chain and protein dephosphorylating (inactivating) myosin light chain (knock-down results more contractile myosin II). Authors also tested which of three myosin II isoforms, A, B or C, were responsible for axonal contractility (A and B positive, C not). All these attempts show the same result, myosin II contractility causes shrinking of axons. When the contractility is released by the way or another, axon diameter increases. To me, these results look very convincing.</p><p>1) Figure 1:</p><p>A. It is not clear what exactly the model on the right shows. If it visualizes contractility, actin filaments should slide closer to each other but here myosin II complex jumps forward.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, to represent contractility, actin filaments have placed closer to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L. and M. Myosin II manipulations did not affect periodicity of actin rings – but how about tilting of actin rings? I am not sure if tilting can be analyzed from STED images (how &quot;straight&quot; lines (actin rings) are) but I would be curious to see the result. I hope that it gives an insight of the directionality of myosin II contractility. If myosin II contracts inside rings, there should not be any tilting, but if myosin II contracts between rings, rings might tilt (change their angle).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the possible tilting of actin rings has been measured for all drug treatments and Sh downregulations (Figure 1L and M of the revised version of the manuscript). A tilting angle D was measured relative to the longitudinal axon axis. Angles larger than 90º were mirrored to the first quadrant to yield an effective angle D<sub>eff</sub> 90-|90-D_ In the absence of this correction, the average value would always artificially tend to 90 degrees. No variations were found, suggesting that myosin II probably does not contract between adjacent rings. However, it is also possible that adjacent actin rings may not tilt given the βII-spectrin scaffold. We also highlight that it is possible that having several active NMII filaments attached to the adjacent axon rings, the generated net force would be averaged out and thus close to zero. This has been added to subsection “Modulation of NMII activity regulates the expansion and contraction of axonal diameter”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L and M. are labeled as describing periodicity but to be exact, the analysis measures the average distance between peaks, not periodicity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, in the y axis of the graphs Figure 1L and M (now Figure 1N and O), “Periodicity” has been replaced by “Average distance between peaks”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure legend mentions number of axons but it is not clear how many independent experiments these axons were taken from.</p></disp-quote><p>In every experiment displayed, at least 3 independent experiments have been performed.

This has been reinforced in the revised version of the manuscript (Subsection “Structural organization and dynamics of actomyosin axonal rings”). Although co-imaging of pMLC and myosin heavy chain was not possible to implement given host antibody constraints, we used an alternative approach to visualize the N- and C-terminus of NMII heavy chains suggested by reviewer 1 (detailed below). Of note, reviewer#1 raised similar concerns. We are transcribing the answer provided:</p><p>pMLC is expected to have a periodicity of ~190 nm if myosin is anchored to actin rings.
