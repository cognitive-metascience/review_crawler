important receptor in the brain and have been implicated in multiple neurological disorders. Many non-selective NMDAR-targeting drugs are poorly tolerated, leading to efforts to target NMDAR subtypes to improve the therapeutic index. We describe here a series of negative allosteric NMDAR modulators with submaximal inhibition at saturating concentrations. Modest changes to the chemical structure interconvert negative and positive modulation. All modulators share the ability to enhance agonist potency and are use-dependent, requiring the binding of both agonists before modulators act with high potency. Data suggest that these modulators, including both enantiomers, bind to the same site on the receptor and share structural determinants of action. Due to the modulator properties, submaximal negative modulators in this series may spare NMDAR at the synapse, while augmenting the response of NMDAR in extrasynaptic spaces. These modulators could serve as useful tools to probe the role of extrasynaptic NMDARs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34711.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The neurons in the brain form networks that can change in response to experience, causing new connections to form between certain neurons and breaking the connections between others.

However, few have been approved for use in patients because most of the potential drug compounds investigated so far produce severe side effects.</p><p>Perszyk et al. have now identified a new group of compounds that can potentially alter the activity of NMDA receptors without fully blocking the response, potentially eliminating the unwanted side effects. The compounds were tested on frog egg cells and human embryonic kidney cells that had been engineered to produce NMDA receptors. Small changes to the chemical structure of these compounds could switch their effect from increasing to decreasing the activity of the receptor. The compounds only interact with active receptors that have a neurotransmitter bound to them, and compete with each other to bind to the receptors.</p><p>Perszyk et al. also found that some compounds behaved differently depending on how active the NMDA receptor was. These compounds could potentially be used to sense the activity in a network of neurons, which opens up new options for treating neurological conditions that affect the networks.</p><p>Further experiments are now required to see how these compounds affect the activity of NMDA receptors in neurons and living animals. The range of effects produced by the compounds studied by Perszyk et al. suggests that other related compounds may have different effects on receptor activity. Future work could investigate the properties of these compounds to see if they could treat a different set of neurological disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NMDAR</kwd><kwd>Allosteric modulator</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036654,NS065371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traynelis</surname><given-names>Stephen F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perszyk</surname><given-names>Riley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A series of novel compounds selective for N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor includes positive and negative allosteric modulators that act at the same site, show use-dependence, increase agonist potency, and have differential activity based on the agonist concentration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>N-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are broadly expressed in the brain and are important for normal development, neuronal plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). NMDARs contribute a slow, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable component to fast excitatory neurotransmission that is voltage dependent by virtue of its sensitivity to pore block by extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). The typical NMDAR is comprised of 2 GluN1 and 2 GluN2 subunits, creating the potential for diversity given that there are eight splice variants of GluN1 and 4 independent genes encoding GluN2 subunits (A-D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). The regulation and functional properties of the NMDAR are controlled by the subunits incorporated into the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vicini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vance et al., 2012</xref>). NMDARs are expressed at most excitatory synapses, and are also found in peri- and extrasynaptic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sans et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steigerwald et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Although NMDARs have been studied extensively, there are still important questions about the different roles that NMDARs may play given differences in subunit composition and synaptic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladding and Raymond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). Pharmacological approaches can be useful for probing these questions, but tool compounds to differentiate these NMDAR subtypes have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogden and Traynelis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monaghan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santangelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu and Paoletti, 2015</xref>). Whereas NMDAR receptors have been implicated in many neurological diseases, there remains a dearth of clinically-approved drugs that target NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Multiple endogenous and exogenous modulatory sites in the NMDAR recently have been described. In addition, nearly complete NMDAR structures obtained using crystallographic approaches are now available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karakas and Furukawa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), and these data, together with recent cryo-EM structures in the receptor super family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Twomey and Sobolevsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Twomey et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Twomey et al., 2017b</xref>), illustrate the overall topography of the NMDAR and suggest a mechanism for some allosteric modulators, such as GluN2B-selective ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). However, a complete understanding of how other modulatory sites operate and can be exploited has been elusive. Advances in the understanding of specific roles of particular NMDAR subunits have led to renewed interest in targeted therapeutic intervention, and recent work has yielded a growing tool box of novel ligands that act on NMDARs with diverse sites and mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogden and Traynelis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monaghan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hackos and Hanson, 2017</xref>). To date, there are positive and negative modulators that bind to the amino-terminal domain (ATD), agonist binding domain (ABD), or transmembrane domain (TMD). Each new class of compounds discovered enriches our understanding of the function of NMDAR and how these receptors can be modulated. The information gained from these modulators has the potential to provide insight into both NMDAR function and therapeutic strategies to treat complex neurological diseases.</p><p>This study describes a series of compounds that includes both positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) as well as negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of NMDAR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzman et al., 2015</xref>). A set of aliphatic substitutions off an ester linkage to the scaffold interconverts these compounds between positive and negative allosteric modulators. Remarkably, the difference between the positive and negative modulation to the same chemical scaffold was influenced by the addition or removal of individual methyl groups. These modulators appear to bind to a shared site to bring about opposing actions, and share mechanistic features, such as agonist dependence and enhancement of agonist potency. The spectrum of properties in this series of modulators could serve as useful tool compounds for probing the role of NMDARs in circuits in both healthy brain and in neuropathological situations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a new class of positive allosteric modulators of NMDAR function</title><p>We have previously described the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a series of negative allosteric pan-NMDAR modulators that contained an amidothiophene core, the most potent possessing a tetrahydrobenzothiophene, with different alkyl and aryl substitutions connected via an ester linkage at the 3-position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzman et al., 2015</xref>). These compounds inhibited the response to saturating concentration of co-agonists at NMDARs expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte experiments, typified by <bold>EU1794-2</bold> (compound 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzman et al., 2015</xref>). We describe here a new set of closely related analogues that can either potentiate or inhibit responses depending on subtle changes in structure and agonist concentration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <bold>EU1794-4</bold> contained an ethyl ester similar to <bold>EU1794-2</bold> and lacked a methyl substituent on the tetrahydrobenzothiophene core. <bold>EU1794-4</bold> potently inhibited GluN1/GluN2D with a substantial residual current remaining at saturating concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, ester substitutions that had a larger calculated functional group volume than the ethyl ester in <bold>EU1794-4</bold> potentiated NMDAR responses to saturating concentrations of glutamate and glycine. For example, the isopropyl ester (<bold>EU1794-5</bold>) potentiated GluN1/GluN2D responses to nearly 200% of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). Restoration of the methyl to the tetrahydrobenzothiophene core restored negative allosteric modulation (<bold>EU1794-19</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Thus, the direction of modulation (positive or negative) could be determined by the size of the alkyl ester and substitution to the tetrahydrobenzothiophene core.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34711.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <bold>EU1794</bold> series of NMDAR NAMs can be converted to PAMs with subtle structural modifications.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative concentration-response experiments for a negative (<bold>EU1794-2</bold>, above) and positive (<bold>EU1794-5</bold>, below) allosteric modulator using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of GluN1/GluN2D NMDARs activated by saturating concentrations of agonist. 100/30 ÂµM glutamate/glycine application is represented by the grey bar and increasing concentrations of modulator are shown by grey scale boxes (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 ÂµM for <bold>EU1794-2</bold> and 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 ÂµM for <bold>EU1794-5</bold>).

However, <bold>EU1794-29</bold>, which had a longer substitution, <italic>n</italic>-butyl, reduced both the maximal potentiation and potency, suggesting an optimal substituent size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Allosteric modulation of agonist potency by NAMs and PAMs</title><p>The tetrahydrobenzothiophene-containing NAMs reported here inhibit all diheteromeric NMDARs without substantial subunit selectivity, similar to those that we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzman et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, the novel PAMs described here show distinct GluN2 dependence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All PAMs are active at GluN1/GluN2C and GluN1/GluN2D, but do not enhance the response of GluN1/GluN2A to maximally effective concentrations of agonist, in some cases resulted in inhibition of these responses. Most PAMs were alsoÂ capable of potentiating GluN1/GluN2B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As seen with other series of NMDAR PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malayev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hackos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), allosteric modulation can be dependent on agonist concentrations. Thus, we assessed the ability of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> to modulate NMDAR responses activated by sub-saturating co-agonist concentrations, clearly exemplified by modulation of GluN1/GluN2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In these conditions, <bold>EU1794-27</bold> positively modulated all NMDAR subtypes and enhanced previously potentiated subtypes to a greater extent than in saturating agonist (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). We hypothesized that this agonist-dependence was due to <bold>EU1794-27</bold> altering the agonist potency. Therefore, we determined the glutamate and glycine EC<sub>50</sub> values in the absence and presence of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). <bold>EU1794-27</bold> produced modest but significant decreases (higher potency) in the EC<sub>50</sub> values for both glutamate and glycine at all NMDARs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Given this effect by the PAMs in this series, we subsequently considered whether the NAMs in the series shared this mechanism. We selected <bold>EU1794-4</bold> for use in evaluating actions on agonist potency since it retains a large steady-state current even for receptors that have bound <bold>EU1794-4</bold> (saturated inhibition is between 40â70% of control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We co-applied <bold>EU1794-4</bold> during responses stimulated by sub-saturating concentrations of agonist (glutamate and glycine concentrations that resulted approximately in a EC<sub>20</sub> response), which resulted in positive modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the negative modulator <bold>EU1794-4</bold> enhanced the glutamate and glycine potencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, positive modulation elicited by 10 ÂµM <bold>EU1794-4</bold> is dependent on the sub-saturating agonist concentrations used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). <bold>EU1794-4</bold> inhibited GluN1/GluN2C responses to saturating concentrations of agonist to 54% of control, and positively modulated equivalent EC<sub>30</sub> responses (equal effective concentrations of glutamate and glycine concentrations that when applied resulted in a 30% of a maximal response) to 140% of control, and positively modulated average equivalent EC<sub>3</sub> responses by 660% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). We did not observe augmentation of sub-saturating agonist responses by <bold>EU1794-2</bold>, most likely due to its greater extent of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, the degree of inhibition produced by <bold>EU1794-2</bold> was reduced on sub-saturating responses at GluN1/GluN2C from 16% to 45% of control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34711.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Modulation of both <bold>EU1794</bold> PAMs and NAMs is dependent on agonist concentration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The concentration-response relationship for <bold>EU1794-27</bold> at diheteromeric NMDARs activated by 100/30 ÂµM glutamate/glycine (data for GluN1/GluN2D shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is included here for clarity).

Using the same protocol to pre-apply glutamate became problematic for some cells due the degree to which <bold>EU1794-27</bold> enhances agonist potency, a feature exemplified by the prolongation of deactivation. This action of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> was able to render nanomolar contaminate levels of glycine (when present) more active, which necessitated a different experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). When <bold>EU1794-2</bold> was used in this experimental paradigm, inhibition of the contaminate level of activity was observed upon modulator application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

This result illustrates a requirement for glycine to be bound to the receptor for high-affinity binding of <bold>EU1794-27</bold>. To circumvent any ambiguity associated with glycine contamination, we utilized another experimental design described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vyklicky et al. (2015)</xref>. Glutamate was pre-applied with 7-CKA (100 ÂµM) to antagonize the glycine site, blocking any occupancy by contaminant glycine. The receptor was activated by switching to a solution that lacked 7-CKA and contained glycine plus glutamate (with or without modulator, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). To test the ability of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> to bind to the receptor with the GluN1 ABD bound to antagonist, <bold>EU1794-27</bold> (3 ÂµM) was added to the solution containing 7-CKA. Upon the switch from the 7-CKA/<bold>EU1794-27</bold> solution containing glutamate to a solution just containing glutamate and glycine, no detectable change in the response rise time or peak amplitude was observed. If <bold>EU1794-27</bold> bound during the 7-CKA phase prior to agonist binding, we would have expected an increased instantaneous peak current upon switching to glutamate plus glycine given that the dissociation of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> is slower than 7-CKA (compare the steady state response and the 7-CKA response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, comparable experiments were performed with 100 ÂµM APV with similar results, as APV stabilizes the GluN2 agonist binding domain (ABD) open-cleft conformation, and thereby prevents the pre-binding of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). When <bold>EU1794-27</bold> (3 ÂµM) was included in all solutions, potentiation was observed but APV unbinding was a required prior to modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

Certain residues of M3, depending on their position on the helix, could point towards either pocket, rendering the two pockets to be lined by a mixture of GluN1 and GluN2 residues. 15 GluN1 and 15 GluN2D residues in these two regions that probed these pockets were identified and mutated to allow a test of the contribution of each residue to <bold>EU1794-2</bold> inhibition and <bold>EU1794-27</bold> potentiation. Inhibition by <bold>EU1794-2</bold> was significantly altered by substitutions at six residues in GluN1 and 2 GluN2D residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which were found on pre-M1 and M3 regions of both GluN1 and GluN2D. Potentiation by <bold>EU1794-27</bold> was more labile, being altered in mutations at 9 GluN1 residues and 6 GluN2D residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Residues that perturbed the actions of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> were spread across all regions tested except for the GluN2D pre-M1.

Inhibition by <bold>EU1794-2</bold> was altered primarily by mutations in GluN1, whereas potentiation by <bold>EU1794-27</bold> was perturbed by residues both in GluN1 and in the M3 helix of GluN2D. Interestingly, the mutations that invert activity of <bold>EU1794-2</bold> and <bold>EU1794-27</bold> were distinct, but in some cases were in close proximity. For example, <bold>EU1794-2</bold> was inverted by GluN1-F654A, whereas mutation of the adjacent residue GluN1-L655A/Y inverted the modulatory action of <bold>EU1794-27</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). <bold>EU1794-27</bold> potentiation was also converted to inhibition by four mutations at residues residing on the 3 areas of GluN1 that were investigated (pre-M1, M1, M3) and also on the M3 GluN2D helix, which were in close proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). <bold>EU1794-27</bold> actions on GluN1-L655A/Y and GluN2D-M678Y, which are homologous residues immediately downstream of the SYTANLAAF motif, resulted in opposite effects (GluN1-L655A/Y converts <bold>EU1794-27</bold> to an inhibitor and GluN2D-M678Y increases the potentiation of <bold>EU1794-27</bold>). We interpret these results to suggest that the activity of both PAMs and NAMs of the <bold>EU1794</bold> series is dependent on multiple residues in the GluN1 subunit, some of which are overlapping. Furthermore, potentiation by <bold>EU1794-27</bold> is dependent on a wider range of GluN1 and GluN2 residues. One possible way to account for this would be if both modulators bound near the GluN1 pre-M1 helix, with potentiator actions dependent on the nearby GluN2 M3 residues associated with the GluN1 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether mutated residues impacted <bold>EU1794</bold> series modulation through altering receptor open probability, we estimated mutant open probability using MTSEA modification of an introduced cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>). The open probability of GluN2D-containing receptors is very low and may not allow for precise determination of the effects of mutations, thus we used GluN2B-containing receptors for comparison. GluN1 mutations were expressed with a GluN2B A7C construct (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref> legend) and GluN2 mutations were expressed with a GluN1 A7C construct. Several residues were assayed that resulted in reversed, enhanced, or blocked modulator activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). GluN1-P557A, which blocked activity of both <bold>EU1794-2</bold> and <bold>EU1794-27</bold>, had an increased open probability as compared to wild type. GluN1-F654A, which converted <bold>EU1794-2</bold> into a potentiator and enhanced <bold>EU1794-27</bold> potentiation, had a similar open probability as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of the homologous GluN2 residue (GluN2-F653A), which reduced <bold>EU1794-27</bold> potentiation, also lowered open probability as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref> shows that GluN1-L665A and GluN1-N803A, which both converted <bold>EU1794-27</bold> into an inhibitor, had significantly lower open probabilities as compared to wild type NMDARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). These data suggest that altered <bold>EU1794</bold> modulator action by mutated residues is not directly dependent on alterations in open probability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PAMs and NAMs exert their opposing effects via a shared binding site on NMDARs</title><p>Given the similarity in chemical structure between positive and negative modulators in this series, we hypothesized that they might have overlapping binding sites. In order to conduct a detailed functional analysis of competition between allosteric modulators, we first used modeling to examine a receptorâs functional response to co-application of positive and negative modulators acting at the same or different sites. We evaluated two models of modulator binding built into a scheme first proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lester and Jahr, 1992</xref>). Model 1 describes receptors with a single binding site that can accommodate either PAM or NAM, but not both. Model 2 describes a receptor to which both modulators can bind at the same time in different sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We evaluated hypothetical responses from these models (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Responses to maximally effective concentrations of agonist were simulated at various concentrations of the positive and negative modulators. When the modulators compete for the same binding site, they act similarly to stated theory about competitive antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arunlakshana and Schild, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christopoulos and Kenakin, 2002</xref>), with the PAM causing a rightward shift of the NAM IC<sub>50</sub> and generating a linear relationship in dose ratio analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>, <italic>Model 1</italic>). By contrast, there is no apparent EC<sub>50</sub> shift when the two modulators are capable of binding simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>, <italic>Model 2</italic>).

This series of small molecule allosteric modulators show a spectrum of effects ranging from strong negative modulation to robust positive modulation. In addition, there are features that are shared across this series, including agonist-dependence and the ability to enhance agonist potency. Thorough analysis of the actions of this series illustrates a potential way forward in designing new analogues to achieve a wide range of activities. Additionally, the novel features found in this class of modulators suggest potential new strategies for targeting distinct populations of NMDARs, such as extrasynaptic receptors that typically are not activated by high concentrations of glutamate or distinct patterns of stimulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The site and mechanism of action for the EU1794 series</title><p>In the evaluation of the kinetic properties of modulator action, we observed complex actions of <bold>EU1794-4</bold> and <bold>EU1794-27</bold>, which could arise from multiple binding sites, enantiomers of these compounds, or could reflect distinct modulator-dependent mechanistic actions from occupancy of a single binding site. The modulation by <bold>EU1794-4</bold> and <bold>EU1794-27</bold> is voltage independent, eliminating potential channel block within the ion channel pore by potential cationic species as a confounding site that contributes to the observed effects. Given that there is high homology between GluN1 and GluN2, especially in the ABD and the TMD, a reasonable hypothesis is that multiple binding sites exist for <bold>EU1794</bold> series modulators in homologous regions on GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. However, the mutagenesis data argue against this idea, given that the residues at which mutations perturbed the actions of <bold>EU1794-2</bold> and <bold>EU1794-27</bold> overlapped and clustered around the pre-M1, M3, and M4 of the GluN1 subunit. Whereas there were a few residues of the GluN2 M3 helix that influenced <bold>EU1794-27</bold> modulation, the structural NMDAR models suggest that these residues face theÂ GluN1 M3 helix, and thus could interact with the pocket adjacent to the GluN1 pre-M1 helix. Additionally, itâs likely the M3 helixes of both GluN1 and GluN2, which are in close contact, act in concert with one another to control rapid pore opening or closing. If these residues identified by mutagenesis controlled conformational changes downstream of the <bold>EU1794</bold> binding site(s), it would limit potential binding site candidates to the interface between the GluN1 and the GluN2 ABDs, which would then have only two identical binding sites in diheteromeric NMDARs. Therefore there would be less potential for non-identical binding sites that contribute to the mixed actions that are observed for <bold>EU1794-27</bold> and <bold>EU1794-4</bold>. For these reasons, the idea that the positive and negative allosteric actions reflect modulator specific mechanisms from occupancy of a single site seems the most plausible interpretation.</p><p>Evaluation of the effects of enantiomers provides further insight into the binding site of the <bold>EU1794</bold> series. <bold>EU1794-27</bold> exhibits strong stereoselectivity, with the (-) enantiomer showing a typical potentiation time course and the (+) enantiomer producing inhibition. The enantiomers of <bold>EU1794-4</bold> are both capable of producing inhibition but with the (-) enantiomer being more potent (3â10 fold) than the (+) enantiomer. Additionally, both enantiomers of <bold>EU1794-4</bold> appear to compete with <bold>EU1794-27</bold> for access to the binding site, suggesting that enantiomers may interact differently with the same binding site. An alternative explanation for lack of additivity of the effects of the two compounds could be that there are shared residues downstream of the PAM and NAM binding sites that mediate their effects; additional studies are required to evaluate this hypothesis. However, the idea that the enantiomers of the <bold>EU1794</bold> series act at the same site suggests their complex actions on NMDARs expressed in HEK is a mixture of receptors bound to one or the other enantiomer of racemic <bold>EU1794-27</bold> and <bold>EU1794-4</bold>. The available enantiomeric data further support the idea that positive and negative modulators within the <bold>EU1794</bold> series share a single or overlapping binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>EU1794 series links positive and negative allosteric modulators that act at the TMD</title><p>An increasing number of NMDAR and AMPAR modulators have been identified with structural determinants of action that reside in transmembrane linker regions and extracellular portions of the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mullasseril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen and Traynelis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogden and Traynelis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yelshanskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swanger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

However, the <bold>EU1794</bold> compounds represent the first bidirectional NMDAR modulator series with structural determinants of activity within this region, low micromolar potency and with clear rules to control modulation. The similarity in structure of positive and negative modulators illustrates how subtle differences in the ligand can interconvert functional actions between inhibition and potentiation. It is unclear precisely how the different sized ester alkyl chain substitutions of these analogs bring about opposing actions, further investigation of the structure activity relationship may elucidate these details. The ability to potentiate NMDAR seems to be unique to (-)-<bold>EU1794-27,</bold> which may have a specific interaction with the receptor achieved only by its stereoselective active pose in the binding pocket. Work with this series may lead to an understanding of the mechanistic link between the PAMs and NAMs that interact in this portion of the receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differential actions on synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors by submaximal EU1794 analogues</title><p>The <bold>EU1794</bold> series has a property of agonist-dependence, requiring both glutamate and glycine to be bound before the modulator binding site adopts a high potency orientation for members of the series. Relatedly, use-dependence is a property of open channel blockers (e.g. memantine, MK-801, ketamine, etc.) that inhibit the receptor through interactions within the ion permeation path, and thus rely on pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Given that the <bold>EU1794</bold> series are allosteric modulators are not voltage-dependent, the mechanism of their agonist-dependence is unclear. Previously, the NAMs QNZ-46, DQP-1105, and NAB-14 have been reported to show varying degrees of glutamate- but not glycine-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen and Traynelis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swanger et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, neurosteroid derivatives with NAM activity have also been shown to have glutamate- and glycine-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vyklicky et al., 2015</xref>), and the PAM GNE-9278 was reported to be glutamate-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the <bold>EU1794</bold> series is the first series of positive and negative modulators that has been shown to possess the property of being both glutamate- and glycine-dependent. Our working hypothesis is that the <bold>EU1794</bold> series of modulators requires conformational changes in both GluN1 and GluN2 subunits that reflect pre-gating or gating transitions, after which its affinity for its binding site is increased. However, we cannot rule out at this time the possibility that the pore must open to increase modulator binding. Resolving the specific mechanism of the <bold>EU1794</bold> may lead to a more complete understanding of the activation transitions NMDAR.</p><p>We believe that <bold>EU1794-4</bold> highlights a novel sub-class of NMDAR modulators that have the capability to selectively act at extrasynaptic NMDARs based on the combinations of its properties. Extrasynaptic NMDAR are hypothesized to respond to glutamate spillover or glial release of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sahlender et al., 2014</xref>). The potential ability to preferentially act at these non-synaptic sites arises from three mechanistic features of the allosteric mechanism: (1) the submaximal inhibitory effects at saturating concentrations of modulator and agonist, (2) the agonist-dependent and slow association rate, which might limit activity at synaptic receptors, and (3) the ability to enhance NMDAR responses to low agonist concentrations. A similar property has been described for the GluN2B-selective agent ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kew et al., 1996</xref>), although the extent to which <bold>EU1794-4</bold> can enhance the response to low concentrations of agonist is amplified by the large degree of residual current at saturating levels of <bold>EU1794-4</bold> (30â60%) compared to ifenprodil (~10%). There are numerous studies that suggest the importance of extrasynaptic NMDARs in normal biology but study of them requires complex experimental paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris and Pettit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouin and Oliet, 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Sobolevsky (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see below, all three reviewers are enthusiastic about your manuscript and recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once you have had the chance to address their relatively minor points; most of these can be addressed with careful editing of the manuscript. The one request for additional data concerns the open probability of a mutant that influences the activity of your allosteric ligands, which would be nice to include, but we leave this to your discretion and would accept inclusion of a discussion of this issue.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are prominent elements of excitatory neurotransmission, important for learning and memory and implicated in a plethora of neurological disorders. Despite the enormous role in pathophysiology, attempts to design drugs targeting NMDARs had limited success, mainly due to a variety of accompanying side effects. Perszyk et al., describe a novel class of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs) and decipher the mechanism of their action, which suggests possibility of using this class of small molecules for future medicinal purposes. The uniqueness of the mechanism is that the small molecules of the same EU1794 scaffold, depending on decoration of the ester linkage to the scaffold by aliphatic substitutions and the NR2 subunit subtype, through binding to the same site at the ion channel extracellular collar can produce inhibition or potentiation of NMDAR-mediated currents that require receptor activation but can further be tuned by concentrations of agonist glutamate and co-agonist glycine. The new PAMs and NAMs therefore represent the first series of high potency bidirectional NMDAR modulators that have a potential to preserve NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, but to modulate extrasynaptic NMDARs in disease-specific ways. The study includes an impressive amount of data and the same time plenty of very elegant experiments. The experimental results are of high quality and interpretations are just.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>NMDA receptors play a central role in brain physiology and function as well as in numerous neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia to name just a small sample. The development of pharmacological tools to target NMDA receptors in the clinic as well as to understand their normal physiological function is critical. Given the wide spread distribution it is often challenging to target specific subclasses of NMDA receptor. In the present manuscript the authors address a new or modified class of pharmacological agents targeting NMDA receptors, the EU1794 series. Surprisingly certain members of this series can be interconverted from negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) to positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), or vice versa, by small changes in their chemistry. The authors do an outstanding job of characterizing these compounds and their properties that would be important to their potential use as experimental tools. The authors show that the activity of the compounds is dependent on agonist concentrations. Notable here is that some of the agents have no or only small modulatory effects at saturating concentrations but have very robust effects at sub-saturating concentrations. The authors characterize the time course of action showing that the compounds require glutamate and glycine binding before the compounds can have their modulatory effect. They identify potential sites of action for both negative and positive modulators and propose that they share overlapping sites.</p><p>The manuscript is well laid out and written-well. The conclusions are consistent with the presented data.</p><p>My only major comment is why do subtle changes in the structure of the EU1794 compounds lead to variations in modulation, either negative or positive allosteric modulation? Although the authors do a nice job of characterizing the effect of the compounds, it would be nice to have some sense of why the variation. Although the new compounds and the interconversion is interesting, it is not clear either structurally or mechanistically why they are interconverted.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Perszyk et al., describes the work that involves discovery of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAM and NAM) on NMDA receptors and characterization of the functional effects elicited by the compound binding. The compounds presented in this paper are novel in terms of compound-design and functional effects. The importance of PAM and NAM compounds for NMDA receptors in the field of neuropharmacology has been well illustrated for many years owing to their therapeutic potentials. The effort started a while ago with ifenprodil that binds an amino terminal domain (NTD) of NMDA receptors in a subtype-specific manner. In recent years, more efforts in developing a series of such compounds along with a completely new series of PAMs and NAMs have been undertaken in the field, thus, the importance of compound development for NMDA receptors is undisputable. The authors synthesized and purified enantiomers of the EU compounds and conducted thorough experiments to prove (at least at the level of pharmacology) that the binding sites for the PAM and NAM overlap by Schild-like analysis and demonstrated that a subtle difference in chemical structures can convert PAM to NAM and vice versa. They also demonstrated the binding site to be located at the tip of the transmembrane domain by extensive mutagenesis and domain truncations experiments. The overall quality of the work is high and it represents novel findings in a variety of ways (discovery of novel compounds, characterization). This manuscript contains useful information from chemistry perspective as well. Overall the work well qualifies to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Results in Figure 6, especially the point mutations that reversed the effect of NAM is robust and interesting. I wonder if the authors can say more about the potential mechanism for PAM-NAM conversion. Related to this, it would be good to have a rough estimation of what the mutations do to the ion channel activity for the ones that inversed the activity. For example, what does 1a F654 do in terms of P open (rough estimation) and agonist potency since they both affect PAM/NAM activity as authors implied.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34711.058</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] The manuscript is well laid out and written-well.

We believe we need structural information to address this idea and have initiated a collaboration with a crystallographer to obtain data describing the site of action. We also have a computational program to dock ligands into space near the pre-M1 region. Neither project has progressed to a point where there is publication-ready data. However, to begin to explore ideas around this interconversion of modulator direction, we have added new data to the manuscript describing the effect of various mutations on the open probability. These data show various alterations in open probability for homologous mutations that interconvert the effect of the modulator, however no direct correlation is observed between the alteration in open probability and the alteration of modulator actions. We also continue to synthesize new derivatives, which could yield additional clues about nature of this interconversion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
