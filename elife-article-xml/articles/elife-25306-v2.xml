the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Fung et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper &quot;Inhibition of BET recruitment to chromatin as an effective treatment for MLL-fusion leukaemia&quot; (Dawson et al., 2011). Here, we report the results of those experiments. We found treatment of MLL-fusion leukaemia cells (MV4;11 cell line) with the BET bromodomain inhibitor I-BET151 resulted in selective growth inhibition, whereas treatment of leukaemia cells harboring a different oncogenic driver (K-562 cell line) did not result in selective growth inhibition; this is similar to the findings reported in the original study (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 11A,B; Dawson et al., 2011). Further, I-BET151 resulted in a statistically significant decrease in <italic>BCL2</italic> expression in MV4;11 cells, but not in K-562 cells; again this is similar to the findings reported in the original study (Figure 3D; Dawson et al., 2011). We did not find a statistically significant difference in survival when testing I-BET151 efficacy in a disseminated xenograft MLL mouse model, whereas the original study reported increased survival in I-BET151 treated mice compared to vehicle control (Figure 4B,D; Dawson et al., 2011). Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as different conditioning regimens and I-BET151 doses, are factors that might have influenced the outcome. We also found I-BET151 treatment resulted in a lower median disease burden compared to vehicle control in all tissues analyzed, similar to the example reported in the original study (Supplementary Figure 16A; Dawson et al., 2011). Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25306.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25306.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>bromodomain inhibitor</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced important parts of the original paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>), for a paper by Dawson et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2011, Dawson et al. demonstrated targeting BET proteins as an effective strategy for modulating aberrant gene expression associated with mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL), a genetically distinct form of acute leukaemia. Selective inhibition of cell viability and <italic>BCL2</italic> expression in leukaemia cells harboring MLL fusions was observed with the BET bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151, in contrast to leukaemia cells with alternate oncogenic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, efficacy of I-BET151 was tested in a xenograft model of MLL, which resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival compared to vehicle control treated animals.</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Dawson et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 2A, 3D, 4B and D, and Supplementary Figures 11A-B and 16A), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have investigated the efficacy of targeting BET bromodomains in other cancer types. Studies using structurally distinct BET inhibitors, JQ1 and OTX015, have reported these inhibitors to be highly active in various cell lines, mouse models, and primary patient samples of MLL and other types of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">CoudÃ© et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiskus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, I-BET151 was reported to be active against AML with mutations involving the nucleophosmin (<italic>NPM1</italic>) gene (NPM1c AML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson et al., 2014</xref>). Additional studies examining the antitumor effects of BET bromodomain inhibition include other cancer types, such as gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montenegro et al., 2016</xref>), childhood sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bid et al., 2016</xref>), triple negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">da Motta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shu et al., 2016</xref>), and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, evidence indicating potential acquired resistance to BET inhibitors has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rathert et al., 2015</xref>), along with studies which have found that treatment with combinatorial drugs can mitigate acquired resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asangani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurimchak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study reported synergistic effects of combinatorial treatment with a disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) inhibitor and I-BET151 in MLL cells and mouse leukaemia models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilan et al., 2016</xref>). Studies have also addressed the nonclinical safety of BET inhibition and found that BET bromodomain inhibition can impact normal intestinal homeostasis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 2016</xref>). There are several variations of I-BET bromodomain inhibitors currently in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chaidos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">French, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wadhwa and Nicolaides, 2016</xref>). A phase I trial to determine the recommended dose of BET inhibitor OTX015/MK-8628 reported that although the inhibitor was found to be tolerated, toxic effects such as thrombocytopenia were commonly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amorim et al., 2016</xref>). An additional clinical study testing BET inhibition with OTX015/MK-8628 in four patients with advanced NUT midline carcinoma, with confirmed BRD4-NUT fusions, found early clinical benefits reported for two patients with one achieving post-treatment disease stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stathis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evaluating the selective inhibition of aÂ MLL-fusionÂ leukaemic cell line with I-BET151</title><p>Using the same BET bromodomain inhibitor as Dawson et al., we aimed to independently replicate an experiment analyzing the ability of I-BET151 to selectively inhibit the growth of the MLL-fusion leukaemic cell line MV4;11 (MLL-AF4 fusion). Similar to the original study, the K-562 leukaemic cell line, which is oncogenically driven by tyrosine kinase activation, served as a negative control. This experiment is comparable to what was reported in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 11A-B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al.

While the original study included a variety of human leukaemia cell lines, this replication attempt was restricted to the MV4;11 and K-562 cell lines, which were utilized in further experiments. For each cell line, cellular IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) with a mean absolute IC<sub>50</sub> value of 9.03 nM [nÂ =Â 5, <italic>SD</italic>Â =Â 8.27 nM] for I-BET151 treated MV4;11 cells, while the K-562 IC<sub>50</sub> estimates were not able to be accurately determined following published guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sebaugh, 2011</xref>). This compares to the original study that reported an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 26 nM for MV4;11 cells, with the K-562 IC<sub>50</sub> value also unable to be accurately determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25306.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular I-BET151 dose response curves in MLL-fusion leukaemia and non-MLL-fusion leukaemia cell lines.</title><p>Cell viability assays were performed for a MLL-fusion leukaemia cell line (MV4;11) and a non-MLL-fusion leukaemia cell line (K-562) with the I-BET151 inhibitor.

Prior to conducting this efficacy experiment, we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of I-BET151 in this xenograft mouse model, which imitates the pathology of human leukaemia by disseminating to the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopes de Menezes et al., 2005</xref>). Five weeks after intravenous injection of MV4;11 cells into 7-week-old female NOD-SCID mice, the animals were successfully engrafted as determined by detectable human leukaemia cells in the peripheral blood. This was an increase from the 3 weeks reported in the original study, but was necessary due to the lack of detectable leukaemia cells in mice at 3 weeks post-injection during this replication attempt. Mice were randomized into treatment groups and after 21 days of daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of vehicle control or three different doses of I-BET151, the MTD was determined as 20 mg/kg/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) based on the criteria pre-specified in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>).

For the efficacy study, the median disease burden observed in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen were smaller in I-BET151 treated mice compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). This was also observed in the MTD study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the median percent of leukaemia cells detected in the bone marrow of vehicle control mice was 10.7%, which was reduced to 5.3% in I-BET151 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This compares to the representative example reported in Supplementary Figure 16A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al. (2011)</xref>, which reported 14% leukaemia burden in the bone marrow of the control mouse and 1.5% in the I-BET151 treated mouse where low-level residual leukaemia was reported after the 21 day treatment. To summarize, for the disease burden aspect of this experiment we found the results were in the same direction as the original study.</p><p>To assess if I-BET151 impacted cell death, specifically apoptosis and necrosis, flow cytometric analysis was also performed on the isolated cells from the vehicle control or I-BET151 treated mice. The degree of apoptosis and necrosis was assessed within the leukaemia population by staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Observationally, there was no notable difference in the peripheral blood or spleen, with a minor decrease in both apoptotic (Annexin V+PI-) and necrotic cells (Annexin V+PI+) observed in the bone marrow of I-BET151 treated mice compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, at the time of sacrifice, animal health issues were observed beyond the anticipated disease presentation for this model. These included gastrointestinal bloating in three of the I-BET151 treated mice and solid tumors detected in four of the vehicle control treated mice and two of the I-BET151 treated mice. While it has been previously noted that NOD-SCID mice have a high rate of spontaneous thymic lymphomas, no other tumor types were previously reported and tumors did not manifest until 20 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prochazka et al., 1992</xref>). To explore the origin of the observed tumors, sections were stained using a human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A,B,C) antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In all tested samples there was extensive staining, indicating the injected human leukaemia cells spread throughout the mouse outside the hematological tissues. This suggests these mice most likely succumbed to fulminant leukaemia manifesting often as extramedullary disease (EMD), a diagnosis that has been observed in a subset of patients with various types of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganzel et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the original study reported EMD in the majority of the control mice, in contrast to none of the I-BET151 treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these observations raise the possibility that although a survival benefit was not observed with I-BET151 treatment in this replication attempt, despite an overall reduced disease burden, that health issues not directly related to leukaemia could have impacted mortality observed in some of the animals, particularly those treated with I-BET151. Additionally, busulfan conditioning could have influenced engraftment kinetics and disease progression in this animal model and potentially impacted the responsiveness of MV4;11 cells to I-BET151 treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Meta-analyses of original and replicated effects</title><p>We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, where possible, to combine each of the effects described above as pre-specified in the confirmatory analysis plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>).

Any known differences, including reagents and protocol differences, were identified prior to conducting the experimental work and described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>). However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper and through communication with the original authors, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as cell lines, strain of mice, number of cells plated/injected, and specific BET inhibitor were maintained, others were changed at the time of study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fung et al., 2015</xref>) or in the execution of the replication. This includes differences such as the conditioning for xenotransplantation (sub-lethal irradiation to busulfan) and dose of I-BET151 used for the efficacy study (30 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). The regimen used in this replication attempt has not been fully evaluated with MV4;11 cells regarding its impact on disease progression and treatment responsiveness, an important consideration, since the method of conditioning can influence overall and hematological toxicity, as well as overall survival, despite similar engraftment levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robert-Richard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saland et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, other aspects were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as cell line genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleensang et al., 2016</xref>), mouse sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>), circadian biological responses to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Kettner, 2013</xref>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kokolus et al., 2013</xref>), and differing compound potency resulting from different stock solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kannt and Wieland, 2016</xref>) or from variation in cell division rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafner et al., 2016</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Replication Study: Inhibition of BET recruitment to chromatin as an effective treatment for MLL-fusion leukaemia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor. Two of the reviewers, Mark Dawson and M Dawn Teare, have agreed to share their names; a third reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The following issues need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The Abstract and text needs to make clear that (and how) the in vivo protocol employed deviated from the original protocol and acknowledge how this might alter the outcome. It seems very important to not give the wrong impression that the xenograft experiments of the original study could not be reproduced, which would easily be the take-home-message after a &quot;superficial read&quot; of the current manuscript. To avoid this impression, the authors should clearly highlight the most relevant deviations from the original study (i.e. the alternative conditioning regimen and the reduced I-BET151 dose) in the Abstract.</p><p>2) Complications to interpretation due to other animal health issues should be clearly described. Here, it is not necessary to describe all potential issues in detail in the main text (although perhaps in supplement), but to address the following possibility, raised by reviewer #1. &quot;The fact that the reduction in disease burden following IBET treatment closely paralleled the findings reported in the original study yet a survival benefit was not observed here raises the possibility that leukaemia related mortality was not the primary cause for the mortality observed in at least some animals in the IBET treatment arm.&quot;</p><p>Specific examples of places where clarification is in order are given below, as well as some additional suggestions, which have been extracted from the reviews:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>From a reader's perspective there is too much emphasis on the statistical testing performed and not enough discussion about the results and how variations to the original study should be interpreted.</p><p>For experiments 1) and 2) the general results obtained very much led to the same conclusion. In experiment 1) however, although there was, as previously, a marked difference in sensitivity between MV4;11 (IC50 9 nM) and K562 (unmeasurable), the meta-analysis demonstrated poor reproducibility between the concentrations in the original and reproduced experiments for MV4:11 (IC50 of 26 nM previously).</p><p>The main area of discrepancy relates to 3) the in vivo mouse experiment and specifically the efficacy study assessing overall survival. There are a number of methodological aspects of this study that differ substantially to the original study and these are not raised in the Abstract nor discussed adequately in the manuscript. Therapeutically, the dose of the drug was different (less, at 20 vs 30 mg/kg) as was the duration of therapy, with treatment starting at d35 instead of d21 as in the previous study. As disease activity was determined by examination of peripheral blood only and we know that this xenograft model gives disseminated disease, one interpretation could be that the results differed as a lower dose was used in the face of an increased disease bulk. Most importantly technically, the conditioning regime used was markedly different. 30mg/kg of Busulfan is a very different approach to the more conventional strategy of sub-lethal irradiation performed in the original study. The conditioning regime can dramatically alter engraftment kinetics and also the natural history of the disease. This is reflected in this particular case by the fact that one quarter of the mice on this study developed 'solid malignancies', which I assume to be extramedullary leukaemia. Furthermore 3/12 mice treated with I-BET developed gastrointestinal bloating and (whilst not explicitly described) presumably died for reasons that were independent of the leukaemia burden. This is alluded to by the authors when they state that &quot;animal health issues were observed beyond the anticipated disease presentation of this model&quot; but could be stressed more. These important issues impact significantly on an efficacy study that is essentially measuring all cause mortality. The fact that the reduction in disease burden following IBET treatment closely paralleled the findings reported in the original study yet a survival benefit was not observed here raises the possibility that leukaemia related mortality was not the primary cause for the mortality observed in at least some animals in the IBET treatment arm.</p><p>All of the above differences would also explain the apparently contradictory finding that, although survival was not impacted, disease bulk was consistently less in the IBET treated arm. A significant issue with the manuscript as currently presented is that the reader is left unaware of these critical details when reading the reproduction.

Most likely due to a lack of access to an irradiation unit, the authors conditioned NOD/SCID mice with a single dose of busulfan (30 mg/kg i.p. 24 hrs prior to MV4;11 transplantation), which has been reported to lead to comparable engraftment of human CD34+ cord blood cells. Apart from the difference in cell type, the original study by Robert-Richard et al. mainly used other dosing regimens (35 mg/kg 36 hrs prior to injection; or 2 x 25 mg 48/24 hrs prior to injection), which they found to be less toxic. While under these conditions, busulfan and irradiation performed similar in human CD34+ HSC engraftment, one cannot conclude that the used regimen has no impact on the in-vivo growth of MV4;11 AML cells (which, for example, are likely to have a much higher proliferation rate than CD34+ HSCs). In fact, another study (Saland et al., 2015) has documented significant differences in the growth of xenografted MV4;11 cells following irradiation vs. busulfan (20 mg/kg). Although the use of NSG and a lower busulfan dose does not allow for direct conclusions for the present study, these results illustrate how sensitive xenograft models are to conditioning regimens. As most prominent difference, after busulfan conditioning the MV4;11 model turned out to be much delayed compared to the original study, which might be explained by insufficient immunosuppression, toxicity of busulfan or its metabolites on MV4;11 cells, or other experimental differences (which the authors partially summarize in their Discussion). Beyond reducing the overall aggressiveness of the model (and, potentially, promoting a high incidence of xenograft-derived solid tumors, which has been observed by the authors), these altered experimental conditions may also impact the in-vivo responsiveness of MV4;11 cells to I-BET151, which should be discussed. This seems particularly important, since busulfan conditioning is still quite uncommon and the used regimen (30 mg/kg 24 hrs prior to injection) has neither been tested in MV4;11 cells, nor has it been evaluated regarding its impact on treatment responsiveness.</p><p>Beyond changing the conditioning protocol, the authors (based on general toxicity studies) also decided to reduce the I-BET151 dose from 30 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. While this seems reasonable for the specific experiment, the cause for the observed toxicity remains unclear and may (again) be related to the conditioning regimen. Most importantly, the use of a different dosing regimen on its own provides a possible explanation for reduced drug effects in the MV4;11 xenograft model. In fact, in recent work the authors of the original study show that reducing I-BET151 to 10 mg/kg has no impact on survival in this model (Gilan et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall, it cannot be assumed that the drug batch was simply more active and, therefore, needed to be reduced to achieve comparable in-vivo activities. While differences in drug batches should always be considered, the reduced tolerability might be due to the used conditioning regimen, and the differences in survival might simply be a consequence of the reduced I-BET151 dose used in this study.</p><p>Overall, changes in the conditioning regimen and the use of a lower dose of I-BET151 may substantially alter the in-vivo response of MV4;11 cells and provide (independent) possible explanations for the observed reduction in in-vivo drug activity. In light of these concerns, it seems very important to not give the wrong impression that the xenograft experiments of the original study could not be reproduced, which would easily be the take-home-message after a &quot;superficial read&quot; of the current manuscript. To avoid this impression, the authors should clearly highlight the most relevant deviations from the original study (i.e. the alternative conditioning regimen and the reduced I-BET151 dose) in the Abstract. Moreover, these experimental differences should also be discussed more extensively in the Discussion. In the current Discussion, the authors first raise some uncertainties due to missing experimental details, then summarize consistent conditions, and then transition into various possible differences that are hard to control for (which are certainly relevant; differences in MV4;11 culture conditions such as different FBS batches could be added). However, for a comprehensive discussion it seems very adequate to first summarize consistent conditions, then highlight obvious and important differences in experimental design (i.e. different conditioning and different drug dose), and only then discuss additional factors that are not easy to control for.</p><p>In summary, the design and execution of this replication study is of high quality, and all necessary changes to the original protocol have been implemented in the best possible way. However, the changes in the design of the xenograft study are substantial and might fully explain the observed differences in in-vivo effects of I-BET151. Due to these differences, the results of the performed xenograft experiments are not fully conclusive with respect to the reproduction of the original study, which should be highlighted more clearly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25306.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The following issues need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Abstract and text needs to make clear that (and how) the</italic> in vivo <italic>protocol employed deviated from the original protocol and acknowledge how this might alter the outcome.

Here, it is not necessary to describe all potential issues in detail in the main text (although perhaps in supplement), but to address the following possibility, raised by reviewer #1. &quot;The fact that the reduction in disease burden following IBET treatment closely paralleled the findings reported in the original study yet a survival benefit was not observed here raises the possibility that leukaemia related mortality was not the primary cause for the mortality observed in at least some animals in the IBET treatment arm.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We have revised the manuscript to include many of the potential areas of clarification and issues raised in the reviews. Specifically, for the possibility raised by reviewer #1, we included this possibility in an additional paragraph after describing the results of the in vivo experiment.</p><p><italic>Specific examples of places where clarification is in order are given below, as well as some additional suggestions, which have been extracted from the reviews:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>From a reader's perspective there is too much emphasis on the statistical testing performed and not enough discussion about the results and how variations to the original study should be interpreted.</italic> </p><p><italic>For experiments 1) and 2) the general results obtained very much led to the same conclusion. In experiment 1) however, although there was, as previously, a marked difference in sensitivity between MV4;11 (IC50 9 nM) and K562 (unmeasurable), the meta-analysis demonstrated poor reproducibility between the concentrations in the original and reproduced experiments for MV4:11 (IC50 of 26 nM previously).</italic> </p><p><italic>The main area of discrepancy relates to 3) the</italic> in vivo <italic>mouse experiment and specifically the efficacy study assessing overall survival. There are a number of methodological aspects of this study that differ substantially to the original study and these are not raised in the Abstract nor discussed adequately in the manuscript. Therapeutically, the dose of the drug was different (less, at 20 vs 30 mg/kg) as was the duration of therapy, with treatment starting at d35 instead of d21 as in the previous study. As disease activity was determined by examination of peripheral blood only and we know that this xenograft model gives disseminated disease, one interpretation could be that the results differed as a lower dose was used in the face of an increased disease bulk. Most importantly technically, the conditioning regime used was markedly different. 30mg/kg of Busulfan is a very different approach to the more conventional strategy of sub-lethal irradiation performed in the original study. The conditioning regime can dramatically alter engraftment kinetics and also the natural history of the disease. This is reflected in this particular case by the fact that one quarter of the mice on this study developed 'solid malignancies', which I assume to be extramedullary leukaemia. Furthermore 3/12 mice treated with I-BET developed gastrointestinal bloating and (whilst not explicitly described) presumably died for reasons that were independent of the leukaemia burden. This is alluded to by the authors when they state that &quot;animal health issues were observed beyond the anticipated disease presentation of this model&quot; but could be stressed more. These important issues impact significantly on an efficacy study that is essentially measuring all cause mortality. The fact that the reduction in disease burden following IBET treatment closely paralleled the findings reported in the original study yet a survival benefit was not observed here raises the possibility that leukaemia related mortality was not the primary cause for the mortality observed in at least some animals in the IBET treatment arm.</italic> </p><p><italic>All of the above differences would also explain the apparently contradictory finding that, although survival was not impacted, disease bulk was consistently less in the IBET treated arm. A significant issue with the manuscript as currently presented is that the reader is left unaware of these critical details when reading the reproduction. It is essential to communicate this both in the Abstract, in the Results section and when discussing the discrepant results.</italic> </p><p>We agree that there are many aspects a reader needs to consider when interpreting this study, just like any individual study. We have revised the manuscript to include the points raised here, specifically including discussion on the deviation in dose and conditioning used and the impact this could potentially have had on engraftment kinetics, disease progression, and determining survival benefit. We have also clarified in the text that the gastrointestinal bloating was observed at the time of sacrifice and expanding discussion about the solid tumors, which as this review suggests is likely extramedullary disease.</p><p><italic>The results from the MTD study show that the mice in the 30mg/kg arm had the greatest variation in starting weight amongst all the cohorts.
