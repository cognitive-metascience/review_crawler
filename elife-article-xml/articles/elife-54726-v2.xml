It can initiate acute cell death followed by secondary injury induced by microglial activation, oxidative stress, inflammation and autophagy in brain tissue, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits. We evaluated a new pomalidomide (Pom) analog, 3,6’-dithioPom (DP), and Pom as immunomodulatory agents to mitigate TBI-induced cell death, neuroinflammation, astrogliosis and behavioral impairments in rats challenged with controlled cortical impact TBI. Both agents significantly reduced the injury contusion volume and degenerating neuron number evaluated histochemically and by MRI at 24 hr and 7 days, with a therapeutic window of 5 hr post-injury. TBI-induced upregulated markers of microglial activation, astrogliosis and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, iNOS, COX-2, and autophagy-associated proteins were suppressed, leading to an amelioration of behavioral deficits with DP providing greater efficacy. Complementary animal and cellular studies demonstrated DP and Pom mediated reductions in markers of neuroinflammation and α-synuclein-induced toxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>pomalidomide</kwd><kwd>3,6'-dithiopomalidomide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG000994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greig</surname><given-names>Nigel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG057025 (R56)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffer</surname><given-names>Barry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 104-2923-B-038-001-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 108-2321-B-038-008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004700</institution-id><institution>Taipei Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2-107-21121-01-N-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jia-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AevisBio Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Dong Seok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The new drug 3,6’-dithiopomalidomide mitigates key markers of neuronal death and neuroinflammation and improves acute behavioral outcome measures in traumatic brain injury, a common, debilitating disorder that lacks effective treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a principal cause of death and long-term disability in the developed world. Annually, an excess of 10 million people suffer a TBI event worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hyder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ruff and Riechers, 2012</xref>), with some 1.6 to 3.8 million cases occurring within the US alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mckee and Daneshvar, 2015</xref>). By far the majority of TBIs are mild to moderate in character and account for 80–95% of cases, with severe TBI comprising the balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LoBue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tagliaferri et al., 2006</xref>). With increases in survival rate following initial injury, TBI can result in significant and lifelong cognitive, physical, and behavioral deficiencies that require long-term access to health care and disability services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LoBue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pavlovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tagliaferri et al., 2006</xref>). It is now understood that TBI represents a process activated at the time of induction, rather than a single event, and whether clinically manifested or asymptomatic, is one of the most powerful environmental risk factors associated with the later development of dementia, and particularly Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gardner and Yaffe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LoBue et al., 2019</xref>), triggered by gene changes in pathways that lead to these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tweedie et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tweedie et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of TBI is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coronado et al., 2015</xref>) and by 2020, TBI will comprise the third largest portion of the global disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hyder et al., 2007</xref>). With the growing comprehension that a mild or moderate TBI is not benign, and the brain may never fully recover from the injury with time, a greater urgency for an effective treatment has arisen. TBI-associated brain damage is often classified into two key stages. An initial primary damage phase occurs at the moment of insult, comprising contusion and laceration, diffuse axonal injury and intracranial hemorrhage that, combined, induce immediate (necrotic) cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Greig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">LaPlaca et al., 2007</xref>) that is difficult to reverse. This is followed by a protracted secondary phase that encompasses biological cascades associated with neuroinflammation, ischemia, glutamate excitotoxicity, astrocyte reactivity, and ultimately neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barkhoudarian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Greve and Zink, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morganti-Kossmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>). These processes represent targets for potential drug intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diaz-Arrastia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The initiation of an inflammatory response is essential for launching homeostatic neuro-reparative mechanisms following a TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McCoy and Tansey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mckee and Daneshvar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sullivan et al., 1999</xref>), but if excessive or time-dependently unregulated, these same processes can heighten neuronal dysfunction and degeneration by inducing a self-propagating pathological inflammatory cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankola et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequent to a TBI, there is a pronounced elevation in the generation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes, and particularly of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Brain mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α are markedly elevated shortly after TBI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frugier et al., 2010</xref>), and are likewise raised in rodent TBI models. This increase precedes and provokes the generation of multiple other inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shohami et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tuttolomondo et al., 2014</xref>). Depending on its concentration, time of release and signaling pathway engaged, TNF-α can, on the one hand, intensify oxidative stress, contribute to glutamate release, and exacerbate blood-brain barrier dysfunction, each of which may promote neuronal dysfunction and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McCoy and Tansey, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, a delayed, smaller TNF-α rise may augment recovery following TBI, in line with its purported neuroprotective functions, by reducing oxidative stress and promoting neurotrophic factor synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Patterson and Holahan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scherbel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sullivan et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We recently demonstrated that pomalidomide (Pom), an immunomodulatory amino-thalidomide analog that potently inhibits TNF-α synthesis and which is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shortt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Terpos et al., 2013</xref>), mitigates neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and behavioral impairments induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present study evaluated the actions of a novel analog, 3,6’-dithiopomalidomide (DP), in comparison with Pom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in the same TBI model. We find DP possesses a similar TNF-α lowering action as Pom in RAW 264.7 cellular studies, and in rodents challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but additionally lowers inflammation-induced COX-2 and iNOS. This broader activity translated to a more potent activity and efficacy, as compared to Pom, in rats challenged with CCI TBI with respect to contusion volume, neuronal cell death and functional outcome evaluated across a broad variety of behavioral, cellular and molecular indices.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pom and DP, at doses well tolerated by rodents, significantly reduce LPS-induced TNF-α levels in rat plasma, and hippocampal and cerebral cortical tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of Pomalidomide (Pom) and the novel analog 3,6’-Dithiopomalidomide (DP).

With more than 2.4 million cases of TBI in the United States annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coronado et al., 2012</xref>), there is a clear and immediate need for an effective TBI treatment strategy. However, despite some 30 prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials on TBI since 1993, at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion, there are no available approved treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Samadani and Dali, 2016</xref>). Focusing on TNF-α as a drug target involved early in triggering and maintaining neuroinflammation, we synthesized TNF-α synthesis inhibitors aimed to lower the level of its generation but preserve its time-dependent release following an insult to potentially augment the neuro-reparative rather than neurodegenerative features of a neuroinflammatory response following a TBI challenge. The lead compound from these efforts, DP, a novel 3,6’ thionated analog of Pom, significantly and dose-dependently reduced contusion volume and improved functional outcomes at 24 hr, with a therapeutic window that closed between 5 and 7 hr in a classical and well characterized rodent model of moderate TBI. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of the cortical contusion tissue demonstrated a DP-mediated amelioration of TBI-induced neuronal cell loss, microglial activation and astrogliosis, and supported the involvement of endogenous compensatory anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and autophagy-related cascades, with DP demonstrating greater potency than Pom. The present study hence supports the central role of TNF-α in the neuroinflammatory response that follows a moderate TBI, and introduces a new compound capable of curbing the inflammatory response to mitigate secondary phase injury-associated processes.</p><p>Neuroinflammation is a double-edged sword. Post-traumatic inflammation can be advantageous to advance the clearance of cellular debris and promote regenerative processes following a brain insult, such as with TBI. When excessive, however, neuroinflammation can promote neuronal cell death and progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Simon et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas anti-inflammatory therapies have demonstrated positive results in animal models of TBI, such promise has not translated well into randomized placebo-controlled human clinical trials and, in some cases, may have been detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roberts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). The development of the innate immune response following a head injury involves a complex interaction of soluble factors. Cellular lysis occurring during the initial phase of injury, accompanying the primary mechanical insult, allows the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Consistently across rodent TBI models, these trigger the rapid upregulation of TNF-α; both systemic and brain TNF-α levels rise within hours of injury, preceding the rise in other inflammatory cytokines, and ultimately decline to basal levels after approximately 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachstetter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rowe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shohami et al., 1997</xref>). Such a rise in TNF-α can stimulate monocyte infiltration, glial activation, neuronal and myelin loss, and increase BBB permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rochfort and Cummins, 2015</xref>). TNF-α receptor-mediated NF-ĸB activation can transcriptionally induce additional TNF-α and thus, amplify TNF-α and receptor signaling pathways to elevate the expression of over 20 different cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Such chemokines and receptors drive the immune response which time-dependently underpins the acute, subacute and then chronic neuroinflammation that ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yamamoto and Gaynor, 2001</xref>). There are many potential targets within the numerous interconnecting cascades, as well as a substantial redundancy between cascades that can, in part, explain the failure of anti-inflammatory strategies to positively impact TBI outcome measures in prior human trials. A not entirely different scenario was formerly faced in the evaluation of anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis prior to successfully targeting TNF-α with anti-TNF-α antibody biologicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feldmann and Maini, 2003</xref>), which now represent one of the most effective and best-selling drug classes worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Pre-clinical studies of the anti-TNF-α biological etanercept support targeting TNF-α as a viable strategy to potentially mitigate TBI across animal models and humans. Its administration to rats following fluid percussion brain injury reduced motor and neurological deficits at 3 days post-injury, consequent to decreased microglia activation and TNF-α generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chio et al., 2010</xref>).

The thionation of the amide carbonyl groups in key positions (particularly 3,6’) within thalidomide dramatically augments TNF-α lowering action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tweedie et al., 2012</xref>), as does addition of an amino group to the fourth carbon of the phthaloyl ring, to yield Pom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shortt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Terpos et al., 2013</xref>). The utilization of both structural changes yields DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Like, thalidomide, both DP and Pom appear to readily cross the BBB, with a brain/plasma uptake ratio of approximately 0.8 into normal brain. This brain uptake is in line with the MPO (multiparameter optimization) score for both compounds (5.5 and 4.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>)). The MPO score provides a composite value of 6 fundamental physicochemical properties that have been found useful to predict whether or not an agent has desirable drug-like properties, and provides a simple and beneficial tool to help prioritize drug candidates for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wager et al., 2016</xref>). A score in the range of 5, which is achieved by both agents, is associated with a favorable likelihood of CNS action. In this regard, when administered as a single systemic dose, both DP and Pom proved capable of lowering both systemic and brain LPS-induced elevations in TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and substantially mitigated secondary phase TBI damage when given 5 hr post injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). On evaluating dose-dependence, DP demonstrated greater potency than Pom. Whereas DP 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg doses both significantly reduced TBI-induced contusion volume and behavioral impairments, Pom 0.5 mg/kg but not 0.1 mg/kg proved effective, with Pom (0.5 mg/kg) providing activity similar to the lower DP dose. Furthermore, this dose-dependent Pom activity cross-validates our prior evaluation of Pom in TBI in a separate series of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Such cross-validation is critical in the drug development process in the light of the ‘reproducibility crisis’ impacting the medical sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stupple et al., 2019</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Six classical physicochemical factors are used to calculate a CNS MPO score that provides a predictive drug-like value.</title><p>A set of 6 important physicochemical parameters (i) lipophilicity (cLogP), (ii) calculated distribution coefficient at physiological pH (7.4) (cLogD), molecular weight, (iv) topological polar surface area, (v) number of hydrogen bond donors, and (vi) the most basic center (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>), are combined together to provide a composite MPO score of predictive drug-like attributes for the central nervous system.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Compound</th><th valign="top">cLogP</th><th valign="top">cLogD (pH7.4)</th><th valign="top">Molecular weight (g/mol)</th><th valign="top">Topological polar surface area (Å<sup>2</sup>)</th><th valign="top">No. hydrogen bond donors</th><th valign="top">Strongest basic p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> calculation</th><th valign="top">CNS MPO score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Pomalidomide</td><td valign="top">–0.16</td><td valign="top">–0.16</td><td valign="top">273.2</td><td valign="top">109.57</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">1.56</td><td valign="top">4.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3,6′ Dithiopomalidomide</td><td valign="top">0.97</td><td valign="top">0.96</td><td valign="top">305.4</td><td valign="top">5.43</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">2.33</td><td valign="top">5.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Evaluation of a broad number of cellular and biochemical measures was undertaken to define mechanisms underpinning TBI and to further differentiate DP and Pom actions. With regard to drug-mediated reductions in contusion volume, qualitative MRI studies likewise demonstrated DP efficacy at 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg doses at 24 hr that were maintained at 7 days. Additionally, quantification of NeuN-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) as well as of FJC-positive degenerating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) within the contusion margin, support the differential potencies of DP and Pom.</p><p>When cellular damage is sufficiently profound, proapoptotic proteins and transcription factors initiate a process of apoptotic neuronal cell death. The upregulation of caspase-3 in neuronal and glial cells, in particular, contributes to TBI pathology in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Härter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lorente et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in animal models, including CCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glushakova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Newcomb et al., 1999</xref>). In addition to triggering apoptosis, caspase-3 is implicated in the proteolysis of key proteins, such as TDP-43, contributing to TBI and other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate that DP, in particular and more potently than Pom, significantly reduces the number of neurons expressing cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Autophagy, an additional process, accelerates the destruction of cells via self-digestion, and is involved in type II (autophagic) cell death, which is distinguishable from type I (apoptotic) cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shintani and Klionsky, 2004</xref>). We hence quantified both transcriptional and translational expression levels of p62 and protein expression of LC3-II, two classical autophagy markers known to change in human and animal TBI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu and Lipinski, 2019</xref>). Declines in p62 and elevations in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were evident at 24 hr following TBI, and are associated with an enhancement of autophagy initiation in accord with prior CCI TBI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu and Lipinski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). DP treatment, in particular, normalized levels of both p62 and LC3-II, and thereby lowered TBI-induced autophagy, of potential importance as both excessive as well as too little autophagy appear to contribute to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gómez-Díaz and Ikeda, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nopparat et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>An interesting difference between the anti-inflammatory actions of DP versus Pom in our TBI rat model is that, whereas both appeared to equally reduce TBI-induced Iba1 expressing cell number, only DP significantly lowered GFAP expressing cells. Iba1 is a pan-microglial marker whose expression increases with microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hopperton et al., 2018</xref>). TBI induced a change in microglial phenotype to an activated M1-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) in line with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Madathil et al., 2018</xref>), as well as an elevation in pro-inflammatory mRNA and protein expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These changes were largely mitigated by both DP and Pom, with the former consistently demonstrating greater potency. GFAP is a well-characterized marker for mature and differentiated brain astrocytes, and an integral component of their cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luoto et al., 2017</xref>). Following brain injury, GFAP is released from degenerating astrocytes, where it can act as a biomarker of damage, and its expression is also elevated in astrocytes that become reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Miller, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that reactive microglia secrete pro-inflammatory proteins that can act together to induce the formation of a subtype of astrocytes (termed A1 astrocytes) that are neurotoxic to neurons and are less capable of supporting neuro-regeneration and promoting new synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Witcher et al., 2018</xref>). The activation state of reactive astrocytes is reported to be regulated by NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>), and hence the mitigation of astrogliosis by DP is promising.</p><p>In the light of the oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Khatri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), essential to neuronal function are endogenous anti-oxidant mechanisms and, particularly, cyclooxygenase (COX) expression in the brain, which is associated with inflammatory status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Figueiredo-Pereira et al., 2015</xref>). COX is generated in two isoforms: COX-1, which largely mediates normal physiological responses, and COX-2, an inducible form that is primarily implicated in pathological conditions. COX-2 is rapidly expressed in several cell types in response to cytokines, growth factors and pro-inflammatory molecules. Its activity can yield ROS and toxic prostaglandin metabolites that, in excess, can exacerbate brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hickey et al., 2007</xref>) and drive neurodegenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartels and Leenders, 2010</xref>). NO similarly, has been associated with the secondary phase of damage after TBI, and is marked by elevated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in ipsilateral brain regions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Üçal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang and Doré, 2007</xref>); it is generally not detectable in normal brain. Induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression requires the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billiar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Poligone and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>), which, if excessive, can likewise aggravate brain damage after TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Staunton et al., 2018</xref>). Our results demonstrate that DP treatment significantly reduces TBI-induced upregulation of iNOS and COX-2, further supporting that anti-inflammation plays a key role in the mechanisms underpinning the neuroprotective actions of DP. Additionally, COX-2 protein appears to predominantly co-localize with NeuN at 24 hr post TBI, largely within the neuronal cell body, and plays an important role in secondary responses that may result in worsened outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dehlaghi Jadid et al., 2019</xref>). Basal levels of COX-2 are found in neurons in cortex and hippocampus, but are normally minimal to undetectable in glia or endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strauss et al., 2000</xref>). The discrete localization and distinct regulation of COX-2 gene expression in the brain provide a rational basis to suspect that perturbation of prostanoid metabolism may play a significant role in the neuropathology of TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strauss et al., 2000</xref>). As indicated by our data, the number of COX-2 positive neurons is increased after TBI and this elevation was decreased by DP treatment, indicating that the effects of DP are, in part, associated with actions on COX-2 following TBI.</p><p>As TBI-released DAMPs trigger intracellular signaling cascades that lead to microglial activation and the transcriptional induction of downstream pro-inflammatory mediators, particularly COX-2 and iNOS, subsequently causing the subsequent release of cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide and prostaglandins, we evaluated the comparative actions of DP and Pom on selected aspects of this cascade in cell culture. Both DP and Pom have similar activity in lowering TNF-α levels in cell culture, and do so more potently than thalidomide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shortt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Terpos et al., 2013</xref>); however in RAW 264.7 cells challenged with LPS, a classical model of inflammation, DP, but not Pom, significantly mitigated elevations in nitrite, iNOS and COX-2. This broader anti-inflammatory action of DP may underpin its greater potency across the majority of the measures evaluated in our in vivo TBI studies.</p><p>Beyond the short-term consequences of neuronal dysfunction and loss induced by TBI, biochemical cascades are initiated that can lead to an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders and, in particular, PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Delic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gardner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crane et al., 2016</xref>). α-Synuclein has been proposed as the key pathological link between the chronic effects of TBI and later development of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2015</xref>). Elevated α-synuclein expression has been demonstrated in CSF acutely after TBI in infants and children, followed by more chronic elevations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Su et al., 2010</xref>). A similar overexpression and accumulation of α-synuclein in adults correlated with secondary neuronal cell death, inflammation, development of neuropathological symptoms and reduced survival following severe TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Uryu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mondello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2015</xref>). TBI-induced elevations in brain α-synuclein levels particularly occur in the cytoplasm of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons adjacent to the nucleus and along their neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wong and Hazrati, 2013</xref>). Elevated α-synuclein levels reduce TH expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yu et al., 2004</xref>), alter activity in neuronal networks, disrupt synaptic transmission, and contribute to neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hassink et al., 2018</xref>). In the light of these factors, we evaluated the ability of DP and Pom to mitigate the toxicity of aggregated α-synuclein in mixed primary cultures. Both DP and Pom, across a wide concentration range, mitigated α-synuclein-induced microglial activation, thereby cross-validating the anti-inflammatory action of both agents in a second in vitro model. Both agents, additionally, mitigated dopaminergic neuron neurite loss and cell death.</p><p>Taken together, our in vivo and cellular in vitro studies focusing on TBI-induced neuroinflammation demonstrate, across a broad number of complementary quantitative behavioral, histological, and biochemical mRNA and protein measures, that Pom and a novel analog, DP, can effectively blunt the neuroinflammatory response. Multiple studies suggest that a neuroinflammatory response is a critical element in the reparative process that follows a brain injury but, when excessive, can exacerbate damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scherbel et al., 1999</xref>). Pom and, in particular, DP appear to ‘recalibrate’ the response, moving it within a beneficial restorative range of actions. Our studies with Pom, a clinically approved drug, cross-validate and expand its potential to repurpose as a new treatment strategy for TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The first animal studies with DP, reported here, highlight it as an interesting, new and more efficacious analog that warrants further development and evaluation in longer-term follow up studies in TBI as well as in other neurological disorders involving an excessive neuroinflammatory component.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that post-treatment, in particular, with DP at 5 hr after TBI significantly improves neurological outcome and reduces TBI-induced cell death, neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation.

They were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin 100 μg/ml (to ensure their maintenance under an uncontaminated condition), and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were propagated in accord with ATCC guidelines, and were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tweedie et al., 2011</xref>). RAW 264.7 cells were challenged with LPS (Sigma, St Louis, MO: serotype 055:B5) at a final concentration of 60 ng/mL. This concentration of LPS in RAW 264.7 cells induces a sub-maximal rise in both TNF-α and nitrite levels without a loss of cell viability. Such a sub-maximal rise is useful for assessing whether the addition of an experimental drug can either lower or further raise levels of TNF-α and nitrite. In the drug ‘pre-treatment’ study, either DT or Pom (10–100 μM) or Veh, n = 3–4, was administered 1 hr prior to LPS challenge (sample size was selected on the basis of our prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tweedie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tweedie et al., 2012</xref>] and a power analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charan and Kantharia, 2013</xref>]).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While both reviewers outlined the interest and the quality of your study, they raised some specific concerns, especially reviewer #2, that you should address in your revised version. It would in addition be important to frame your study in a broader context to explain the novelty of the work to non-specialist. We do hope that you will find the reviews constructive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Lin et al., the authors explore the effect of 3,6'-Dithiopomalidomide (DP) on the deleterious effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The laboratory had shown that pomalidomide (Pom), an immunomodulatory aminothalidomide analog that potently inhibits TNF-α production, had a positive effect on the outcome of cortical TBI in rats, and are hence now testing another analog that has similar effects on TNF-α but also lowers inflammation induced Cox2 and iNOS. Using a combination of well-designed and carefully quantified studies, the authors show that DP crosses the BBB and limits TNF-α production in vivo in response to LPS, DP iv 5 hours after the TBI alleviates behavioral symptoms, reduced contusion volume and improves functional outcome, with two doses and two stages tested. DP also reduces neuronal damage, caspase-3 induced apoptosis and microglial activation in the contusion region. Overall, in all tests, DP triggered more robust responses than Pom, especially at the dose of 0.5mg/kg. In addition, DP also selectively reduced the expression of autophagy markers and reduced astrogliosis, which was accompanied by a striking effect of DP pre-treatment in cell culture of nitrite, iNOS and COX2 levels. Finally, the authors show that Pom and DP treatments improves the survival and growth of cultured dopaminergic neurons exposed to α-synuclein, suggesting that it might be of interest in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Taken together, this is a well-designed and thorough study that systematically examines the effects of DP and compares them to Pom. Considering the previous work of the laboratory, it seems to more to constitute an interesting extension of the previous work than a fundamentally novel finding.

Our study hence provides two scientifically important advances: (i) it describes a new potential drug for TBI (a disorder for which there is no currently approved pharmacological treatment) and (ii) it compares it to a FDA approved drug with the potential for repositioning.</p><p>In relation to the reviewer’s final comment, the final study within the Results section of our manuscript relates to the actions of both drugs to mitigate α-synuclein-induced losses of dopaminergic neurons and their neurite extensions, and notably also demonstrates mitigation of microglial cell activation in primary cultures. We included this cellular α-synuclein study for multiple reasons. Most important, there is a broadly increasing agreement across epidemiological studies that TBI leads to an increased incidence of PD (see: Gardner et al., 2018; Crane et al., 2016 and multiple others). Notably, and as detailed by Acosta et al., 2015, α-synuclein provides an important pathological link between TBI and the later development of PD; this is reiterated in an extensive review by Delic et al., 2020, that has just appeared in the literature. Secondly, the application of α-synuclein to primary dopaminergic neuron and microglia cultures results in neuroinflammation, and provides a model that supplements the classical RAW 264.7 cells/LPS challenge model, and helps to transition it with the in vivo LPS and TBI studies in our manuscript.</p><p>The focus of our manuscript and studies is TBI, rather than the treatment of PD. We agree with the premise of reviewer 1 in that DP and Pom are interesting drugs that warrant evaluation in other neurological disorders that, like TBI, have an inflammatory component (such as PD). However, we view such an evaluation in an animal model of PD to be beyond the scope of this already comprehensive and detailed <italic>eLife</italic> submission (in this regard, one would need to select the appropriate PD model to evaluate, drug would be administered by a different route – as the i.v. route in our moderate TBI study would not be appropriate to PD treatment – and many other factors would require to be worked out – including drug synthesis in large amounts to support a chronic study (as DP is a new experimental drug – first synthesized by us – and not available anywhere else)). In the light of the reviewer’s comment – the initial lines of the Results section (subsection “DP and Pom mitigate α-synuclein-induced toxicity in primary dopaminergic cultures”) relating to our cellular dopaminergic neurons/microglia/α-synuclein study together with the Discussion section (eleventh paragraph) relating to α-synuclein have been substantially modified to stress the underpinning scientific rationale of our α-synuclein study and how it relates to the other studies within our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:[…] 1) Number of animals for some of the behavioral experiments is rather low, e.g. n=5.

The E in our study is 24 (E=5*6-6) which is greater than 20, and means that adding further animals will not increase the chance of obtaining statistically significant results. Since our data showed clear statistical differences between Sham, TBI+Veh, Pom (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg) and DP (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) groups, we did not add further animals to our behavioral experiments. As a general rule, we will add animals when there appears to be a clear trend that does not achieve statistical significance – or should an animal not be able to undertake a task (which would be noted in our manuscript, if occurring). In such a scenario we would include more animals according to 3R principle (reduction, replacement and refinement) for ethical use of animals.</p><p>In the light of the reviewer’s comment, we have modified the appropriate section within the Materials and methods section to indicate “……(n=5 per group, based on both prior studies (Huang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016, 2015) and a power analysis (Charan and Kantharia, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are the molecules directly modulating microglia polarization or is the effect on microglia derived from smaller lesions?

In addition, iNOS data is available in Figure 11. Our data indicates that TBI upregulates genes associated with M1 microglia and down-regulates genes associated with M2 microglia. Intravenous administration of Pom (0.5 mg/kg) and, in particular, DP (0.5 mg/kg) reversed microglia polarization caused by TBI – by down-regulating M1 and upregulating M2 genes. Notably, protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 have now also been measured, and mirror changes in mRNA expression (new panels H, I and J in Figure 10).</p><p>To further answer the reviewer’s question on microglia activation, we also revised Figure 9 by adding new panels D and E- in which we analyzed the proportion of microglia with an activated morphology (revised Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect on cytokine levels should be studies also at protein level (Figure 10).

Does POM and DP have same efficacy and affinity and what is their molecular target that they inhibit?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer poses an interesting question, as to the specific target of DP and POM. In large part and as a background, the ‘drug development’ process can be split into ‘target-based’ vs. ‘phenotypic’ screening and subsequent development. The emerging consensus is that multiple TBI-associated cascades are triggered in parallel and, if true, the multifactorial nature of TBI would make the discovery of a single effective ‘mechanism-targeted’ drug improbable. To counter this, phenotypic screens can be used in drug development to identify compounds to mitigate a critical step(s) associated with TBI, such as neuroinflammation, and such a phenotypic screen is largely agnostic to any specific mechanism(s) underpinning this event. We selected DP from a broad number of novel Pom analogues that we synthesized and screened (Beedie et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018) via phenotypic-screening to identify agents that mitigated inflammation on the Pom backbone. Key amongst these screens is the RAW 264.7 cell/LPS screen, which is known to induce the cells to generate and release TNF-α and reactive nitrogen species. TNF-α is hence considered a primary target of Pom and related drugs, as noted in the Discussion; such agents enhance mRNA degradation of TNF-α post-transcriptionally and, thereby, lower TNF-α generation (Discussion, fourth paragraph). As also noted in the Discussion, either through lowered TNF-α or via direct actions on other cytokines, DP appears to have a range of potentially useful actions (that seems to be wider than that of Pom). This advantage of phenotypic drug screening may account for it being associated with the highest number of first-in-class drug approvals by the FDA between 1999 and 2008 (Swinney and Anthony, 2011).</p></body></sub-article></article>
