Most strokes happen when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off due to blood clots or clumps of fat blocking blood vessels called arteries. To prevent a blocked blood vessel causing a stroke, the network of blood vessels in the brain contains alternative routes to each area. The arteries in these alternative routes can widen to allow more blood to flow through them and avoid the blockage.</p><p>When the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, the level of oxygen in that area decreases. This causes highly reactive molecules known collectively as free radicals to be produced, which can bind to other molecules in cells and stop them from working properly. A protein called TRPA1 is found in the cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels. When it is active, TRPA1 forms a channel that allows signals known as calcium ions to enter the cell, which ultimately leads to arteries in the brain becoming wider. A free radical known as 4-HNE binds to TRPA1, but it is not clear if this enables the channel to directly sense the levels of oxygen in the brain.</p><p>Pires and Earley studied TRPA1 channels in brain arteries from mice. The experiments found that decreasing the levels of oxygen in the arteries caused 4-HNE to accumulate and activate TRPA1, resulting in the blood vessels becoming wider. Chemicals that inhibit the production of free radicals blocked the activity of the TRPA1 channels. Mice that lacked TRPA1 were more likely to sustain damage to the brain during strokes than normal mice. Furthermore, injecting normal mice experiencing a stroke with a drug that activates TRPA1 reduced the amount of damage to the brain.</p><p>The findings of Pires and Earley suggest that TRPA1 plays an important role in protecting the brain during strokes and other conditions that reduce the brain’s blood supply. Future studies will assess whether drugs that activate TRPA1 have the potential to help reduce long-term disabilities in human patients who have a stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPA1</kwd><kwd>endothelium-dependent dilation</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ influx</kwd><kwd>ischemic strokes</kwd><kwd>middle cerebral artery occlusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15POST2472002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pires</surname><given-names>Paulo Wagner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HL140106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pires</surname><given-names>Paulo Wagner</given-names></name><name><surname>Earley</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL137852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Earley</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL091905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Earley</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL139585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Earley</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1NS110044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Earley</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Acute hypoxia activates TRPA1 channels in cerebral artery endothelial cells to activate an early adaptive response to reduce tissue ischemic damage through vasodilation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interruption of regional blood flow within the brain can rapidly cause irreparable neuronal damage. The cerebral circulation exhibits unique capabilities that allows it to adjust to varying environmental conditions and pathophysiological situations so as to maintain optimal perfusion and minimize such injury. G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels present on the endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that form the walls of cerebral blood vessels initiate many of the signaling cascades that enable these intrinsic adaptive processes. The specific cellular pathways responsible for cerebrovascular homeostasis are of considerable interest as potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with impaired blood flow regulation within the brain, such as stroke and vascular cognitive impairment; however, these pathways remain incompletely understood. We recently reported that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) cation channels are present in the endothelium of arteries within the brain, but not in other arterial beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting a specialized role for these channels in cerebral blood flow regulation. In the current study, we investigated the endogenous adaptive and protective functions of TRPA1 channels within the cerebral vasculature.</p><p>TRPA1, the sole member of the mammalian ankyrin TRP subfamily, is a large-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable, non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karashima et al., 2010</xref>). TRPA1 channels are present on perivascular nerves surrounding small mesenteric arteries, and their stimulation causes vasodilation through release of C-protein gene-related peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, TRPA1 channels form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling complex with intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium channels (K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1) at sites of close contact between cerebral artery endothelial cells and underlying SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, activation of TRPA1 channels, for example with the electrophilic compound allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), derived from mustard oil, induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral resistance arteries, an effect that is prevented by blockade of K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Endogenous regulation of TRPA1 in the cerebral endothelium has been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) generated by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). ROS-induced activation of TRPA1 has been shown to occur through a process that requires generation of lipid peroxidation products that directly activate the channel, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trevisani et al., 2007</xref>). Increased generation of ROS and oxidative stress is a hallmark of vascular diseases, but the importance of TRPA1-mediated vasodilation for the regulation of blood flow in the brain under pathological conditions remains unknown.</p><p>Cerebral blood vessels have the inherent ability to dilate in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kontos et al., 1978</xref>). When hypoxia occurs within specific regions of the brain, this adaptation increases localized blood flow to the affected area, enhancing delivery of oxygen. Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for this important response are not known, a recent study suggested that TRPA1 channels are sensitive to changes in O<sub>2</sub> concentration and are activated by both hyperoxic and hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, hypoxia and ischemia are linked to elevated ROS production and increased generation of 4-HNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunstmann et al., 1996</xref>), an endogenous activator of TRPA1 activity.</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia causes activation of TRPA1 channels in the cerebral endothelium, resulting in vasodilation, and further propose that this response constitutes an adaptive response during perfusion deficiency. Using an integrative approach and a newly developed mouse model expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor exclusively in endothelial cells, we elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for activation of TRPA1 channels in the intact cerebral endothelium during hypoxia and investigated the pathophysiological impact of this novel pathway in vivo using an established model of ischemic strokes. Our findings suggest that TRPA1 channels in the cerebral endothelium are early sensors of hypoxia and initiate an adaptive response to reduce ischemic damage in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries</title><p>A primary goal of this study was to determine the direct effects of hypoxia on TRPA1 channels that are present in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). An effective strategy for directly measuring changes in channel activity is to record local, transient elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels generated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through single TRPA1 channels in the endothelium, detected as TRPA1 sparklets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>), using optical patch-clamp methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sullivan and Earley, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A previous study reported the use of transgenic mice expressing the <italic>Gcamp2</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor under the control of the Cx40 promoter to record TRPV4 sparklets in the endothelium of mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found that the fluorescence intensity of Cx40-based <italic>Gcamp2</italic> (and <italic>Gcamp5</italic>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensors was very low in the endothelium of cerebral arteries, preventing reliable recordings from being obtained. We also found that the cerebral endothelium could not be effectively loaded with standard Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dyes, such as Fluo-4AM. To overcome these limitations, we generated a new transgenic mouse line that expresses <italic>Gcamp6f</italic>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor with fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), exclusively in the endothelium.

We found that acute hypoxic exposure induced an increase in TRPA1 sparklet frequency in the endothelium of intact cerebral pial arteries and penetrating arterioles that caused dilation. Pharmacological activation of TRPA1 in vivo reduced the loss of brain tissue in response to experimentally induced ischemic stroke, whereas conditional knockout of TRPA1 in the endothelium exacerbated this damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). We propose that TRPA1 activity is important in mediating hypoxia-induced dilation of the cerebral vasculature during ischemic stroke, and that this response improves collateral blood flow to the affected region to improve outcomes.</p><p>TRPA1 channels are activated by electrophilic compounds, such as AITC, allicin and CinA, which target specific cysteine residues located in the cytosolic pre-S1 domain linking the channel’s ankyrin-repeat region to the first membrane-spanning domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paulsen et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, considerable evidence demonstrates that TRPA1 channels are activated by ROS and/or ROS-derived metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trevisani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pires and Earley, 2017</xref>). Lipid peroxidation products such as 4-HNE and related substances appear to act on the same cysteine residues that are targeted by electrophilic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pires and Earley, 2017</xref>), providing evidence for a common mechanism of activation. It has been suggested that TRPA1 channels are activated by hypoxia, such as reported by Takahashi <italic>et al.,</italic> who showed that shifting <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic> from 150 mmHg to 80 mmHg stimulated TRPA1 activity, measured using the FLIPPER assay in HEK cells overexpressing TRPA1. The authors interpreted this finding as evidence of hypoxia-induced activation of TRPA1. However, under normal physiological conditions in healthy humans, the <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic> of arterial blood is ~80–100 mmHg within the aorta,~30–70 mmHg in capillaries, and ~20–40 mmHg in the venous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>). Viewed in this context, the data reported by Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>. appear to suggest that TRPA1 channels are activated by restoration of normoxia following hyperoxic exposure, rather than by hypoxia per se. In our study, the <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic> of the superfusing bath was closely monitored and was maintained at ~80–90 mmHg during control (normoxic) conditions and determined to be ~13 mmHg during acute hypoxic challenge. TRPA1 activity, detected as TRPA1 sparklets, was low under normoxic conditions, but was stimulated by change to a hypoxic <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic>. It should be noted that the <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic> in the rat brain following an ischemic stroke varies from near anoxia in the infarct core (~1–2 mmHg) to ~10–15 mmHg in the peri-infarct area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2004</xref>) — values of <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic> similar to those observed in our tissue bath experiments. Thus, our data suggest that pathophysiologically relevant levels of hypoxia acutely activate TRPA1 channels in the intact cerebral endothelium.</p><p>In a prior study, we showed that extracellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generated by NOX2 activates TRPA1 channels in the cerebral endothelium through a process that requires lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). However, here we found that hypoxia-induced activation of TRPA1 was independent of both NOX activity and extracellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Instead, we found that intracellular generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> was required for hypoxia-induced activation of TRPA1. Previous reports have shown that acute hypoxic exposure uncouples the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klimova and Chandel, 2008</xref>), stimulating a localized burst of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernansanz-Agustín et al., 2014</xref>), which can enter the cytoplasm through anion channels present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with earlier reports showing that hypoxia increases mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabharwal and Schumacker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eales et al., 2016</xref>) and cultured endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernansanz-Agustín et al., 2014</xref>), we found that exposure to acute hypoxia stimulated ROS generation in native cerebral artery endothelial cells, and that this response was inhibited by a mitochondrial-targeted SOD mimetic and by intracellular PEG-SOD. A recent study reported that mitochondria are located at the base of myoendothelial projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maarouf et al., 2017</xref>), which are regions of near contact between the plasma membrane of endothelial cells and the underlying smooth muscle cells. TRPA1 channels are also concentrated within myoendothelial projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that hypoxia-induced increases in mitochondria O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production generates 4-HNE within myoendothelial projections, leading to TRPA1 activation in those sites. Our data provide support for a signaling pathway initiated by mitochondrial-generated O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, showing that these superoxide ions stimulate the activity of TRPA1 channels in the cerebral endothelium during acute hypoxic exposure. The current studies do not specifically establish whether mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> activates TRPA1 channels directly or if activation requires lipid peroxidation.</p><p>TRPA1 channels conduct mixed cation currents with a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), and activation of TRPA1 on the plasma membrane of endothelial cells transiently creates small microdomains with high localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Our prior studies demonstrated that TRPA1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx stimulated by direct application of AITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>) or through O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generated by NOX2 (1) triggers endothelium-dependent dilation of cerebral arteries, a response that is unaffected by blocking nitric oxide synthase or cyclooxygenase pathways, but is sensitive to inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 and K<sub>Ca</sub>2.3 K<sup>+</sup> channels. TRPA1 channels and K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 channels co-localize within myoendothelial projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>), such that influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> though TRPA1 channels within these spatially restricted regions is sufficient to increase the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to levels capable of activating outward K<sup>+</sup> currents through K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 and K<sub>Ca</sub>2.3, leading to hyperpolarization of the endothelial cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Hyperpolarization of the endothelial cell plasma membrane, in turn, is conducted to SMCs through myoendothelial gap junctions, resulting in relaxation and vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokoya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chadha et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, TRPA1 activation by AITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qian et al., 2013</xref>) and 4-HNE stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores, leading to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients previously linked to activation of K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 (39). Our current findings show that activity of K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1 and/or K<sub>Ca</sub>2.3 channels is required for cerebral artery dilation in response to hypoxia, suggesting that these channels act downstream of TRPA1 in this setting.</p><p>Our data also show that pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1 channels or <italic>Trpa1</italic> knockout in the endothelium did not completely abolish hypoxia-induced dilation of cerebral arteries and arterioles, suggesting the possibility that redundant or overlapping mechanisms contribute to this response. Several possibilities have been reported, including endogenous generation of carbon monoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leffler et al., 1999</xref>) and TRPV3 channel activity. TRPV3 has been shown to be sensitized by acute hypoxia in a ROS-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karttunen et al., 2015</xref>), and cause endothelium-dependent dilation of cerebral pial arteries and penetrating arterioles in response to chemical agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pires et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Earley et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The extent of neuronal loss following an ischemic insult is determined in part by the supply of blood to the region surrounding the infarct core, known as the ischemic penumbra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoehn-Berlage et al., 1995</xref>). The penumbra is characterized by structurally intact, but metabolic silent, parenchymal tissue in which perfusion is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Symon et al., 1977</xref>). Increasing blood flow to the ischemic penumbra has been shown to reduce expansion of the infarct zone and, consequently, improve neurological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cipolla et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that activation of TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells of cerebral arteries is an early adaptive response to acute reduction in tissue <italic>pO<sub>2</sub></italic>, leading to a possible increase in perfusion within the penumbra. Loss of TRPA1 signaling in endothelial cells of cerebral arteries increased cerebral infarcts following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Further, pharmacological activation of TRPA1 decreased infarcts, an effect blunted by loss of endothelial TRPA1 channels. Isoflurane, the anesthetic agent used during MCAO surgeries, was previously shown to potentiate TRPA1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matta et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, isoflurane anesthesia is neuroprotective in various animal models of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altay et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altay et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khatibi et al., 2011</xref>), but the mechanistic basis of this effect is not known. The current findings support the concept that isoflurane may provide neuroprotection by potentiating TRPA1-mediated cerebral arterial dilation.</p><p>In summary, the present study shows that hypoxia stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPA1 channels in the intact cerebral endothelium <italic>via</italic> a mechanism that requires generation of intracellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> by mitochondria. We also demonstrated that hypoxia-induced TRPA1 activity initiates endothelium-dependent dilation of cerebral pial arteries and penetrating arterioles. Selective deletion of TRPA1 expression in the endothelium exacerbated the loss of brain tissue associated with ischemic stroke, providing evidence that hypoxia-induced activation of TRPA1 in the cerebral endothelium constitutes a novel adaptive response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57bl6</td><td><italic>Tek<sup>cre</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories; <break/>PMID: 11161575</td><td>stock # 008863</td><td/></tr><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57bl6</td><td><italic>mT/mG</italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories; <break/>PMID: 17868096</td><td>stock # 007676</td><td/></tr><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57bl6</td><td><italic>Tek<sup>gfp</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories; <break/>PMID: 11064424</td><td>stock # 003658</td><td/></tr><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57bl6</td><td><italic>Gcamp6f</italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories; <break/>PMID: 25741722</td><td>stock # 028865</td><td/></tr><tr><td> strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57bl6</td><td><italic>Trpa1 ecKO</italic></td><td>Other; PMID: 25564678</td><td>NA</td><td>Mice with endothelium-specific <break/>deletion of Trpa1.

Slices were washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides using a Fluoroshield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Abcam). Fluorescence images were taken by an Olympus FluoView laser scanning confocal microscope using a 60x oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture: 1.42) in a 1024 × 1024 pixels per field of view. The pixel size was maintained constant at X = 180 nM, Y = 180 nM, Z = 0.801 nM. Z-stacks were captured (~40 µm in thickness) to allow for 3-dimensional reconstruction of the arteriolar bed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ROS imaging</title><p>Superoxide production by native cerebral artery endothelial cells was assessed by confocal imaging of cells stained with the ROS-sensitive dye dyhydroethidium (DHE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pires et al., 2010</xref>). Native endothelial cells were isolated by dissecting cerebral arteries and incubating them in tissue collection solution supplemented with 1 mg/mL papain (Worthington Biochemical Company, Lakewood, NJ), 1 mg/mL DL-dithiothreitol and 10 mg/mL BSA for 12 min in a 37°C water bath. Arteries were then washed three times with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS and incubated in tissue-collection solution supplemented with 1 mg/mL type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Company) for 12 min in a 37°C water bath. Thereafter, arteries were washed three times with PSS and triturated by passing the solution through a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pires et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pires et al., 2017</xref>). Dissociated cells in the solution were placed in a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (Greiner Bio-One GmBH, Germany) and allowed to adhere to the dish for 30 min in a cell culture incubator. After incubating cells with 5 µM DHE (ThermoFisher) for 5 min at 37°C, the culture dish was transferred to a spinning-disk confocal microscope for real-time recordings of fluorescence intensity. Attached cells in the dish were exposed to normoxic or hypoxic PSS supplemented with DHE (5 µM) in cells pre-incubated with vehicle, PEG-SOD (30 min prior to recording) or mitoTEMPO (15 min prior to recording) and recorded at a rate of 1 frame/min for 10 min. Recordings were performed in an Olympus IX-71 microscope coupled to a Yokogawa CSU22 Confocal Scanning Unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and an Andor iXon + camera (Andor Technology) using a 100x oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.45). Cells were excited using a 488 nm laser and emission was detected using a 500–530 band-pass emission filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pressure myography</title><p>The effect of hypoxia on the diameters of isolated intact cerebral pial resistance arteries was assessed using pressure myography. Cerebral arteries were carefully dissected and cannulated between two glass cannulas in a pressure myograph chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation, St. Albans, VT). Arteries were pressurized to 60 mmHg and maintained in normoxic PSS at 37°C for 30 min to reach equilibration. Luminal diameter was continuously recorded by edge-detection using videomicroscopy. The viability of each preparation was established by briefly incubating arteries in isotonic PSS containing high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (60 mM KCl, 59 mM NaCl; all other components held constant) to induce constriction. Afterwards, arteries were washed with normoxic PSS until spontaneous myogenic tone was generated. Myogenic tone (%) was calculated as [1 – (active luminal diameter/passive luminal diameter)] x 100. Arteries were then exposed to hypoxic PSS for 10 min and subsequently returned to normoxic PSS. All pharmacological experiments were performed in a paired fashion. Passive diameter at 60 mmHg was determined by incubating arteries in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS supplemented with EGTA (2 mM) and diltiazem (10 μM). In a subset of experiments, the endothelium was removed by passing an air bubble through the lumen of the artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ralevic et al., 1989</xref>). This method of endothelium removal was shown to almost completely ablate endothelium-dependent responses, without damaging the underlying smooth muscle cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ralevic et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>The effects of TRPA1 agonists and hypoxia were also assessed in freshly isolated cerebral penetrating arterioles. Isolation of penetrating arterioles was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pires et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, penetrating arterioles branching out of the middle cerebral artery were carefully isolated from the surrounding parenchyma and mounted onto glass cannulas in a blind-sac experimental configuration. Penetrating arterioles were pressurized to 40 mmHg and superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, four glucose, pH 7.4). Arteriolar viability was assessed by exposing the preparation to isotonic aCSF containing high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (in mM: 67 NaCl, 60 KCl, all other salts remain the same concentration). Viable arterioles were washed with regular aCSF and allowed to generate spontaneous myogenic tone, after which they were exposed to 4-HNE, hypoxia or CinA in the presence or absence of the TRPA1 inhibitor A967079.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Middle cerebral artery occlusion model</title><p>Permanent cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal suture model of MCAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Longa et al., 1989</xref>), modified for mice. Mice were initially anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen and their body temperature was maintained at 37°C. An incision was made at the top of the head for attachment of a laser Doppler flow probe (Periflux System 5000; Perimed AB, Järfälla, Sweden) to measure blood flow to the region supplied by the MCA (5 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to the bregma). A midline incision was made at the neck to expose the carotid artery, and the lingual, thyroid and external carotid arteries were tied off. A 6–0 nylon monofilament with a rounded silicone tip (Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA),~210 μm in diameter, was inserted into the common carotid artery and advanced through the internal carotid artery to block the MCA where it branches from the circle of Willis. MCAO was verified by a sharp drop in blood perfusion, as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Mice that showed less than an 80% drop in perfusion were excluded from the study. Ischemia was maintained for 24 hr, after which mice were anesthetized and euthanized by decapitation. A subset of mice was injected with CinA (50 mg/kg body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2007</xref>]) or an equal volume of vehicle (0.2–0.3 ml of DMSO) 15 min after MCAO to assess the effects of pharmacological activation of TRPA1 on ischemic stroke outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurement of infarct size</title><p>The brain was removed from the skull and sliced into 1 mm-thick sections. Ischemic damage was assessed by subsequently staining sections for 20 min with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, which stains viable tissue red, leaving infarcted tissue white. Brain slices were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and digital images were taken. The percentage of infarction was determined using the following equation: %HI = [(VCVL)/VC]*100, where HI is the hemisphere infarcted, VC is the volume of normal tissue in the non-ischemic hemisphere, and VL is the volume of normal tissue in the ischemic hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swanson et al., 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All summary data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed and graphs were constructed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The significance of differences between two groups was tested by paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, depending on the experimental design. Data that did not fit a normal distribution were tested using a non-parametric alternative. Comparisons of three or more groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Sidak <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Values of p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant for all experiments.</p><p>Sample size for experiments were determined by performing a 2-sided power analysis to reach a power of 0.8 for a value of α ≤0.05. Using these parameters, we determined that Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments should have a minimum of 16 field of views; experiments assessing 4-HNE fluorescence should be 5 field of views; pressure myography experiments should be performed in at least three arteries; MCAO experiments required at least three mice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anita S.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuroprotective Effects of TRPA1 Channels in the Cerebral Endothelium Following Ischemic Stroke&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This is a potentially highly important paper that shows how oxidative species lead to vasodilation in pial brain vessels and potentially heightens blood flux during stress, injury, and/or hypoxia. While the reviewers found merit to your work, they also note serious complications. These are the essential issues that must be addressed in the text and/or with new data.</p><p>Past analysis by the Kleinfeld group and by various computational groups conclude that the bulk of the resistance of the vasculature lies in the capillaries with a smaller fraction in the penetrating arterioles. The current work considers only pial arterioles. At the minimum, it is essential to show that penetrating arterioles contain TRPA1 at densities similar or greater than in the pial arterioles. Ideally, the authors should isolate a pial vessel and show that these vessels also react to activation of TRPA1 by 4-HNE.</p><p>The reviewers raised many essential points. All the points listed below need to be addressed. The following are deemed essential and must be addressed with new text or additional experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As noted by reviewer #1</p><p>&quot;… it is therefore essential to carry out.… experiments showing that 4-HNE evokes detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, that are mediated by TRPA1, in endothelial cells that have never been exposed to CPA or to EGTA-AM.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is an apparent contradiction in Figure 3A. The image shows increased DHE fluorescence with hypoxia, while the graph shows a decrease. Please clarify?</p><p>Further to Figure 3A, &quot;It is essential to add data.… to demonstrate that there is a reduction of the generation of ROS inside the cells, as monitored with DHE, when PEG-SOD was applied.&quot;</p><p>As noted by reviewer #2</p><p>&quot;[You] previously assigned the production of ROS to NADPH oxidase, yet the current work assigns it to mitochondria..… If TRPA1 is localized in endothelial projections near the smooth muscle contact site, how can ROS generated in mitochondria and outside projections, and diffuse to the channel without interacting with other proteins? Is it possible that TRPA1 lies outside the projection in the endothelial body?&quot; Please clarify.</p><p>As noted by reviewer # 3</p><p>&quot;Injection of CinA reduced the infarct size in control.… mice. It is not clear why they chose this to activate TRPA1 [as] there is no information that CinA acts TRPA1 to dilate cerebral arteries. Thus, it is important to see if CinA increases TRPA1 sparklets in wild type control [mice] but not in eTRPA1-/- [mice].</p><p>&quot;[The] authors show that hypoxia produced 4-HNE.… However, it is not clear if 4-HNE contributes to TRPA1 sparklets. Based on the findings in Figure 3, TRPA1 channels were activated by mitochondrial ROS. Thus, it seems that 4-HNE do not have a major role in hypoxia-induced TRPA1 sparklets. Please clarify this issue in the Discussion.</p><p>Lastly, please make it clear in the Abstract that you are using isolated vessels for all but the infarct data. &quot; Mouse model&quot; is too nebulous a term.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper reports that hypoxia of (pial) arteries leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as the lipid peroxide 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which can activate TRPA1 channels in the endothelial cell surface membrane. These let calcium in, which activates gK(Ca) channels, leading to a K<sup>+</sup> efflux. This in turn raises [K]o around the arteries' smooth muscle, leading to hyperpolarization (via activity of gKir channels) and relaxation, causing vessel dilation. This is suggested to be protective in MCAO.</p><p>Many of the steps are well documented, especially those in which KO of TRPA1 in endothelial cells reduces the effects. However, there is a tendency to assume that pharmacological agents will work &quot;as stated on the tin&quot;. I have the following issues which need to be resolved before a decision could be made on whether to accept the paper.</p><p>1) Choice of vessels to study. The work is done on pial arteries. The authors wish to imply that the dilation produced by TRPA1 in hypoxia will increase blood flow to the brain. To reach this conclusion it would have to be the case that the pial vessels constitute a significant resistance in the vascular pathway between (say) the circle of Willis (where I assume the blood pressure is constant) and the large veins draining the brain. I question whether this is the case, because the pial vessels have multiple anastomoses (to reduce the decrease of brain blood flow if one of them gets blocked: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16379497, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20616030), and so are expected to have a low resistance. Within the brain parenchyma it is known that it is the capillaries that have the highest resistance (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27780904). Can the authors cite evidence that shows that the pial vessels do have a significant resistance?</p><p>2) If the resistance argument downplays the significance of pial dilation, is there evidence that can be cited to suggest that downstream penetrating arterioles or contractile capillary pericytes also express TRPA1, and so might increase blood flow by the same mechanism?</p><p>3) Use of CPA to block SERCA. I do not understand why SERCA pumps were always blocked with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) to avoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from stores, and EGTA-AM was applied. Blocking the SERCA will increase the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked by TRPA1, since it will reduce removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm. Lowering the baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] with EGTA will also increase fractional [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes. It is therefore essential to carry out at least some experiments showing that 4-HNE evokes detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, that are mediated by TRPA1 (i.e. are blocked by A967079 or TRPA1 KO), in endothelial cells that have never been exposed to CPA or to EGTA-AM.</p><p>In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of the ECs to the onset of application of CPA should be shown.

It is essential to add data to Figure 3A showing that there is less ROS generation inside the cells (monitored with DHE) when PEG-SOD was applied.

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, a putative TRPA1 agonist (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18574153; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28320952) which may affect the overall expression and activation of TRPA1, which is prone to change in the presence of agonists (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265225). This must be discussed.</p><p>(9) Fluo4-AM is said not to enter ECs in subsection “New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries.”, yet also in subsection “New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries.” EGTA-AM does. What is the explanation of the difference? Is there in fact any evidence that the EGTA gets in (e.g. from monitoring [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors hypothesize that endothelial TRPA1 can be activated by hypoxia-derived ROS, leading to cerebral artery dilation and reduced stroke injury. The authors begin their examination by showing that 4-HNE and hypoxia increase TRPA1 activity as assessed through sparklet production. Next, they show the rise TRPA1 activity was blocked by antioxidants and TRPA1 antagonists. Moving to myography, hypoxia was revealed to dilate cerebral arteries, a response that was again disrupted by antioxidants, TRPA1 blockade and in eTRPA1-/- mice. Finally, the authors then show that diminishing TRPA1 activity increases stroke volume while TRPA1 activation reduced infarcts in wildtype, but not eTRPA1-/- mice. The authors conclude that endothelial TRPA1 channels are sensitive to hypoxia and that their activation not only leads to vasodilation but can reduce the deleterious effects of ischemic damage.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study and one that ties the activity of a unique TRP channel to the genesis of stroke injury. Clearly, the strength of the study lies in the cellular measurements of TRPA1 activation. The connection between TRPA1 and stroke injury is perhaps less certain but understandable given the biological scale over which the authors are working. The reviewer outlines three major concerns that require clarification. See below.</p><p>1) The first concern is conceptual and centers on the TRPA1 activation by ROS. The authors have previously assigned the production of ROS to NADPH oxidase, yet the current work assigns it to mitochondria. The conceptual issue is this. If TRPA1 is localized in endothelial projections near the smooth muscle contact site, how can ROS generated in mitochondria and outside projections, diffuse to the channel without interacting with other proteins? Is it possible that TRPA1 lies outside the projection in the endothelial body? Clarification in the Discussion section would be warranted.</p><p>2) The second concern centers on Figure 5A. The pattern of injury in control mice is not consistent with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The injury pattern in the eTRP-/- mice is more in line with control expectations and with that of Figure 5B and 5C. This concern needs to be addressed.</p><p>3) The n numbers for the main experiments are low (n=4-5) and should be increased to align with generally accepted practice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Pires and Earley described that TRPA1 channel in endothelial cells of cerebral arteries was activated by hypoxia resulting vasodilation. Hypoxia increased the number of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes through TRPA1 channels called TRPA1 sparklets. These TRPA1 sparklets required mitochondrial ROS but not extracellular O2-. Vasodilation by hypoxia was reduced by blockade or endothelial cell-specific deletion of TRPA1 channels. To investigate functional significance of TRPA1-mediated vasodilation, they assessed the ischemic damage by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and found that the deletion of endothelial TRPA1 channels worsened the damage, while activation of TRPA1 channels reduced the damages, suggesting that importance of TRPA1 activity in cerebral endothelium in ischemic strokes.</p><p>This is an interesting paper showing that TRPA1 channels activation during hypoxia may initiate adaptive response to reduce damages by ischemia. More importantly, activation of TRPA1 channels after ischemia may have a beneficial effect on ischemic stroke.</p><p>However, there are still major concerns.</p><p>1) Authors show that hypoxia produced 4-HNE, an endogenous ligand for TRPA1 channels. However, it is not clear if 4-HNE contributes to TRPA1 sparklets. Based on the findings in Figure 3, TRPA1 channels were activated by mitochondrial ROS. Thus, it seems that 4-HNE do not have a major role in hypoxia-induced TRPA1 sparklets. Please clarify this.</p><p>2) Injection of cinnamaaldehyde (CinA) reduced the infarct size in control C57Bl6J mice. It is not clear why they chose this to activate TRPA1. Other TRPA1 activators (4-HNE, AITC) are used in this study and previous literature by the authors. It seems that there is no information that CinA act TRPA1 to dilate cerebral arteries. Thus, it is important to see if CinA increases TRPA1 sparklets in wild type control but not in eTRPA1-/-.</p><p>3) MCAO experiments suggest that the deletion of TRPA1 increased infarct size and activation of TRPA1 by CinA reduced infarct size. Authors described that the protective effect of CinA is partially dependent on TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells. However, the authors did not test if CinA fail to reduce infarct size by MCAO in eTRPA1-/-. Also, the authors did not show if CinA reduce infarct size in <italic>TRPA1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Of course, it may not be appropriate to compare the infarct size between Figure 6A and Figure 6C. But, it is not clear if CinA reduces the infarct size in <italic>TRPA1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>.</p><p>4) ROS imaging data is not convincing. It looks DHE fluorescence brighter with hypoxia plus mitoTEMPO. However, there is a trend of decreasing in the summary data.</p><p>5) Authors propose that TRPA1-mediated vasodilation improve blood flow and outcomes after ischemic stroke based on the results using endothelium specific TRPA1 channel knockouts. In vitro data suggest that TRPA1 activity cause vasodilation. However, authors did not test if TRPA1-channels activity actually improve blood flow in vivo.</p><p>6) CPA was treated in all preparations to detect TRPA1 sparklets. It is not clear if Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through TRPA1 channels predominantly contribute to hypoxia-induced vasodilation. The contribution of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store should be discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuroprotective Effects of TRPA1 Channels in the Cerebral Endothelium Following Ischemic Stroke&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While the reviewers found merit to your work, they also note serious complications. These are the essential issues that must be addressed in the text and/or with new data.</p><p>Past analysis by the Kleinfeld group and by various computational groups conclude that the bulk of the resistance of the vasculature lies in the capillaries with a smaller fraction in the penetrating arterioles. The current work considers only pial arterioles. At the minimum, it is essential to show that penetrating arterioles contain TRPA1 at densities similar or greater than in the pial arterioles. Ideally, the authors should isolate a pial vessel and show that these vessels also react to activation of TRPA1 by 4-HNE.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point, although we also note that older literature maintains that the extracranial and pial arteries provide approximately 50% of overall cerebral vascular resistance(Faraci and Heistad, 1990; Heistad, Marcus and Abboud, 1978). We performed the suggested experiments and the revised manuscript now includes new immunofluorescence images showing that TRPA1 channels are present on endothelial cells within penetrating arterioles (Figure 7). Further, new ex vivo pressure myography experiments demonstrate that 4-HNE, hypoxia, and cinnamaldehyde (CinA) cause dilation of pressurized penetrating arterioles that is blocked by the selective TRPA1 inhibitor A967079 (Figure 7 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2). Taken together, our findings indicate that TRPA1 channels are present and functional in penetrating arterioles and dilate these vessels when activated by chemical agonists and hypoxia. Our data support the possibility that hypoxia-induced activation of TRPA1 causes dilation of pial arteries and penetrating arterioles, which together contribute to cerebral vascular resistance and have an important impact on local hemodynamic control within the brain parenchyma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers raised many essential points.

These let calcium in, which activates gK(Ca) channels, leading to a K<sup>+</sup> efflux.

This is suggested to be protective in MCAO.</p><p>Many of the steps are well documented, especially those in which KO of TRPA1 in endothelial cells reduces the effects. However, there is a tendency to assume that pharmacological agents will work &quot;as stated on the tin&quot;. I have the following issues which need to be resolved before a decision could be made on whether to accept the paper.</p><p>1) Choice of vessels to study. The work is done on pial arteries. The authors wish to imply that the dilation produced by TRPA1 in hypoxia will increase blood flow to the brain. To reach this conclusion it would have to be the case that the pial vessels constitute a significant resistance in the vascular pathway between (say) the circle of Willis (where I assume the blood pressure is constant) and the large veins draining the brain. I question whether this is the case, because the pial vessels have multiple anastomoses (to reduce the decrease of brain blood flow if one of them gets blocked: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16379497, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20616030), and so are expected to have a low resistance. Within the brain parenchyma it is known that it is the capillaries that have the highest resistance (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27780904). Can the authors cite evidence that shows that the pial vessels do have a significant resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns, although we also note that older literature maintains that the extracranial and pial arteries provide approximately 50% of the total vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation (Faraci and Heistad, 1990; Heistad, Marcus and Abboud, 1978). To further address this issue, the revised manuscript includes new data demonstrating that TRPA1 channels are present on the endothelium of penetrating arterioles and that activation of these channels with chemical agonists or hypoxia induced vasodilation.

I do not understand why SERCA pumps were always blocked with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) to avoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from stores, and EGTA-AM was applied. Blocking the SERCA will increase the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked by TRPA1, since it will reduce removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm. Lowering the baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] with EGTA will also increase fractional [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes. It is therefore essential to carry out at least some experiments showing that 4-HNE evokes detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, that are mediated by TRPA1 (i.e. are blocked by A967079 or TRPA1 KO), in endothelial cells that have never been exposed to CPA or to EGTA-AM.</p><p>In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of the ECs to the onset of application of CPA should be shown.

We see very little spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity in the unstimulated endothelium after a 15-minute incubation in the presence of CPA (Figure 1), suggesting that the compound does not provoke an increase in spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Indeed, we see the opposite and as expected, we see more spontaneous activity in the endothelium of arteries that have not been treated with CPA, likely due to spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder also whether CPA affects TRPA1 either directly or by elevating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, as thapsigargin has been shown to do (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18515013).

Data in the current manuscript show that TRPA1 sparklet frequency is very low in the unstimulated endothelium following treatment with CPA (Figure 1), providing evidence that CPA at the concentration used here has no direct effects on TRPA1 activity. It is also unlikely that an increase in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] caused by CPA affects TRPA1 activity in our experiments because our initial studies were performed in cells treated with EGTA-AM to buffer changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pharmacology for modulating ROS.

We (and many other laboratories) have used the air bubble technique in many prior studies (for example (Pires et al., 2015; Earley, Gonzales and Crnich, 2009), and did not observe loss of smooth muscle function. All vessels used for the current study maintained their ability to constrict in response to increases in intraluminal pressure following passage of an air bubble through the lumen, indicating that smooth muscle function was intact.

Importantly, a study by Sonkusare et al., 2012 showed that TRPV4 sparklets in the <italic>en face</italic> preparation are indistinguishable from those in pressurized arteries, suggesting that longitudinal incision of the artery does not significantly affect the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channels in the endothelium. We acknowledge that the endothelium of arteries mounted <italic>en face</italic> is not subjected to the effects of intraluminal pressure or to shear stress due to blood flow, and we cannot study how these stimuli impact Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity using this preparation. We have included additional references describing the en face preparation and discuss the strengths and limitations of the technique in the revised manuscript (subsection “New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Anesthesia. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, a putative TRPA1 agonist (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18574153; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28320952) which may affect the overall expression and activation of TRPA1, which is prone to change in the presence of agonists (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265225). This must be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very interesting point. Prior studies report that isoflurane anesthesia is neuroprotective in various animal models of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (Altay et al., 2012; Altay et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Khatibi at al., 2011), but the mechanistic basis of this effect is not known. Our current findings and the studies cited by the reviewer support the concept that isoflurane may provide neuroprotection by potentiating TRPA1-mediated cerebral arterial dilation. This is discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Fluo4-AM is said not to enter ECs in subsection “New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries.”, yet also in subsection “New genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor mice enable optical recording of single-channel TRPA1 activity in the endothelium of intact cerebral arteries.” EGTA-AM does. What is the explanation of the difference? Is there in fact any evidence that the EGTA gets in (e.g. from monitoring [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i)?</p></disp-quote><p>In pilot studies, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio of TRPA1 sparklets recorded from <italic>Tek:Gcamp6f</italic> mice is improved by treating the tissue with EGTA-AM, suggesting that it can get into cells.

The authors begin their examination by showing that 4-HNE and hypoxia increase TRPA1 activity as assessed through sparklet production. Next, they show the rise TRPA1 activity was blocked by antioxidants and TRPA1 antagonists. Moving to myography, hypoxia was revealed to dilate cerebral arteries, a response that was again disrupted by antioxidants, TRPA1 blockade and in eTRPA1-/- mice. Finally, the authors then show that diminishing TRPA1 activity increases stroke volume while TRPA1 activation reduced infarcts in wildtype, but not eTRPA1-/- mice. The authors conclude that endothelial TRPA1 channels are sensitive to hypoxia and that their activation not only leads to vasodilation but can reduce the deleterious effects of ischemic damage.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study and one that ties the activity of a unique TRP channel to the genesis of stroke injury. Clearly, the strength of the study lies in the cellular measurements of TRPA1 activation. The connection between TRPA1 and stroke injury is perhaps less certain but understandable given the biological scale over which the authors are working. The reviewer outlines three major concerns and four minor issues that require clarification. See below.</p><p>1) The first concern is conceptual and centers on the TRPA1 activation by ROS. The authors have previously assigned the production of ROS to NADPH oxidase, yet the current work assigns it to mitochondria. The conceptual issue is this. If TRPA1 is localized in endothelial projections near the smooth muscle contact site, how can ROS generated in mitochondria and outside projections, diffuse to the channel without interacting with other proteins? Is it possible that TRPA1 lies outside the projection in the endothelial body? Clarification in the Discussion section would be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study we showed that membrane expression of TRPA1 is enriched within myoendothelial projections and co-localizes with NOX2. We also found that stimulation of NOX2 produced O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> that activates the channel through a lipid peroxide product metabolite (Sullivan et al., 2016), suggesting that lipid peroxide products such as 4-HNE are endogenous activators of TRPA1 in endothelial cells. Interestingly, a recent study from Dr. Donald Welsh’s laboratory showed that mitochondria are localized to the base of myoendothelial projections in endothelial cells<sup>5</sup>. Thus, it is possible that mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> can also lead to generation of lipid peroxide metabolites within myoendothelial projections, leading to subsequent activation of TRPA1 channels. We also reported in our previous publication that TRPA1 channels are also present on the endothelial cell plasma membrane outside of myoendothelial projections. Thus, TRPA1 channels can potentially be activated by ROS generated through multiple intracellular pathways and by extracellular sources. We discuss this concept in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second concern centers on Figure 5A. The pattern of injury in control mice is not consistent with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The injury pattern in the eTRP-/- mice is more in line with control expectations and with that of Figure 5B and 5C. This concern needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer, as the cerebral infarct data reported in Figure 8A (previously Figure 6A) for <italic>TRPA1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice are not significantly different from the infarct observed in regular C57bl6 mice (Figure 8B, hemisphere infarcted: 44.8 ± 7.1 vs 49.3 ± 4.7, <italic>Trpa1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> vs wildtype C57bl6 mice, p = 0.299). However, the infarct size in <italic>Trpa1</italic> ecKO mice was significantly higher than that from C57bl6 mice (hemisphere infarcted (%): 61.9 ± 3.6, p = 0.036). We have replaced the representative images to better represent the summary data shown in the graphs, as well as to show the similarities and differences between the experiments and genetic backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The n numbers for the main experiments are low (n=4-5) and should be increased to align with generally accepted practice.</p></disp-quote><p>The n values used for the original submission were selected on the basis of power analysis to determine the necessary number of biological replicates to give a generally accepted statistical power of 0.05 for each experiment. However, we acknowledge the reviewer’s point and have increased the <italic>n</italic> values for most of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Pires and Earley described that TRPA1 channel in endothelial cells of cerebral arteries was activated by hypoxia resulting vasodilation. Hypoxia increased the number of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes through TRPA1 channels called TRPA1 sparklets. These TRPA1 sparklets required mitochondrial ROS but not extracellular O2-. Vasodilation by hypoxia was reduced by blockade or endothelial cell-specific deletion of TRPA1 channels. To investigate functional significance of TRPA1-mediated vasodilation, they assessed the ischemic damage by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and found that the deletion of endothelial TRPA1 channels worsened the damage, while activation of TRPA1 channels reduced the damages, suggesting that importance of TRPA1 activity in cerebral endothelium in ischemic strokes.</p><p>This is an interesting paper showing that TRPA1 channels activation during hypoxia may initiate adaptive response to reduce damages by ischemia. More importantly, activation of TRPA1 channels after ischemia may have a beneficial effect on ischemic stroke.</p><p>However, there are still major concerns.</p><p>1) Authors show that hypoxia produced 4-HNE, an endogenous ligand for TRPA1 channels. However, it is not clear if 4-HNE contributes to TRPA1 sparklets. Based on the findings in Figure 3, TRPA1 channels were activated by mitochondrial ROS. Thus, it seems that 4-HNE do not have a major role in hypoxia-induced TRPA1 sparklets. Please clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Data shown in Figure 4 show that hypoxia causes generation of mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and data shown in Figure 3 suggest that hypoxia increases generation of 4-HNE in the endothelium. Prior studies indicate that O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> can peroxidize membrane lipids to generate lipid peroxide products including 4-HNE (for a review, see Esterbauer, Schaur and Zollner, 1991). Since 4-HNE stimulates TRPA1 sparklets (Figure 1), we believe that it is plausible that hypoxia increases O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production by the mitochondria to generate 4-HNE and activate TRPA1 channels at the plasma membrane. We agree that our data do not specifically rule out the possibility that mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> directly activates TRPA1 channel. This possibility is discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Injection of cinnamaaldehyde (CinA) reduced the infarct size in control C57Bl6J mice. It is not clear why they chose this to activate TRPA1. Other TRPA1 activators (4-HNE, AITC) are used in this study and previous literature by the authors. It seems that there is no information that CinA act TRPA1 to dilate cerebral arteries. Thus, it is important to see if CinA increases TRPA1 sparklets in wild type control but not in eTRPA1-/-.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose CinA for these studies because this compound has previously been used in vivo at the same dosage used here and was well tolerated by the animals (Huang et al., 2007). To address the reviewer’s concern regarding the effects of CinA on cerebral artery diameter, data presented in the revised manuscript show that CinA dilates pressurized pial arteries and penetrating arterioles in ex vivo pressure myography studies (Figure 8—figure supplement 2). This response is blocked by the TRPA1 inhibitor A967079 and is absent in arteries and arterioles isolated from <italic>Trpa1</italic> ecKO mice. These data demonstrate that CinA dilates pial arteries and penetrating arterioles by activating TRPA1 channels. We did not attempt the suggested Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments because the pressure myography studies directly address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) MCAO experiments suggest that the deletion of TRPA1 increased infarct size and activation of TRPA1 by CinA reduced infarct size. Authors described that the protective effect of CinA is partially dependent on TRPA1 channels in endothelial cells. However, the authors did not test if CinA fail to reduce infarct size by MCAO in eTRPA1-/-. Also, the authors did not show if CinA reduce infarct size in TRPA1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Of course, it may not be appropriate to compare the infarct size between Figure 6A and Figure 6C. But, it is not clear if CinA reduces the infarct size in TRPA1<sup>fl/fl</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect, we disagree with the reviewer’s comment. In the original submission we tested the effects of CinA injection in the outcome of MCAO in <italic>Trpa1</italic> ecKO mice (Figure 6C in the original submission, Figure 8C in the revised manuscript). These data show that infarct size was smaller in <italic>Trpa1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (control) mice treated with CinA when compared <italic>Trpa1</italic> ecKO mice treated with CinA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) ROS imaging data is not convincing. It looks DHE fluorescence brighter with hypoxia plus mitoTEMPO. However, there is a trend of decreasing in the summary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the images of DHE accumulation in endothelial cells after exposure to hypoxia shown in the original manuscript were not representative of the summary data. Image quality has been improved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Authors propose that TRPA1-mediated vasodilation improve blood flow and outcomes after ischemic stroke based on the results using endothelium specific TRPA1 channel knockouts. In vitro data suggest that TRPA1 activity cause vasodilation. However, authors did not test if TRPA1-channels activity actually improve blood flow in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed experiments would best be carried out using fMRI or other advanced in vivo imaging modalities. Unfortunately, the capabilities for these potentially elegant studies are not available at our institution. We agree that the suggested experiments would strengthen our conclusions and hope to collaborate with other investigators to more fully characterize the neuroprotective role of TRPA1 channels in the endothelium in an in vivo setting in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) CPA was treated in all preparations to detect TRPA1 sparklets. It is not clear if Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through TRPA1 channels predominantly contribute to hypoxia-induced vasodilation. The contribution of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In a prior publication, we showed that the TRPA1 activator AITC stimulated dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity in the intact cerebral endothelium that was the result of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP<sub>3</sub> receptors on the ER, and that this response was blocked by inhibition of TRPA1 channels (Qian et al., 2013). New data included in the revised manuscript show that 4-HNE increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient activity in the absence of CPA and this response is prevented by the TRPA1 inhibitor A967079. These findings provide evidence that the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal resulting from Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPA1 channels (TRPA1 sparklets) is amplified by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from proximal IP<sub>3</sub> receptors. We discuss this concept in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor.

The Review Editor points out that TRPA1 seems to be present outside of endothelial cells in our photomicrographs. Astrocytes express TRPA1 channels (Shigetomi et al.,2013; Shigetomi et al., 2011), and it is likely that the signal observed outside of endothelial cells is from TRPA1 channels present in astrocytic end-feet (astrocyte projections that envelop blood vessels within the brain parenchyma). It is important to note that we have not performed co-staining of astrocytes and TRPA1 to confirm this possibility, as this is outside of the scope of the current study.
