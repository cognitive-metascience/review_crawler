For example, members of a large family of lipids called sphingolipids play crucial roles in many cell processes and are essential for tissues and organs to form as animal embryos develop. A molecule called sphingosine is the basic building block of most sphingolipids. An enzyme known as sphingosine kinase 2 (Sphk2) converts sphingosine into a sphingolipid called sphingosine 1-phosphate, which is released from cells and regulates communication between cells. Another enzyme called ceramide synthase 2b (Cers2b) converts sphingosine into ceramide, which is required for the membrane surrounding individual cells to work properly.</p><p>Excess levels of particular sphingolipids can be toxic to cells so animals carefully control the levels of these molecules in their bodies. However, it was not clear how animal cells sense the molecules and regulate their production and breakdown. Mendelson et al. addressed this question by studying mutant zebrafish embryos that fail to produce Sphk2 and thus produce little or no sphingosine 1-phosphate.</p><p>It was thought that the mutant zebrafish may experience the toxic effects of high levels of sphingosine because they are unable to convert it to sphingosine 1-phosphate. However, the experiments show that the mutant embryos are able to avoid this toxicity by increasing the production of the Cers2b enzyme. Somehow the gene that encodes this enzyme is able to sense high levels of sphingosine and responds by increasing its own production, which in turn increases the conversion of sphingosine into the non-toxic ceramide. Further experiments found that this mechanism for sensing and removing excess sphingosine is already operating at an earlier stage of development when the zebrafish is just an egg.</p><p>Further work is needed to understand exactly how this sphingosine sensing mechanism works. These findings may help us to develop new treatments for diseases caused by an imbalance in sphingolipids, such as diabetes and cancer. This work may also help to increase the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility therapies by enhancing the survival of human egg cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sphingolipids</kwd><kwd>epiboly</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisano</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisano</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL089934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA077839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL135821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL111400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developing oocytes lacking <italic>Sphk2</italic> sense high sphingosine levels and transcriptionally activate expression of the gene encoding Cers2b, to mediate a salvage pathway to reduce potentially toxic sphingosine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lysophospholipid mediator generated through sphingomyelin metabolism, best known as a receptor-dependent regulator of lymphocyte trafficking and vascular homeostasis. However, S1P signaling also plays key roles during embryogenesis, including developmental angiogenesis, cardiogenesis, limb development and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Proia and Hla, 2015</xref>). S1P binds to five G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P<sub>1–5</sub>) that are widely-expressed and function either alone or together to regulate various developmental and physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mendelson et al., 2014</xref>). S1P can only be generated via phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase, encoded by two genes (<italic>sphk1</italic> and <italic>sphk2</italic>) that are highly conserved in vertebrates. In zebrafish, <italic>sphk2</italic> is expressed during the earliest stages of embryogenesis, including as a maternal transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendelson et al., 2015</xref>). Mouse embryos tolerate knockout of either <italic>Sphk1</italic> or <italic>Sphk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allende et al., 2004</xref>), which implies that <italic>Sphk1</italic> and <italic>Sphk2</italic> function redundantly and can compensate for each other’s loss. Indeed, global or hematopoietic-specific (erythrocyte and platelet) knockout of both <italic>Sphk1</italic> and <italic>Sphk2</italic> is embryonic lethal between E11.5–13.5 due to vascular developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mizugishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>) that are similar to those observed in mice lacking all three receptors S1P<sub>1-3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). Because of this early lethality, functions for sphingosine kinases in murine embryogenesis are otherwise not well characterized.</p><p>Zebrafish genetics has contributed much of our understanding for how S1P signaling regulates collective cell migration during the process of primordial heart tube formation from two anterior lateral mesoderm progenitor fields. A point mutation in the gene <italic>miles apart</italic> (<italic>mil</italic>), which encodes S1P<sub>2</sub>, prevents cardiac precursor cells from migrating to the midline, resulting in formation of two separate defective hearts or <italic>cardia bifida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kupperman et al., 2000</xref>). The mutants <italic>two of hearts</italic> (<italic>toh</italic>) and <italic>ko157</italic> phenocopy the <italic>mil</italic> cardiac defect and are caused by recessive mutations in the sphingolipid transporter gene, <italic>spinster2</italic> (<italic>spns2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osborne et al., 2008</xref>). A model consistent with the genetics is that <italic>spns2</italic> functions in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL, analogous to mammalian extra-embryonic endoderm) to transport S1P to embryonic endoderm where it activates S1P<sub>2</sub> signaling, coupled to Gα<sub>13</sub> that subsequently activates RhoGEF to regulate endodermal convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ye and Lin, 2013</xref>). In this way, the S1P<sub>2</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub>/Rho pathway activates cell-surface integrins and fibronectin matrix assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) and provides endoderm with the matricellular cues recognized by myocardial precursor cells to migrate collectively towards the midline. Receptor signaling is mediated in part through YAP1-dependent expression of CTGF in S1P-activated endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukui et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendelson et al., 2015</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hisano et al., 2015a</xref>) generated maternal zygotic mutants for <italic>sphk2</italic> (<italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic>) and showed that these embryos phenocopy null zygotic mutants of <italic>s1pr2</italic> and <italic>spns2</italic>. The <italic>sphk2</italic> transcripts can be either maternally or zygotically provided, but without either, essential migrational cues fail to be transmitted to precardiac mesoderm and formation of the heart tube fails. Sphk2 activity in the YSL, presumably acting in concert with the Spns2 transporter, establishes a gradient of extracellular S1P essential for the provision of endodermal cues that are recognized by overlapping sheets of migrating precardiac mesoderm. Endoderm convergence/heart tube formation is the earliest known developmental function for receptor-dependent S1P signaling. However, the studies do not rule out other receptor-independent functions for Sphk2.</p><p>We have since re-evaluated the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos and discovered phenotypes that are distinct from those found by disruption of <italic>spns2</italic> or <italic>s1pr2</italic>. These phenotypes appear to be caused not by loss of S1P, but rather by the excessive accumulation of the precursor substrate sphingosine in the absence of kinase. This led us to the discovery that embryos lacking sphingosine kinase activity tolerate the potentially toxic excess sphingosine because they upregulate a specific ceramide synthase (Cers) gene, as a salvage pathway to normalize sphingosine levels. We mapped a DNA region that mediates the transcriptional response on the <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter. It has long been noted that Cers enzymes, in addition to encoding a Lag motif important for enzymatic activity that metabolizes sphingosine to ceramide, also encode a homeobox domain, typically used for DNA-binding by the HOX class of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Futerman, 2010</xref>). Indeed, we show that Cers2b, probably by an indirect mechanism, can modulate the expression of its own promoter, and this activity requires the HOX domain and is sensitive to sphingosine levels. Our study identifies cis-linked sphingolipid transcriptional response sequences, and reveals a sensing mechanism controlling sphingolipid levels by a metabolic enzyme that participates in a feedback program.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maternal-zygotic mutant embryos have previously unrecognized early developmental phenotypes</title><p>Upon close examination of developing embryos, we noticed that <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos display a subtle but consistent developmental delay during gastrulation, compared to time-matched wildtype embryos, particularly obvious around 7–8 hr post fertilization (hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>).

Quantitative lipidomics profiling confirmed that the mutant embryos are depleted of S1P to essentially undetectable levels. However, this analysis also revealed that the mutant embryos have excessive levels of sphingosine and total long chain ceramides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>), likely due to substrate backup caused by lack of sphingosine kinase and reverse reactions that form ceramide. These observations indicate that in the absence of Sphk2, embryos accumulate excessive levels of the precursor substrate sphingosine, associated with a developmental delay during gastrulation. This is however ultimately tolerated by embryos, and they recover, until displaying later phenotypes in endoderm convergence and heart formation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21992.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos show developmental delay associated with enhanced levels of sphingosine.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Compared to time-matched representative wildtype embryos observed at 7 or 8 hr post fertilization (hpf), the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos (<bold>C,D</bold>) display a developmental delay during epiboly, denoted by arrows indicating the leading edge of the blastoderm.

During early gastrulation, the blastoderm and the YSL move toward the vegetal pole during a process known as epiboly. A microtubule network surrounds the yolk syncytial nuclei while another set of animal–vegetal-oriented microtubules emerge from the YSL into the yolk cytoplasmic layer (YCL). As epiboly progresses, two actin rings become visible; these rings serve to close the developing blastopore. Proper cytoskeletal patterning is crucial during epiboly as chemical disruption of either the microtubule or actin networks blocks epiboly progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Solnica-Krezel, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into why embryos treated with excessive sphingosine or with sphingosine kinase inhibitors fail to complete epiboly, we stained treated embryos to evaluate cytoskeletal markers associated with morphological defects.

Because MOs can have off-target or toxicity effects, the MO was titrated to define reagent amounts, e.g. 5 ng, having no effect following injection into wildtype embryos.

They may also be subject to off-targeting. Therefore, to more rigorously test whether Cers2b compensates for loss of Sphk2 to relieve excess sphingosine, we designed sgRNAs to target mutation of <italic>cers2b</italic>. We established a line of fish carrying a 23 bp deletion in exon6 of the <italic>cers2b</italic> gene that is predicted to delete most of the Lag domain and generate a frame-shift with a premature stop codon and a truncated protein that would lack enzymatic function. This mutant allele was tolerated for development and was crossed onto the background of the <italic>sphk2</italic> mutant, to raise <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup>; cers2b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> adult fish. When crossed to each other, the resulting clutches consistently had approximately 25% of the embryos that phenocopied the gastrulation defect caused by treating wildtype embryos with excess sphingosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These embryos rapidly perish, which precluded our ability to measure directly the ceramide levels or genotype the dying embryos. However, the genetic interaction of <italic>sphk2</italic> and <italic>cers2b</italic> is fully consistent with sphingosine-associated up-regulation and compensation from Cers2b. We note that the <italic>cers2b</italic> gene fails to be up-regulated in the <italic>sphk2</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and neither do these embryos show increased ceramide levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Likewise, wildtype embryos treated with sphingosine fail to activate expression of <italic>cers2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) or to significantly increase levels of total ceramides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We crossed <italic>sphk2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> females with either wildtype males or mutant null males, to compare the relative levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts or sphingosine.

However, we found the levels were not increased compared to the control cohort and neither were overall S1P levels depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Therefore, the data suggest that the increased sphingosine level associated with transcriptional activation of <italic>cers2b</italic> is dependent on the maternal loss of Sphk2 function, and neither wildtype embryos nor morphants are able to respond to increased sphingosine levels by up-regulation of the <italic>cers2b</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhanced <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter activity in <italic>Sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos compared to wildtype embryos</title><p>The strikingly higher <italic>cers2b</italic> transcript levels in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos suggest that this gene may have cis-regulatory elements that respond to sphingosine levels (sphingosine response elements). If true, these elements might confer promoter activity to a reporter gene, which like the endogenous gene should be more active in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos compared to wildtype embryos. The <italic>cers2b</italic> gene is located on chromosome 16, with a transcriptional start site approximately 1.7 kb downstream of the 3’ end of the adjacent <italic>celf3b</italic> gene. The putative promoter region of <italic>cers2b</italic>, including the entire 1680 bp non-coding region directly upstream of exon1 was isolated by PCR and cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. This construct was co-injected with RNA encoding a control <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase enzyme into fertilized eggs of wildtype or <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos. In three independent experiments using a total of 114 embryos of each genotype per experiment (n = 38 samples, each sample comprised from three embryos) the ratio between firefly luciferase to <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase (FL/RL) was 9-fold higher in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos compared to wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, p&lt;0.0001). We note that this difference was entirely attributable to the luciferase reporter, as the control RL levels were highly consistent in all experiments. To localize the sequences of the <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter that mediate this response, shorter promoter fragments were cloned into the reporter, progressively deleting 5’-upstream sequences, and compared for activity in wildtype and mutant embryos. The results of this study are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Deletion of the first 49 bp (1631 bp construct) decreased the enhanced responsiveness to 6-fold, while deletion of 83 bp (1597 bp construct) reduced it to a 2-fold difference. Deletion of the upsteam 400 bp (1281 bp construct) essentially eliminated promoter activity in both wildtype and mutant embryos. These results indicate that key regulatory regions conferring both promoter activity and enhanced response in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> mutant embryos are present in the 400 bp region at the 5’ end of the 1.7 kb promoter construct.

To demonstrate that this reflects cis-regions of the <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter, shorter promoter fragments containing progressively less upstream sequences were similarly compared. Much of the promoter activity was found to reside in the upstream 400 bp, and transfer of this sequence to a heterologous (minimal SV40) promoter was sufficient to transfer the response in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos. (<bold>B</bold>) Similar luciferase reporter assays were carried out in HEK293T mammalian cells. Ectopic expression of Cers2b caused a significant repression of the <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter-regulated reporter compared to empty expression vector control. This repression was relieved in cells treated with 10 mM sphingosine, which does not affect basal level of the reporter (empty vector +sphingosine).

An attractive candidate component of this sensing mechanism would be Cers2b itself, since it is the ideal protein for recognizing sphingosine and thereby might be differentially impacted depending on sphingosine levels. We were struck by the additional observation that many vertebrate ceramide synthase enzymes, including Cers2b, encode not only metabolic activity domains, but also a homeobox domain, typically found in homeobox class transcription factors. This raises the possibility that Cers2b, in addition to functioning to sense sphingosine levels, could potentially impact the transcriptional activity of its own or other genes.</p><p>To test if Cers2b can impact expression of its own promoter, the luciferase reporter under control of <italic>cers2b</italic> upstream sequences was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with an expression vector for Cers2b or a control empty expression vector, along with a control <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase expression vector to normalize for transfection efficiency and lysate preparation. Expression of Cers2b consistently and significantly decreased expression of the <italic>cers2b</italic>:luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that Cer2b can be a functional repressor of its own gene. Addition of 10 μM sphingosine to the transfected cells relieved this repressor activity so that the reporter was expressed at levels not significantly different from the control conditions without Cers2b. To test if this activity was dependent on the homeobox domain, a two amino acid mutation was introduced into the Cers2b coding sequence (R121W, R122S), which is predicted to impair the conserved structure of the homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis, 2001</xref>). Like addition of sphingosine, the RR121-122WS alteration eliminated the capacity for Cers2b to repress its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>We also generated by site-directed mutagenesis an isoform for Cers2b that is mutant in the Lag domain (HH212-213DD).

In this case, it would be expected that some fraction of the protein is localized in the nucleus to interact with its own promoter or other genes. We used confocal microscopy of HEK293T cells transfected with a vector to express a Cers2-GFP fusion protein, in order to visualize localization in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, Cers2-GFP protein is localized primarily to the ER, throughout the cell including contiguous to the nuclear membrane. Following exposure to 10 μM sphingosine, a condition that leads to de-repression of the reporter that is regulated by the <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter, there is a considerable change in the distribution of the fusion protein and notably enhanced signal associated with the nuclear membrane. There did not appear to be significant levels of the fusion protein in the nucleus either at steady state or following sphingosine exposure. We also compared expression levels of the protein by western blotting, following separation of nuclear and cytosolic extracts. In this case there was a marked enrichment for Cers2b in the nuclear fraction following exposure to sphingosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, when the nuclear fraction was further separated, we found that sphingosine induction caused Cers2b association primarily with nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), consistent with the confocal imaging. Therefore, we did not find evidence that Cers2 functions as a nuclear protein and while function as a transcription factor can’t be ruled out, it appears more likely that Cers2b impacts promoter activity by an indirect mechanism, perhaps acting at the nuclear membrane to process nuclear sphingosine.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21992.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The subcellular localization of Cers2 protein is altered by increased sphingosine levels.</title><p>HEK293T cells transfected with a Cers2-GFP expression plasmid were examined after 6 hr exposure to 10 uM sphingosine in culture.

It is less appreciated that regulation of sphingolipid metabolism may have additional receptor-independent functions equally critical for early developmental decisions such as cell proliferation, survival, and tissue morphogenesis. Previous studies confirmed that Sphk2 is an enzyme required to generate S1P used during early embryogenesis in an S1P receptor-dependent manner to regulate endoderm convergence and heart tube formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hisano et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendelson et al., 2015</xref>). Here we confirmed that <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> mutant embryos are depleted of S1P, but we also found additional previously unrecognized phenotypes that result from dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Importantly, the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenotype revealed a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which sphingolipid metabolism is achieved at the level of ceramide production.</p><p>The <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> mutant embryos have increased sphingosine levels due to the failure to convert this substrate to S1P. These embryos are developmentally delayed during gastrulation, although they eventually recover and can complete epiboly. This delay can be phenocopied in wildtype embryos by culturing in the presence of excess sphingosine, suggesting that the two observations are linked. Even with the increased sphingosine levels, the mutant embryos are nevertheless relatively resistant to toxicity caused by excess sphingosine. This indicates that they have engaged an alternative program to convert sphingosine to a non-toxic metabolite. The mutant embryos express strikingly high levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts, strong evidence for this anticipated salvage pathway for sphingosine turnover. Knockdown and genetic interaction experiments suggest that transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>cers2b</italic> is important for mutant embryos to complete epiboly. Finally, <italic>cers2b</italic> promoter activity can be transferred to an independent reporter gene, functioning in cis to promote higher expression levels in <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos compared to wildtype embryos. Upstream sequences confer sphingosine responsivity, located within a 400 bp region. Cers2b protein itself can partially repress activity of this promoter, dependent on a HOX domain but independent of enzymatic activity, and this repression is relieved by addition of sphingosine. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the genome senses and modulates sphingosine levels during embryogenesis.</p><p>The reason that <italic>Sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos are delayed in epiboly is not known, but we speculate that it is caused by destabilization of the actin-microtubule cytoskeletal network due to accumulation of excess sphingosine. A similar delay is recapitulated in wildtype embryos treated with 3 μM sphingosine, while increasing this to 5 μM causes rupture of the epiblast associated with massive disorganization of actin and microtubule networks that are essential for ‘pulling’ the blastoderm around the yolk cell. Upregulation of <italic>cers2b</italic> in the mutant embryos manages to maintain sphingosine levels below this ‘catastrophic’ threshold, generating a phenotype similar to wildtype embryos treated with the 3 μM lower dose. A good candidate for mediating the connection to cytoskeleton is the p21-activated kinase Pak1. Pak kinases can localize to cortical actin structures, and expression of activated mutants induces cytoskeletal reorganization, including loss of actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manser et al., 1997</xref>). Pak1 signaling is also implicated during epiboly in sustaining E-cadherin at adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tay et al., 2010</xref>), which also fails in the sphingosine-treated embryos. Interestingly, sphingosine was shown previously to activate PAK1 in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bokoch et al., 1998</xref>). The dramatic blastoderm constriction phenotype is remarkably similar to the maternal-zygotic <italic>betty boop</italic> (<italic>bbp</italic>) mutant embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holloway et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that it could also involve defects in a p38/MAPKAPK2 pathway. Although S1P<sub>2</sub> couples through Gα<sub>13</sub> to control cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ye and Lin, 2013</xref>), and Gα<sub>13</sub> signaling plays an important role in epiboly progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Solnica-Krezel, 2006</xref>), the receptor-dependent pathway seems less likely to be involved, since similar phenotypes are not observed in embryos lacking S1P receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hisano et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, it has long been recognized that while Sphk1 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm, Sphk2 is mostly a nuclear protein, and may be particularly important for regulating nuclear sphingosine levels, which could impact DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Igarashi et al., 2003</xref>) or oxidative stress otherwise leading to DNA damage and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Brocklyn and Williams, 2012</xref>). We note that <italic>sphk2</italic> is expressed as a maternal transcript, and this is also true of <italic>cers2b</italic> in the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> mutant embryos. This suggests that the genome might be especially vigilant at limiting nuclear sphingosine levels during oogenesis in order to protect genomic integrity. In this context, it is of interest to note previous studies where sphingolipids, particularly S1P, were shown to protect oocytes from apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress or chemotherapy in mice and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morita et al., 2000</xref>). S1P treatment in vitro was shown to induce oocyte survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hannoun et al., 2010</xref>), and acid ceramidase is known to modulate oocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eliyahu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, our findings could have practical implications in reproductive sciences and in vitro fertilization technology.</p><p>It is interesting that Cers2b contains a homeobox domain, required for repressing transcriptional activity of its own promoter. This leads to a model whereby under conditions with limiting sphingosine levels the Cers2b enzyme functions to repress its own gene and thereby limit sphingosine conversion to ceramide (perhaps also favoring conversion to S1P). If sphingosine levels exceed a certain threshold, for example by loss of Sphk2 activity and/or increased ceramidase activity, this is recognized by binding of sphingosine to the Lag domain of Cers2b, which relieves Cers2b repression activity, perhaps through a conformational alteration, and activates enzymatic activity to remove sphingosine by metabolism to ceramide. Currently we can’t rule out post-transcriptional regulation of the <italic>cers2b</italic> gene in response to increased sphingosine levels. However, we note that the <italic>cers2b</italic> transcript levels are markedly enhanced, at levels that are recapitulated by the promoter using a luciferase reporter with no shared RNA sequences. Furthermore, the increase is highly specific to the <italic>cers2b</italic> transcript.</p><p>15 years ago Venkataraman and Futerman speculated whether the presence of a homeobox domain suggests that the enzymes might act as dual sphingosine sensors and transcriptional regulators, analogous to how sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) senses and modulates sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Venkataraman and Futerman, 2002</xref>). Consistent with our results, overexpressing mammalian Cers2 in HT29 colon cancer cells caused a modest but significant reduction in transcription of a reporter gene regulated by an acid ceramidase promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tirodkar et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that Cers2 might have additional pathway-relevant targets. The single <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cers ortholog, Schlank, also has a homeodomain, in addition to the Lag motif. Interestingly, <italic>schlank</italic> mutants could be rescued by expression of variant proteins lacking a functional Lag motif, as long as they contained the homeodomain and a nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>). While the mechanism for Cers2b action during zebrafish embryogenesis remains unclear, our results suggest the critical role played by this ER/nuclear membrane-localized enzyme is in autoregulation of sphingolipid metabolism.</p><p>Our data provide new evidence for a role of ceramide synthase in vertebrate embryonic development, but the concept of a dual role in metabolism and transcription has been considered previously. In fact, together with our observations, it seems likely that Cers2b may play a central role in coordinating a response following sensing of sphingosine levels to the transcriptional machinery in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism.</p><p>Our observation linking Cers2b to genomic sensing/transcription was only made possible by close examination of subtle phenotypes in the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> mutant embryo. The identical phenotype caused by excess sphingosine in wildtype embryos (pinching off of the blastoderm during epiboly and embryonic lethality) was also seen in <italic>sphk2</italic> morphants. This suggests that mutants (but not morphants or wildtype embryos treated with sphingosine) are able to recognize the defect and have time to take corrective action through engaging the salvage Cers2 pathway. The process apparently occurs during oogenesis, since it involves the expression of maternal transcripts. The capacity of zebrafish embryos to compensate for mutant genes may be relatively robust (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>]), and at least partially responsible for the reported disparity between mutant and morphant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kok et al., 2015</xref>). It can also be fortuitous for revealing novel biological regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Maintenance of zebrafish</title><p>Wildtype (AB/TU hybrid) and mutant zebrafish were maintained at 28.5C and staged as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>Sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> were generated (<italic>sphk2<sup>wcm2</sup></italic>) and characterized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendelson et al., 2015</xref>).

Since the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos have elevated sphingosine levels, this suggested the possibility of a sphingosine-responsive element controlling the expression of Cers2, which could lower toxic sphingosine by catalyzing its conversion to ceramide. A sphingosine responsive element was subsequently defined in the Cers2 promoter. Intriguingly Cers2 itself was shown to was repress Cers2 promoter activity, leading to the suggestion the Cers2 functions as a transcription factor that feeds back to down regulate its own expression, an entirely novel mechanism for regulating sphingolipid metabolism.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Cers2 is a multi-pass membrane protein that resides in the ER. For it to function as a transcription factor, Cers2 or a fragment therein would have to move to the nucleus in order to bind to its promoter. Because of the novelty of Cers2 acting as a transcription factor and the alternative possibility described below, it is important to show that Cers2 enters the nucleus.</p><p>2) Another way that Cers2 could repress its own transcription is by lowering sphingosine levels through its intrinsic enzymatic activity, independent of an action as a transcription factor. Transfection of a catalytically dead mutant of Cers2 to see if it retains promoter repression activity could negate this possibility. Along a similar vein, the homeobox mutant (R121W, R122S) should be tested to see if it retains ceramide synthase activity.</p><p>3) Do zygotic <italic>sphk2</italic> mutants show higher levels of sphingosine and higher levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts (like the maternal-zygotic mutants)?</p><p>4) Are the effects of sphingosine on <italic>cers2b</italic> solely at the level of transcription? What about mRNA stability and/or translation?</p><p>5) Determine the levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts and ceramide in <italic>sphk2</italic> morphants as well as in wt embryos treated with sphingosine.</p><p>6) What are the comparative levels of Sph and ceramides in the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> with and without the <italic>cers2b</italic> MO?</p><p>7) The extent of epiboly of EVL and Deep cells needs to be presented somehow, either as% progression or distance from the pole.

They also suggest that this is due to upregulation of <italic>cers2b</italic> during oogenesis. This needs to be demonstrated on the eggs squeezed from <italic>sphk2</italic> mutant females. Ceramide levels in oocytes should also be measured.

Because of the novelty of Cers2 acting as a transcription factor and the alternative possibility described below, it is important to show that Cers2 enters the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point and in response we carried out a number of experiments to investigate the cellular localization of Cers2, both at steady state and following exposure of cells to sphingosine. First, we used confocal microscopy of HEK293T cells transfected with a vector to express a Cers2-GFP fusion protein, which allowed us to visualize localization in live cells. As expected, this protein is localized primarily to the ER, throughout the cell including contiguous to the nuclear membrane. Following exposure to 10 μM sphingosine, a condition that leads to de-repression of the reporter that is regulated by the Cers2 promoter, there is indeed a considerable change in the distribution of the fusion protein and enhanced signal associated with the nuclear membrane. Whether this includes nuclear translocation of the fusion protein was not convincingly seen, but there did not appear to be a substantial incorporation into the nucleus. Second, we also compared expression levels of the protein by western blotting, following separation of nuclear and cystosolic extracts. In this case we found a marked enrichment for Cers2 in the nuclear fraction. However, when the extracts were further separated, we could show that within the nuclear fraction, the sphingosine induction caused Cers2 association primarily with nuclear membranes. Representative data from these experiments are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In summary we did not find strong evidence that Cers2 functions as a nuclear protein and while it can’t be ruled out, we think it’s more likely to impact promoter activity by an indirect mechanism rather than as a nuclear transcription factor. Alternatively, modification of the Cers2b protein after sphingosine treatment (for example, proteolysis and release of an active fragment) cannot be determined as yet due to lack of appropriate antibodies. This will be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another way that Cers2 could repress its own transcription is by lowering sphingosine levels through its intrinsic enzymatic activity, independent of an action as a transcription factor. Transfection of a catalytically dead mutant of Cers2 to see if it retains promoter repression activity could negate this possibility. Along a similar vein, the homeobox mutant (R121W, R122S) should be tested to see if it retains ceramide synthase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we generated by site-directed mutagenesis, isoforms for Cers2b that are mutant in the Lag domain (HH212-213DD) that is predicted to be enzymatically dead, and compared the effect of this protein and the protein with a mutant HOX domain for Cers2 promoter regulation as well as regulation of ceramide levels. As shown in new panels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the Lag-mutant protein retains the ability to repress the reporter controlled by the Cers2b-promoter, yet fails to generate ceramide above background levels. In contrast, the HOX mutant protein retains the ability, equivalent to the wildtype protein, to increase ceramide levels, but is unable to repress activity of the promoter. Therefore, the HOX domain is required for Cers2 gene regulation, but independent of enzymatic function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do zygotic sphk2 mutants show higher levels of sphingosine and higher levels of cers2b transcripts (like the maternal-zygotic mutants)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a challenging question to answer directly, because zygotic mutants are not identified by phenotype during early embryogenesis including the stages we evaluated in maternal-zygotic mutants. However, we could cross heterozygous females with either wildtype males or mutant males, to compare the relative levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts or sphingosine. In the former case, the embryos are 50% heterozygous and 50% wildtype (none are null), while in the latter case 50% of the embryos are zygotic null (and the other 50% heterozygous). If the zygotic null mutants were similar to MZ mutants, we would expect to easily measure half the levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts or increased sphingosine seen in the MZ mutants. However, we found the levels were not increased compared to the control cohort. Neither were overall S1P levels depleted. Therefore, the increased sphingosine levels associated with transcriptional activation of <italic>cers2b</italic> is dependent on the maternal-zygotic loss of <italic>sphk2</italic> (or in fact, as discussed below, maternal loss in oocytes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are the effects of sphingosine on cers2b solely at the level of transcription? What about mRNA stability and/or translation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a possibility that we are not able to rule out, and have indicated so in the revised text (Discussion, fifth paragraph). However, we note that the <italic>cers2b</italic> transcript levels are markedly enhanced, at levels that are remarkably recapitulated by the promoter using a luciferase reporter with no shared RNA sequences. Furthermore, the increase is highly specific to the Cers2b transcript. These two observations make it unlikely that mRNA stability plays a major role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Determine the levels of cers2b transcripts and ceramide in sphk2 morphants as well as in wt embryos treated with sphingosine.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we compared <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts and ceramide levels in the <italic>sphk2</italic> morphants. As shown in new panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>cers2b</italic> fails to be up-regulated in the morphants, and neither do these embryos show increased ceramide levels. This suggests that the morphants are hypo-morphs for loss of S1P, and only in the mutant is the loss sufficient to cause sphingosine levels to rise and trigger the expression of <italic>cers2b</italic>. Alternatively, the activation of <italic>cers2b</italic> may be restricted to stages of oogenesis. Likewise, wildtype embryos treated with sphingosine fail to significantly increase levels of total ceramide and do not activate expression of <italic>cers2b</italic>. We also generated germline-transmitting mutants of <italic>cers2b</italic>, and found evidence that embryos maternal-zygotic for <italic>sphk2</italic> are now sensitive for loss of <italic>cers2b</italic>. In summary, the ability of embryos to activate <italic>cers2b</italic> expression is dependent on maternal-zygotic loss of <italic>sphk2</italic>, associated with enhanced levels of sphingosine, and <italic>cers2b</italic> is required under this condition to rescue gastrulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What are the comparative levels of Sph and ceramides in the sphk2<sup>MZ</sup> with and without the cers2b MO?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos are depleted of S1P, and have elevated levels of sphingosine and total ceramides. Knockdown of Cers2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was sufficient to cause a gastrulation defect that phenocopies the defect associated with excess sphingosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the morphant phenotype is not fully penetrant and we acknowledge that morphant knockdowns may be partial, transient, and subject to off-targets. Therefore, to more rigorously test whether Cers2b compensates for loss of Sphk2 to relieve excess sphingosine, we designed a sgRNA to target mutation of <italic>cers2b</italic>. We established a line of fish carrying a 23 bp deletion in exon6 of the <italic>cers2b</italic> gene that is predicted to delete most of the Lag domain and generate a frame-shift with a premature stop codon that would lack enzymatic function. This mutant allele is tolerated and was crossed onto the background of the <italic>sphk2</italic> mutant, to raise <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup>; cers2b+/-</italic> adult fish. When crossed to each other, the resulting clutches consistently showed ~25% of the embryos phenocopied the gastrulation defect caused by treating wildtype embryos with excess sphingosine. These embryos very quickly perish, which precluded our ability to measure directly the ceramide levels. However, the genetic interaction of <italic>sphk2</italic> and <italic>cers2b</italic> is fully consistent with sphingosine-associated up-regulation and compensation from Cers2b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The extent of epiboly of EVL and Deep cells needs to be presented somehow, either as% progression or distance from the pole. Use of phalloidin staining could help demarcate these borders for measuring.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we made measurements and indicate the percent of epiboly progression for representative embryos directly on the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We also note in the text (subsection “Epiboly defects caused by excess sphingosine are associated with a disturbed cytoskeleton”), the apparent loss of coordination for EVL and Deep cell attachment, as seen in panels J and K where the deep cells move independently of the EVL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors conclude (quite reasonably) that the sphk2<sup>MZ</sup> mutants initiate a mechanism to reduce Sph levels during oogenesis, and this is protective. They also suggest that this is due to upregulation of cers2b during oogenesis. This needs to be demonstrated on the eggs squeezed from sphk2 mutant females. Ceramide levels in oocytes should also be measured. Are maternal sphk2 mutants also protected from exogenous Sph, as sphk2<sup>MZ</sup> mutants are?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we carried out in situ hybridization experiments using oocytes from <italic>sphk2</italic> mutant females. These experiments show strikingly higher levels of <italic>cers2b</italic> transcripts in the mutant oocytes. Similar to the <italic>sphk2<sup>MZ</sup></italic> embryos, oocytes isolated from <italic>sphK2</italic> null female fish do not have measurable S1P, and display a commensurate accumulation of sphingosine. In this case, total ceramide levels are not significantly different from wildtype oocytes. Early embryos derived from a <italic>sphk2</italic> null female are resistant to rupture when exposed to exogenous sphingosine, despite a functional <italic>sphk2</italic> allele inherited from the wildtype male. All of these data are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and are fully consistent with a sphingosine-induced Cers2b-based protective mechanism generated during oogenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
