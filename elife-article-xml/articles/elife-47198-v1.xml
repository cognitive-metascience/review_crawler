We identified loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in anti-Müllerian hormone (<italic>AMH</italic>) and its receptor, <italic>AMHR2</italic>, in 3% of CHH probands using whole-exome sequencing. We showed that during embryonic development, AMH is expressed in migratory GnRH neurons in both mouse and human fetuses and unconvered a novel function of AMH as a pro-motility factor for GnRH neurons. Pathohistological analysis of <italic>Amhr2</italic>-deficient mice showed abnormal development of the peripheral olfactory system and defective embryonic migration of the neuroendocrine GnRH cells to the basal forebrain, which results in reduced fertility in adults. Our findings highlight a novel role for AMH in the development and function of GnRH neurons and indicate that AMH signaling insufficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of CHH in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>AMH</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>Kallmann's syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE12-0015-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giacobini</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2016-CoG 725149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giacobini</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTQ2017-87889-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alonso-Cotchico</surname><given-names>Lur</given-names></name><name><surname>Masgrau</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Maréchal</surname><given-names>Jean-Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTQ2017-83745-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alonso-Cotchico</surname><given-names>Lur</given-names></name><name><surname>Masgrau</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Maréchal</surname><given-names>Jean-Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imbernon</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002809</institution-id><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017SGR1323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alonso-Cotchico</surname><given-names>Lur</given-names></name><name><surname>Maréchal</surname><given-names>Jean-Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mouse in vivo and in vitro analysis and human genetic screening highlight the role of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) signaling in GnRH neuronal development and function, and identify mutations in AMH and AMHR2 in CHH patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential for puberty onset and reproduction. GnRH is released into the pituitary portal blood vessels for delivery to the anterior pituitary. There, GnRH controls the production and release of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), which in turn stimulate gametogenesis and sex steroid production in the gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christian and Moenter, 2010</xref>). GnRH–secreting neurons are unusual neuroendocrine cells, as they originate in the nasal placode outside the central nervous system during embryonic development, and migrate to the hypothalamus along the vomeronasal and terminal nerves (VNN, TN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</xref>). This process is evolutionarily conserved and follows a similar spatio-temporal pattern in all mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</xref>), including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casoni et al., 2016</xref>). Disruption of GnRH neuronal migration and/or defective GnRH synthesis and secretion leads to congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadisms (CHH), a rare endocrine disorder (prevalence: 1 in 4000) characterized by absent or incomplete puberty resulting in infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>). CHH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous with several causal genes identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>), and follows various modes of transmission, including oligogenic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sykiotis et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mutations identified so far only account for half of clinically reported cases, suggesting that other causal genes remain to be discovered. Unravelling new genetic pathways involved in the regulation of the development of the GnRH system is relevant for understanding the basis of pathogenesis leading to CHH in humans.</p><p>AMH is a TGF-β family member and it signals by binding to a specific type II receptor (AMHR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">di Clemente et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baarends et al., 1994</xref>), which heterodimerizes with one of several type I TGF-β receptors (Acvr1 [Alk2], Bmpr1a [Alk3] and Bmpr1b [Alk6]), to recruit Smad proteins that subsequently undergo nuclear translocation to regulate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Josso and Clemente, 2003</xref>). Although AMH signaling has been traditionally reported to play a crucial role during sex differentiation and gonadal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Josso et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behringer et al., 1994</xref>), accumulating evidence has started to shed light on unexpected functions of AMH in the central nervous system as well as in the pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lebeurrier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrel et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that GnRH neurons express AMHR2 from early fetal development to adulthood and that AMH stimulates GnRH neuronal activity and hormone secretion in mature GnRH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we expand this information by demonstrating that GnRH cells also express AMH during their migratory process, both in mice and human fetuses and we describe a novel role of AMH as a potent stimulator of GnRH cell motility. Finally, we show that pharmacological or genetic invalidation of Amhr2 signaling in vivo alters GnRH migration and the projections of VNN/TN to the basal forebrain, which results in a reduced size of this neuronal population in adult brains, altered ovulation and fertility. The involvement of the AMH signaling pathway in GnRH ontogeny and secretion led to the identification of four heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AMH</italic> and <italic>AMHR2</italic> among 136 CHH patients. Collectively, this study identified a novel embryonic role of AMH in the development and function of GnRH neurons and provides genetic evidence that disturbance of AMH signaling can contribute to CHH phenotype in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amh is expressed by GnRH migratory cells in mouse and human fetuses</title><p>We have recently shown that migratory GnRH neurons and developing vomeronasal/olfactory axons express Amhr2 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>).

AMH overexpression (<italic>AMH</italic> WT) in GN11 cells significantly increased cell migration by 50% when compared with mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). The AMH-dependent induction of cell motility was prevented when the cells where transfected with the mutants identified in KS patients (p.Pro151Ser and p.Asp238Glu) as well as with the mutant found in a nCHH proband (p.Thr99Ser; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, since the latter <italic>AMH</italic> mutation was found in a male nCHH proband (LH 2.7 U/l; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and because we previously showed that AMH stimulates GnRH and LH secretion in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>), we wondered whether this mutant could also negatively impact on GnRH secretion. In order to assess that we used GT1-7 cells that express Amh type-I and type-II receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and that display significant GnRH secretory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mellon et al., 1990</xref>). GT1-7 cells were transfected with either <italic>AMH</italic> WT or p.Thr99Ser <italic>AMH</italic> and conditioned medium was collected 48 hr later for GnRH ELISA measurement. The p.Thr99Ser <italic>AMH</italic> variant significantly reduced GnRH secretion as compared to GT1-7 cells expressing the <italic>AMH</italic> WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>To functionally test the impact of the <italic>AMHR2</italic> deletion (p.Gly445_Leu453del) and determine whether this variant leads to defective AMH-induced motility, we transfected GN11 cells with a plasmid encoding the h<italic>AMHR2</italic> WT or the <italic>AMHR2</italic> p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant and performed migration assays culturing the cells with SFM alone or supplemented with recombinant human AMH protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Consistent with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, AMH treatment significantly increased cell migration of <italic>AMHR2</italic> WT-transfected cells as compared with SFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). This effect was significantly impaired when GN11 cells were transfected with the <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutant plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Since the <italic>AMHR2</italic> p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant was found in a female nCHH proband (LH &lt;2.0 U/l; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; human case summaries in Materials and methods), we also assessed whether AMH treatment increased GnRH release in GT1-7 cells expressing either <italic>AMHR2</italic> WT or the p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). These experiments revealed that AMH (50 ng/ml) stimulates GnRH secretion into medium of GnRH cells expressing the <italic>AMHR2</italic> WT, whereas introduction of the <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutant variant into GT1-7 cells significantly reduced the AMH-dependent GnRH secretion as compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to evaluate the structural impact of the AMHR2 deletion (p.Gly445_Leu453del), a three-dimensional structural model of the corresponding mutated catalytic intracellular serine/threonine domain of the receptor was generated (DEL), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belville et al., 2009</xref>). The model of the WT AMHR2 kinase domain presents a general fold of a two-domain kinase, with an N-lobe mainly composed of a five-stranded β-sheet and a mostly α-helical C-lobe. The deleted residues are located at the top of the C-lobe and are part of the αG helix and its preceding loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). In both WT and DEL, the overall protein structure remains stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the interactions established in this zone reveals differences between the <italic>AMHR2</italic>-WT and the <italic>AMHR2</italic> p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant models. In the WT model, the structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving Leu444, Leu456 and Leu453, as well as by the hydrogen bonds Arg462-Glu443, Arg463-Tyr440 and Gln446-Glu441. For the <italic>AMHR2</italic> p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant model, the structure is stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds: Arg462-Glu443, Arg462-Glu460 and Arg463-Tyr440 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The main structural fluctuations are observed in the loop regions of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g–i</xref>). Comparison of <italic>AMHR2</italic> WT and <italic>AMHR2</italic> p.Gly445_Leu453del mutant simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g–i</xref>) suggests there may be some differences in the dynamic behavior of some of these flexible regions, including the kinase activation loop. In summary, although <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutant tertiary structure is expected to be folded in a similar manner to that of the WT species, it is possible that the deletion results in some alterations in the intracellular signaling.</p><p>Taken together, these in vitro results confirm that the identified AMH and AMHR2 mutants are loss-of-function, supporting the role of AMH/AMHR2 signaling in GnRH neuronal migration and GnRH secretion and thus pointing toward a potential contribution of these variants to the pathogenesis of CHH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Originally identified in the mesenchyme of Müllerian ducts and in gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Josso et al., 1998</xref>), Amh and Amhr2 were subsequently documented in several other organs, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lebeurrier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and the pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrel et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that Amh biological effects could be much broader than initially thought.</p><p>We recently reported Amhr2 expression in migratory GnRH neurons and along olfactory axons, both in mice and human fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we showed that GnRH neurons express Amh during fetal development and that this expression is retained both in rodents and humans. Our in vivo and in vitro analyses show that Amh signaling regulates migration of GnRH neurons toward the brain through an autocrine mechanism. This is strongly supported by our in vivo and in vitro data showing Amh expression in GnRH neurons and by the reduction in cell motility detected in GN11 cells when transfected with the h<italic>AMH</italic> CHH variants. Moreover, in this study, we showed that Amh acts as a promotility factor for GnRH neurons by signaling via Amhr2/Bmpr1b and activation of the MAPK pathway.</p><p>The animal experiments revealed that both acute neutralization of Amhr2 and genetic invalidation of this receptor lead to a strong accumulation of GnRH cells in the nasal region with defects in both the olfactory targeting to the OBs and alterations in the intracranial projections of the VNN/TN; defects that strongly resemble the phenotype previously described in histological analyses of KS human fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira et al., 2010</xref>). Since Amh is only produced by GnRH neurons in the fetal brain and because the axonal scaffold of GnRH neurons express Amhr2, we hypothesize that Amh signaling contributes to the correct development of the ventral branch of the vomeronasal/terminal nerves in the brain through a paracrine mechanism. Mono-allelic inactivation of <italic>Amhr2</italic> in mice is not sufficient to significantly alter GnRH neuronal migration, as indicated by the normal number of GnRH neurons observed in adult <italic>Amhr2</italic> heterozygous brains. On the other hand, the presence of only one <italic>Amhr2</italic>-null allele is sufficient to trigger significant impairments of LH secretion, LH pulsatlity and fertility in adult female mice. In heterozygous males, only the number of litters/90 days was found to be significantly reduced as compared to <italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> males, suggesting that sexual behavior but not fecundity is likely altered in <italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> males.</p><p>Bi-allelic inactivation of <italic>Amhr2</italic> in mice results instead into a significant reduction of the GnRH cell population in the brains of adult <italic>Amhr2-</italic>null mice of both sexes as compared to wild-type animals. Since male and female homozygous adult animals showed a comparable GnRH cell loss, it is likely that the GnRH migratory defect observed in <italic>Amhr2</italic>-deficient embryos is independent of the genetic sex of the animals.</p><p>We speculate that Amh/Amhr2 signaling can regulate, respectively, GnRH migration, during embryonic development, and GnRH/LH secretion postnatally. The latter point is also supported by our in vitro experiments showing AMH-induced GnRH secretion in GT1-7 cells.</p><p>Homozygous <italic>Amhr2</italic> female mice have a more pronounced phenotype than heterozygous animals, as they combine developmental defects in GnRH migration with severely impaired ovulation and fertility in adulthood. This strong phenotype could be the consequence of a lack of a broad spectrum of actions of Amh at different prenatal and postnatal stages, impacting the GnRH neuronal migration and the GnRH secretion, respectively, or gonadotrope function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrel et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, since Amh is known to be expressed by granulosa cells in the ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vigier et al., 1984</xref>) and to regulate folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durlinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durlinger et al., 1999</xref>), it is likely that part of the reproductive phenotype of <italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is also due in part to the lack of ovarian Amh. Dissecting the specific contribution of ovarian versus cerebral Amh in the control of fertility would only be possible using a neuronal specific knockout of <italic>Amhr2,</italic> which is not available yet. However, our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cimino et al., 2016</xref>) and current findings, showing that Amh directly increases GnRH and LH secretion, support a role for Amh in the neuroendocrine regulation of fertility in physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p>Our study identified heterozygous mutations in CHH probands that affect highly conserved amino acids of AMH or its exclusive binding receptor, AMHR2. The AMH mutants display defects in AMH release. Since the described proAMH cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mamsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pankhurst and McLennan, 2013</xref>) are not located in close proximity of these mutations, it is unlikely that they impinge on the cleavage of the proAMH. The decreased AMH secretion might rather result from altered protein trafficking leading to accumulation of the mutants AMH in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and defective release. The AMH mutants identified in KS probands also significantly reduced GN11 migration compared to the wild-type AMH. Interestingly, the p.Thr99Ser <italic>AMH</italic> mutation found in a nCHH proband compromises both GnRH cell motility in GN11 cells as well as GnRH secretion in GT1-7 cells. It is plausible that AMH mutants cause dominant negative effects by forming heterodimers with wild-type AMH, thus reducing AMHR2 activation and the downstream biological response. Finally, the AMHR2 p.Gly445_Leu453del mutation identified in a female nCHH proband was also loss-of-function in in vitro migration and GnRH secretion assays.</p><p>The heterozygous mutations in <italic>AMH</italic> and <italic>AMHR2</italic> are found in 3% of CHH probands in our cohort (4 out of 136). This is consistent with the genetic landscape of CHH as the majority of known CHH genes have a low mutational prevalence (&lt;5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>). Variable expressivity was observed in family members carrying the same mutation, consistent with the fact that CHH represents the more severe end of a large spectrum of manifestations. This is a common theme in the genetics of CHH, and factors such as digenic/oligogenic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sykiotis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pitteloud et al., 2007</xref>), epigenetic regulation or non-genetic contributions likely play important roles. As the current study is limited by the small number of probands harboring <italic>AMH</italic> and <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutations, confirmation in larger CHH cohorts will be necessary to establish the specific contributions of these two genes in the pathogenesis of CHH.</p><p>Notably, homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AMH</italic> (OMIM: 600957) or <italic>AMHR2</italic> (OMIM: 600956) cause PMDS in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imbeaud et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mishina et al., 1996</xref>). PMDS is characterized by the retention of Müllerian duct derivatives (the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper part of the vagina) in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Josso and Clemente, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behringer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mishina et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belville et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belville et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orvis et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, we identified two mutations (AMH p.Pro151Ser and AMHR2 p.Gly445_Leu453del) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picard et al., 2017</xref>) in our CHH cohort previously associated with autosomal recessive PMDS. MRI or pelvic ultrasounds were performed in the two male CHH patients harboring <italic>AMH</italic> mutations, including the patient carrying the p.Pro151Ser. No defects in the internal genitalia were identified, consistent with the fact that monoallelic defects in <italic>AMH</italic> or <italic>AMHR2</italic> do not cause PMDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picard et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, parents of PMDS probands carrying heterozygote <italic>AMH</italic> or <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutations are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Picard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Josso et al., 2005</xref>); however, detailed reproductive and olfactory phenotyping in these parents have not been reported. Furthermore, there are few studies examining the hormonal profile of patients with PMDS although spontaneous puberty is reported based on clinical observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Josso et al., 2005</xref>). To assess pubertal and reproductive defects in PMDS patients or family members, detailed reproductive phenotyping will be necessary.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate the pleiotropic roles of <italic>AMH</italic> and <italic>AMHR2</italic> in shaping internal genitalia and GnRH neuron migration. Different mechanistic actions of the mutants (i.e. recessive vs. dominant negative vs. haploinsufficiency) in combination with tissue-specific signaling pathway might guide the final phenotype.</p><p><italic>AMH</italic> and <italic>AMHR2</italic> mutations affecting GN11 cell motility were found in both KS and nCHH individuals. We thus speculate that GnRH migratory defects could also occur in some cases of nCHH. This hypothesis challenges the current dogma, whereby defects in GnRH cell migration lead to KS and not nCHH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, increasing genetic evidence indicates that CHH genes do not segregate into 2 (i.e. KS and nCHH) but rather three categories: 1) KS only, 2) nCHH only and 3) both KS and nCHH. The latter includes genes involved in GnRH neuron migration such as <italic>FGFR1</italic>, <italic>SEMA7A</italic>, <italic>AXL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>). We recently showed that GnRH neurons in human fetuses migrate into the brain in tight associations with vomeronasal and terminal nerves and not olfactory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casoni et al., 2016</xref>). Another recent study demonstrated that correct development of the OBs and axonal connection to the forebrain are not required for GnRH neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taroc et al., 2017</xref>), thus implying a stronger contribution of the vomeronasal/terminal nerve as a scaffold for the GnRH migration. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the vomeronasal and the terminal nerve play important roles in the ontogenesis and migration of GnRH neurons in vertebrates, and raises the intriguing possibility that some genetic forms of nCHH might be due to defective central projections of the vomeronasal/terminal nerves leading to subsequent alterations of the GnRH migratory process.</p><p>In

Heads from the embryos were washed thoroughly in cold 0.01M PBS, fixed in fixative solution [4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 0.01M PBS, pH 7.4] for 6–8 hr at 4°C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C. The following day, heads were embedded in OCT embedding medium (Tissue-Tek, Torrence, CA), frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C until sectioning. The embryo heads were coronally cryosectioned (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar Germany) at 16 μm intervals directly onto slides and stored at −80°C until use. Adult mice were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg of ketamine-HCl and 8 mg/kg xylazine-HCl and transcardially perfused with 40 ml of saline, followed by 100 ml of 4% PFA, pH 7.4.

Timed-pregnant mice (<italic>n</italic> = 2) carrying E12.5 embryos were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the uterine horns were gently placed outside the abdominal cavity and constantly hydrated with 35°C sterile saline. Using a Nanofil syringe and a 35 GA needle attachment (World Precision Instruments), 2 μl containing 0.4 μg of Amhr2 Neutralizing Antibody (Amhr2-NA, 1:200, R and D system, AF1618) and Fluorogold tracer 1:1500 (Sigma Aldrich, #39286) diluted in saline was injected intra-utero in the olfactory placode of each embryo of one uterine horn. In order to consistently obtain control and Amhr2-NA treated embryos from the same pregnant animals and limit biases associated with the staging of the embryonic development, the embryos of the contralateral horn were injected with saline and Fluorogold of both dams. The concentration of AMHR2-NA was determined based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. The uteri were gently returned and the mothers sutured and monitored for few days. Embryos were collected at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), fixed, cryoprotected, frozen and cut as described above (Immunofluorescence). Fluorogold was used in order to verify the specificity of the injection sites and only embryos confirmed as optimal hits (fluorogold fluorescence within the olfactory epithelium) were used for the GnRH quantitative analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 4 per treatment group, from two independent dams).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>GnRH cell counting</title><p>Serial sagittal sections (16 μm) from E14.5 WT embryos, (<italic>n</italic> = 4 per group) were prepared as described above.

Juvenile (P12) and adult female mice (3 months old) were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg of ketamine-HCl and 8 mg/kg xylazine-HCl before being sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Microdissections from embryonic nasal region and post-natal/adult hypothalamic preoptic region were enzymatically dissociated using Papain Dissociation System (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) to obtain single-cell suspensions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Messina et al., 2016</xref>). After dissociation, the cells were physically purified using a FACSAria III (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer equipped with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). The sort decision was based on measurements of GFP fluorescence (excitation: 488 nm, 50 mW; detection: GFP bandpass 530/30 nm, autofluorescence bandpass 695/40 nm) by comparing cell suspensions from GnRH-GFP and wild-type animals. For each animal, 500 GFP-positive cells were sorted directly into 8 μl extraction buffer: 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.4 U/μl RNaseOUT (Life Technologies).

Physical examination revealed partial but incomplete puberty (testicular volume 12 ml bilaterally, pubic hair Tanner IV) as well as eunuchoid proportions (arm span 184 cm for height of 176 cm). Targeted clinical exam detected slight hyperlaxity, high-arched palate and pectum excavatum.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carol F Elias (Reviewer #1); Markey McNutt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Malone et al. reported results showing a link between defective AMH signaling and defective embryonic migration of GnRH and abnormal development of projections to basal forebrain. The study by Malone and colleagues describes the identification of loss-of-function mutation in AMH and AMHR2 in 3% of congenital HH probands. Authors showed both AMH and AMHR2 are expressed in migratory GnRH neurons of mice and humans, suggesting a role in GnRH neuronal migration during development. They also performed functional studies in mice using mouse genetics, pharmacology and ex vivo explants in developing embryos, identified relevant signaling pathways using in vitro cell lines and used modeling to infer structural changes and pathological consequences. The manuscript provides novel information that will be of wide interest. As outlined below, the biggest criticism to be dealt with is regarding the over interpretation of the clinical genetic data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The overall data suggests a role for anti-müllerian hormone and its receptor in the migration of GnRH neurons in the mouse model shows hypogonadism when AMHR2 is disrupted. The conclusion from the paper is that the 3 variants identified in AMH and the single variant found in AMHR2 are pathogenic. However, the authors do not provide adequate explanation as to how they arrived at the classification of these variants.</p><p>Clinical variant interpretation is complex, and the widely excepted guidelines for interpretation were set forth by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics in PMID 25741868. Under these guidelines, all of the variants reported in this paper would be classified as variants of uncertain significance. All 4 pedigrees are small and there is not enough data to show appropriate disease segregation in any of the families.</p><p>Additionally, all of these variants have been identified in control populations and have significant frequencies relative to the known disease frequency in gnomAD. For example, the first variant in AMH (c.295A &gt;T) has an overall population frequency of 0.02%. By the Hardy-Weinberg equation, you would expect the heterozygous carrier frequency in the population to be about 0.04%. This is well above the reported disease frequency in the paper of 1 in 4000 (0.025%). Even if this were the only variant contributing to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism we would expect a much higher disease frequency in the population. This indicates that even if this were a pathogenic variant it would have very low penetrance. If any of these variants had a significant effect on the reproductive axis, they should be under strong negative selection and never reached such high population frequencies.</p><p>The data would be much more compelling with rare, de novo variants or in large families to establish clear segregation.</p><p>To really be compelling and provide sufficient evidence to classify these variants as likely pathogenic, second and third unrelated families with clear phenotypes and the same variants would need to be demonstrated. Based on the data from the mice and embryology, it certainly seems reasonable that AMH could be involved in Kallmann syndrome and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism in humans. However, there is not sufficient evidence presented in the paper to reach the conclusions that they have about the pathogenicity of the reported variants. I do feel this data should be published, but it should be done so with appropriately tempered interpretation of the clinical variants.</p><p>If published with the current data, the authors should rewrite the interpretation and state the limitations as clearly as they do for the mouse work. The statements of pathogenicity should be replaced with more guarded interpretation. The in vitro data suggests that the variants observed in the clinical cases are deleterious to protein function. However, additional studies will be needed to determine if they are truly pathogenic in humans. The frequency of the identified variants in control populations suggest that if these are pathogenic variants, they are low penetrance. This would be consistent with previous observations that genes associated with KS and IHH are of reduced penetrance and may represent digenic/oligogenic inheritance.</p><p>It is suggested that the authors present the clinical data, speculate that these are candidate genes, suggest follow-up experiments and replication in other cohorts, and delete their statements of over-interpretation of variant pathogenicity. If the clinical observation is true, given the frequency of this disease and high number of cases with no identified genetic cause, it should replicate in multiple other clinical cohorts. They will still be the first to report the possible role of these genes even they do not provide definitive evidence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47198.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The overall data suggests a role for anti-müllerian hormone and its receptor in the migration of GnRH neurons in the mouse model shows hypogonadism when AMHR2 is disrupted.

However, we do not feel these standards are applicable to the current manuscript, based on 3 critical statements within the published ACMG guidelines [1]:</p><p>“This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology…to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders.”</p><p>“It is not intended for the interpretation of somatic variation, pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants, or variants in genes associated with multigenic non-Mendelian complex disorders.”</p><p>“Care must be taken when applying these rules to candidate genes (“genes of uncertain significance” (GUS)) in the context of exome or genome studies … because this guidance is not intended to fulfil the needs of the research community in its effort to identify new genes in disease.”</p><p>We thus feel that applying these clinical standards within this research study would be inadvisable, especially given the high degree of oligogenicity observed in CHH [2-4]. However, it is interesting to note that the automated classification of these variants using InterVar (wintervar.wglab.org/) was initially “Uncertain Significance”. Adding the information from our in vitro or in vivo studies (ACMG category PS3), all 4 mutations would be classified as “Likely Pathogenic”.</p><p>However, we do agree with the reviewer that additional families and larger studies in CHH patients is needed in order to confirm the contribution of AMH and AMHR2 mutations in the pathophysiology of CHH. We have updated the Discussion to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All 4 pedigrees are small and there is not enough data to show appropriate disease segregation in any of the families.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have added this point to the Discussion that large-scale studies needed for further confirmation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, all of these variants have been identified in control populations and have significant frequencies relative to the known disease frequency in gnomAD.

However, CHH is not a strictly Mendelian disorder. Oligogenicity (i.e. mutations in more than one gene) is a well-known mode of inheritance in CHH, and the increased use of next-generation sequencing has uncovered increasing degrees of oligogenicity. Indeed, very few of the &gt;30 genes involved in CHH are highly penetrant and rare variants in these genes can found in the controls <bold><sup>4</sup></bold>. We have modified the Discussion to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>The data would be much more compelling with rare,</italic> de novo <italic>variants or in large families to establish clear segregation.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers, and have noted this point in the Discussion as follows: “This is a common theme in the genetics of CHH, and factors such as digenic/oligogenic inheritance, epigenetic regulation or non-genetic contributions likely play important roles. As the current study is limited by the small number of probands harboring AMH and AMHR2 mutations, confirmation in larger CHH cohorts will be necessary to establish the specific contributions of these two genes in the pathogenesis of CHH”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To really be compelling and provide sufficient evidence to classify these variants as likely pathogenic, second and third unrelated families with clear phenotypes and the same variants would need to be demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we do not feel that applying ACMG classification to these mutants is wise at this stage. However, we agree that having additional families harboring the same mutations would be optimal. But as is the case with many rare disorders, most mutations in other CHH genes are private.
