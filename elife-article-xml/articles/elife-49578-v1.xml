by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). To tune behavior according to day length, SCN neurons display unified rhythms with synchronous phasing when days are short, but will divide into two sub-clusters when days are long. The transition between SCN states is critical for maintaining behavioral responses to seasonal change, but the mechanisms regulating this form of neuroplasticity remain unclear. Here we identify that a switch in chloride transport and GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is critical for maintaining state plasticity in the SCN network. Further, we reveal that blocking excitatory GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling locks the SCN into its long day state. Collectively, these data demonstrate that plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling dictates how clock neurons interact to maintain environmental encoding. Further, this work highlights factors that may influence susceptibility to seasonal disorders in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49578.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In winter, as the days become shorter, millions of people find that their mood and energy levels start to drop. They crave carbohydrates, struggle with their weight, and find it harder to get out of bed in the mornings. These individuals are suffering from the ‘winter blues’ or seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and most find that their symptoms spontaneously improve in the spring when the days become longer again. Many also benefit from bright light therapy during the winter months, but not everyone responds fully to this treatment, so additional options are needed.</p><p>The winter blues occur when the brain adjusts to changes in day length with the onset of winter. The brain region responsible for making this adjustment is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is the master clock of the brain that coordinates the body’s circadian rhythms – the daily fluctuations in things like appetite, body temperature, sleep and wakefulness.</p><p>But as well as being the brain’s clock, the SCN is also the brain’s calendar. In winter, when the days are short, SCN neurons coordinate their activity and fire in synchrony. But in summer, when the days are long, SCN neurons divide into two clusters, which fire at different times. By transitioning between these two states, the SCN helps the body adjust to seasonal changes in day length. Rohr, Pancholi et al. now provide new insight into the mechanism behind this process by showing that light alters the neurochemistry of the SCN.</p><p>Exposing mice to long days causes a brain chemical called GABA to switch from inhibiting neurons in the SCN to activating them. Blocking this switch from inhibition to activation locks the SCN into its 'summer state'. Rohr, Pancholi et al. propose that this failure to transition to the winter state may be an interesting way to prevent the winter blues.</p><p>While much remains to be learned about this process, these findings pave the way for better understanding the neurobiology of winter depression and how best to treat it.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>suprachiasmatic nucleus</kwd><kwd>circadian clock network</kwd><kwd>coupling</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS091234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-12-65</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A seasonal switch to excitatory GABAA signaling dictates how daily clock neurons interact to encode environmental change.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Daily rhythms generated by the circadian system serve to anticipate changes in the environment caused by the Earth’s rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hut and Beersma, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pittendrigh, 1960</xref>). In mammals, the circadian system is a hierarchical collection of biological clocks orchestrated by a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). The SCN itself is a network of clock cells that interact with one another to regulate emergent circuit properties, process photic cues, and provide daily signals to downstream tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>). At the cellular level, SCN neurons display ca. 24 hr rhythms in electrical and molecular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>) generated by genetic feedback loops that control daily expression of clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhr and Takahashi, 2013</xref>) and the clock-controlled genes that regulate cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Although the circadian molecular clock drives cellular rhythms, intercellular interactions among SCN neurons synchronize, amplify, and stabilize rhythms of cells within the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the SCN adjusts to the environment, effectively matching the 24 hr period of the solar cycle, the phase of the local time zone, and the waveform of the prevailing day length as it changes over the year. Thus, the SCN network serves as both daily clock and annual calendar, and defining the circuit-level mechanisms by which SCN neurons interact is paramount for understanding the temporal regulation of behavior and physiology.</p><p>Seasonal changes in the environment threaten the survival and well being of organisms living on this planet. To cope with this challenge, many biological processes are modulated on a seasonal basis. Although daily timekeeping is a cellular property, seasonal encoding is accomplished via changes in the spatiotemporal relationships of SCN clock cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Gorman, 2016</xref>). When days are short, SCN neurons form a highly synchronized population of cellular clocks with similar times of daily protein expression and electrical activity. In contrast, when days are long, the SCN network switches to an alternate state characterized by two subclusters of clock neurons that cycle in anti-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inagaki et al., 2007</xref>). The ability of the SCN network to encode season is critical for the regulation of a large variety of biological processes, including reproduction, immune function, and metabolism. In humans, seasonality likewise influences a wide range of functions such as sleep, metabolism, and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garbazza and Benedetti, 2018</xref>), which can produce annually recurrent pathology in 3–10% of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewy et al., 2006</xref>). Although seasonal affective disorder is closely linked to photic modulation of circadian clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wirz-Justice, 2018</xref>), the mechanisms that regulate sensitivity to day length remain ill-defined.</p><p>GABA is the primary neurotransmitter expressed by SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>), and recent work indicates that day length modulates GABA signaling in the SCN network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>). Although GABA is typically classified as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is a heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channel permeable to chloride and bicarbonate that can elicit either hyperpolarization or depolarization depending on the electrochemical gradient of chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaila et al., 2014</xref>). In mature neurons, levels of intracellular chloride are regulated by the Cl<sup>-</sup> extruder KCC2 (K<sup>+</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter 2) and the Cl<sup>-</sup> importer NKCC1 (Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter 1). Changes in the relative expression and/or function of these two chloride co-transporters cause ionic plasticity: short- and long-term modulation that alters neuronal responses to GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaila et al., 2014</xref>). The most well documented example of this neuroplasticity occurs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rivera et al., 1999</xref>), when NKCC1 drives a depolarizing chloride reversal potential in immature neurons, but up-regulation of KCC2 causes a switch to the hyperpolarizing GABA response in adulthood. However, this process is not immutable; with downregulation of KCC2 in mature neurons causing a switch to excitatory GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in several distinct circuits in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hewitt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostroumov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkar et al., 2011</xref>). In the SCN, recent work has shown that exposure to long days increases the number of neurons that respond to GABA with depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>) and elevates intracellular chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myung et al., 2015</xref>). Further, alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling are associated with changes in circadian behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWoskin et al., 2015</xref>), and the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in coupling SCN neurons depends on seasonal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, this work suggests that GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in the SCN varies with day length, but it remains unclear how plasticity in GABA circuits regulates seasonal encoding by the master clock network.</p><p>Here we provide insight into the mechanisms and functional significance of seasonal plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in the SCN network. First, we show how changes in day length modulate molecular responses of the SCN clock to GABA stimulation. Next, we provide insight into mechanisms underlying seasonal plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling by demonstrating that long days decrease KCC2 expression in the specific SCN compartment that processes light. Lastly, we test the functional significance of photoperiodic changes in chloride transport and GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling for SCN network dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the seasonal switch in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling accelerates recovery of the SCN network back to its synchronous state. Through pharmacological interrogation, we define the regional locus of this neuroadaptation, identify consequences for network encoding, and shed new light on how this form of plasticity may modulate daily rhythms in behavior. Overall, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which seasonal adjustments in GABA<sub>A</sub> circuits of the master clock serve to maintain sensitivity to changes in day length.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long days modulate molecular responses of the SCN clock to GABA stimulation</title><p>To gain greater insight into the functional consequences of seasonal changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling, we first tested how day length modulates molecular responses of the SCN clock to GABA. Previous work has predicted that the seasonal switch to excitatory GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling will alter how the SCN clock is reset by tonic GABA stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWoskin et al., 2015</xref>). To test this prediction, we examined photoperiodic changes in GABA-induced resetting using PER2::LUC rhythms as a readout of the SCN molecular clock. mPer2<sup>Luc</sup> mice were exposed to either 12 hr of light per day (L12) or a long-day with 20 hr of light per day (L20) for at least 8 weeks. SCN slices were collected from mice housed under each photoperiod, and PER2::LUC rhythms were monitored for three cycles in vitro before treatment with either 200 μM GABA or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). GABA was not washed out following application to provide a tonic stimulus, and its concentration was stable in culture for at least 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>), the SCN clock shifted to a later phase when GABA was applied to L12 slices at the trough of the PER2::LUC rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, this resetting response was blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with a prior study demonstrating that GABA-induced resetting is mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling and not GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Next we examined whether long days altered SCN responses to GABA by measuring resetting responses at times spanning the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In L12 slices, GABA shifted the PER2::LUC rhythm in a phase-dependent manner, eliciting phase delays during early subjective night and phase advances during other times of the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Notably, the shape of this phase-resetting rhythm was similar to that reported previously for GABA-induced phase shifts of electrical rhythms in dissociated SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>). In L20 slices, GABA elicited phase delays for a larger proportion of the circadian cycle and produced phase advances at later times relative to L12 slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These results indicate that the waveform of the GABA-induced resetting rhythm is altered by photoperiod, as illustrated by either a phase response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or polar plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, long day exposure did not alter systematically the magnitude of resetting to this dose of GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which distinguishes it from photoperiodic suppression of NMDA- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and light-induced resetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pittendrigh et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">vanderLeest et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, these results confirm that the seasonal switch in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling modulates the intrinsic responses of the SCN molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the effect on waveform is of particular interest because this parameter often reflects changes in SCN organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pittendrigh et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">vanderLeest et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49578.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Long days alter SCN molecular responses to GABA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The phase response curve to GABA is altered by photoperiodic history.

To quantify the dynamic process of network recovery, we measured changes in the phase relationship of SCN shell and core neurons over time in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see Materials and methods). As predicted for a coupled oscillator system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansel et al., 1995</xref>), the magnitude and direction of the cellular responses depended on the core-shell relationship at the start of the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Specifically, the shell-core phase difference was reduced in the ‘negative’ direction when SCN core neurons phase-led SCN shell neurons by 2–6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas it was reduced in the opposite ‘positive’ direction when SCN core neurons phase-led SCN shell neurons by 8–16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Analysis of cellular period indicated that this coupling response is driven largely by changes in the cellular rhythms of SCN core neurons, which adopted a longer period when the network re-synchronized in the negative direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a shorter period when re-synchronization occurred in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similar to VU, BU, and CLP290, ACE increased L12 SCN period in a GABA<sub>A</sub>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). ACE also eliminated the period difference between SCN core and shell neurons in L12 SCN slices by specifically increasing the period of SCN shell neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with low KCC2/NKCC1 expression in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Given the ever-changing nature of the photic environment, there is a premium on maintaining plasticity of SCN encoding. Here we provide novel insight into seasonal encoding by revealing that the photoperiodic switch in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is necessary for restoring SCN function after it is disrupted by light. By examining dynamic changes in cellular synchrony, we have uncovered that plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is a critical neuroadaptation that modifies how SCN clock neurons communicate with one another to regulate circuit function in accordance with an ever-changing environment. This switch corresponds with KCC2 downregulation in the specific SCN compartment that receives and processes light input, which is the same region in L20 slices displaying altered cellular responses during pharmacological modulation of chloride transport and non-canonical GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling. Collectively, these results indicate that downregulation of KCC2 in this specific region is critical for network recovery after exposure to long days, and that this process is likely driven by mechanisms similar to those regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in other important networks controlling behavior.</p><p>Here we find that seasonal changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in the SCN network regulate the transition back to its synchronous state. In this manner, seasonal plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling may be viewed as a homeostatic mechanism because it acts to restore circuit function after it is perturbed by light. Homeostasis is not a term commonly employed in a circadian context, but its applicability to seasonal encoding is not without precedent. For instance, formal assays have shown that photoperiodic adjustments in behavior and physiology return to steady-state when the long day stimulus is removed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976a</xref>). Further, photoperiodic alterations in SCN cellular relationships return to steady-state after DD release in vivo and culture ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Homeostatic recalibration is critical for most biological systems, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood in many neural networks because circuit transitions are difficult to study in real-time. By tracking this dynamic process ex vivo, we first demonstrated an unexpected role for GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling in network recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Here we show this form of neuroplasticity requires non-canonical GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling by demonstrating that ACE locks the SCN network into its reorganized state by modulating the coupling response of SCN core neurons. Interestingly, our data suggest that non-canonical GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling also modulates SCN dynamics under steady state by acting on a different cellular target. Specifically, ACE influenced cellular relationships in L12 slices due to modulation of the molecular clock in SCN shell neurons. This equalized cellular period across the network and attenuated the shell-core phase difference that manifests over time in culture or after release into DD in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2011</xref>). This indicates that non-canonical GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling acts to impose phase differences during steady state by modulating the period of SCN shell neurons, but facilitates synchrony in the polarized state by acting on SCN core neurons. Recent reports indicate that GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is involved in other types of network behaviors not examined directly here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freeman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azzi et al., 2017</xref>), thus it would be of interest to determine whether non-canonical responses to GABA are likewise involved in these other SCN processes. Further work investigating how state-dependent GABA signaling regulates cellular physiology in different subclasses of SCN neurons is warranted given that this is the major neurotransmitter expressed by SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to providing novel insight into the functional significance of seasonal changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling, the present results expand understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying this form of neuroplasticity. Neuronal responses to GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling are influenced by the ratio of KCC2 and NKCC1 expression, and changes in either co-transporter can invert ion flux because the equilibrium potential for chloride is close to the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rivera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woodin et al., 2003</xref>). In other adult networks, KCC2 downregulation is the key event modulating the sign of GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling because it alters the co-transporter ratio to favor NKCC1-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hewitt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostroumov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkar et al., 2011</xref>). Here we show that long days decrease KCC2 in the SCN core and increase NKCC1 in the SCN shell, consistent with previous work demonstrating that long days increase depolarizing responses to GABA in both SCN compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>). Given the limits of drawing inferences from expression alone, we next tested the functional implications of photoperiodic changes in KCC2/NKCC1 using two different approaches (i.e., NKCC1 antagonism with bumetanide, KCC2 agonism with CLP290). Both drugs attenuated the ability of the long-day SCN network to return to its basal state ex vivo in a qualitatively similar manner, suggesting that photoperiodic adjustments of chloride transport serve to speed SCN recovery after disruption by light. Notably, long days decreased KCC2 in the SCN core during the daytime, which matches the phase when SCN neuronal responses to GABA are affected most by photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>). Further, KCC2 antagonism accelerated SCN recovery in vitro by changing the coupling responses of SCN core neurons, suggesting that further suppression of KCC2 activity beyond that achieved by light may have potential benefits. Lastly, we find that ACE blocked network recovery by specifically modulating the coupling responses of SCN core neurons. The convergent nature of these results is consistent with the known effects of these compounds on chloride transport, neuronal excitability, and GABA-evoked calcium responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farajnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deisz et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that KCC2 downregulation in the SCN core is the critical cellular adaptation driving network recovery in the master clock. It remains unclear how light modulates KCC2 expression, but it is likely that this photoperiodic change is achieved via post-translational regulation of protein expression and/or activity because long days do not increase <italic>Kcc2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myung et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, KCC2 function can be controlled by its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaila et al., 2014</xref>), which is modulated by intercellular signaling mechanisms known to be involved in photic processing, including glutamate, BDNF, and extrasynaptic GABA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>). Given that KCC2 is downregulated in the SCN compartment that receives and processes photic input, identifying the specific pathways by which light represses KCC2 in this region represents an important area for future work.</p><p>Consistent with its effects in vitro, we found that bumetanide reduced circadian plasticity in vivo. Although the systemic approach used here did not target a specific locus, bumetanide specifically decreased plasticity of circadian waveform, which is a rhythmic property closely linked to spatiotemporal encoding by the SCN network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Gorman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Margraf et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">VanderLeest et al., 2007</xref>). Slower recovery of behavioral state following systemic bumetanide administration in vivo is similar to the reduced rate of SCN recovery in vitro. In contrast, in vivo bumetanide administration did not prevent long day encoding itself or the aftereffect on free-running period, which may reflect that brain levels of BU were insufficient to block these effects. Hypothalamic levels of bumetanide in the current study approached the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Löscher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampel et al., 2018</xref>). Systemically administered bumetanide has been shown to modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory in mouse models of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marguet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>), and the efficacy of this compound in previous and current work may relate to its prolonged administration over many days to mice, a species in which the plasma half-life of bumetanide is &gt;45 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Töpfer et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the SCN regulates both circadian period and waveform, future work targeting this specific locus may provide additional insight into the processes controlling seasonal encoding and aftereffects. Although pharmacological manipulations may be limited by the need for continued drug efficacy over weeks without daily interference, the current results may be used to develop and optimize genetic approaches to modulate chloride transport and/or GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling specifically in SCN neurons. The current results indicate that cell identity and phasing may be important considerations in the design of these future studies.</p><p>In agreement with previous work suggesting daily SCN changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling correspond with altered NKCC1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belenky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2008</xref>), our results demonstrate that NKCC1 and KCC2/NKCC1 are regulated over the day under a standard lighting condition. Thus, the adult SCN is likely a network in which neuroplasticity of GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling influences circuit function on both a seasonal and circadian basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>). The regional differences in KCC2/NKCC1 expression described here reflect disparities in both KCC2 and NKCC1 expression across SCN compartments. Similar to other AVP+ structures in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haam et al., 2012</xref>), we detected stark regional differences in KCC2 expression across the SCN shell and core. Further, the timing of peak NKCC1 expression appeared to differ across SCN compartment, consistent with Western blot analyses of NKCC1 in the mouse SCN conducted at two times of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, low NKCC1 expression in the SCN core corresponds with the phase of low intracellular chloride in this specific region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, daily variation in chloride co-transporter expression may contribute to documented regional differences in neuronal excitability and GABA<sub>A</sub> responses of SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klett and Allen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that changes in KCC2 and NKCC1 can impact myriad other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaila et al., 2014</xref>), further investigation into their role in the SCN network is warranted.</p><p>Seasonal changes in the SCN circuit also alter molecular responses to GABA stimulation. Phase resetting responses elicited here are consistent with findings that tonic GABA stimulation effectively shifts the phase of the SCN molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWoskin et al., 2015</xref>). One caveat to longer-term treatment is the inadvertent modulation of additional targets. With this in mind, it is notable that present responses to tonic GABA treatment appear similar in several respects to those elicited by more acute treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>). For instance, GABA-induced resetting was occluded by GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonism, replicating previous work that also directly excluded a contribution of GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>). In addition, it has been found that 1 hr and 6 hr pulses of GABA elicit phase shifts of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>), suggesting that SCN resetting responses are not fundamentally altered by longer-term treatment. Consistent with this idea, the waveform of GABA-induced resetting displayed by L12 SCN slices replicates that elicited in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>). Although the absolute magnitude and precise phasing of resetting responses vary across studies, this may reflect other important methodological differences (e.g., phase via PER2::LUC versus electrical rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>], SCN slice from adult mouse versus dissociated SCN neurons from early postnatal pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Reppert, 2000</xref>]). Going forward, the assay developed here may be useful to examine whether photoperiod modulates sensitivity to GABA signaling across the circadian cycle. Further, imaging may add insight into cell-type specific responses since the signal recorded with luminometry is a population-level rhythm that largely reflects the brightest regions of the slice (i.e., shell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azzi et al., 2017</xref>). The results of further studies such as these may provide additional insight into seasonal plasticity of GABA circuits and how these intersect with the intracellular circadian clock.</p><p>Last, the current results may have implications for annual changes in human health and physiology. Seasonal disorders manifest in 3–10% of people, with the greatest incidence occurring at high latitudes where seasonal variation in photoperiod is most pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wirz-Justice, 2018</xref>). Evidence supports a light-based, circadian basis for seasonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wirz-Justice, 2018</xref>), but the neurobiological basis of human variation in sensitivity to seasonal disorders remains unknown. Like humans, many rodent species are characterized by two seasonal morphs: short day responders and short day non-responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson, 1987</xref>). The Siberian hamster, a classic model for interrogating photoperiodic circuits, typically displays seasonal alterations in reproduction, metabolism, immune function, affective state, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldman, 1999</xref>). However, a subset of Siberian hamsters fail to transition to the winter phenotype after exposure to long days due to a genetic pre-disposition that locks their SCN into a summer state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Margraf et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puchalski and Lynch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldman et al., 2000</xref>). It has been theorized that short day non-responsiveness reflects individual differences in SCN coupling that hinders network plasticity. Here we demonstrate that GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling regulates seasonal plasticity in the state of the SCN network, raising the possibility that individual differences in SCN GABA circuits may contribute to natural variation in seasonal responsiveness. Thus, further investigation of mechanisms and factors that regulate photoperiodic remodeling of GABA circuits in the SCN may help to better understand the neural basis of annually reoccurring disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mPer2<sup>Luc</sup>mouse</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoo et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006852">IMSR_JAX:006852</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-AVP (Guinea Pig polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Peninsula Laboratories <break/>Cat# T-5048</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2313978">AB_2313978</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Primary antibody, <break/>(1:1K)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NKCC1 (Goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam <break/>Cat#ab99558</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10675276">AB_10675276</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Primary antibody, <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-KCC2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Millipore <break/>Cat# 07–432</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310611">AB_310611</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Primary antibody, <break/>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Guinea Pig, Alexa Fluor 647</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immunoresearch <break/>Cat#706-605-148</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10895029">AB_10895029</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Secondary antibody, <break/>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey Anti-Goat, Alexa Fluor 555</td><td valign="top">Abcam <break/>Cat#ab150130</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10894526">AB_10894526</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Secondary antibody, <break/>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey Anti-Rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immunoresearch <break/>Cat#711-545-152</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10893040">AB_10893040</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Secondary antibody, <break/>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Bumetanide ELISA Kit</td><td valign="top">Neogen Corporation Cat#103719–1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and husbandry conditions</title><p>All procedures involving mice were conducted according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Marquette University.

Each SCN was cultured on a membrane insert in a dish containing 1.2 mL of air-buffered Dulbecco’s modified explant medium (DMEM, Sigma D2902) supplemented with 0.1 mM beetle luciferin, 0.02% B27 (Gibco 17504), 0.01% HEPES (Gibco 15630), 0.005% NaCHO<sub>3</sub> (Gibco 25080), 0.004% Dextrose (Sigma G7021), and 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco 15140). For resetting experiments, PER2::LUC rhythms were monitored using an Actimetrics luminometer housed within a incubator set to 37°C. At times spanning the circadian cycle, GABA (200 μM) or the equivalent volume of DMEM was added to the culture medium after 3 days in vitro. The direction and magnitude of the resetting response was quantified using Lumicycle analyses software (Actimetrics) by measuring the difference between the predicted and actual time of peak PER2::LUC expression on the cycle following drug/vehicle application. Derivatized GABA concentration over time in culture was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence detection. Briefly, media samples were diluted 200-fold with HPLC grade water prior to pre-column derivatization with ortho-phthalaldehdye (OPA) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol using a Shimadzu LC10AD VP autosampler. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Kinetex XB C-18 (50 × 4.6 mm, 2.6 μm; Phenomenex) and a mobile phase consisting of 100 mM Na2HPO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% acetonitrile (pH of 6.04). GABA was detected using a Shimadzu 10RF-AXL fluorescence detector with an excitation and emission wavelength of 320 and 400 nm, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brains were collected at eight timepoints spanning the circadian cycle (n = 4/timepoint/photoperiod), and protein expression was evaluated in free-floating slices with triple immunohistochemistry using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, SCN slices (40 μm) were washed six times in PBS, blocked in normal donkey serum, and incubated for 48 hr at 4°C with primary antibodies for AVP (1:1K, Peninsula Laboratories, Cat# T-5048, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2313978">AB_2313978</ext-link>), NKCC1 (1:500, Abcam, Cat#ab99558, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10675276">AB_10675276</ext-link>) and KCC2 (1:500, EMD Millipore, Cat# 07–432, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310611">AB_310611</ext-link>). Following primary antibody incubation, SCN slices were washed six times in PBS, incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies (1:500 for each: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10893040">AB_10893040</ext-link>, Alexa Fluor 488; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10894526">AB_10894526</ext-link>, Alexa Fluor 555; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10895029">AB_10895029</ext-link>, Alexa Fluor 647), washed six times in PBS, and then mounted onto microscope slides using Promount anti-fade gold reagent. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope using identical settings for all samples. Images were analyzed in ImageJ. Using AVP immunoreactivity, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each SCN slice by placing a circular ROI on the AVP+ dorsomedial shell and a second ROI of identical size and shape in the AVP-negative ventral core. To calculate chloride co-transporter expression, each ROI was transferred onto KCC2 and NKCC1 images thresholded for background subtraction. For each sample, the KCC2/NKCC1 ratio was calculated and averaged across the two SCN lobes. Similar results were obtained with free-form ROIs encompassing each SCN compartment, but this approach was discarded because AVP expression in the SCN core was higher and more variable across samples. Lastly, mean daily expression of each chloride co-transporter was calculated by collapsing data from all samples collected at different timepoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>PER2::LUC imaging and analyses</title><p>SCN PER2::LUC rhythms were imaged as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al. (2013)</xref>. Briefly, PER2::LUC was collected using a Stanford Photonics CCD camera within a light-tight incubator set to 37°C. For drug treatments, pharmacological agents were added at the start of the experiment directly to the culture medium (always &lt;0.05% total volume of medium) and remained for the duration of the recording. SCN slices were treated with the NKCC1 antagonist Bumetanide (80 μM, BU), the KCC2 antagonist VU0240551 (80 μM, VU), the KCC2 agonist CLP290 (100 μM), the carbonic anhydrase antagonist Acetazolamide (ACE, 100 μM), or vehicle (DMEM with DMSO &lt;0.1%). To maintain drug efficacy for long-term recordings in this interface-culture preparation, drug concentration was increased slightly relative to previous work employing bath application of drugs for short-term electrophysiological recordings (i.e., 50 μM BU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2008</xref>], 75 μM VU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haam et al., 2012</xref>], 50 μM ACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostroumov et al., 2016</xref>]). To assess effects of drug treatment on whole SCN rhythms, the time series for the entire SCN was extracted using ImageJ and analyzed with Lumicycle analyses software.</p><p>To analyze SCN function at the network and cellular level, Matlab-based computational analyses were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, a time series was generated for each 12-pixel diameter ROI of the image using a uniform grid with 2-pixel spacing, for which the linear trend was eliminated and a Butterworth filter was applied to remove high- and low-frequency interference. To generate composite phase maps illustrating results for an entire group, samples were aligned to the same X-Y coordinates by minimizing the sum of squared difference of the 24 h-summed bioluminescence profiles. To evaluate cellular rhythms, an iterative process was employed to locate and extract data from cell-like ROIs after background and local noise subtraction. To measure interactions among SCN shell and core neurons, we calculated the phase difference between peak PER2::LUC in SCN core ROIs and the average peak time of SCN shell ROIs over Cycles 2–4 in vitro, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al. (2013)</xref>. The change in the phase relationship over time in vitro was used to quantify the magnitude and direction of coupling responses. Cellular period was calculated as the average peak-to-peak cycle length over the same interval in vitro. For both coupling and period responses, the relative peak time was determined subtracting the peak time of each cell on Cycle two from the average peak time of the complementary cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Circadian behavior assays</title><p>For drug treatments in vivo, mice received bumetanide (BU, 5 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) in their drinking water for 8 weeks of photo-entrainment (L12 or L20) and 5 weeks of constant darkness (DD). Bumetanide levels were tested in plasma and hypothalamus with a bumetanide ELISA Kit (Neogen Corporation, Cat#103719–1) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Drug concentration was assessed with a VersaMax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) and compared to a standard curve. To assess effects of bumetanide on circadian behavior, daily locomotor rhythms were monitored via wheel-running cages and the Clocklab acquisition system (Actimetrics, Evanston, IL). Using ClockLab software (Actimetrics, Evanston, IL), the time of activity onset, activity offset, activity duration, and the number of wheel revolutions was determined for each day of the experiment. The time of activity onset was identified each day as the first bin above a threshold of 15 counts, preceded by at least 6 hr of inactivity and followed within 30 min by at least two more bins likewise above threshold. Activity offset was determined by a similar but opposite rule. The difference between the time of activity offset and onset was used to calculate activity duration. Free-running period was measured from the slope of a regression line fit to activity onsets over the four weeks in DD. Lastly, effects of BU on jetlag behavior was assessed in a subset of mice by abruptly advancing the L12 light:dark cycle by 6 hr. Rate of re-entrainment was quantified by calculating the number of days required for each mouse to shift activity onset by 6 hr, at which point the activity rhythm was re-aligned to the new LD cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are represented in figures as Mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed with JMP software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or CircWave software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oster et al., 2006</xref>). Phase, coupling, and period response curves were generated using a 4 hr running average, then collapsed into time bins for statistical analyses. Full Factorial ANOVA was used to assess effects of photoperiod and circadian time (or drug condition or cell type), as well as the interaction of the two main variables. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed with Least Square Means Contrasts to correct for family wise error. Changes in circadian behavior over time and its interaction with photoperiod and drug condition were analyzed with Full Factorial Repeated Measures ANOVA, followed by post hoc Least Square Means Contrasts. Statistical significance was set at p≤0.05 in all cases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Stanford Photonics and Adriano DellaPolla for technical assistance.

for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.

The authors find that GABA responsiveness changes in a reversible way with exposure to &quot;long-day&quot; light conditions. These changes revert back to the baseline in slices from animals adapted to summer conditions and this is correlated with changes in Cl<sup>-</sup> gradients. The work has important implications for how coupling of SCN networks is regulated on a seasonal time scale.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm of both reviewers, the reviewers had several concerns with the presentation of the data and statistical analyses which limit the interpretability of the data. These concerns are all related to analysis so should not require new experiments.</p><p>1) There are no statistical analyses presented to support the authors' statements that the rate of core/shell resynchronization is altered by any of the pharmacological treatments in Figure 4 and Figure 6. The authors should include an analysis of the core/shell phase difference across each cycle in culture, either by comparing the average across the whole core and shell or by examining only the cells in the polarized states (as in Figure 4D). Addition of this analysis would also greatly facilitate comparisons between this experiment and the in vivo experiment in Figure 5.</p><p>2) Using a ratio of KCC2/NKCC1 expression based on IHC fluorescence is questionable. While the authors are careful to not over interpret these data in the text of the results and acknowledge the limitations of IHC quantification in the Discussion, the way the data are represented in Figure 2 is still misleading (i.e. the label on the color bar in Figure 2B). The manuscript would be greatly improved by removing the KCC2/NKCC1 ratios entirely and instead focusing on the raw values for each transporter separately. An additional problem with the ratio analysis is that the data presented are not on a log scale, and the cosinor analysis run on log-transformed data because a floor effect is likely hiding a rhythm in the KCC2/NKCC1 ratio in the L12 shell. Furthermore, a 3 color gradient should be used because the differences on the red end of the scale are hard to tell apart.</p><p>3) Statistical reporting: It is unclear whether the vehicle treated slices were used in the analysis for the data in Figure 1D. If they were not, they should be included, and the responses to vehicle treatment for each photoperiod should be included in Figure 1D. The data in Figure 2D-E should not be analyzed with a t-test, but should be determined by looking for a main effect of photoperiod in the two-way ANOVA that was run for Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. A two-way mixed-design ANOVA should be used to analyze the activity duration for days in DD in the same way that it was for LD (Figure 5B). The Materials and methods should include details on the statistical tests used throughout and what (if any) assumptions of those tests were assessed. Details on any corrections for family-wise error should be stated. Clarification is needed on what is meant by &quot;Full Factorial ANOVA omnibus test&quot;. Reporting the main effects of photoperiod, time and/or interactions would be more informative, along with f values and degrees of freedom. Sample sizes for individual timepoints/bins in Figure 1 and for neurons in &quot;polarized&quot; state (in Figures 4D and 6C) should be reported.</p><p>4) Writing: In general, the manuscript is well written; however, the writing is better understood by someone in the field and there is a concern that a reader outside the circadian field would not understand or appreciate the findings. The Introduction should be more concise and highlight the gap in the literature more quickly. As it stands now the sentence describing the prior work in the lab (Evans et al., 2013) in the next to last paragraph of the Introduction sounds just like the sentence in the last Introduction paragraph &quot;these results reveal.…&quot; and thus the contribution sounds incremental. Also the authors should use more specific terms and avoid jargon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49578.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm of both reviewers, the reviewers had several concerns with the presentation of the data and statistical analyses which limit the interpretability of the data.

We have revised the color scale for the ratiometric images as requested. To better visualize the lack of rhythm in the L12 SCN shell, we have plotted data for this compartment on a separate scale. From this revised figure, it is clear that a floor effect is not obscuring a KCC2/NKCC1 rhythm in this region. We have retained the ratio data since these proteins together are known to regulate chloride flux, and our predictions are based on the ratiometric model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical reporting: It is unclear whether the vehicle treated slices were used in the analysis for the data in Figure 1D.
