large regulatory landscapes matching topologically associating domains (TADs). In various contexts, the associated chromatin backbone is modified by specific enhancer–enhancer and enhancer–promoter interactions. We used a TAD flanking the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster to study how these regulatory architectures are formed and deconstructed once their function achieved. We describe this TAD as a functional unit, with several regulatory sequences acting together to elicit a transcriptional response. With one exception, deletion of these sequences didn’t modify the transcriptional outcome, a result at odds with a conventional view of enhancer function. The deletion and inversion of a CTCF site located near these regulatory sequences did not affect transcription of the target gene. Slight modifications were nevertheless observed, in agreement with the loop extrusion model. We discuss these unexpected results considering both conventional and alternative explanations relying on the accumulation of poorly specific factors within the TAD backbone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hox clusters</kwd><kwd>TAD</kwd><kwd>CTCF</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>loop extrusion</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_138662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>588029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NICHD F32HD0935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bolt</surname><given-names>Christopher Chase</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vertebrates, large regulatory landscapes sometimes behave as coherent regulatory units, which may explain the lack of effect sometimes observed when single enhancer sequences are deleted in isolation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During mammalian development, the organization of body structures and their morphogenesis require the accurate transcriptional regulation of the <italic>Hox</italic> gene family of transcription factors. These proteins instruct progenitor cells at different levels along the main anterior to posterior axis, about their developmental fates. In addition to this ancient role in trunk patterning, subsets of the four <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters were co-opted during evolution to promote the development of secondary body axes such as the limbs and the external genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dollé et al., 1991a</xref>). In the latter case, mice lacking both <italic>Hoxa13</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> functions fail to develop external genitalia due to a complete agenesis of the genital tubercle (GT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warot et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, the control of gene transcription in the emerging GT involves <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences located in a 700 kb large regulatory landscape positioned 5’ to the cluster, referred to as C-DOM (centromeric domain)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitz et al., 2003</xref>). This regulatory landscape matches one of the two topologically-associating domains (TADs), which flank the gene cluster. The functional importance of C-DOM was confirmed in vivo using chromosome engineering. For example, when this region was repositioned 3 Mb away from <italic>HoxD</italic>, transcription of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> in the GT was almost entirely abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tschopp and Duboule, 2011</xref>) and subsequent deletions spanning various parts of C-DOM supported this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that this entire regulatory landscape is shared between GT and digits, and contains multiple enhancer sequences that are active in either both or only one of these developing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, it appears that within a large constitutive TAD structure, subtle yet specific modifications of chromatin architecture are formed either in GT or in digit cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lonfat and Duboule, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the regulatory landscape located at the opposite side of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster (T-DOM), which includes a large variety of enhancers with distinct specificities regulating ‘anterior’ <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes, the C-DOM appears to be devoted to the control of the most posterior and distal terminal body structures by regulating mostly <italic>Hoxd13</italic> either in digit cells or in the GT. The tropism of C-DOM enhancers for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> results from the presence of a strong chromatin boundary between this target gene and the rest of the cluster, which concentrates the action of centromeric enhancer on this precise target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez-Carballo et al., 2017</xref>). Over the past years, the importance of the C-DOM in controlling <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes expression has been clearly demonstrated. However, both the dynamic behavior of such a regulatory landscape that is its implementation and decommissioning, as well as the functional contribution of specific <italic>cis</italic>-elements in these processes remained to be established. This is necessary to understand how an entire TAD can be transcriptionally mobilized in different morphogenetic contexts to achieve similar regulatory outcomes. A ‘specific’ view of the regulatory system would involve discriminative factors, progressively building a tissue-specific chromatin context with a deterministic strategy. Alternatively, a more generic process could be considered, where the accumulation of various factors available in different tissues would elicit the same transcriptional response through whichever chromatin configuration they would trigger.</p><p>In this work, we studied the chromatin conformation dynamics at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus during GT development, as well as the functional contribution of specific <italic>cis</italic>-elements to <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes regulation. We observed that the gross chromatin organization of C-DOM predates the appearance of the GT. As GT development progresses, we scored a reduction in transcript levels correlating with a decrease in enhancer-promoter chromatin loops within C-DOM. This decrease occurred while maintaining a subset of CTCF associated contacts, which are preserved independently from the transcriptional status of the gene cluster. While both the deletion of the <italic>Prox</italic> enhancer and deletions of clusters of enhancers severely affected <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes transcript levels, the deletions of most enhancers in isolation had little (if any) effect on transcription in the GT. Moreover, the deletion of the only bound CTCF site detected in the central part of the regulatory landscape, did not impact the transcriptional outcome, even though its inversion reallocated contacts in a manner compatible with the loop extrusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vian et al., 2018</xref>). These results point to a high resilience of the regulatory strategy at work in this locus. They also suggest the existence in the same TAD of distinct mechanisms to control target gene activation, either relying upon sequence specific enhancer-promoter interactions, or involving less deterministic parameters and using the underlying chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hox</italic> genes and GT development</title><p>To assess <italic>Hox</italic> genes transcription during GT development, we initially quantified their expression levels by using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and analyzed datasets from three different stages of GT embryonic development starting from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), E16.5 and E18.5.

We performed RT-qPCR for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and detected transcripts in the CR at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), followed by a significant increase in transcript levels between the CR and the E12.5 GT (p&lt;0.0001). The mRNA levels then remained constant between E12.5 and E13.5, whereas they were significantly reduced in the interval between E13.5 and E15.5 GTs (p&lt;0.0001). After E15.5, the transcript levels continued to decrease yet to a lesser extent (between E15.5 and E18.5; p=0.0175, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), confirming the RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>We next compared chromatin accessibility and selected histone modifications in three developmental stages to correlate with transcript levels. We used the CR at E10.5 (prior to GT formation; low <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression), GT at E13.5 (early GT development; high <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression) and GT at E17.5 (late GT development; low <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression) and performed ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq for both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 chromatin marks. At E10.5, prior to GT formation, all <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes and <italic>Evx2</italic> were accessible as defined by ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). H3K27ac signals of moderate intensity were scored over the <italic>Hoxd9</italic> to <italic>Evx2</italic> DNA interval as well as peaks over the promoters of <italic>Hoxd1</italic>, <italic>Hoxd3, and Hoxd4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating a somewhat general activity of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in this posterior region of the elongating body axis. This was confirmed by a low coverage in H3K27me3 marks, which were detected mostly over the <italic>Evx2</italic> gene, next to the <italic>Hox</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, gray area).</p><p>In the growing E13.5 genital bud, a different picture was observed with a whole inactivation of the cluster from <italic>Hoxd1</italic> to <italic>Hoxd10-11</italic>, as indicated by a robust coverage of this region by H3K27me3 marks and the disappearance of both H3K27ac marks and ATAC-seq signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, ATAC-seq peaks remained in the <italic>Hoxd11</italic> to <italic>Evx2</italic> region, accompanied by a large increase in H3K27ac signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) reflecting full transcription of the latter genes. At this stage, a clear separation of the cluster into two distinct epigenetic domains was scored, reminiscent of the situation described in distal forelimb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>). At E17.5, this clear dichotomy between epigenetic domains, as labelled by the H3K27ac and ATAC-seq signals, was still detected though at a lower magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In parallel, H3K27me3 marks started to spread over the entire gene cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data are in agreement with the analysis of mRNA levels as observed by both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Implementation and decommissioning of a chromatin architecture</title><p><italic>Hoxd</italic> genes are regulated in the developing GT by long-range acting sequences positioned within the flanking centromericly located TAD (C-DOM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Upon transcriptional activation, however, frequencies of contacts with the C-DOM increased and interactions between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and previously characterized enhancers (Prox, GT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>) became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, second track, blue lines). This dataset showed a C-DOM specific chromatin architecture that is organized before the emergence of the genital bud.</p><p>In subsequent stages of GT development (E12.5 or E13.5), contacts between various enhancer regions and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> continued to increase when compared to the CR sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As development further progressed, contacts established between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and C-DOM weakened. At the latter stage the profile observed was comparable to either forebrain cells or the mESC profiles, with a loss of contacts with specific enhancers (Prox and GT2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue lines). We quantified the percent of fragments covering each regulatory island by using mESC as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The relative frequency of contacts with island II and island V remained fairly constant in all samples analyzed. In contrast, the contacts between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and either Prox or GT2 dramatically increased from the mESC to the E13.5 GT samples. The decrease in contacts observed between E13.5 to E17.5 GTs correlated with a decrease in <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcript levels. Fetal forebrain cells, which do not express any <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes, showed the lowest values of interactions between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and either Prox or GT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To validate these results, we selected both the GT2 region, which displayed important changes in interaction frequencies with <italic>Hoxd13</italic> during GT development, and the island V region which showed more constitutive contacts, as viewpoints in 4C-seq experiments. We used 4C-seq libraries for E12.5, E13.5, E15.5, and E17.5 GT cells and E12.5 forebrain cells as the negative control. We confirmed that the interactions between GT2 and the <italic>Hoxd13</italic> region substantially decreased from E13.5 to E17.5, whereas contact frequencies between island V and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> was essentially stable, regardless of the stage and tissue analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, as transcription decreased, some contacts established with C-DOM were lost whereas others were maintained (island II and island V), indicating that at the time transcription is switched off, C-DOM goes back to the pre-organized chromatin backbone that characterizes tissues or cells that do not express any <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Of note, the constitutively contacted island V includes a binding site occupied by CTCF (see below), a protein described to facilitate enhancer-promoter contacts by DNA-looping (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>), even though it does not always appear necessary in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stadhouders et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dissecting the regulatory potential of the C-DOM TAD</title><p>We next explored the functional dynamics of C-DOM during GT development.

We looked at the potential impact of either deleting or inverting this CTCF site on the remaining regulatory elements by performing ATAC-seq in wildtype, <italic>Del(V),</italic> and <italic>Inv(V)</italic> homozygous GT at E13.5. In mutant <italic>Del(V)</italic> GT cells, with the exception of the deleted region, we did not observe any change in the ATAC-seq profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) when compared to control GT cells. Minor changes were not reproduced in replicates and were likely due to individual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the mutant <italic>Inv(V)</italic> GT cells, we observed the loss of one ATAC-seq peak located between the GT2 and CsB sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, black arrow), similar to what was scored in the <italic>Del(GT2)</italic> allele. Therefore, neither the deletion nor the inversion of this centrally-located CTCF site had any substantial effect on the accessibility of the remaining regulatory elements, corroborating the RT-qPCR results where expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> was unchanged in these two alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The position and orientation of this CTCF site suggested that it may play a role in helping the central part of C-DOM, rich in potential GT-specific elements, to get closer to <italic>Hoxd13</italic> through the formation of a large loop. We thus performed 4C-seq by using the <italic>Del(V)</italic> and <italic>Inv(V)</italic> mutant alleles on GT cells at E13.5 to investigate whether either the absence or the inversion of the CTCF site would affect the interaction landscape within C-DOM. When <italic>Hoxd13</italic> was taken as a viewpoint for the <italic>Del(V)</italic> allele, the global interaction profile between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and C-DOM was virtually identical to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We confirmed this result by using a viewpoint positioned on island IV, located nearby island V. Only a slight reduction in the frequency of contacts between island IV and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> was scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, black arrow). Therefore, island V and its associated CTCF site seem to have a marginal importance in maintaining the global chromatin structure of this regulatory landscape.</p><p>The majority of CTCF mediated chromatin loops are established between sites displaying opposite and convergent orientations (i.e. with CTCF motifs pointing toward each other) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>).

We validated this result by doing the reverse experiment and using a viewpoint on island V. In this set up, we observed a reduction in the overall frequency of interactions in the region between island V and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> thus confirming the previous result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Noteworthy, we observed an increase in the interaction frequency in the region centromeric to island V up to island II and island C, that is with the next CTCF sites displaying opposite and convergent orientations in the mutant configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, middle and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This inversion in the general tropism of interactions supports the importance of CTCF site orientations in the loop-extrusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>). When we used island IV as a viewpoint, we also observed a reduction in contacts with <italic>Hoxd13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, black arrow). Taken together, these results suggest that either the loss or the inversion of island V and its associated CTCF site, had an effect on C-DOM chromatin structure. Nonetheless, this effect did not greatly alter the regulatory landscape chromatin architecture, corroborating the lack of impact on transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Group 13 HOX proteins and TAD licensing</title><p>These results obtained after single enhancer deletions raise several hypotheses (see below). Among them is the possibility that the transcriptional outcome of the C-DOM regulation may rely upon an unspecific and global effect of accumulating various factors within the landscape architecture, thus licensing the TAD for activation of the target genes. The same C-DOM TAD was previously shown to regulate <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and neighboring <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes during distal limb bud development, a structure that resembles in many respects the developing genitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobb and Duboule, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Infante et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, the products of both <italic>Hoxa13</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> were shown to bind to most of those C-DOM regulatory sequences specific for distal limb buds. From this observation, it was concluded that HOX13 proteins themselves were instrumental in activating or re-enforcing transcription of the <italic>Hoxd13</italic> gene in this developmental context, by accumulating at this landscape and binding to many accessible sites due to their low binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beccari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheth et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this context, we used an antibody against the HOXA13 in a CUT and RUN approach with either CR cells at E10.5 or GT cells at E13.5, that is before GT formation and during its emergence, respectively.

In the case of Prox, HOX13 binding was scored before a clear ATAC-seq signal was detected, suggesting a potential role for HOX13 proteins in participating to making some of these sites accessible.

Studies of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster have provided some insights into this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>) and suggested that the regulation of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> is primarily achieved by the C-DOM TAD, a large regulatory landscape flanking the gene cluster on its centromeric side, which also controls <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene activation in the developing digits. In the latter case, the chromatin interaction profile displayed some differences in transcriptionally active cells, even though the global TAD structure remained unchanged, suggesting that a C-DOM internal chromatin micro-organization had occurred due to the implementation of various digit-specific enhancers. Because of the related evolutionary origin of digits and external genitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobb and Duboule, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>), we examined this particular aspect of <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene regulation during the growth of the genital tubercle.</p><p>We looked at chromatin dynamics at the <italic>Hoxd</italic> locus and observed two types of chromatin interactions. On the one hand, we detected contacts associated with a pre-formed structure, mainly linked to occupied CTCF sites. These contacts were observed independently of the transcriptional status of the cluster, as exemplified by island II and island V. On the other hand, we scored interactions present only when transcriptional activation had occurred such as the Prox and GT2 enhancer sequences. Our time-point series of interaction profiles revealed that the C-DOM TAD seems to be activated in a coordinated manner, with all specific contacts appearing mostly within the same developmental time window, suggesting that the TAD itself may be considered as a global regulatory unit (see below), rather than a field containing a range of disparate enhancers with specific features and acting at different times. Also, the chromatin architecture associated with this specific developmental context was already observed in the E10.5 CR, that is before the emergence of the GT. Therefore, this internal-TAD micro-organization predates the outgrowth of the GT structure, which suggests -but does not demonstrate- a causal relationship or at least a necessity for the TAD to be fully primed for the structure to develop.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Switching the TAD on and off to prevent regulatory leakages</title><p>Our time-series sampling gave us the unique opportunity to follow the C-DOM TAD dynamics in a developing system where most of the cells at E17.5 derive from a homogenous population of mesodermal cells in the nascent genital bud at E12.5, all expressing <italic>Hoxd13</italic>. The highest frequency of interactions with C-DOM was scored in E12.5 and E13.5 GTs, which correlated with an increase in <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcription, an enrichment of H3K27ac marks and increase in binding of HOX13 proteins at discrete enhancer elements. After this time-point, a decrease in <italic>Hoxd</italic> transcript levels were scored in parallel with a reduction of all contacts associated with the active regulatory regions within the C-DOM. By E17.5 the C-DOM structure within the GT was reduced to a framework of constitutive interactions associated with CTCF binding sites, similar to the one observed in ES cells and fetal forebrain cells.</p><p>This global decrease, observed at a cell population level, can be explained either through a general decrease in transcription or through the selective transcriptional switch-off in some cell types along with their progressive differentiation thus leading to a dilution effect. Detailed ISH analyses see Figures 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dollé et al. (1991a)</xref> and Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warot et al.

At E17.5 indeed, strong <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression was scored in the anlagen of the <italic>corpus cavernosum</italic> while other cells of the tubercle became negative. Of note, this concentration of positive cells in the blastema and subsequent restriction to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dollé et al., 1991a</xref>) resembles the situation for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcripts during cartilage differentiation in developing digits. In support of this analogy, a penile bone (<italic>baculum</italic>) differentiates from this region in the mouse as in many other mammals.</p><p>The hereby described changes in the regulatory landscape architecture associated with transcriptional activity seem to be a pervasive feature during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freire-Pritchett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips-Cremins et al., 2013</xref>).

While such negative ground-state structures may simply reflect the absence of upstream factors and/or represent a scaffold to reinforce future enhancer-promoter contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paliou et al., 2019</xref>), it may in our case be functionally required to prevent any transcriptional leakage of <italic>Hoxd13</italic>.

A rapid return to an inactive chromatin conformation of C-DOM may help control this aspect, unlike other contexts where a particular chromatin topology is maintained for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernandez-Albert et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Long-range enhancers mechanism(s) of action</title><p>The complex pleiotropic expressions of vertebrate <italic>Hox</italic> genes, as well as of many other developmental genes, are usually controlled by multiple enhancers, either regulating subsets of the global pattern, or acting together in a partially redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>).

Various explanations can be considered for this result. Some sequences in this region may contact <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and thus prevent it to access more potent enhancers located at more proximal positions. This deleted region is rich in bound CTCF, which may favor such a sequestering (constitutive interactions) of <italic>Hoxd13</italic>. Upon deletion of this region, <italic>Hoxd13</italic> contacts with functional enhancers would be re-enforced. Also, this effect may be a consequence of a global reorganization of the genomic landscape, for this specific deletion removes a TAD boundary. Because of the observed weak transcriptional effect and the difficulty to discriminate between many parameters, the analysis of this allele was not pursued further.</p><p>When the more central <italic>rel5</italic> to <italic>SB</italic> DNA fragment was deleted, a substantial decrease in <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcription was observed. However, the deletion of any single candidate sequence in isolation identified within this segment did not elicit any detectable decrease in transcription. This systematic analysis echoes previous studies where deleting a single and well-characterized enhancer did not have the expected effect upon its target gene (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cretekos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the deletion of the Prox enhancer resulted in a decrease in <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcripts, which in itself could account for the decrease observed when the larger <italic>rel1</italic> to <italic>rel5</italic> DNA fragment was deleted. This occurred in the absence of any major reorganization either of the chromatin architecture, or of its accessibility to factors. Therefore, Prox seemed to act independently of the other elements in C-DOM, as initially expected for a ‘classical’ enhancer sequence. Concerning the elements located within the <italic>rel5</italic> to <italic>SB</italic> central part of C-DOM whose deletions in isolation had no detectable effect, they could be functionally redundant with one another or, alternatively, compensatory mechanisms could be implemented for instance to re-direct the lost interactions towards another enhancer. Also, evolution might have selected regulatory processes to cope when facing particular conditions not necessarily tractable in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). Our transgenic assays revealed that at least partial overlap in the functional domains was sometimes observed (GT1, GT2 and Prox), whereas in other cases, transgenic sequences elicited complementary domain of expression (IIIE and IVE). Therefore, some functional overlap between enhancers may account for the absence of phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, it is possible either that our experimental approach lacks the resolution required to discern mild alterations in gene expression, perhaps occurring in a subpopulation of cells, or that individual C-DOM enhancers elements may control gene expression at distinct developmental stages. In the latter scenario, we may have missed the enhancer function by focusing our analyses in selected developmental time-point.

After inversion, these CTCF sites were now facing the island V CTCF binding site and hence these partial redistributions of interactions are in agreement with the loop extrusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>). While the inversion of island V thus resulted in a slight reallocation of intra-TAD interactions, they were not sufficient to elicit changes in gene expression and had negligible impact on long-range regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes by C-DOM.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A complex regulatory landscape involved in the development of external genitals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Job Dekker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: José Luis Gómez-Skármeta (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Duboule and colleagues examine not only how complex regulatory architectures are established to achieve a specific transcriptional outcome, but also how they are rewired after. Using the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus and external genitalia as paradigm, the authors perform timecourse experiments to understand the correlation between structure and function and, importantly, generate a series of transgenic mouse lines to functionally disentangle the role of individual regulatory elements. Based on these observation they make the following conclusions: 1) the TAD regulatory environment of the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus is mostly unchanged during development, however specific regulatory elements become accessible and differentially interact with <italic>Hoxd13</italic> promoter upon gene activation; 2) while large deletions have strong effect on transcription, single enhancer deletions have surprisingly little effect on gene expression (with one notable exception) and 3) Inversion or deletion of CTCF contacts alters chromatin architecture landscape in agreement with predictions of the loop-extrusion model but has no effect on gene expression or enhancer-promoter contacts.</p><p>In general, the work is well done; the findings are interesting and novel and provide evidence that enhancer-promoter contacts are dynamically regulated within the general architecture of the encompassing TAD. The extensive transgenic mouse lines provide evidence that functional outcome of genetic manipulations cannot be readily predicted based on chromatin accessibility and 3D proximity and further confirmation that enhancer regulation can also be CTCF-independent. Overall, I believe that the manuscript could be potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> provided that the following important issues are addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Replicates and biological reproducibility</p><p>In many figures the 4C signal is quantified (for example in Figure 2 and specifically in Figure 2C) and conclusions are made based on differences across conditions without showing what is the biological variability of such quantifications. Based on the Transparent Reporting File 2 biological replicates exist for these experiment – they should be analyzed separately to determine whether the differences are meaningful or due to biological variability.</p><p>2) Data presentation consistency</p><p>In many cases only selected timepoints are shown in the figure panels which sometimes makes the interpretation difficult. For example, in Figure 3A ATAC tracks from CR E10.5 and GT E13.5 are compared with H3K27ac tracks from GT E13.5 and GT E17.5. This makes it difficult to see if the accessibility at the Prox enhancer persists also after <italic>Hoxd13</italic> has been downregulated (at E17.5). The authors should display consistently the ATAC and H3K27ac tracks across all three timepoints for a fair comparison. Similar issue is in Figure 2B when we compare the 4C profiles between mES and CRE10.5 with gene expression in Figure 1B, which doesn't have the mES timepoint. Does expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> increase between mES and CR E10.5?</p><p>3) Contribution of the GT1 region to <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression</p><p>The region labeled as GT1 in Figure 2 appears to interact strongly with <italic>Hoxd13</italic> promoter in a dynamic manner, is open at E13.5 but has no H3K27ac. Furthermore, in the <italic>Del(SB-Atf2)</italic> line, where the GT1 region is also removed, <italic>Hox13</italic> expression is upregulated. One hypothesis would be that this region represents a transcription repressor (potentially <italic>Hox13</italic> based on the ChIPseq in Figure 7), but the authors never discuss this. Such hypothesis could also potentially explain why the long deletion in the <italic>Del(rel5-SB)</italic> line has a major effect but there is little contribution of individual enhancer elements – it could be that the big deletion reduces the genomic distance between the <italic>Hoxd13</italic> promoter and GT1, therefore facilitating repression. It would be of great interest to see: 1) Does the interaction between <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and the GT1 region increase in the <italic>Del(rel5-SB)</italic> line? 2) Are there any motifs present in GT1, suggesting binding of repressors, is it marked by Polycomb? and 3) would the precise deletion/mutation of GT1 also lead to upregulation of <italic>Hoxd13</italic>.</p><p>4) In Figure 4: Is the expression of neighboring genes such as <italic>Lnpk, Evx2</italic> and <italic>Atf2</italic> (in the C-Dom) affected upon Prox deletion?

It would also help discriminated between additional layer of E-P specificity versus a global activation within the TAD. What is the expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> in this line at CR 10.5 and E17.5? Analogous for Figure 6 – does the deletion of GT2 affects the expression of neighboring genes? <italic>Lnpk</italic> is of particular interest, given the potential interaction based on Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Related to this point: Does inversion of the CTCF site in element lead to leakage of GT2 or Prox activity towards genes on the centromeric side of <italic>HoxD</italic>? It may not be surprising that deletion of element sC, II, III, IV by themselves do nothing, as they are &quot;behind&quot; the CTCF site in element V (they may in fact not regulate <italic>Hoxd13</italic> at all?).

Based on the Transparent Reporting File 2 biological replicates exist for these experiment – they should be analyzed separately to determine whether the differences are meaningful or due to biological variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being very clear regarding the number of replicates. We did produce replicates for all the deletion alleles and the corresponding controls (GT E13.5). The number of biological replicates for each condition (when more than one, see below) are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. However, we did not produce replicates for the samples used in the “developmental time series” (CRE10.5, GTE12.5, GTE15.5, GTE17.5). We determined it was not necessary in this specific case, mainly for two reasons. First because we made the converse experiment (i.e. using viewpoints on the islands) to confirm the changes. We understand that this is not the same as a biological replicate, yet the same result obtained by two (or more) different viewpoints is certainly as valid as running one duplicate for a single viewpoint. In the case where the material is rare and necessitates too many embryos (e.g. CRE10.5), we generally prefer using various viewpoints. Secondly, the time course of the GT in vivo (unique thus far in the literature) is self-controlled, i.e. the interactions that are not “specific” for one particular stage are used as internal comparative controls to identify those contacts that evolve along with the time course. This is particularly visible in Figure 2, where some peaks initially increase and subsequently decrease, when compared both vertically (time-scale) and horizontally (control interactions at the same time-point).</p><p>The Transparent Reporting File was corrected accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data presentation consistency</p><p>In many cases only selected timepoints are shown in the figure panels which sometimes makes the interpretation difficult. For example, in Figure 3A ATAC tracks from CR E10.5 and GT E13.5 are compared with H3K27ac tracks from GT E13.5 and GT E17.5. This makes it difficult to see if the accessibility at the Prox enhancer persists also after Hoxd13 has been downregulated (at E17.5). The authors should display consistently the ATAC and H3K27ac tracks across all three timepoints for a fair comparison. Similar issue is in Figure 2B when we compare the 4C profiles between mES and CRE10.5 with gene expression in Figure 1B, which doesn't have the mES timepoint. Does expression of Hoxd13 increase between mES and CR E10.5?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to show the most significant datasets for the message we like to convey and thus we did not overpack the figures with confirmatory results. Nevertheless, we agree with this comment and we have re-organized the datasets to increase consistency. Concerning the first part of the question, we have now added to Figures 1 and 3 the ATAC-seq dataset for E17.5 for better comparison. We also removed the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from Figure 3. Concerning the H3K27ac ChIP-seq for the cloaca, while we are confident in the results in the gene cluster (showed in Figure 1), we would need to do the experiment once again to determine that the C-DOM is virtually depleted of this mark. This experiment would require dissecting hundreds of young fetuses, which we do not think is necessary, nor desirable, considering the small amount of information that this experiment will deliver. As a consequence, we have removed the data from the figure.</p><p>To the second aspect of the question, the transcription of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes increases from mES to the CRE10.5 sample, for there is essentially no expression of thesegenes in murine ES cells (5 FPKM for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> by RNA-seq, while undetected by qPCR according to the Noordermeer et al. paper (see Figure S7 from the <italic>eLife,</italic> 2014paper). Likewise, <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes are not transcribed in forebrain cells at any developmental stage considered and, consequently, there is little basis to quantifying <italic>Hoxd13</italic> either in mES cells, or in FB cells. On lines 188 and 189, we write: “These two profiles likely reflected the 3D chromatin state of C-DOM in the complete absence of transcription”, which we think is clear enough.</p><p>To clarify this issue, we added a schematic of the expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> in Figure 2. Also, we slightly amended Figure2A to make it clear that <italic>Atf2</italic> is not part of the C-TAD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Contribution of the GT1 region to Hoxd13 expression</p><p>The region labeled as GT1 in Figure 2 appears to interact strongly with Hoxd13 promoter in a dynamic manner, is open at E13.5 but has no H3K27ac. Furthermore, in the Del(SB-Atf2) line, where the GT1 region is also removed, Hox13 expression is upregulated. One hypothesis would be that this region represents a transcription repressor (potentially Hox13 based on the ChIPseq in Figure 7), but the authors never discuss this. Such hypothesis could also potentially explain why the long deletion in the Del(rel5-SB) line has a major effect but there is little contribution of individual enhancer elements – it could be that the big deletion reduces the genomic distance between the Hoxd13 promoter and GT1, therefore facilitating repression. It would be of great interest to see: 1) Does the interaction between Hoxd13 and the GT1 region increase in the Del(rel5-SB) line? 2) Are there any motifs present in GT1, suggesting binding of repressors, is it marked by Polycomb? and 3) would the precise deletion/mutation of GT1 also lead to upregulation of Hoxd13.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly understand this interest for the GT1 sequence. We nevertheless decided to focus this work on the central and telomeric parts of C-DOM, rather than on the centromeric part containing GT1, mostly because the central deletion (and that of <italic>Prox</italic>) had the strongest impact on <italic>Hoxd13</italic> transcription. The situation turned out to be complex enough, with potential activating enhancers, such that we decided to ignore the up-regulation of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes upon removal of the most centromeric deletion. The main reason for this is that the GT1 sequence was isolated because it displayed transgenic activity in the GT (LacZ staining). Therefore, should this sequence have a repressive activity, it would need to be a context-specific repression, whereas the sequence would be an activator outside its genomic context. While of potential interest, this investigation would require years of work using embryonic material and is in fact not on the agenda.</p><p>We nevertheless introduced a paragraph in the Discussion section “Mechanism(s) of action of long-range enhancers”, which now proposes some potential explanations related to the GT1-containing deletion.</p><p>Also, GT1 does not contain any salient DNA motive that would be known either to bind a repressor, or to induce formation of a chromatin structure that may be associated with transcriptional down-regulation (such as a TE). Along this line, the GT1 sequence does not display any histone modifications associated with polycomb binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4: Is the expression of neighboring genes such as Lnpk, Evx2 and Atf2 (in the C-Dom) affected upon Prox deletion? This will address if Prox is regulating only HoxD13 or has a general enhancer activity within the TAD. It would also help discriminated between additional layer of E-P specificity versus a global activation within the TAD. What is the expression of Hoxd13 in this line at CR 10.5 and E17.5? Analogous for Figure 6 – does the deletion of GT2 affects the expression of neighboring genes? Lnpk is of particular interest, given the potential interaction based on Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Related to this point: Does inversion of the CTCF site in element lead to leakage of GT2 or Prox activity towards genes on the centromeric side of HoxD? It may not be surprising that deletion of element sC, II, III, IV by themselves do nothing, as they are &quot;behind&quot; the CTCF site in element V (they may in fact not regulate Hoxd13 at all?). When element V is deleted: does deletion of these centromeric distal elements now alter Hoxd13?</p></disp-quote><p>Several issues are raised here. First, one has to remember that the combined inactivation of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and <italic>Hoxa13</italic> alone completely abrogates GT formation, leading to an open cloaca (see Introduction). To our knowledge, none of the genes located nearby (i.e. <italic>Lnpk</italic> and <italic>Evx2</italic>) has any function during either limb or GT development (the <italic>Atf2</italic> gene is not addressed here as it stands <italic>outside</italic> -and not <italic>inside</italic> as suggested- the C-DOM TAD). It is possible that these non-<italic>Hox</italic> genes nevertheless play a role by being part of the general enhancer-promoter equilibrium necessary for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> to be optimally regulated. The genetic stocks we use in this paper were not produced to address this question and only inferences can be obtained from our deleted mice. It would be necessary to produce mice lacking promoters (or the part responsible for the contact), a set of experiments largely outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>As it stands, we can propose the following answers:</p><p>In the <italic>del(prox)</italic> mice, the steady state mRNA levels of <italic>Evx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxd12</italic> are significantly decreased. This is not surprising as we showed previously (starting with Spitz et al., Cell, 2003) that every transcription unit present in this landscape would fall under the control of this set of enhancers (in fact, this is what defined the concept of regulatory landscapes in this paper). In this manuscript, we did not look at <italic>Lnpk,</italic> whose transcription is also controlled by the limb and genital enhancers present in C-DOM.</p><p>Concerning the expression of <italic>Hoxd13</italic> in the CR of <italic>del(Prox)</italic> embryos at E10.5, because this element is not accessible at this stage (as seen by ATAC-seq, Figures 3A and 8B), we considered that <italic>Prox</italic> was not active in these cells and hence we did not include this stage (which in addition, requires a large number of embryos as starting material) when analyzing this allele. Regarding the E17.5 stage, it would be difficult to interpret the results of this experiment (we expect only a moderate quantitative effect) as we will not be able to discriminate between a direct transcriptional effect, on the one hand, and a cellular dilution effect induced by the huge growth of the structure, with only some cells remaining positive for <italic>Hoxd13</italic> (see the text), on the other hand.</p><p>Also, the deletion of GT2 alone affects the transcription of <italic>Evx2</italic> but not that of <italic>Hox</italic> genes (there again, we did not look a <italic>Lnpk</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does inversion of the CTCF site in element lead to leakage of GT2 or Prox activity towards genes on the centromeric side of HoxD?</p></disp-quote><p>There isn’t any detectable change in the expression of the <italic>Evx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in this CTCF inverted allele.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may not be surprising that deletion of elements C, II, III, IV by themselves do nothing, as they are &quot;behind&quot; the CTCF site in element V (they may in fact not regulate Hoxd13 at all?).</p></disp-quote><p>Well, this does not seem to be the case, for we see an effect when deleting two elements (<italic>III</italic> and <italic>IV)</italic> at the same time while keeping the CTCF site associated to island V intact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When element V is deleted: does deletion of these centromeric distal elements now alter Hoxd13?</p></disp-quote><p>This is of course one of the valid questions one may ask in experiments combining micro-deletions in-<italic>cis</italic>. We have not produced such alleles and thus we cannot provide a clear answer to this point. All this work was done in mice in vivo and regardless of how efficient is the CRISPR technology, such experiments require both an insane number of animals (to be well-done) and a long-time frame. Also, the number of possibilities of combined deletions in-<italic>cis</italic> is very large and there is no a priori one or a few particular combinations that should be done in priority, leaving us with the necessity either to have an unbiased approach or to have no approach at all. We selected the latter.</p><p>However, our educated guess is probably yes, because both the <italic>del(IV-SB)</italic> and the <italic>del(rel5-SB)</italic> alleles affect <italic>Hoxd13</italic> expression, although the first one keeps the island V intact and the second allele also removes GT2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A major conclusion is that the deletions do not affect the overall architecture of the locus. The question is whether 4C-seq, with just one or two anchors has enough power to conclude that there is no effect on the global architecture of the C-DOM landscape.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that indeed our approach allows us to draw such a conclusion, provided the word “global” is used. It is certainly possible that minor changes occur that cannot be detected using our 4C approach, and the same question can be asked at any level of resolution. For example, a slight difference in the representativity of one particular spatial configuration amongst others would not even be detected by using a high resolution Hi-C approach. By global architecture we mean the presence of the TADs and of the main contact points within these TADs, suggesting that these various regulatory sequences do not contribute strongly to the building of the structure. Even the inversion of the CTCF site (<italic>region V</italic>), which induces a clear (and expected) modification in the distribution of interactions, does not globally change the contact profile to an extent similar form example to the inversion or the deletion of a strong TAD boundary region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) When GT2 or Prox are deleted: does Hoxd13 now interact with other elements (new elements or elements it also interact with in WT but now with higher frequency)? If so, are these elements contained within the larger deletion that did have an effect on Hoxd13 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Unless we do not fully understand this comment, this point is addressed in the paper. For Prox in Figure 4E and F and in the text. For GT2, in Figure 6 and figure supplement 3A and 3B as well as in the text too.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The current 4C data represent only 1 replicate. Two reviewers indicated that it was critical to demonstrate reproducibility. They also understood the technical challenges. Therefore, we ask for adding biological replicates to confirm the most important and key findings. This would include replicates of some of the 4C analyses. When such data can be included the work would be suitable for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>To the first point, there are two issues.</p><p>1) the appearance and disappearance, along with time, of particular peaks (GT2 and Prox; Figure 2). This is highly significant and we have tried to make it clearer in this version. For this time course, we had made one replicate at E13.5 to have an estimation of the variability. This variability is now indicated in the new Figure 2C (open circles in the E13.5 points). You can see that the data for GT2 are very clear. For Prox, you can see that if one applies this variability to all the points, only the time points 12.5, 13,5 and 15.5 are clearly significant, whereas the 10.5 and 17.5 points are borderline. This simply means that the Prox element peaks in its interactions within a shorter time window, which is in full agreement with the fact that it is opened (ATAC seq data) later than the GT2 sequence.</p><p>2) The general increase and decrease of contacts throughout the TAD (C-DOM), following the same dynamics. This was not the main issue of this Figure 2 and we agree that these exact percentages did not have much sense, except to indicate that there is a clear tendency. In this revised text, we removed the numbers from Figure 2 and simply mention in the text, after the description of GT2 and Prox dynamics that, in addition, the overall number of reads over the entire landscape showed a tendency… etc. A clear description of how we calculated this global increase/decrease in the number of reads has been added in the Materials and methods</p><p>To the second point, we have added a table including the 66 datasets described in this work. They are accompanied by the numbers of the figure(s) where they appear, the number of replicates (if any) and an explanation as to why replicates were not processed in some cases. This table is now included as supplementary file 6 and referred to at the end of the Materials and methods section as: “A complete list of datasets and replicate status of all experiments is described in Supplementary file 6”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
