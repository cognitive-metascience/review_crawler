Beta power is predictive of healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. In non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power 'events'. As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect changes in event number, power, duration, and/or frequency span. We show that functionally relevant differences in averaged beta power in primary somatosensory neocortex reflect a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e. event rate. Further, beta events occurring close to the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. These results are consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography, and in local field potentials from mice performing a detection task. These results imply that an increased propensity of beta events predicts the failure to effectively transmit information through specific neocortical representations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beta rhythm</kwd><kwd>perception</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>functional homology</kwd><kwd>transient oscillation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011184</institution-id><institution>Brown Institute for Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Hyeyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010629</institution-id><institution>Fulbright Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Hyeyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS045130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Christopher I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH106174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephanie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Veterans Health Administration, Office of Research and Development, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service; N9228-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephanie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience NSF CRCNS-1131850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephanie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EB022889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephanie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Across species, tasks and recording modalities, the rate of transient neocortical beta frequency (15-29Hz) events strongly predicts perceptual ability, providing fundamental mechanistic insight, with implications for tracking and manipulating brain dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beta frequency oscillations are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity.

Yet, how and why beta impacts function is debated. The temporal signatures of rhythmic activity may prove crucial to understanding their importance in brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones, 2016</xref>). Yet, most studies reporting functional correlates of brain rhythms rely on averaging across time and/or trials, where the temporal dynamics of rhythmic activity is lost.</p><p>Several recent studies have appreciated that, while some rhythms are sustained for several cycles (e.g. occipital alpha rhythms during eye closure, slow wave sleep rhythms), rhythmic activity can often be transient in non-averaged data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>). In such studies, high power beta frequency activity (15–29 Hz) emerges as brief events typically lasting &lt;150 ms. Transient beta has been reported in many brain areas including somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ziegler et al., 2010</xref>), motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rule et al., 2017</xref>), occipital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freyer et al., 2009</xref>), and frontal neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>), and basal ganglia structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolo and Merchant, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>), and across recording modalities and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>). Further, differences in the accumulated density of transient beta bursts across trials predicts functionally relevant differences in averaged beta power reflecting motor and cognitive demands in monkey local field potentials (LFP) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), that lower prestimulus beta power (averaged in the 1 s prestimulus time window) in the human primary somatosensory neocortex (SI) predicts an increase in the probability of detection of tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>). Correspondingly, shifts in spatial attention modulate post-cue/prestimulus beta power, such that average power decreases in the attended SI location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sacchet et al., 2015</xref>). These prior studies did not investigate the relationship between the transient nature of the beta events on specific trials and function.</p><p>Here, we find that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human SI emerge from a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial (e.g. the rate of beta events). This result is conserved in both detection and attention tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2007</xref>): A lower rate of prestimulus beta events predicts enhanced detection of stimuli at perceptual threshold, and the rate of beta events in the attended region of the brain decreases. Moreover, non-detected trials were more likely to have a high-power beta event within approximately 200 ms of the stimulus. Importantly, these beta events were not a byproduct a sustained oscillation whose power gets dynamically modulated; rather, we find evidence that beta events may be generated by a transient, ‘bursty’ mechanism. These results show that differences in the rate and timing of ‘bursty’ beta events underlie the correlation between beta power and behavior in humans. Results were remarkably consistent in LFP recordings from awake behaving mice performing a similar tactile detection task. The strong parallel in the character of beta events across behavior, recording scales, and species indicates a fundamental consistency in the nature of this much-studied dynamic in the mammalian neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mean prestimulus beta power is higher on non-detected and attend-out trials</title><p>We have previously shown that prestimulus beta rhythms source localized to the hand representation in human SI are predictive of tactile perception.

If so, allocation of this dynamic to”attend-out’ representations, those where distracting inputs might decrease performance, could be adaptive. Consistent with this prediction, when human subjects are cued to attend to perceptual-threshold level stimulation in the hand or foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sacchet et al., 2015</xref>), a similar negative relationship exists between prestimulus beta power and the allocation of attention (attend-in rate, measured as PCM of attend hand trial) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci–ii</xref>; analysis was limited to detected trials to compare the effect of attention independent of detection). Human attention data were also obtained from a MEG dipole source localized to the contralateral hand area of SI (N = 10 subjects, see further details in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the negative relationships between averaged beta power and behavior visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ii</xref> produced a significant difference across behavioral conditions, we compared the grand averaged prestimulus power pooled across conditions in each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1iii</xref>). All three datasets showed significance, such that the pooled average was significantly higher on non-detected/attend out trials (p&lt;0.05, right-tailed paired t-test). Quantification of the corresponding effect size showed the difference across behavioral conditions was larger for detection than attention (see Cohen’s d values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels iii).</p><p>To further investigate the potential impact of prestimulus beta power on behavior, we conducted an ideal observer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nienborg et al., 2012</xref>). Trial mean prestimulus beta power denotes beta power averaged across the 1 s prestimulus period, and across the 15–29 Hz beta band. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the ideal observer is termed detect probability (DP) and attend probability (AP) for detection and attention tasks, respectively. A DP or AP value of 0.5 indicates no predictability, and &lt;0.5 indicates that higher trial mean prestimulus beta power was predictive of non-detected or attend-out trials. Box plot distributions of these values across subjects or sessions are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1iv</xref>. In all three datasets, the median of DP and AP distributions were significantly &lt;0.5, such that higher power indicated the subject was less likely to detect or attend to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1iv</xref> asterisks p&lt;0.05, p-values from one-sample left-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test). While this effect was significant in all three datasets, the effect was stronger in the detection datasets, where in 50% of human subjects and mouse sessions high beta was significantly predictive of non-detection, as compared to the attention dataset where only 10% of the subjects showed significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1iv</xref>, see parentheses above each plot, bootstrapped 1000 times to determine 95% confidence interval for each subject/session. DP/AP is significantly less than 0.5 if the upper boundary of the bootstrapped confidence interval is less than 0.5).</p><p>To determine if the difference in prestimulus beta power between non-detected and detected trials might be due to a lower criterion for perception and/or enhanced motor readiness, we assessed the relationship between correct reject and false alarm trials and beta power in the mouse dataset. Averaged beta power was not significantly higher in correct rejections compared to false alarms across sessions, arguing strongly against the possibility that the difference was due to modulation of the criterion or motor readiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; right-tailed paired t-test). This analysis was not possible in the human detection data due to task design and low false alarm rates.

To choose the power cutoff in a principled manner, we calculated for each subject and session the correlation between the percent area above cutoff in the 1 s prestimulus beta band spectrogram (see red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai</xref> inset) and the trial mean prestimulus beta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). The correlation with mean power was highest near the 6X median power cutoff across species and behavioral tasks (dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). In other words, this power cutoff best accounted for the variability in trial mean prestimulus power, the effect we are seeking to understand. We therefore chose the value of 6X median as the cutoff for further analyses (see also figure supplements to Figures 6, 7 and 8 for examination of cutoff variation).

Likely due to this refractory period, the IEI histogram started at zero and rose to a peak near 200 ms. An alternative possibility is that the peak near 200 ms is reflective of underlying rhythmicity. To test the rhythmicity of ‘non-overlapping events’, we constructed jittered distributions of IEIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11ii</xref>, black curve; see legend and Materials and methods for details). Neither the detected nor the non-detected (and, attend-in nor attend-out) IEI distributions were distinct from the jittered distributions, suggesting that ‘non-overlapping beta events’ did not occur rhythmically in any behavioral condition.

We investigated this possibility further by considering two mechanisms that could underlie transient surges in beta power in the spectrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a Dynamic Amplitude Modulation mechanism versus a Bursty Generator mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> schematic). A Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis predicts the existence of an ongoing continuous rhythm whose amplitude (and hence power) was dynamically modulated. Under this hypothesis, the rhythmicity of the beta component of the signal would be independent of its amplitude. In contrast, the Bursty Generator hypothesis assumes that the generator that triggers the beta waveform also causes the transient surge in beta amplitude. Under this hypothesis, beta rhythmicity is only present when this generator triggers the system: If so, rhythmicity would be restricted to high beta power regions of the data. The contrasting predictions of these two competing hypotheses were tested by choosing an amplitude cutoff, and comparing the rhythmicity in time lags above and below the cutoff.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29086.020</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Beta event emergence is consistent with a bursty generator mechanisms, as opposed to dynamic amplitude modulation of a sustained beta oscillation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of two alternative mechanisms that could underlie transient surges in beta power in the spectrogram: (i) Dynamic Amplitude Modulation mechanism; versus, (ii) Bursty Generator mechanism.

As diagrammed, we assessed whether or not rhythmicity was maintained by comparing the time lag between first and last peaks in the oscillation within a high power region, or last and first peaks in consecutive regions with a low power region in between. For this analysis, we band-passed the data and performed a Hilbert transform to calculate the time lag modulo the beta period for these regions. These values were plotted as functions of the normalized modulo (remainder after division) that varied between −0.5 and 0.5, where 0 corresponded to integer multiples of the beta period. The ‘time lag above cutoff’ (red periods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>) were calculated as the time between the first (orange dot) and last (brown dot) 0° phase time points in each supra-cutoff region, where 0° phase denotes the peak points in the oscillation (marked with grey/orange/ brown dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref> schematic). The ‘time lag below cutoff’ was calculated as the time between the last 0° phase time point in the preceding supra-cutoff region and the first 0° phase time point in the succeeding supra-cutoff region. With this definition, we would expect the time lags to be integer multiples of the beta period in rhythmic regions, i.e. we would expect the modulo of the beta period to be around 0. Under the Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis, where a sustained oscillation is being modulated in amplitude, we would expect both the time lags above (red) and below (blue) the cutoff to be rhythmic, hence the time lag modulo the beta period distributions should both be centered at 0 (lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12Ai</xref>). In contrast, the Bursty Generator hypothesis would predict that supra-cutoff regions would be rhythmic, whereas sub-cutoff regions would not. In this model, the time lag modulo the beta period distributions would be centered at 0 for time lags above cutoff (red), whereas the distribution would be flat for time lags below cutoff (blue) (lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12Aii</xref>).</p><p>We chose the Hilbert-amplitude cutoff (cyan horizontal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>) such that it was comparable to the 6X median power cutoff in the Morlet spectrogram analysis, in that there was a similar percentage of time points above the cutoff in the beta band (~10%). We determined the characteristic beta period for each subject/session as the inverse of the characteristic beta frequency. The characteristic beta frequency in turn was defined as the median of the instantaneous frequency values in the Hilbert-transformation of the beta band-passed data. This characteristic beta period was used to calculate the time lags’ modulo of the beta period and to normalize to range between −0.5 and 0.5.</p><p>To account for the possibility that rhythmicity may decay over time, we first performed histogram matching of time lags above and below cutoff, such that the number of beta cycles in the time lags being compared was matched. The modulo probability histograms for the matched time lags above and below the amplitude cutoff are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref> for each dataset (i-iii). These probability histograms show that time lags above cutoff are integer multiples of the beta period (i.e. distributions are centered at 0), in direct contrast to time lags below cutoff that are not (i.e. distributions are flat).</p><p>Overall, these results strongly support the prediction that high power regions are rhythmic but low power regions are not, providing evidence for the Bursty Generator hypothesis over the Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data showed that averaged prestimulus beta activity in somatosensory neocortex is predictive of perceptual success and shifts in attention, such that higher power reflects decreased detection or attention. This result held across various analysis methods, species and recording modalities (human MEG, mouse LFP), consistent with the general prediction that spontaneous sensorimotor beta acts as, or is the by-product of, an ‘inhibitory’ process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To further uncover the potential mechanisms underlying this robust association of beta with an ‘inhibitory’ influence, we studied the trial-by-trial relationship between beta and behavior. On individual trials, beta emerged as a brief high-power transient above background noise in the frequency spectrum and was consistent with a ‘bursty’ process as opposed to dynamic amplitude modulation of a sustained beta oscillation. As such, we postulated that observed differences in averaged power across behavioral conditions could reflect modulation in the number of high-power beta events in a predefined window (i.e. rate) and/or modulation in the event power, duration, or frequency span. Our results showed that the rate of prestimulus beta events was the most consistent predictor of detection and shifts in attention, and most strongly correlated with average prestimulus beta power. In human data, only the rate of events was significantly predictive of function across detection and attention tasks. Moreover, an event occurring closer to the stimulus onset was more likely to result in non-detection. Analysis of a subset of the data where the number of events, or conversely the timing of the ‘most recent beta event’, were matched across detected and non-detected trials showed that event number and timing may be independently informative to perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that with shifts in attention, the brain decreases the probability of high-power beta events, and this decrease translates to improved sensory processing in the aligned sensory channel. To our knowledge, these are the first results to show that rate of beta events in human neocortical signals is a meaningful predictor of function. Prior studies in animal models have shown that features of transient beta activity in LFP signals correlate with behavior, including motor and cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolo and Merchant, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>) and working memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>). Homology in beta event characteristics across tasks, recording modalities, and species, suggests modulation of beta event rate may be the fundamental feature underlying behaviorally relevant differences in averaged beta power.</p><p>These observations have direct implications for the highly debated topic of whether there is a role for brain rhythms in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainsworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ray and Maunsell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ray and Maunsell, 2015</xref>). A well-established theory suggests a crucial role for the specific alignment of oscillatory phases with external input, with specific phases beneficial for signal transmission while others are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lakatos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Elswijk et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, our current study suggests that in spontaneous, prestimulus, anticipatory states it is unlikely that beta’s local influence on the filtering of sensory input is through a temporal phase-alignment code. Rather, in all three of our tasks, the precise timing of the sensory stimulus onset is unpredictable for the subject (i.e. randomized design). Under these conditions, our results suggest that the inhibitory correlation between beta and perception may reflect the presence of another process that enhances beta event probability/rate, such as an increase in a specific thalamic input and/or the existence of a specific neuromodulatory environment that promotes this rhythm. Further, if a single beta event occurs within 200 ms before the sensory stimulus, the stimulus is less likely to be perceived, suggesting that the increased rate in non-attended conditions acts to increase the probability that an event will occur close to, or perhaps during, the stimulus. In this case, beta events could have an inhibitory impact on function for a prolonged period that extends longer than the event duration, a period that could be as long as 200 ms. Of note, this finding does not preclude a role for band-band phase-coherence between brain regions in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sacchet et al., 2015</xref>). Rather, our results are relevant to the potential interpretation of phase of a local spontaneous beta ‘oscillation’ at the timing of external stimulus arrival and suggest that the beta’s inhibitory influence is likely not due to a specific phase-alignment.</p><p>How might an increase in the rate of prestimulus SI beta events translate mechanistically to a decrease in tactile perception? Our findings directly indicate that the circuit-level mechanisms that create beta events recruit an ‘inhibitory’ process that decreases the relay of sensory information to or from SI. The rate of beta events therefore predicts the presence of this inhibitory process at the time of the stimulus. Evidence for this inference depends first on understanding the mechanisms of generation of beta events observed in SI. We have previously investigated the mechanisms of high-power SI beta event generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>). Converging evidence in humans and animals supported a model-derived theory that the circuit-mechanisms creating high-power beta events consisted of bursts of subthreshold excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, such that the distal drive was effectively stronger and lasted ~50 ms. Our present study implies that beta’s inhibitory impact on function is largely related to the likelihood of observing this strong distal drive (event number) and/or the strong distal drive happening closer to the onset of the stimulus (‘most recent event’ timing), in contrast to stronger distal drive (event power), longer lasting drive (event duration) or drive covering a larger frequency span in the spectrogram (event frequency span).</p><p>There are several plausible mechanisms by which the accumulation and/or the timing of the strong distal drive required for beta generation could impair throughput in the aligned somatotopic area. First, the strong distal drive to SI could decrease the efficacy of information processing by supragranular inputs to SI. One prominent candidate for this mechanism is recruitment of inhibitory neurons in supragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). Such inputs could also alter distal dendritic processes in large layer V neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larkum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>), the primary contributor to the MEG signals recorded. Alternatively, the generators of the exogenous drive contributing to beta emergence in SI (e.g. bursting in thalamic neurons) could themselves mediate beta’s inhibitory impact on perception at the locale of the exogenous generator (e.g. through a filtering process in the thalamus), in which case the increase in neocortical beta events represents an epiphenominal reflection of this process. Future studies are necessary to test alternative hypotheses and to identify possible cortical or thalamic sources of the exogenous drive.</p><p>Based on the following, we conjecture that the mechanisms of generation of high-power beta events may be distinct from lower-power beta transients, and thus separable in their impact on function. While the distribution of power of all beta local maxima did not show bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ii</xref> inset), several other factors indicated high power beta events were distinct from noise. First, high power beta events were stereotyped in their waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>) and in their spectral features, i.e. the event duration and frequency span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, sliding power cutoff analyses showed that despite the lack of clear bimodality in the full distribution of beta event power, there was a clear switch in the relative importance of event features as the beta event power cutoff was varied. For lower power cutoffs (&lt;~3X median) beta event power is more predictive of averaged prestimulus power and behavior than beta event rate, while for higher cutoffs (&gt;3X median) beta event rate is more predictive. Third, we found that the intervals between consecutive high power beta events were consistent with a bursty process, as opposed to dynamic amplitude modulation of a continuous process. Taken together, our prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>) and current results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the high-power beta events that dominate fluctuations in the averaged prestimulus beta power are distinct in their generation and relationship to function.</p><p>An open question is whether properties of transient rhythms in other frequency bands or sub-bands of beta may underlie observed differences across behavioral conditions. Indeed, transient rhythms emerging for a few cycles have been reported in other bands, including gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greenwood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>) and alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ziegler et al., 2010</xref>). In our human data, power-spectral density analysis shows a single ‘bump’ in the alpha band (7–14 Hz) and a single bump in the beta band (15–29 Hz); whereas the gamma (30–80 Hz) power is not distinquishable from the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). The bump in the beta band emerges primarily between 18–22 Hz, also known as the beta 2 range, and we do not observe a separate bump for the beta 1 range (typically ~15 Hz; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopell et al., 2014</xref>]). We conjecture that this isolated increase in the power spectral density in the beta band is indicative of a singular underlying mechanism. In further support, as discussed above, we have previously shown evidence for a unique mechanism that generates stereotyped and homogeneous beta-band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>). As a follow-up, the current study assessed the behavioral impact of beta’s transient manifestation in detail. Of note, our data also show high power alpha band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). We have observed that alpha and beta have separable correlations with attention and perception. Shifts in averaged alpha power occur sooner after attentional cues than shifts in beta power, and beta showed a stronger linear relationship to detectability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sacchet et al., 2015</xref>). A full quantification of the potential transient nature of alpha and its relationship to beta events would be an interesting future direction.</p><p>The transient nature of high-power spontaneous beta events observed here has direct implications for brain stimulation studies, such as transcranial alternating current (tACS) or magnetic stimulation (TMS), aimed at entraining ‘rhythms’ to causally modulate behavior. Causal manipulations may be more effective if they are designed to match the intermittent character and specific temporal characteristics of the beta events observed. Our results suggest the rate and timing of beta events is a key target for modulation. Specifically, stimulation protocols that drive two or more events in the 1 s prestimulus period may impair perception, whereas blocking such events may benefit perception. Our data predict that driving single events could impair throughput in the aligned somatotopic area, but only if it arrives close to the time of the stimulus.</p><p>In summary, cumulative evidence across tasks, recording modalities, and species support the notion that as opposed to phase-alignment, amplitude modulation, sustained rhythmicity or several other possible means by which transient, high-power beta events could influence behavior (e.g. frequency span), beta event rate has a dominant impact on function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human recordings</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>MEG data collection</title><p>Details of the human MEG recordings and source localization for both the detection and attention tasks have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2007</xref>).

In brief, the stimulus was a single cycle of a 100 Hz sine wave (i.e. 10 ms duration) generated by piezoelectric benders (Noliac). The stimulus was applied to the third digit fingertip of the right hand. Individual subjects’ perceptual thresholds were obtained before imaging by employing a parameter estimation by sequential testing (PEST) convergence procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leek, 2001</xref>), which estimated the threshold to &lt;5 μm precision.</p><p>During MEG imaging, 70% of the trials were maintained at perceptual threshold (50% detection) using a dynamic algorithm. 10% suprathreshold stimuli (100% detection) and 20% null stimuli (catch trials) were randomly interleaved with the threshold stimuli.

The stimulus was delivered at a random time between 500 and 1500 ms after the onset of the auditory cue.

In brief, 10 subjects were instructed to fixate on a cross on a projection screen. Each trial lasted 3500 ms, and began with a 60 dB, 2 kHz tone delivered to both ears, simultaneously accompanied by the fixation cross changing into a visual word cue instructing the subject where to attend; either ‘Hand’ (attend-in condition), ‘Foot’ (attend-out condition) or ‘Either’ location. The tactile stimulus was delivered to the cued location at a randomized time between 1100 ms and 2100 ms after the cue onset. The stimulus was a single cycle of a 100 Hz sine wave (10 ms duration) generated by piezoelectric benders, as in the detection task. Stimuli were applied to the distal pads of the third digit of the left hand or first digit of the left foot, and PEST procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leek, 2001</xref>) was employed before the task to estimate subject’s initial detection threshold for both the hand and the foot.

Continuous data was sampled at 30 kHZ, and off-line downsampled to 1000 Hz.

Components resembling artifact were manually chosen, and denoised signal was reconstructed with the exclusion of the rejected components. This reconstructed signal was used for all further analyses.

Mice were 8–15 weeks at the time of surgery. Animals were individually housed with enrichment toys and maintained on a 12 hr reversed light-dark cycle. All experimental procedures and animal care protocols were approved by Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and were in accordance with US National Institutes of Health guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2-2"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Naive mice were induced with isofluorane gas anesthesia (0.5–2% in oxygen 1 L/min) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. We injected slow-release buprenorphine subcutaneously (0.1 mg/kg; as an analgesic) and dexamethasone intraperitoneally (IP, 4 mg/kg; to prevent tissue swelling). Hair was removed from scalp with hair-removal cream, followed by scalp cleansing with iodine solution and alcohol. Then, skull was exposed by incision. After the skull was cleaned, muscle resection was performed on the left side. A titanium headpost was affixed to the skull with adhesive luting cement (C and B Metabond). Two small stainless-steel watch screws were implanted in the skull plates; one anterior to bregma, one on the right hemisphere. Next, a ~ 1.5 mm–diameter craniotomy was drilled over barrel cortex of the left hemisphere, and subsequently duratomy was performed. The guide tube array (8 by 2 arrangement of 33ga polyimide tubes; 2 mm by 0.5 mm) was centered at 1.25 mm posterior to bregma and 3.25 mm lateral to the midline and angled 45 degrees relative to midline. The drive body was angled 30 degrees relative to the perpendicular direction to compensate for the curvature of barrel cortex. Once the implant was stably positioned, C and B Metabond and dental acrylic (All for Dentist) was placed around its base to seal its place. A drop of surgical lubricant (Surgilube) prevented dental acrylic from contacting the cortical surface. Mice were given at least 3 days to recover before the start of water restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2-3"><title>Trial structure and behavior control</title><p>The behavioral task setup was adapted from a previous study from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siegle et al., 2014</xref>) with slight modifications. Each trial consisted of right-side (contralateral) vibrissae stimulation in the caudorostral direction, with 20 Hz deflections that lasted 500 ms (10 pulses with the same amplitude). The stimulus was delivered through piezoelectric benders (Noliac). Vibrissae on the right side were tied up with a suture loop fed through a glass capillary tube (0.8 mm outer diameter) attached to the piezoelectric bender. Most of the vibrissae were secured about 3 mm from the mystacial pad.</p><p>If the mouse licked within 700 ms relative to the onset of the stimulus, a drop of water was delivered, shortly followed by vacuum suction to remove any remaining water not consumed by the animal. Water delivery and vacuum suction was controlled by a solenoid valve (NResearch) connected with Tygon tubing. Mice received water through a plastic tube, which was positioned near the animal’s mouth using a Noga arm. The water was delivered based on gravitational flow and the volume was controlled by the duration of valve opening (~100 ms), calibrated to give an ~3 µl per opening. Individual licks were detected using beam breaks of IR detector flanking the lick tube. Unlike the human detection task, there was no cue indicating the start of a trial.</p><p>All behavioral events including piezoelectric control, reward delivery, and lick measurements were monitored and controlled in Matlab and interfaced with a combination of Arduino and PCI DIO board (National Instruments, Austin, Texas).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2-4"><title>Behavioral training</title><p>Mice were water restricted for at least 7 days before start of training, during which time mice were acclimated to the head-fixed setup where mice could freely run on a fixed-axis styrofoam ball. Mice were given at least 1 ml per day, calibrated such that mice would not lose weight further than 80% of their original weight before water restriction.</p><p>Training began with reward-all session where vibrissae stimuli were paired with water delivery regardless of the animal’s response. This allowed mice to establish an association between vibrissae deflection and reward, such that the mice learned to lick when they detected the stimulus in anticipation of the reward. Mice learned the association after about a week of reward-all training. After this period reward was only delivered on trials where the mouse licked within 700 ms of the stimulus onset (i.e. reward window).</p><p>The stimulus amplitude was varied on a trial by trial basis between 0 to maximal amplitude (about 1 mm deflection) in a randomized manner. Before the start of each session, the experimenter set the percentage of maximal trials and 0 amplitude (catch) trials. The rest of the trials were submaximal trials, where the stimulus amplitude was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and maximal amplitude. Throughout training, percentage of maximal amplitude trials were gradually lowered to 10%, and percentage of catch trials were gradually increased to 25%.</p><p>Correct rejection trials were trials where the mouse did not lick during the reward window. On the contrary, false positives, where mice did lick during catch trials, led to a time out of 15 s. Further, exploratory licking during inter-trial intervals (ITI, 2–6 s) led to resetting (prolongation) of ITI, and this reset could happen up to 10 times. This prevented excessive impulsive licking.</p><p>If mouse did not consume enough water during the behavior session, supplementary water was given several hours after the conclusion of the session, such that mouse would have drank at least 1 ml of water each day. Mouse weight was monitored throughout the entire duration of training such that their weight would not fall below 80% of their original post-surgery weight. Mice performing the detection task was recorded over a period of ~3 months.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2-5"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Only the behavior sessions that exhibited well-trained behavior were selected for analysis, based on the following criteria: (1) Stereotyped reaction time, as assessed by a clear peak in the reaction time histogram. (2) Goodness of fit for the Boltzmann distribution fit of psychometric performance over the entire session (mean of R-squared across the 10 sessions was 0.91, range was 0.77 ~ 0.99; mean of root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.12, range 0.04 ~ 0.18).</p><p>Threshold level stimulus trials were chosen offline from periods within the &lt;2.5 hr session where the mouse was engaged in the task. Even in well trained mice, there were periods where animals defaulted to non-optimal strategies, such as excessive impulsive licking or non-engagement from satiety or prolonged inattention. To address the issue of exploratory licking that was not in response to detection, hit trials were defined as trials where the animal not only licked within the 700 ms reward window but also did not lick the spout prestimulus up to −1000 ms. In addition, we filtered out the trials between two false positives if there were no misses or correct rejections in between, to exclude periods where the mouse was acting impulsively. To filter out periods where the mouse was not engaged in the task, we looked at trials with strong stimuli (as defined as stimulus at 80% detection, calculated from Boltzmann distribution fit of psychometric performance over the entire session). If three consecutive strong stimuli lead to non-detection and there were no detected trials in between, all trials in between were filtered out.</p><p>We chose stimulus amplitude-matched threshold level detected and non-detected trials for all analyses, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. To do this, we binned all submaximal stimulus amplitude into 15 bins. Detected and non-detected trials were chosen from the high-performance periods to maximize trial count while matching the stimulus amplitude histogram. In all of the sessions analyzed, there were at least 100 stimulus amplitude-matched detected and non-detected trials each (mean 120 trials, range 106 ~ 160).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Common data analysis procedures for human and animal recordings</title><sec id="s4-2-3-1"><title>Evoked response</title><p>The evoked response to suprathreshold tactile stimulus was averaged first for each subject/session, then averaged across subjects/sessions.

To quantify the percentage of significant subjects/sessions, a 95% confidence interval was determined individually for each subject/session by bootstrapping 1000 times.

Therefore, the number of local maxima per ‘non-overlapping beta event’ was quantified, for each behavioral condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11i</xref>). The ‘non-overlapping beta event’ power, duration and frequency span were defined in the same way as the original definition of beta events: Power was defined as the maximum power within the supra-cutoff region; and the ‘non-overlapping beta event’ duration and frequency span were defined as the full-width at half-maximum in the time and frequency domain, respectively (edge cases were handled the same way as section Beta event duration and frequency span).

The jittered ‘non-overlapping beta event’ IEI distribution was generated by randomly jittering the timing of ‘non-overlapping beta events’, within the 1 s prestimulus window of the events’ respective trials. The limiting conditions for the jittering was that (i) the independent events stayed non-overlapping; and (ii) the relative order in which the events occurred within a trial was preserved.

We then determined beta phase and amplitude by Hilbert-transformation of the band-pass filtered data. We chose the Hilbert-amplitude cutoff to be 2X median of beta band-passed Hilbert amplitude cutoff. This cuttoff approximately matched the 6X median of Morlet spectral power cutoff used to define beta events throughout the paper, in that the proportion of timepoints above the cutoff in the 1 s prestimulus window was approximately 10% across subjects/sessions in both cases.</p><p>We then determined the characteristic beta period for each subject/session as the inverse of the characteristic beta frequency. In turn, the characteristic beta frequency for each subject/session was defined as the median of the instantaneous frequency values in the Hilbert-transformation of the beta band-passed data. This characteristic beta period for each subject/session was used to calculate the time lags’ modulo of the beta period, for time lags above and below the amplitude cutoff. Modulo operation calculates the remainder after division; for example, time lag modulo the beta period of 0 would mean that the time lag was an integer multiple of the beta period. To compare across subjects/sessions, we normalized the time lag modulo of the beta period values by the characteristic beta period, such that the normalized values would vary between −0.5 and 0.5.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christopher Black for help with editing figures on Adobe Illustrator and Dr. Manuel Gomez-Ramirez for comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The rate of transient beta frequency events predicts impaired function across tasks and species&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study shows that beta band signals appear as short beta events using human MEG and mouse LFP in barrel cortex, and investigates how apparent change in beta band power and somatosensory detection/attention relate to the event features (i.e. event rate, duration, spectral width, amplitude and timing) within individual trials of tasks. Results show that the event rate of beta consistently correlates with sensory outcome and beta power, and particularly recent events are the strongest predictors.</p><p>All reviewers agree with the novelty and potential importance of findings documented in the manuscript. Though well written, there are many issues that need clarification, and there are several concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study's conclusions are not constrained as long as it is not documented from which neural populations beta events are measured. Enhanced transient beta event rates in a neural population that is not relevant for the near threshold sensory detection would have a fundamentally different functional meaning than a reduced event rate in a neural population that is essentially encoding task relevant information. But the current manuscript version does not disambiguate from which neural populations these events were measured. It is unclear from which sensor level or deep sources the beta events in the human datasets originate, nor is it reported whether the beta events in barrel cortex stem from neural recording sites that were overlapping the stimulation site or not, or from sites with evoked responses to the stimulation.</p><p>Since there are more than 300 sensors measured in the human datasets it might be safe to assume that only a very small portion of them are measuring activity from neural circuits necessary for efficient preparation of the detection response. The enhanced beta event rate may thus be dominated by activity from neural populations that interfere with the task, including from sensory or language related areas, from motor related areas or from prefrontal areas where beta activity may signify activation rather than inhibition. In this situation, it seems necessary that the authors report whether event rates changes were differentially observed in those recording/measurement sites that are apparently task modulated as opposed to those not task modulated.</p><p>Thus, the manuscript should show information about locations of MEG sources and LFP recordings. If signals were from the hand area of somatosensory cortex and barrel cortex, then somatosensory responses to finger taps and whisker deflections are expected. Additionally, those sensory neuronal responses could be susceptible to prior beta events, similarly to behaviorally-indicated sensory detection. In human attention tasks, it is also possible to see beta band of dipole in foot area acting differently from beta band in hand area depending on the cue in each trial.</p><p>In a similar vein, it would be helpful to know whether the beta event rate enhancement was more a frontal / motor preparation related effect, or a sensory association cortex effect.</p><p>2) While the unconventional analysis approach to beta events is timely and interesting, it comes with the risk of &quot;relabeling&quot; something we already know with novel terminology.</p><p>The starting point of the manuscript is the hypothesis that neural activity in the beta frequency band is best described as bursts. While there is certainly some evidence that supports this assumption, it would be good if the authors could also provide some key evidence for this in the current manuscript. Whereas the (implicit) alternative model used by the authors appears to be a model with stationary oscillatory amplitude, it may be more useful here to consider an alternative oscillation-based model with dynamic amplitude modulations.</p><p>There are at least two further analyses that may adjudicate burst vs. dynamic amplitude accounts. First, the authors could provide histograms of Hilbert-transformed amplitude envelope data. If there are two regimes ([no-bursts + noise] and [bursts+noise]), then this should result in amplitude distributions (histograms) with bimodal features (in the clearest case: a separate 'bump' at the participant-specific burst amplitude). Second, the authors may look at the degree of phase-preservation between successive time points as well as between successive bursts. Under a dynamic amplitude account, one would expect consistent phase relations between successive time points / successive &quot;bursts&quot;. In contrast, the bursting account, as far as I understand it, would predict phase independence between beta &quot;oscillations&quot; at successive time points and bursts.</p><p>3) A related issue regards the concern that epochs with prominent (and largely sustained) beta oscillations may be wrongfully classified as epochs with high burst rate. Noise (as well as dynamic amplitude fluctuations) may tip the beta estimates above and below threshold, resulting in multiple &quot;bursts&quot; (e.g., high burst rate) in the authors' analysis. This appears particularly a concern given that most inter-burst-intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) indeed appear to occur within the range of few millisecond only. Have the authors considered imposing a minimum interval between successive bursts (and/or a minimal amplitude relaxation between successive bursts)? Would the same results be obtained?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> (duration ~ 100 ms and intervals of &lt;50 ms) together suggest that many bursts occur as doublets of about 250 ms, or triplets. Is that so? If yes, there should be more to characterize, like the timing of doublets. It may be noted that 250 ms or less is about the duration of the prestimulus period described as when beta events are effective in modulating sensory detection.</p><p>In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows the interval distributions do not differ between behavioral outcomes. It looks inconsistent with that more beta events occur in miss trials than hit trials.</p><p>4) For comparison, it appears key to also include outcomes of regular power analyses when relating neural activity to behavioral performance, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (for the 1s pre-stimulus epoch) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (power as a function of time). Are events features (rate) really better predictors of performance than conventional power estimates?</p><p>5) The authors limit analysis to the beta frequency range, but in the discussion mention alpha and gamma bands. One might expect these frequency ranges to be modulated as well at least in a fraction of sensors and recording sites. Why did the authors not add a brief summary analysis on whether similar findings as the beta event rate changes might be obtained with alpha and gamma ? In that way one immediately can discern whether the findings have clear frequency specificity, or whether similar effects can be expected in other bands with clear power spectral peaks. Either of these results would be highly informative.</p><p>If the authors find this analysis would exceed the scope of the study, the discussion on alpha and gamma should be shortened and instead a discussion of the possibly different functional roles of the beta frequency (sub)ranges is included to discern better why the analysis concentrates on this band and whether the authors suggest that the band represents some homogeneous underlying sources (or not).</p><p>Also, there is evidence that rolandic alpha oscillations also predict somatosensory performance and are modulated by somatosensory attention. Have the authors considered extending their analyses to this frequency range?</p><p>6) What was the proportion of trials in each dataset with at least one event (the inclusion criteria) in correct and error trials? Without this information, it is difficult to discern how important the beta events would be to predict trial-by-trial performance. A discussion of the overall effect size considering this number would be very interesting to readers – this is particularly relevant with regard to the stimulation approaches that would want to utilize event like stimulation protocols.</p><p>Do the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8 (i)</xref> derived from all trials or a fraction of trials that had beta events? Event rate can be derived in both ways. Blue and red curves in the figure should be derived from all detected and non-detected trials respectively.</p><p>Which trials were used to derive the threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? All Hit, Miss, FA, and catch trials?</p><p>Would the strength of the correlations look very different when including these zero event trials as zero's and using Spearman instead of Pearson correlations?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29086.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study's conclusions are not constrained as long as it is not documented from which neural populations beta events are measured.

The data from both the human detection and attention datasets represents activity from a dipole signal source localized to the hand area of SI. This was detailed in our prior publications (Jones et al., 2010, Jones et al., 2007) but not clearly stated in the current paper. In the mouse dataset, the chronic electrode implant (flexDrive, Voigts et al., 2013) was positioned over barrel cortex during a stereotaxic surgery and recording sites had a clear evoked response in the local field potentials in response to vibrissae deflections.</p><p>We have clarified these issues in several ways.</p><p>1) We have added a new figure that shows the tactile evoked response in the area recorded from the human and mouse data sets: see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> is discussed in our response to reviewers’ comment (1)).</p><p>2) We have added the details of the localization methods in “Mean prestimulus beta power is higher on non-detected and attend-out trials” section of Results, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend.</p><p>3) We state details of the human source localization in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Dipole activity from a suprathreshold level stimulus to the third digit of the right hand was localized to the postcentral gyrus in the contralateral hand area of SI using least-squares fit inverse methods and individualized structural MRIs, or a spherically symmetric conductor model of the head (Hamalainen &amp; Sarvas 1989). All analyses presented in this paper are derived from the forward solution from this source-localized region of interest.”</p><p>We state details of the mouse electrode implant in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“The guide tube array (8 by 2 arrangement of 33ga polyimide tubes; 2 mm by 0.5 mm) was centered at 1.25 mm posterior to bregma and 3.25 mm lateral to the midline and angled 45 degrees relative to midline. The drive body was angled 30 degrees relative to the perpendicular direction to compensate for the curvature of barrel cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, those sensory neuronal responses could be susceptible to prior beta events, similarly to behaviorally-indicated sensory detection.

However, given that the goal of the current paper was to inspect what features of transient beta “events” contribute to beta’s impact on function, we limited our analysis to the primary somatosensory area, where we have previously reported that beta robustly affects function (Jones et al., 2010, Jones et al., 2009). In addition, the striking homology of beta dynamics between the human datasets and the mouse dataset is a main thesis of our paper, and given that the mouse recordings were only conducted in the primary somatosensory areas, we would not be able to draw similar parallels for other regions of the brain. Therefore, we feel that it is beyond the scope of our paper, which already presents analyses in two tasks and two species, to characterize beta dynamics in other brain regions. Other studies recording LFPs in monkeys have studied the transient properties of beta oscillations and their relevance to function in other brain areas, including motor cortex (Lundqvist et al., 2016, Rule et al., 2017) and basal ganglia (Feingold et al., 2015). These papers are discussed in our Introduction and Discussion sections.</p><p>Of further note, the postcentral gyrus in the hand area of SI is particularly suitable for applying the inverse solution to extract source-localized data using MEG, due to its dendritic alignment being tangential to the MEG sensors. In prior analyses, we failed to reconstruct consistent dipoles from the foot localization data using the standard equivalent current dipoles localization techniques described above; therefore, we only analyzed and presented activity of the hand area. This fact is detailed in a prior report (Jones et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the unconventional analysis approach to beta events is timely and interesting, it comes with the risk of &quot;relabeling&quot; something we already know with novel terminology.</p><p>The starting point of the manuscript is the hypothesis that neural activity in the beta frequency band is best described as bursts.

As detailed below, we performed the suggested additional analyses and found they provide further evidence that SI beta rhythms are transient and “bursty” rather than rhythmic. This new result is included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>.</p><p>Before we dive into our new analyses, we would first like to emphasize that in our view, the event-like properties of beta is most notable in its stereotyped waveform when <italic>preselected</italic> for high beta power, as extensively characterized in a prior publication from our group (Sherman et al., 2016). In good agreement with this idea, in the present paper we found that high power beta events (above 6X median power cutoff) indeed have stereotyped spectral features, where the duration and frequency span have less variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we further found that such high power regions explain most of the trial-by-trial fluctuations in beta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), suggesting that these high-power beta events may dominate beta’s impact on function. Given this emphasis on the stereotypy of the waveform (Sherman et al., 2016) and resultant spectral features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), bimodality in spectral power is not a prerequisite for “burstiness” of beta events. To make this view more explicit, we added a discussion of this topic in the Discussion section of our paper.</p><p>Indeed, the histograms of Hilbert-transformed amplitude envelope analysis (as directly suggested by the reviewer) did not show a consistent pattern of bimodality in beta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although there are hints of bimodality in some subjects / sessions, these distributions overall do not provide compelling evidence that the distribution is bimodal (see also inset in Figure 4ii for histogram of beta local maxima power).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Hilbert-transformed amplitude histograms do not consistently show bimodality.</title><p>Hilbert-transformed amplitude histograms of band-pass (14~29Hz) filtered data for each subject / session in A.

The Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis predicts that an ongoing continuous rhythm exists, whose amplitude is dynamically modulated. Under this hypothesis, the rhythmicity of the beta component of the signal would be independent of its amplitude (i.e. spectral power). In contrast, the Bursty Generator hypothesis assumes that the generator that triggers the beta waveform also causes the transient surge in beta amplitude. Under this hypothesis, beta rhythmicity is only present when this generator triggers the system; therefore, rhythmicity is restricted to high beta power regions of the data. The contrasting predictions of these two competing hypotheses can be tested by choosing an amplitude (power) cutoff, and comparing the rhythmicity in regions above and below the cutoff.</p><p>The intuition behind this analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>: As diagrammed, we assessed whether or not rhythmicity was maintained by comparing the time lag between first and last peaks in the oscillation within a high power region, or last and first peaks in consecutive regions with a low power region in between. Specifically, we band-passed the data and performed a Hilbert transform to calculate the time lag modulo the beta period for these regions. These values were plotted as functions of the normalized modulo (remainder after division) that varied between -0.5 and 0.5, where 0 corresponds to integer multiples of the beta period. The “time lag above cutoff” (red periods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>) were calculated as the time between the first (orange dot) and last (brown dot) 0° phase time points in each supra-cutoff region, where 0° phase denotes the peak points in the oscillation (marked with grey / orange / brown dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref> schematic). The “time lag below cutoff” was calculated as the time between the last 0° phase timepoint in the preceding supra-cutoff region and the first 0° phase timepoint in the succeeding supra-cutoff region. With this definition, we would expect the time lags to be integer multiples of the beta period in rhythmic regions, i.e. we would expect the modulo of the beta period to be around 0.</p><p>Under the Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis, where a sustained oscillation is being modulated in amplitude, we would expect both the time lags above (red) and below (blue) the cutoff to be rhythmic, hence the time lag modulo the beta period distributions should both be centered at 0 (lower panels in Figure 12Ai). In contrast, the Bursty Generator hypothesis would predict that supra-cutoff regions would be rhythmic, whereas sub-cutoff regions are not; therefore, the time lag modulo the beta period distributions would be centered at 0 for time lags above cutoff (red), whereas the distribution would be flat for time lags below cutoff (blue) (lower panels in Figure 12Aii).</p><p>We chose the Hilbert-amplitude cutoff (cyan horizontal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>) such that it was comparable to the 6X median power cutoff in the Morlet spectrogram analysis, in that there was a similar percentage of time points above the cutoff in the beta band (~10%). We determined the characteristic beta period for each subject / session as the inverse of the characteristic beta frequency. The characteristic beta frequency in turn was defined as the median of the instantaneous frequency values in the Hilbert-transformation of the beta band-passed data. This characteristic beta period was used to calculate the time lags’ modulo of the beta period and to normalize to range between -0.5 and 0.5.</p><p>To account for the possibility that rhythmicity may decay over time, we first performed histogram matching of time lags above and below cutoff such that the number of beta cycles in the time lags being compared was matched. The modulo probability histograms for the matched time lags above and below the amplitude cutoff are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref> for each dataset (i-iii). These probability histograms show that time lags above cutoff are integer multiples of the beta period (i.e. distributions are centered at 0), in direct contrast to time lags below cutoff that are not (i.e. distributions are flat).</p><p>Overall, these results strongly support the prediction that high power regions are rhythmic but low power regions are not, providing evidence for the Bursty Generator hypothesis over the Dynamic Amplitude Modulation hypothesis.</p><p>We added these results and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> in a new section of the Results subtitled, “BETA events are generated by a bursty mechanism, rather than by dynamic amplitude modulation of sustained beta oscillation”.

Have the authors considered imposing a minimum interval between successive bursts (and/or a minimal amplitude relaxation between successive bursts)? Would the same results be obtained?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the close reading, and confirm the reviewer’s observation that in our original definition of events, multiple events could occur within one continuous high-power (above power cutoff) region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we considered an alternative definition of an event and applied the same analyses. In the new definition, we considered each continuous supra-cutoff temporal region in the spectrogram to be an event. With this approach, each successive event would be separated by sub-cutoff periods, effectively imposing a “minimal amplitude relaxation between successive bursts” as suggested by the reviewer. We term events using this redefinition “non-overlapping events.” As before, event power is defined as the maximal power within the supra-cutoff region, and event duration and frequency span are defined as the full-width at half-maximum in the time and frequency domain, respectively. Summary of our main results for non-overlapping events is plotted in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, shown below.</p><p>Despite the complete abolition of the Inter-Event-Intervals (IEI) that “occur within the range of a few millisecond only” (Figure 11ii), we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11i</xref> that most (~80%) of the “non-overlapping events” have only one local maxima in a single continuous supra-cutoff region. In other words, ~80% of “non-overlapping events” were also identified as an event in our original definition. Given this high congruency between the original event definition and the alternative “non-overlapping event” definition, it is not surprising that we found most of the results obtained from the original definition of events to hold in this redefinition. The following is a further elaboration of the agreement in results.</p><p>First, we find that the “non-overlapping events” do not occur rhythmically. The IEI histogram starts at zero and rises to a peak near 200ms (Figure 11ii), likely due to the refractory period imposed by the constraint of “minimal amplitude relaxation between successive bursts”. Alternatively, it is possible that the peak near 200ms was reflective of underlying rhythmicity. To test for the presence or lack of rhythmicity in IEI of “non-overlapping events”, we constructed jittered IEI distributions (Figure 11ii, black curve, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> legend for details). Neither the IEI distributions in the detected nor the non-detected (the attend-in nor the attend-out) trials are distinct from the jittered distributions, suggesting that non-overlapping events do not occur rhythmically in either behavioral condition. This further corroborates our original conclusion that beta event generation in our data is not rhythmic. Note, these conclusions are again limited by our restriction to the 1 second prestimulus period and the fact that only trials with ≥ 2 events were considered (i.e., ~30% of the trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>), as was the case for the original definition of events.</p><p>We further tested whether the conclusions regarding the influence of beta events on mean power and behavior held with this redefinition. In good agreement with our original definition of events, the number of “non-overlapping events” best correlated with trial mean prestimulus beta power (Figure 11iii, Friedman test followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test, with Holm-Bonferroni correction) and was the most consistent predictor of behavior across species and tasks, as measured with detect / attend probabilities (Figure 11iv).</p><p>We have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and describe it in the “BETA events did not occur rhythmically” section of Results, and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> (duration ~ 100 ms and intervals of &lt;50 ms) together suggest that many bursts occur as doublets of about 250 ms, or triplets. Is that so? If yes, there should be more to characterize, like the timing of doublets. It may be noted that 250 ms or less is about the duration of the prestimulus period described as when beta events are effective in modulating sensory detection.</p></disp-quote><p>We think there was some confusion about our definition of IEI. It appears the reviewer interpreted the IEI to be the interval between the end of a previous burst and the beginning of the next burst (hence the 100+50+100=250ms calculation). Rather, our definition was based on timing between two consecutive maxima in the beta band (see Materials and methods). As such, two or more maxima (beta events) could occur within one continuous supra-cutoff region, and create an IEI of &lt;50ms. Per this comment, and that above, we performed a new analysis of IEI with “non-overlapping events” (see above). This analysis revealed that most supra-cutoff regions had a single event (~80%). In particular, this high preservation of events from the old to the new definition was non-differential for behavioral outcomes / conditions; i.e. given an event, the probability that it would be a multi-maxima event was not higher or lower in non-detected trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11i</xref>). Therefore, we would not expect the single-maxima events (which is an event in both the old and the new definition) and the multi-maxima events (which is multiple events in the old definition but one event in the new definition) to influence behavior differentially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows the interval distributions do not differ between behavioral outcomes. It looks inconsistent with that more beta events occur in miss trials than hit trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that one would typically expect rate and inter event interval (IEI) distribution to be related. The apparent discrepancy stems from the constraint that IEI by definition could only be calculated in trials that had ≥2 events in the 1 second prestimulus window, and most (~70%) trials had 0 or 1 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). As such, the IEI analysis was restricted to only the remaining ~30% trials with ≥2 events, and we cannot expect the typical rate to interval relation to hold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For comparison, it appears key to also include outcomes of regular power analyses when relating neural activity to behavioral performance, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (for the 1s pre-stimulus epoch) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (power as a function of time). Are events features (rate) really better predictors of performance than conventional power estimates?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and would like to first emphasize that the goal of our analysis was to determine which event feature(s) contribute to statistically significant differences in average prestimulus power, rather than to determine if any one of the features was a “better” predictor than averaged power. Many prior studies, including our own, have established that averaged prestimulus power robustly predicts behavior. Yet, knowledge of how beta rhythms impacts behavior remains relatively unknown. In our view, a key step in uncovering beta’s role in function is to understand features of the prestimulus ‘rhythm’ that contribute to observed average power differences.</p><p>We note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in our paper is already one of the figures requested by the reviewer: “outcomes of regular power analyses when relating neural activity to behavioral performance, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (for the 1s pre-stimulus epoch)”.Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> results shows event number is not a better (nor worse) predictor of perception / attention than averaged power. When considering averaged prestimulus power, 50% of subjects in human detection and 50% sessions in mouse detection had DP significantly less than 0.5, and 10% of subjects in human attention had AP significantly less than 0.5; in comparison, the% of subjects / sessions values for event number were 40%, 40%, and 20% in each dataset, respectively (see Figure 1iv parentheses).</p><p>In addition, a newly added analysis calculating the effect size as Cohen’s d (see our response to reviewers’ comment (6), and Materials and methods) shows that effect sizes are similar for trial mean prestimulus beta power (1.3 for human detection, 1.69 for mouse detection, 0.94 for human attention; see Figure 1iii) and event number (1.15 for human detection, 1.97 for mouse detection, 0.88 for human attention; see Figure 7iii).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is also important to display averaged power as a function of time, to show that the 1 second prestimulus window was an appropriate choice for assessing beta’s impact on function, and to assess whether beta power difference is more prominent closer to the time of the stimulus. We have added this additional analysis as a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>), which shows that beta power is higher on non-detected / attend-out trials throughout the prestimulus window. Further, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref> depicts event rate time histograms across the 1 second prestimulus window, which similarly supports that differences in the rate of events across behavioral outcomes / conditions are distributed in the prestimulus period.</p><p>The results pertaining to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7i</xref> are discussed in the Results section.</p><p>It is worth noting that these added figures are distinct from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8i</xref>, which depicts the histogram of the timing of the single beta event closest to the stimulus (i.e., a single “most recent event” per trial), rather than a time histogram of the event rate of all events before the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors limit analysis to the beta frequency range, but in the discussion mention alpha and gamma bands. One might expect these frequency ranges to be modulated as well at least in a fraction of sensors and recording sites. Why did the authors not add a brief summary analysis on whether similar findings as the beta event rate changes might be obtained with alpha and gamma ? In that way one immediately can discern whether the findings have clear frequency specificity, or whether similar effects can be expected in other bands with clear power spectral peaks. Either of these results would be highly informative.</p><p>If the authors find this analysis would exceed the scope of the study, the discussion on alpha and gamma should be shortened and instead a discussion of the possibly different functional roles of the beta frequency (sub)ranges is included to discern better why the analysis concentrates on this band and whether the authors suggest that the band represents some homogeneous underlying sources (or not).</p><p>Also, there is evidence that rolandic alpha oscillations also predict somatosensory performance and are modulated by somatosensory attention. Have the authors considered extending their analyses to this frequency range?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer than an investigation of other frequency bands is of high interest. ALPHA in particular is relevant in our data, as our prior publications show that averaged SI alpha power also shifts with attention and predicts perception (Jones et al., 2010). Further, alpha band activity also appears to be event like in our data (Jones et al., 2009), however this fact has not yet been fully characterized. Of note, in our macroscale human data gamma power is not distinguishable from the dominant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> trend.</p><p>While of high interest, we feel a full analysis of alpha band activity is beyond the scope of our current study. First, our group has recently established a new theory about the origin of transient neocortical beta rhythms (Sherman et al., 2016). Therefore, as a direct next analysis, we were most interested in assessing the behavioral impact of such transient properties for beta rhythms. Second, we have observed that alpha and beta have separable effects on attention and perception. Shifts in averaged alpha power occur sooner after attentional cues than shifts in beta power, and beta showed a stronger linear relationship to detectability (Jones et al., 2010, Sacchet et al., 2015). We view these alpha dynamics as distinct and equally important as beta dynamics, and deserving of a full analysis. Our paper is already covering many new ideas and analysis methods, and includes beta dynamics across two tasks, two recording modalities and two species. As such, we think including alpha would expand beyond the scope of this study but provides food for future analysis.</p><p>To directly follow the reviewer’s advice, we have shortened the discussion of alpha and gamma oscillations and updated the text in the Discussion:</p><p>“Of note, our data also show high power alpha band activity (Jones et al., 2010, Jones et al., 2009). We have observed that alpha and beta have separable correlations with attention and perception. Shifts in averaged alpha power occur sooner after attentional cues than shifts in beta power, and beta showed a stronger linear relationship to detectability (Jones et al., 2010, Sacchet et al., 2015). A full quantification of the potential transient nature of alpha and its relationship to beta events would be an interesting future direction.”</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that the potential import of ‘(sub) ranges of beta’ merits a more focused discussion than was present in the original paper. In our data, we consistently find only a single distinct ‘bump’ in the power spectra in the beta band, as shown in prior publications from our group (Jones et al., 2009). We also believe that SI beta that modulates somatosensory perception is generated by a unique mechanism that manifests as homogeneous, stereotyped waveform features (Sherman et al., 2016). To directly meet the concerns of the reviewer, we now discuss this homogeneity in the beta band as follows:</p><p>“In our human data, power-spectral density analysis shows a single “bump” in the alpha band (7-14 Hz) and a single bump in the beta band (15-29 Hz); whereas the gamma (30-80 Hz) power is not distinquishable from the<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> trend (Jones et al., 2009). The bump in the beta band emerges primarily between 18-22 Hz, also known as the beta 2 range, and we do not observe a separate bump for the beta 1 range (typically ~15Hz; (Kopell et al., 2014)). We conjecture that this isolated increase in the power spectral density in the beta band is indicative of a singular underlying mechanism. In further support, as discussed above, we have previously shown evidence for a unique mechanism that generates stereotyped and homogeneous beta-band activity (Sherman et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What was the proportion of trials in each dataset with at least one event (the inclusion criteria) in correct and error trials? Without this information, it is difficult to discern how important the beta events would be to predict trial-by-trial performance.

Given that our optimal criterion was 2 for most subjects / sessions, we also calculated the effect size for the proportion of trials with 2 or more events (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Although the effect size for the proportion of trials with 1 or more events was quite high, the proportion of trials with 2 or more events had a higher effect size in all three datasets.</p><p>It is worth noting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2i</xref> that the proportion of trials with 1 event was not substantially different between behavioral outcomes / conditions. Likewise, the corresponding effect size for the proportion of trials with 1 event was not high (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In contrast, the effect size for the proportion of trials with 0 events (which is same in absolute value but negative in sign of effect size for the proportion of trials with 1 or more events) was much larger in absolute value. Therefore, we surmise that stimulation protocols that drive two or more events in the 1 second period may impair perception, whereas blocking events from happening in the 1 second prestimulus period (i.e. 0 events) may benefit perception.</p><p>In trials where there is just one event (~30% of all trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>), other event features may contain more information about the behavioral condition.

Indeed, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2iii</xref> shows that the event timing is significantly (p&lt;0.05) closer to the stimulus onset on non-detected trials in the human detection dataset, and trends toward significance (p&lt;0.1) in the mouse detection dataset (right-tailed paired t-test). We would not expect there to be a difference in timing relative to the stimulus onset in the different attention conditions, as the cue instructing where to attend (attend-in vs attend-out) was ultimately what lead to the differences in beta dynamics, and the timing of the cue relative to the stimulus onset was randomized in this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2Ciii</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the actual number of events contains more information than quantification of the mere presence or absence of events.</p><p>These new results are now described in Results section “Non-detected trials were more likely to have a prestimulus beta event closer to the time of the stimulus<italic>”</italic>, and discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8(i)</xref> derived from all trials or a fraction of trials that had beta events?

To directly address this concern we performed two additional analyses, as described further below: (1) the Spearman analysis as suggested, and (2) a multiple linear regression analysis. These further analyses corroborated our original findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">3</xref>). However, we decided to keep the original analyses (Pearson’s correlation with zero event trials excluded for trial mean event power, duration and F-span) in the paper, as setting these values as zero in the large number of zero event trials (40% see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>) would significantly underestimate their average values and ultimately not change the conclusions of our study, as elaborated below.</p><p>We have however made two adjustments in the paper to strengthen our statistical analyses pertaining to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. First, we employed the Friedman’s test before applying the pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank tests. We chose the non-parametric Friedman’s test rather than repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) since rmANOVA assumptions of normality and equal variance were not consistently met. Second, we have corrected for multiple comparisons in the pairwise Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Further details are described in our response to reviewers’ comment (13) and in the revised paper (Results section and Materials and methods).</p><p>1) Here, we detail our application of the Spearman’s correlation as suggested by the reviewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We first calculated the Spearman’s correlation with trial mean prestimulus beta power, for each subject / session in each dataset. All trials were included for all features by setting trial mean event power, duration and frequency span as zero for zero event trials.</p><p>Before assessing statistical differences between distributions of Spearman’s correlation values with rmANOVA, we checked for rmANOVA assumptions; i.e. the normality assumption and the equal variance assumption. We checked for normality using the Lilliefors test. Of the 12 (4 features, 3 datasets) distributions of Spearman’s correlation values, all but the trial mean event duration in the human detection data (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.026</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) were not significantly different from a normal distribution.

Significance determined at p&lt;0.05 are summarized with asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Results are in general agreement with our original analysis, with the difference that event number and event power comparison was not significant in the human detection dataset nor the human attention dataset.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Spearman’s correlation with trial mean prestimulus beta power.</title><p>All trials were included for all features, and trial mean event power, duration and frequency span as zero for zero event trials.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29086-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>2) For thoroughness, we also conducted multiple linear regression with event number, trial mean event power, duration and F-span as regressors and the trial mean prestimulus beta power as the dependent variable. Multiple linear regression is appropriate here since all trials are included for all event parameters, and it has an advantage over Spearman’s correlation in that it can assess the relative contribution of each regressor while controlling for other regressors. To keep the spirit of Spearman’s (rank) correlation, the multiple linear regression was done with trial ranks as regressors, where the trial ranks were based on each event feature respectively, rather than raw values for trial summary of event features. The following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> depicts the slope values for each regressor, where multiple linear regression was done separately for each subject in each dataset.</p><p>To assess significance, here we applied rmANOVA since assumptions of normality and equal variance were found to be valid in all cases, and found that the regression slope distributions were significantly different in all three datasets (p=1.43×10<sup>-14</sup>, df=3, F=96.9 for human detection dataset; p=8.03×10<sup>-20</sup>, df=3, F=250.9 for mouse detection dataset; p=8.49×10<sup>-18</sup>, df=3, F=174.9 for human attention dataset). To compare across features, we applied post-hoc paired t-test with Holm-Bonferroni corrections; since the normality assumption was valid, we applied this parametric test rather than Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results are depicted with asterisks, p&lt;0.05 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>. In agreement with our original analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), event number rank was a significantly better regressor of trial mean power rank in terms of slope compared to ranks of trial mean event power, duration and F-span in all three datasets. This suggests that the superiority of event number in its correlation with mean power is not solely driven by the fact that it had a wider dynamic range than other features it was being compared to.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Multiple linear regression slopes, with trial mean prestimulus beta power as the response variable and the four trial summary event features as regressors.</title><p>All trials were included for all four features; trial mean event power, duration and frequency span were defined as zero for zero event trials.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29086-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
