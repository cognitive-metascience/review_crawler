manipulations. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of human naïve pluripotency remain poorly understood. Using the human inducible reprogramming system together with the 5iLAF naïve induction strategy, integrative analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics across the transition from human fibroblasts to naïve iPSCs revealed ordered waves of gene network activation sharing signatures with those found during embryonic development from late embryogenesis to pre-implantation stages. More importantly, Transcriptional analysis showed a significant transient reactivation of transcripts with 8-cell-stage-like characteristics in the late stage of reprogramming, suggesting transient activation of gene network with human zygotic genome activation (ZGA)-like signatures during the establishment of naïve pluripotency. Together, Dissecting the naïve reprogramming dynamics by integrative analysis improves the understanding of the molecular features involved in the generation of naïve pluripotency directly from somatic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>naive state</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB964601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 14YF1403900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 15XD1503500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0100400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31325019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During reprogramming of human fibroblasts to naïve iPSCs there is transient reactivation of transcripts with the characteristics of 8-cell-stage-embryos.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pluripotent state, emerging during the development of embryos from the totipotent zygote stage into the blastocyst stage in vivo, can be captured indefinitely in vitro as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Moreover, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) further demonstrates that pluripotency can be re-captured directly from somatic cells. Previous studies have demonstrated distinct properties in human ESCs/iPSCs compared with mouse ESCs/iPSCs with regard to cell morphology, transcriptional profiles, signaling requirements and epigenetic modifications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). Human ESCs/iPSCs represent a primed pluripotent state corresponding to the post-implantation epiblast; while mouse ESCs/iPSCs represent a naïve state of pluripotency found in the pre-implantation blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ware, 2017</xref>). Recent advances have allowed the development of several strategies to achieve human naïve pluripotency through genetic or chemical manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gafni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ware et al., 2014</xref>). Rigorous molecular criteria for the evaluation of human naïve pluripotency have also been defined through systematic comparisons among naïve pluripotent cell lines derived via different strategies, primed pluripotent cell lines and human pre-implantation embryos(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davidson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dodsworth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The widely used 5iLAF culture system allows the establishment of naïve pluripotency in different types of human cells, including cells from pre-implantation embryos, primed pluripotent stem cells, and even somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pastor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). However, in-depth mechanistic studies exploring naïve pluripotency establishment during these reprogramming processes are still lacking, owing to the low efficiency of reprogramming and the high heterogeneity of the reprogramming cells. The human inducible reprogramming system recently developed by Cacchiarelli and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>) enables high-resolution analysis throughout the reprogramming process, thus providing a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular roadmap of the gain of naïve pluripotency directly from somatic cells.</p><p>In this study, we utilized the human secondary reprogramming system together with the 5iLAF naïve induction system to systematically characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics involved in the transition from fibroblast cells to naïve pluripotent cells at base resolution. Integrative analysis revealed ordered gene network activation that shared signatures with embryogenesis from the post-implantation to pre-implantation stages, with a transient wave of 8-cell-specific transcripts expression in the late stage of naïve reprogramming, suggesting the activation of gene networks with human zygotic genome activation (ZGA)-like characteristics during naïve pluripotency establishment. Altogether, dissecting the dynamics during naïve induction process provides a comprehensive analysis of the naïve pluripotency reprogramming roadmap, which improves the understating of molecular networks in human naïve pluripotency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of inducible naïve reprogramming system in human</title><p>To establish the secondary naïve iPSCs induction system in human, we first reprogrammed primary human embryonic fibroblasts (1° hEF) to primary primed iPSCs (1° piPSCs) by using the doxycycline (dox)-inducible polycistronic human OSKM cassette, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2008</xref>). After the differentiation of clonal 1° piPSCs, the resultant secondary human inducible fibroblast-like cells (2° hiF) were reprogrammed into iPSCs at naïve pluripotent state by 5iLAF with dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>), the 2° hiFs showed significantly decreased proliferation ability and naïve reprogramming efficiency, as well as increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity with long-term culturing and passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>); these effects were rescued by immortalizing the 2° hiF cell lines (2° hiF-T) with constitutive human <italic>TERT</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>Upon dox treatment, morphological changes occurred in hiF-T cells at approximately day 2, and small cell aggregates were observed as early as day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dome-shaped colonies emerged and expanded after the culture conditions were changed from conventional hESC medium (hESM) to 5iLAF medium on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 20 days of induction, the cells were further cultured under dox-withdrawal conditions for 4 days before clonal expansion, to establish the secondary naïve iPSC lines (niPSC-Ts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also used the OCT4-ΔPE-GFP reporter system to monitor the activation of the OCT4 distal enhancer (DE), the molecular signature of ground state pluripotency, during human naïve reprogramming. GFP<sup>+</sup> colonies were observed at day 20 of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and were increased during the reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), reaching ~91.4% in clonally derived niPSC-Ts, as detected by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunostaining results of the derived niPSC-Ts exhibited robust expression of core pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and TRA-1–60) and naïve pluripotency markers (DPPA3 and UTF1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In agreement with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pastor et al., 2016</xref>), almost all niPSC-Ts were negative for SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, using the dox-inducible system and 5iLAF naïve reprogramming strategy, we established a stable and reliable system for the integrative study of the transcriptional and epigenetic roadmap to human naïve pluripotency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29518.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of the secondary naïve iPSC induction system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative bright field images of hiF-Ts, niPSC-Ts and reprogramming cells at the indicated time points during reprogramming.

The Pearson correlation distance analysis of mRNAs segregated the cell samples into three distinct categories including hiF-T/0d/2d/6d, 8d/12d and 14d/20d/24d+dox/24d-dox/niPSC-T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the basis of the dynamics of the differentially expressed (DE) genes during naïve reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis exhibited a continuous trajectory of transcriptional dynamics from hiF-Ts to established niPSC-Ts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, distinct from the results for the primed reprogramming system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>), the cellular states at days 20–24 during naïve reprogramming were similar, and dox withdrawal did not result in dramatic transcriptional changes in the cells on day 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), thus further suggesting the intrinsic differences between naïve and primed pluripotency. Compared with those in the primed reprogramming system, the epiblast-specific markers representing naïve pluripotency were gradually up-regulated (one-tailed t-test p-value=5.99e-22), whereas the primed-specific genes were gradually down-regulated (one-tailed t-test p-value=1.67e-3) during the naïve pluripotency induction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

More importantly, pluripotency-associated gene networks were also activated in two waves; the earlier one consisted of genes with an early embryogenesis signature such as gradual up-regulation of <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> from day 2, whereas the later one comprised genes with pre-implantation characteristics, such as <italic>DPPA3</italic> and <italic>TFCP2L1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the transiently up-regulated genes during naïve reprogramming, the first transient wave peaked at day eight and was enriched in genes characteristic of late embryogenesis and pattern specification, such as <italic>LHX9</italic> and the <italic>HOX</italic> cluster genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The second wave peaked around day 12–14 and included metabolism-associated genes, such as <italic>IGF2</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The third wave, which peaked during the late reprogramming process at approximately day 24, was enriched in genes important for gamete generation (Fisher’s exact test p-value=1.934e-3) and sexual reproduction (Fisher’s exact test p-value=3.517e-3), such as <italic>OVOL1</italic> and <italic>CGB5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the gene expression program with pre-implantation-like signatures exhibited significantly different dynamics in naïve compared with primed reprogramming systems, which exhibited robust up-regulation along the naïve reprogramming process, peaking in niPSC-Ts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). However, such expression was lost upon dox withdrawal and iPSC-T derivation during primed reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>), results consistent with the MDS analysis results in both reprogramming systems, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, in comparing the transcriptional profiles between the naïve reprogramming process of hiF-Ts to niPSC-Ts and human early embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2013</xref>), we found that the reprogramming cells at day 20 and 24 and niPSC-Ts most closely resembled human embryos at the late blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Immunostaining of the pre-implantation marker DPPA3 and early embryogenesis marker UTF1 in the reprogramming cells at day 20 and day 24 in both induction systems also confirmed our observations in the transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to the primed reprogramming system, in which the transcriptional profile finally dropped to the post-implantation-like stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>), the derivation of naïve iPSCs was accompanied by ordered waves of gene network activation, with the gene program finally stabilizing at the pre-implantation-like stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Gene network activation with 8-cell-stage-like characteristics during naïve reprogramming</title><p>During human embryo development, the major wave of embryonic genome activation (EGA) occurs at approximately day three at ~8 cell (8C) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niakan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vassena et al., 2011</xref>), times corresponding to the major wave of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the 2 cell stage in mice, which is a key transcriptional feature of totipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Latham and Schultz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schultz, 2002</xref>). By analyzing single cell RNA-seq datasets of human early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2013</xref>), we identified 538 genes with expression levels peaking at the 8C stage during human embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), including the previously reported EGA regulators with PRD-like homeodomains such as <italic>DUXA</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic> and <italic>LEUTX</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Töhönen et al., 2015</xref>). Further investigation revealed that these 8C-genes were significantly enriched in the cluster including genes important for gamete generation (Fisher’s exact test p-value=3.784322e-08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and exhibited similar transiently up-regulated expression patterns during the late stages of naïve reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition to <italic>ZSCAN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), whose mouse homologs are 2C-stage restricted and are important for telomere stability in mouse ESCs and iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zalzman et al., 2010</xref>); we also identified <italic>KLF17</italic>, <italic>TBX20</italic> and some <italic>PRAMEF</italic> family genes including <italic>PRAMEF15</italic>, <italic>PRAMEF5 etc</italic>. in the 8C-stage category with transiently enhanced transcription activity during late stages of naïve reprogramming but not in the primed reprogramming system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). More importantly, we identified <italic>MBD3L2/3/4/5</italic> genes as 8C-genes during human embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>); these genes are the homologs of the mouse <italic>Mbd3l2</italic> gene, which is specifically expressed at the 2C stage during mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>). Similar to the genes listed above, the transcriptional dynamics of <italic>MBD3L2/3/4/5</italic> also showed dramatically increased expression during the late stages of naïve reprogramming from day 20 to 24 even after dox withdrawal, then decreased sharply after niPSC-T derivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). However, during the primed reprogramming, we observed only a small transient wave of <italic>ZSCAN4</italic> expression during the late stages from day 20 to day 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and only marginal <italic>MBD3L2/3/4/5</italic> expression throughout the induction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>MBD3L2/3/4/5</italic> genes are loci-clustered in the human genome and are far from <italic>MBD3L1</italic>. Although these genes exhibited differential mRNA expression levels, the amino acid sequences of each gene in the cluster are identical, thus suggesting that the gene cluster might have evolved from mouse <italic>Mbd3l2</italic> via the copy-paste mode, similar to the situation observed in mouse <italic>Zscan4</italic> retrotransposons and ERV repeats. Using specific human ZSCAN4 and MBD3L2-5 antibodies, we performed immunostaining in cells during reprogramming. While only weak expression of ZSCAN4 as well as no expression of MBD3L2-5 could be detected around day 14, we could observe robust expression of ZSCAN4 and MBD3L2-5 around day 24 during naïve reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). During primed reprogramming, we could observe weak expression of ZSCAN4 and DPPA3 at 24d + dox, which diminished after dox withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the expression of MBD3L2-5 could not be detected during primed reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Western blot analysis of MBD3L2-5 also confirmed our observations in both immunostaining and transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Although the transcriptional profiles of MBD3L cluster genes exhibited sharply decreased mRNA expression in the derived niPSC-T lines, we could still observe MBD3L2-5<sup>+</sup> cells in naïve iPSC clones compared to their absence in primed iPSCs by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting the expression of MBD3L2/3/4/5 as an indicator for naïve pluripotency. In summary, the transient expression of 8C-genes, which occurs specifically during the late stages of naïve reprogramming, suggests the emergence of gene network activation with 8C-stage-like characteristics. Compared with the primed reprogramming that finally stabilized at the post-implantation-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>), naïve reprogramming not only reached the pre-implantation-like status but more importantly, underwent reactivation of gene programs with human EGA-like characteristics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29518.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transient activation of transcripts with 8C-stage-like signatures during naïve reprogramming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Line plot showing expression dynamics of 8C-stage-specific genes during human embryonic development.

According to our observation of the 8C-gene network wave during naïve reprogramming, we next assessed the dynamics of transposon elements (TEs) during this process. We identified TEs that were specifically and highly expressed at the 8C stage (8C-TEs) during human embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>); these TEs also showed transient reactivation during the late stages of naïve reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Deep investigations at the base level also confirmed our observations above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Here, by using the secondary human naïve reprogramming system, we monitored the dynamics of transcriptome and epigenome during naïve pluripotency induction process. We observed ordered reactivations of transcriptional networks sharing signatures reminiscent of reversed embryonic development, including a significant transient wave of 8C-stage-specific transcripts expression in the late reprogramming stages followed by the stabilization of the transcriptome with pre-implantation-like characteristics, thus suggesting that the activation of a network with human EGA-like characteristics occurs during naïve pluripotency induction.</p><p>Recent advances have demonstrated that during the primed iPSCs induction, the pre-implantation-like state is reached quickly but is lost upon dox withdrawal and iPSC line derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>). Distinctly from that phenomenon, the reprogramming cells in the naïve pluripotency induction process undergo a gradual reactivation of networks with pre-implantation signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, the expression wave of 8C transcripts observed specifically in naïve reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the 8C-stage-like state is transiently established during the naïve pluripotency induction process. We also observed a significant genome-wide DNA demethylation as early as 12 days after naïve induction, which eventually led to hypomethylation in naïve iPSCs with similar methylation ratios of ICM in vivo, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pastor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.

The reviewers also note a number of instances in which the presentation of results is unclear. You should address these major criticisms concerning data analysis and clear up the areas where the presentation lacks clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>A key question relates to the analysis of the data: the authors need to clarify precisely what embryo and primed cell reprogramming datasets they are comparing their data to.</p><p>1) Subsection “Transcriptional profiling of naïve reprogramming cells” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> - how were genes classified as early embryogenesis, pre-implantation, and late embryogenesis? These do not turn up in the GO analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>2) Subsection “Transcriptional profiling of naïve reprogramming cells” - what is the significance of the activation of genes related to placenta development and gamete generation?</p><p>3) Subsection “Transcriptional profiling of naïve reprogramming cells” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> - what is the source of the human embryo data? Is there a distinction in these data for blastocyst between inner cell mass and trophectoderm? What about the epiblast proper, which the naïve cells should resemble?</p><p>4) Subsection “Transcriptional profiling of naïve reprogramming cells” – where do the authors' data show that primed cell reprogramming drops to a post-implantation stage? What post-implantation data in what species?</p><p>5) Subsection “8-cell-stage-like state was transiently established during naïve reprogramming” and elsewhere-the statement that an eight-cell stage was transiently established probably claims too much from the data. Unless I misunderstand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, the induction of a selected set of 8C genes is considerably more modest in naïve reprogrammed cells compared to that in the embryo, and the reprogramming cells may be expressing many genes that are not typical of this stage. Some other form of analysis would be required to prove that the transient cells are really equivalent to an 8C stage.</p><p>6) Subsection “8-cell-stage-like state was transiently established during naïve reprogramming” - again the significance of enrichment for genes involved in gamete generation is unclear here.</p><p>7) Subsection “Dynamic changes in epigenetic modifications in the naïve reprogramming system” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> - what genes are chosen for study here and why?</p><p>8) Subsection “Dynamic changes in epigenetic modifications in the naïve reprogramming system” and following-the logic of comparison of the H3K4me3 with those of the mouse blastocysts is not clear.

What human embryo epiblast data are used for comparison?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> primed heatmap is the first place that we see a comparison between the 2i reprogrammed cells and cells reprogrammed in 5iLAF. This is repeated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. I can't find details of the primed timecourse. Was this generated in parallel with the 5iLAF 2i reprogramming? Is it a 2i timecourse or derived from the first reprogramming stage? If so, this should be included in the over-view cartoons describing the experimental design and detailed in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Or has the data been taken from an external publication (e.g. Cacchiarelli et al., 2015 which is referenced heavily in the Results section describing the transcriptome time series)? If so, I have some concerns about the integration of these two data sets. The GEO accessions for any external data series used in comparisons should be provided in the methods. Details on normalization used to address technical batch, as would be expected from integrating disparate data sources, should be provided. These integration issues are exacerbated in comparisons of single cell RNA-seq and population RNA-seq for the correlation table with the early embryo series.</p><p>The authors benchmark the 2i 5LAF transcriptome series against an external early human embryogenesis series using a Pearson correlation. Why this choice of embryo time points? If the 2i iPSC equivalent is late epiblast, is correlation with zygote-blastocyst sufficient or informative? There are relevant later stage human and monkey embryogenesis datasets that would provide a more appropriate developmental window.</p><p>How was the correlation analysis performed? There are no substantive details of any of the bioinformatics analyses beyond the RNA-seq processing.</p><p>The comparison of 'primed'-iPSC and 5iLAF-2i-iPSC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to the '8-cell' signature that the authors claim is reminiscent of the reactivation of the zygote transcriptome rests heavily on comparative higher expression of this signature in the 5iLAF series and not in the 'primed' iPSC series. As far as I can tell from the methods described, only 1 replicate is provided per time point in the 5iLAF-2i-iPSC timecourse. This spike could represent an oversampling issue or some other technical issue with a small number of libraries – Panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref> particularly concerns us with regard to potential over-sampling. I have insufficient information to evaluate the quality of the primed and 5iLAF series without knowing the source of the former. The transposon mining comes from the same RNA-seq libraries, and so the same question about library quality, source of comparison and suspicion in a 'spike' seen in a small number of data points in a time series applies to the transposon analysis.</p><p>The authors have not evaluated whether the 8-cell signature is expressed later in human embryonic development. Indeed, many of the individual genes are more broadly expressed. This needs further exploration before concluding that the 5iLAF-iPSC have an equivalent zygote-reactivation wave of chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Of the individual genes highlighted in the RNA-seq, and then confirmed by IF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> lacks comparison of the 5iLAF-iPSC with the primed iPSC series or with other pluripotent cell lines, so the claim that these genes are hall-marks of the naïve state remains somewhat anecdotal.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unique molecular events during reprogramming of human somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) at naïve state&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Christine Wells (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The revised manuscript and rebuttal address many concerns raised in the first round of review. However, one reviewer who is highly experienced in this field continues to have several important concerns about the analysis and interpretation of the data. These are summarized below and relate to your analysis of the repeat RNA-seq time course, the specificity of expression of key markers used to define cell state and the reliance on one embryo dataset only, and the degree to which the final cell state of the naïve and primed protocols really differ.</p><p>We are therefore offering you the opportunity to address these issues. As a matter of policy, we rarely offer more than one round of revision so please take the following concerns carefully as we may not be able to consider any further revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reanalysis, including repeat RNA-seq of the time course, have been superficially addressed. In fact, it is not clear that this repeat data has been incorporated into any of the analyses or figures. The libraries appear genuinely different, sufficiently so that the numbers of DE genes, and scales on plots should be different between the manuscript versions. They are not. One would assume that this would address potential library artefacts association with the earlier version of the manuscript, however no changes in relevant figures have arisen from inclusion of additional data, suggesting that no additional data has been included in the analysis.</p><p>Please clarify whether or not the repeat time course has been incorporated into the revised figures.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D:</xref> I'm concerned that genes I observe to be highly variable in any pluripotent cell culture, including 2i-cultures, are being used as hallmarks of naïve vs primed states, especially given the shallow replication of the data generated here, and the single comparison to one primed dataset generated in another lab. In particular, the claims that dox-withdrawal in primed iPSC (Cacchiarelli) lead to loss of naïve markers such as DPP2,3,5, DNMT3L, NODAL etc. exemplifies the superficial nature of the comparison being made in this manuscript.

However, this strong correlation was not observed when comparing our naïve reprogramming dataset with Guo et al., dataset (GSE63818) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29518.024</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29518-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29518.025</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29518-resp-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>We are sorry that we have not found the public embryonic data at the stages just in the narrow time window of post-implantation. Therefore, in the last revised response we used hESC0 and hESC10 to simulate the post-implantation time-point during development, which were reported to originate from a post-ICM intermediate (PICMI), a transient epiblast-like structure that has undergone X-inactivation in female cells and is both necessary and sufficient for ESC derivation (O’Leary et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The behaviour of primed and naive time courses are very similar up to the derivation of the final iPSC line.

Is it possible for instance that the differences in the final cell lines reflect long term adaptation to particular culture conditions rather than inherent differences in cell state? If 2 above is answered adequately, you should be able to address this point. We apologise if the significance of point 2 above was not clear enough in the previous review.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this important question. We have performed cell clustering based on cell-to-cell correlation of the reprogramming endpoints in our study and naïve/primed ESCs/iPSCs from public datasets mentioned above. The correlation analyses showed that the niPSC-Ts which most resembled other naïve ESCs/iPSCs in the public datasets, separate clearly from the piPSC-Ts, indicating that the differences in the final iPSC state are not the result of normal line variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref>).</p><p>We do not think that the differences between niPSC-T and piPSC-Ts reflect long term adaptation to the 5iLAF culture conditions. The activation of OCT4 distal enhancer and the signatures in epigenome in naïve cells strongly suggest their inherent differences from primed cells.</p><fig id="respfig8"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29518.026</object-id><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29518-resp-fig8-v2"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
