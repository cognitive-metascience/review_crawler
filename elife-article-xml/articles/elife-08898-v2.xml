ECT-2, the exchange factor responsible for RhoA activation, is regulated to ensure spatiotemporal control of contractile ring assembly. Centralspindlin, composed of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 and the kinesin MKLP1/ZEN-4, is known to activate ECT-2, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. We report that ECT-2-mediated RhoA activation depends on the ability of CYK-4 to localize to the plasma membrane, bind RhoA, and promote GTP hydrolysis by RhoA. Defects resulting from loss of CYK-4 RhoGAP activity can be rescued by activating mutations in ECT-2 or depletion of RGA-3/4, which functions as a conventional RhoGAP for RhoA. Consistent with CYK-4 RhoGAP activity contributing to GEF activation, the catalytic domains of CYK-4 and ECT-2 directly interact. Thus, counterintuitively, CYK-4 RhoGAP activity promotes RhoA activation. We propose that the most active form of the cytokinetic RhoGEF involves complex formation between ECT-2, centralspindlin and RhoA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08898.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08898.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08898.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell division is a process in which a cell splits to form two daughter cells. In most cases, the cell first duplicates its genetic material and then the two copies are pulled to opposite ends of the cell. A ring of protein filaments—called the contractile ring—then assembles to form a band around the cell at the site of the division. This ring contracts and the force generated separates the cells in a step known as cytokinesis.</p><p>A protein belonging to the Rho family, called RhoA, is essential for cytokinesis because it controls the formation of the contractile ring. Rho proteins are switched on by the activities of other proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Another group of proteins known as ‘GTPase activating proteins’ (or GAPs for short) generally act to promote the ability of Rho proteins to turn themselves off.</p><p>In animals and other multicellular organisms, a GAP called CYK-4 largely concentrates on the spindle midzone, but some of the protein also moves to part of the cell membrane near the future site of cell division. It binds to a guanine nucleotide exchange factor called ECT-2 to switch RhoA on, which in turn promotes the formation of the contractile ring. However, it is not clear why a protein that activates RhoA is also able to trigger its inactivation.</p><p>In this study, Zhang and Glotzer studied cell division in a roundworm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The experiments show that cells that lacked the GAP activity of CYK-4 were unable to complete cytokinesis because RhoA was not fully switched on. This requirement could be bypassed in cells with mutant forms of ECT-2 that were overactive. Therefore, an activity that was thought to inactivate RhoA actually promotes its activation. Further experiments show that the section (or ‘domain’) of CYK-4 that has GAP activity interacts directly with the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of ECT2. Zhang and Glotzer suggest that this interaction stimulates ECT2 and thereby promotes the activation of RhoA.</p><p>Further experiments will reveal how CYK-4 stimulates ECT-2. In addition, it will be important to determine whether other proteins with GAP domains also work in this unconventional way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08898.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08898.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>Rho GTPase</kwd><kwd>RhoGAP</kwd><kwd>RhoGEF</kwd><kwd>centralspindlin</kwd><kwd>Rac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM085087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glotzer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007234</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Donglei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR000430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glotzer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of the key regulator of cytokinesis, RhoA, involves an unexpected contribution by a RhoGAP domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>RhoA activation during cytokinesis</title><p>Cell division involves the myosin-mediated contraction of an actin-based contractile ring. In metazoans, contractile ring assembly involves activation of the GTPase RhoA. RhoA directly activates formin-mediated actin polymerization and indirectly promotes myosin activation. As the contractile ring must assemble at the correct position and at the correct time, between the segregating chromosomes in anaphase, RhoA activation is subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green et al., 2012</xref> for review).</p><p>The primary direct activator of RhoA during cytokinesis is the RhoGEF ECT-2. ECT-2 contains N-terminal BRCT domains and a C-terminal RhoGEF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). Presumably as a consequence of being autoinhibited, ECT-2 function depends on activators. One of the important activators of ECT-2 during cytokinesis is the centralspindlin complex, which is a heterotetramer containing a dimeric kinesin, ZEN-4 (aka MKLP1, Pavarotti) and dimeric CYK-4 (aka MgcRacGAP, Tum/RacGAP50C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mishima et al., 2002</xref>). Centralspindlin organizes the spindle midzone and directly recruits numerous regulators of cytokinesis, including ECT-2, to this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>). ECT-2 and centralspindlin are conserved among—and restricted to—metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frédéric et al., 2013</xref>) (unpublished results). Though these proteins are conserved, their names are distinct in each organism. For simplicity, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> names will be used throughout this manuscript with the exception that we will refer to RHO-1 with the more common name RhoA.</p><p>Recruitment of ECT-2 to the spindle midzone involves regulated binding between ECT-2 and CYK-4. The BRCT domains of ECT-2 bind to CYK-4 phosphorylated by PLK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>). CYK-4 phosphorylation occurs in a cell cycle and microtubule-regulated manner. Furthermore, CDK-1 phosphorylation of ECT-2 inhibits the ECT-2-CYK-4 interaction during metaphase and inactivates a membrane binding motif within ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2011</xref>). The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ECT-2 and centralspindlin is required for RhoA activation during cytokinesis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Centralspindlin also localizes in trace, but biologically relevant, amounts on the cell membrane. Centralspindlin accumulation to the midzone and the membrane are independently regulated by its oligomerization, which is inhibited by a 14-3-3 protein and promoted by the chromosome passenger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basant et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>The role of the GAP activity of CYK-4 GAP has been controversial</title><p>The CYK-4 subunit of centralspindlin contains an evolutionarily conserved Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</xref>). The function of this domain has been examined in a number of different contexts. In vitro, the GAP domain of CYK-4 efficiently activates the GTPase activity of the Rho-family GTPases, CED-10/Rac1 and CDC-42. CYK-4 also has GAP activity towards RhoA, but it is far less active towards RhoA as compared to Rac1 and CDC-42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Touré et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>). Despite extensive effort, there is no consensus for the biological role of this GAP activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">White and Glotzer, 2012</xref> for review). In some cell types, the GAP activity appears dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>), in others it appears to be important to negatively regulate Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Avino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>), whereas in yet others it appears to promote RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Avino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zavortink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>). System-specific differences may underlie some of these diverse results. However, these studies differ in the mutations used to assess the function of the GAP domain, which is likely to affect the results. In addition, some of the controversy may be due to misinterpretation of indirect effects.</p><p>The function of the RhoGAP domain has been examined in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos in some detail. These studies have focused largely on a temperature-sensitive, separation-of-function substitution mutation, E448K, that lies in the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4, <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>). The mutant protein can complex with the centralspindlin kinesin, ZEN-4, and bundle microtubules in the central spindle. However, cytokinesis does not proceed to completion in these embryos. Interestingly, depletion of CED-10/Rac1 or the actin nucleator subunit ARP-2 enables these embryos to complete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>). These genetic interactions have been interpreted to indicate that the GAP domain of CYK-4 is important to keep CED-10/Rac1 inactive and prevent the accumulation of branched actin in the equatorial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>). However, subsequent analysis demonstrated that <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic>; <italic>ced-10(−)</italic> embryos are phenotypically abnormal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, <italic>cyk-4</italic>; <italic>ced-10</italic> mutant embryos have reduced accumulation of RhoA effectors as compared to <italic>ced-10</italic> mutants alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that this mutation in CYK-4 affects more than the RhoGAP activity of CYK-4 or that CED-10/Rac1 is not the relevant target of the GAP domain, or both.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Parallel mechanisms activate RhoA in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo</title><p>Analysis of centralspindlin function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos is impeded by the existence of a second, parallel pathway that promotes RhoA activation in the early embryo. Upon fertilization, embryos exhibit RhoA-dependent contractility that promotes embryo polarization and culminates in the formation of a transient furrow known as the pseudocleavage furrow. This wave of contractility requires a poorly conserved protein known as NOP-1 and is largely independent of centralspindlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). Cytokinetic contractility, on the other hand, involves both NOP-1 and centralspindlin. However, <italic>nop-1</italic> is nonessential; loss of function mutants are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rose et al., 1995</xref>). Cytokinesis proceeds to completion in the absence of NOP-1, although furrow initiation is slightly delayed and RhoA accumulates to lower levels at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). Due to its role in RhoA activation, polarization in NOP-1-deficient embryos is also delayed. Mutational inactivation of NOP-1 permits direct analysis of centralspindlin-dependent furrow formation. Notably, when NOP-1 is inactivated, <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> embryos are completely defective in RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tse et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Membrane-bound centralspindlin promotes RhoA activation</title><p>The CYK-4 GAP domain is adjacent to a C1 domain that mediates membrane localization of centralspindlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lekomtsev et al., 2012</xref>). Given that the <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> substitution renders the protein thermosensitive, it is possible that these phenotypes are not the sole consequence of loss of GAP activity; this mutation could affect other functions of the GAP domain, the adjacent C1 domain may also be affected. To clarify these issues, we performed a targeted structure-function analysis of the C1 and GAP domains of CYK-4. We demonstrate that the <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> allele indeed affects its ability to associate with the membrane and show that this activity contributes to RhoA activation. We further show that the active site of the GAP domain contributes to the accumulation of downstream effectors of RhoA and RhoA-dependent contractility. Furthermore, we find that the catalytic domains of CYK-4 and ECT-2 directly interact in vitro. Finally, we show that hypomorphic defects in CYK-4-mediated RhoA dependent contractility can be suppressed by either loss of the RhoGAP activity provided by RGA-3/4 or by either of two activating mutations in ECT-2. These activating mutations in <italic>ect-2</italic> rescue <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> and GAP-deficient CYK-4. Our results indicate that CYK-4 GAP activity is involved in ECT-2-mediated RhoA activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> allele, E448K, exhibits defects in membrane association</title><p>We sought to conduct a structure-function analysis of CYK-4 to determine the individual contributions of the GAP and C1 domains of CYK-4. We established a rescue assay based on single copy integrants of GFP-tagged CYK-4 transgenes driven by the <italic>cyk-4</italic> promoter inserted at a defined locus in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome using Mos1-mediated integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). The transgenes were expressed at consistent levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The transgenes were rendered resistant to an RNAi construct that could effectively deplete endogenous CYK-4 by targeting the 3′ UTR and portions of the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). By combining the appropriate mutant transgene with RNAi to specifically deplete endogenous CYK-4, we obtained embryos that express CYK-4<sup>MUT</sup>. In this and all subsequent experiments, when a given variant is assayed, endogenous CYK-4 is depleted by RNAi; these will be referred to as <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>mut</italic></sup> embryos. We first sought to validate the rescue assay, by assaying <italic>cyk-4<sup>E448K</sup></italic> embryos and found that they closely phenocopy <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> embryos in which endogenous CYK-4 has the E448K substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This phenocopy indicates functional depletion of endogenous CYK-4. Additionally, a wild-type transgene was fully functional as it could complement a large deletion in CYK-4 to viability and fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the C1 domain promoting membrane association, CYK-4<sup>∆C1</sup> does not accumulate on ingressing cleavage furrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). As <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> is temperature sensitive, we considered the possibility that the thermosensitivity also destabilizes the C1 domain that lies adjacent to the CYK-4 GAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, at the restrictive temperature, CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> exhibits a similar defect in localization as CYK-4<sup>∆C1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). CYK-4 also associates with the membrane in the germline and indirect evidence suggests that this localization is compromised in embryos expressing CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). We generated strains in which both the endogenous <italic>cyk-4</italic> and the GFP-tagged transgene contained the E448K mutation. At the permissive temperature, CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup> membrane recruitment was readily detected in the germline, however this localization was lost as animals were shifted to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, the C1 domain is required for membrane localization in the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Embryos, expressing only CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup>, are largely normal during the initial stages of the first cell cycle. They undergo pseudocleavage, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, central spindle assembly during anaphase, and CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> becomes highly enriched on the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cleavage furrow initiation occurs and the furrow ingresses at near wild-type rates to near completion. However, cytokinesis does not complete and the furrow ultimately regresses; this phenotype was fully penetrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); these embryos also fail to complete cytokinesis following meiosis II (data not shown). These results suggest that a late step in cytokinesis is most sensitive to loss of CYK-4 GAP activity.

If furrow formation is dependent on CYK-4 binding to either CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42 to generate a positive regulatory complex, then inactivation of these GTPases would be predicted to cause a phenotype at least as severe as a mutation that weakens the GTPase binding site of CYK-4. However, mutation of CED-10/Rac1, or depletion of CDC-42, does not affect the rate of cleavage furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>), even when combined with mutations in NOP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

We infer, therefore, that RhoA is the relevant GTPase that CYK-4 binds to promote cleavage furrow formation.

Previous studies proposed at least three models for the phenotype seen in <italic>cyk-4<sup>R459A</sup></italic> embryos. First, the GAP domain could function as canonical GAP that acts on RhoA, causing CYK-4 GAP-deficient embryos fail to complete cytokinesis because of a requirement for RhoA inactivation at late cytokinesis. Second, CED-10/Rac1 could be an important target of CYK-4 GAP activity, causing CYK-4 GAP deficient embryos to accumulate ectopic Rac1 activity that interferes with cytokinesis. Third, although it is counterintuitive, CYK-4 GAP activity could somehow promote RhoA activation, and therefore the CYK-4 GAP deficient embryos may fail cytokinesis due to incomplete RhoA activation. We sought to distinguish between these alternatives.</p><p>The first and third models make opposite predictions for the outcome of experiments in which RhoA levels are perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We therefore assayed whether CYK-4 GAP domain mutations affect accumulation of RhoA effectors. Because the RhoA biosensor and the CYK-4 transgenes are both GFP-tagged and integrated at the same position of the genome, we assayed the accumulation of RFP-tagged non-muscle myosin, NMY-2, a key effector of RhoA, as a proxy for RhoA activation. To validate that NMY-2::mRFP is a valid proxy for RhoA activity levels, we compared the accumulation of these two markers to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis when co-expressed. The recruitment of NMY-2::mRFP and the RhoA biosensor are highly correlated in space, time, and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In addition, the correlation between these markers remains strong when either NOP-1, CYK-4, or RGA-3/4 are depleted, despite the significant changes in the extent of recruitment caused by these perturbations. Thus NMY-2::mRFP provides a reliable proxy for RhoA activation.</p><p>We assayed NMY-2::mRFP levels in CYK-4<sup>WT</sup>, CYK-4<sup>∆C1</sup>, CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup>, and CYK-4<sup>EE</sup> embryos during anaphase.

Conversely, depletion of RGA-3/4 increases myosin accumulation in CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> and CYK-4<sup>EE</sup> embryos, both in the presence and absence of NOP-1.

Given that the E129K mutation lies near the N-terminal BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we hypothesized that it could interfere with ECT-2 autoinhibition. To test this possibility, we assayed for binding between the N- and C- termini of ECT-2. Wild-type N- and C- termini form a complex that is readily detected in vitro. However, the E129K substitution, but not G707D, significantly reduces binding of the ECT-2 N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that this allele functions by relieving autoinhibition.</p><p>The G707D mutation in ECT-2 is located in the PH portion of the RhoGEF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In principle, this mutation could promote RhoA activation by a number of mechanisms including activation of the GEF domain, relieving autoinhibition of ECT-2, stabilizing the interaction with CYK-4 and/or stabilizing the interaction of ECT-2 with the plasma membrane. We did not observe a change in the association of ECT-2_N with ECT-2_C<sup>G707D</sup>, suggesting that the mutation doesn't relieve autoinhibition. However, as the mutated residue maps to a helix that lies near RhoA in a co–crystal structure of a related RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we tested whether it activates RhoGEF activity. We assayed ECT-2 GEF activity in an in vitro exchange assay. The ECT-2<sup>G707D</sup> variant exhibits a modest increase in GEF activity compared to wild-type ECT-2 over a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), perhaps by increasing the affinity of ECT-2 for RhoA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Overview</title><p>Diverse mechanisms ensure that the cytokinetic contractile ring assembles at the cell equator following chromosome segregation. These regulatory mechanisms converge to promote local accumulation of active RhoA at the cell equator which is an essential prerequisite for contractile ring assembly. Whereas it is widely accepted that the RhoGEF ECT-2 is the primary activator of RhoA and the centralspindlin component CYK-4 contributes to RhoA activation, the mechanism(s) by which CYK-4 promotes RhoA activation have been rather unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CYK-4 has multiple functional domains that are required for it to promote RhoA activation. In addition to the previously characterized binding interaction with ECT-2, we show that both the C1 domain and the catalytic activity of the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 are also required for full activation of ECT-2. Furthermore, our results indicate in order for the CYK-4 GAP domain to promote RhoA activation, it has to act catalytically on RhoA•GTP. This implies that RhoA plays a role in promoting its own activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The GAP activity of CYK-4 is required for RhoA activation</title><p>Four results suggest that CYK-4 GAP activity promotes RhoA activation. First, CYK-4 GAP activity is required for the completion of cytokinesis and embryos lacking this activity exhibit reduced levels of RhoA effectors. Second, when the NOP-1-dependent, parallel pathway for RhoA activation is eliminated, the requirement for CYK-4 GAP activity for furrow formation and effector recruitment is greatly enhanced. Third, we have demonstrated a biochemical interaction between the GAP domain of CYK-4 and the GEF domain of ECT-2. Fourth, the requirement for CYK-4 GAP activity can be alleviated by three independent perturbations that each increase RhoA activity levels.</p><p>One of the perturbations that suppresses the CYK-4 GAP-deficient phenotype is depletion of the primary RhoA GAP, RGA-3/4. Embryos defective in RGA-3/4 alone exhibit hypercontractility and are largely inviable; these phenotypes are consistent with the canonical function of a RhoA GAP. However, loss of CYK-4 GAP activity and loss of RGA-3/4 counterbalance each other during cytokinesis. Furthermore, suppression by RGA-3/4 depletion is potent, it can restore cytokinesis in embryos deficient in both NOP-1 and CYK-4 GAP activity in which furrows otherwise barely ingress.</p><p>A large, unbiased, genome-wide screen for suppressors of <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> corroborates the model that CYK-4 GAP activity promotes RhoA activation. We identified two strong, extragenic, gain of function suppressor mutations in the RhoGEF ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because these suppressors rescue <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> and <italic>cyk-4<sup>R459A</sup></italic> to viability, the essential function of the CYK-4 GAP activity must be to promote RhoA activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism of ECT-2 activation and positive feedback</title><p>These results raise the fundamental question: by what mechanism does the GAP activity of CYK-4 contribute to RhoA activation? We propose a working model in which the most active form of the ECT-2 RhoGEF is a complex containing ECT-2 and CYK-4 with a molecule of RhoA•GDP bound to the GAP active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>The GTPase bound to CYK-4 is likely to be RhoA, rather than CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42. If CYK-4 had to bind CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42, then depletion of those GTPases should impair cytokinesis as severely as a mutation that attenuates GTPase binding by the CYK-4 GAP domain. However, neither CED-10/Rac1 nor CDC-42 is required for cytokinesis, even in NOP-1-defective embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas weakening GTPase binding by the CYK-4 GAP domain strongly impacts cytokinesis. The model has a further implication: to form the most active ECT-2 GEF complex, CYK-4 GAP binds RhoA•GTP. Therefore, RhoA•GTP plays a role in RhoGEF activation, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop during cytokinesis.</p><p>This working model is supported by the finding that full activation of RhoA and cytokinesis requires that the CYK-4 GAP domain both bind a Rho family GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and activate its ability to hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig5">Figures 2, 4, 5</xref>); indeed mutations in the CYK-4 GAP domain that diminish GTPase binding exhibit a stronger defect in RhoA activation than mutation of the GAP active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our mutational analysis has trapped ECT-2 in four distinct states that form an allelic series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We propose that the least active form of ECT-2 is not bound to CYK-4 and has little GEF activity. Once CYK-4 is phosphorylated, it can be bound by the ECT-2 N-terminal BRCT domains rendering it weakly activated (equivalent to CYK-4<sup>EE</sup>). This form may also exhibit some interactions between the GEF domain of ECT-2 and the GAP domain of CYK-4, as these domains can interact in vitro without RhoA present. If CYK-4 can bind to RhoA•GTP, it induces a higher activity state, as evidenced by the increased activity of CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup>, which is sufficient for zygotic development. Finally, if CYK-4 can induce GTP hydrolysis by RhoA, this results in the fully active ECT-2/CYK-4/RhoA•GDP or ECT-2/CYK-4/RhoA•GDP + Pi state populated by the wild-type protein. We speculate that this complex results in full relief from autoinhibition within the ECT-2 GEF domain.</p><p>Not only does this model explain why CYK-4 retains GAP activity towards RhoA, it also explains why its ability to inactivate RhoA is attenuated relative to Rac and Cdc42. High turnover rates of RhoA•GTP induced by CYK-4 might rapidly consume RhoA•GTP at the site of production, yielding a futile cycle of RhoA activation and inactivation. However, this working model must be tested by structural studies and biochemical reconstitution assays that reflect the in vivo situation. Accurate reconstitutions will need to account for the facts that cytokinetic RhoA activation involves the CYK-4 C1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the ability of CYK-4 to bind to ZEN-4, and the ability of ZEN-4 to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basant et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>CED-10/Rac1 is not the primary target for CYK-4 GAP activity</title><p>We tested the model that GAP activity of CYK-4 is important to maintain CED-10/Rac1 in an inactive state. Some of our results do support this model, as the failure to complete the first cytokinesis in embryos lacking CYK-4 GAP activity can be partially restored by a loss of function mutation in <italic>ced-10/Rac1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We therefore tested whether inactivation of CED-10/Rac1 suppresses loss of CYK-4 GAP activity in NOP-1-deficient embryos. GAP-deficient CYK-4 does not promote significant ingression of the cleavage furrow in embryos lacking NOP-1, irrespective of the presence or absence of CED-10/Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Biii,v</xref>). Finally, mutations in CED-10/Rac1 do not suppress the lethality of a temperature sensitive mutation in <italic>cyk-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, because the active site of the CYK-4 GAP domain is required in the absence of CED-10/Rac1, CED-10/Rac1 inactivation cannot be the primary function of the CYK-4 GAP domain. Rather, these results suggest a model in which loss of CED-10/Rac1 function causes a reduction in overall cortical tension which, in turn, allows an increase in the extent of NOP-1-dependent furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>GEF activation model can account for many previous results</title><p>The experiments presented here demonstrate that CYK-4 GAP activity promotes RhoA activation and that this function is essential in early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos and in the adult germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2A, 4B</xref>). Our experiments also addressed the function of CYK-4 GAP activity post-embryonically. We find that whereas zygotic <italic>cyk-4</italic> null embryos die during embryogenesis, expression of catalytically inactive CYK-4 provides significant rescue, supporting development into viable, albeit sterile, adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, while early embryos require the GAP activity of CYK-4, this requirement is relaxed post-embryonically. The requirement for CYK-4 GAP activity can be experimentally eliminated by hyperactivation of ECT-2 or depletion of the RhoA GAP RGA-3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5B, 6B</xref>). Interestingly, RGA-3/4 is primarily expressed in the germline and in early embryos (NextDB, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmutz et al., 2007</xref> and data not shown), thus regulated RGA-3/4 expression could contribute to the tissue specific requirements.</p><p>These findings allow us to reconcile many previous results on the role of the CYK-4 GAP domain during cytokinesis. Some studies provided evidence that the GAP activity is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>), whereas others suggested it is required for Rac1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Avino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>), RhoA inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller and Bement, 2009</xref>), or RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Avino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zavortink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>). The first set of results is consistent with the results presented here, as some cell types may not require the GAP activity of CYK-4 for cytokinesis, as seen in post embryonic cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. As numerous studies have shown that active RhoA can indirectly inhibit Rac1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guilluy et al., 2011</xref> for review), some of the results that point to a role for CYK-4 GAP activity in attenuating Rac1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>) may be indirectly caused by a reduction RhoA activation or by indirectly controlling cortical tension. Thus, many previous results can be explained without proposing that the CYK-4 GAP domain performs different functions in different organisms or cell types. We do not rule out the possibility that, in certain contexts, CYK-4 or its orthologs negatively regulate Rac or Cdc42. Recent evidence indicates that the <italic>Xenopus</italic> ortholog of CYK-4 concentrates at cell–cell junctions and negatively regulates GTPases at that site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breznau et al., 2015</xref>).

Interestingly, ECT-2 has also been implicated in SOS regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canevascini et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, CYK-4 is not the only protein with a GTPase activating domain that plays a role in promoting GEF activity.

Thus, centralspindlin has several domains that contribute to maximal activation of ECT-2. However, not all cell types may require maximal activation of ECT-2 either because of physical properties of the cell (cell size, cortical tension, and tissue organization) or because of their biochemical properties (expression of RGA-3/4 orthologs). Nevertheless, the evolutionary conservation of all of these functions suggests that they play critical roles during some stage(s) of metazoan development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>Animals were grown at 20°C on standard nematode growth media (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

The position of the furrow was assessed in each frame by manual tracking of GFP::PH or mCherry::PH signal. The extent of ingression in each frame was calculated as d/w, where w is the total width of the embryo and d is the distance between the furrow tips. To determine whether furrow ingression kinetics were statistically significant different between multiple genotypes, data sets of normalized cortical distance from 100 s to 410 s after anaphase onset were analyzed with a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Dunnett's multiple comparisons test.</p><p>To quantitate the abundance of NMY-2::mRFP at the equatorial region, a stack of five planes spanning 2.5 μm was captured every 10 s.

A region of fixed size in the equatorial region was thresholded with a minimal value of 1.25× background and the total thresholded signal in the region was integrated and normalized to the background.

Through structure-function analysis of CYK-4 GAP they have identified that the GAP activity of CYK-4 is essential for cytokinesis, and performs at least 2 different functions. They make the important discovery that the GAP activity is crucial for nucleotide exchange on RhoA, the GTPase that activates both actin polymerization and myosin II activation. The work is very thorough and I particularly like the experiment where, through an unbiased screen for suppressors of CYK-4 GAP mutants, they identify new alleles of the RhoA exchange factor ECT2 itself. They further go on to show that CYK-4 physically interacts with ECT-2 and that an Ect2 mutant they isolated has higher nucleotide exchange activity (albeit a modest one).</p><p>I think the paper is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I would like to see the biochemistry developed better. In particular, I am surprised that none of the GAP mutants identified in the work have been characterized in the biochemical studies described in the latter part of the paper. The two key experiments are: 1) how do the GAP mutants behave in the physical interaction experiments with ECT2 and 2) how does the presence of wild-type or GAP mutants of CYK-4 affects the ECT2-mediated nucleotide exchange on RhoA. These experiments are crucial if they are to advance the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>I think some more discussion is also warranted on how mutations in the PH domain potentially affect the GEF activity. Molecular dynamics may help, although I realize this can be a new foray altogether.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Zhang and Glotzer provide an extensive and compelling analysis of the controversial role of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> RhoGAP CYK-4 during cytokinesis in animal cells. Their data strongly support the conclusion that the primary role of CYK-4/RhoGAP is to activate RhoA through its RhoGEF ECT-2. This is a counter-intuitive finding, as normally one thinks of GAPs as negative regulators of GTPases, not activators. The authors provide a rationale for this surprising role, and their evidence certainly supports the conclusion and also can to a large extent explain alternative views (invoking either indirect effects on other GTPases, or indirect effects from depletion of other GTPases to explain results suggesting that either the GAP activity of this family of RhoGAPs is not necessary or that it acts on other GTPases, in particular Rac as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>). The authors provide an elegant and impressive analysis of this issue, using a powerful combination of mutational analysis, live cell imaging and biochemistry. This manuscript provides the most extensive and compelling analysis of how CYK-4 influences cytokinesis via the RhoGEF ECT-2 and the RhoA GTPase, and should go a long ways toward resolving this complex issue.</p><p>While the manuscript in my opinion clearly warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors first need to address the following concerns that, while perhaps relatively minor, nevertheless could possibly improve the clarity of their arguments.</p><p>1) In the Introduction, subsection “The role of the GAP activity of CYK-4 GAP has been controversial”, the authors point out that CYK-4 has GAP activity toward RhoA but much more toward Rac1 and CDC-42. The authors should directly address how these observations relate to their conclusions concerning their model for how CYK-4 functions as an activator of RhoA.</p><p>2) With respect to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors should discuss why there is some furrow ingression in embryos expressing CYK-4 lacking the C1 domain, and lacking <italic>nop-1</italic> and <italic>ced-10</italic> (in contrast to CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup>).</p><p>3) In two places (subsection “The <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> allele, E448K, exhibits defects in membrane association” and “CYK-4 GAP domain mutations that prevent RhoA binding are highly defective in RhoA activation”), the authors conclude results paragraphs by stating that an observation is “important” without explaining why it is important. Doing so might help clarify their conclusions.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Mutations in the active site of CYK-4 can be suppressed by RGA-3/4 depletion”, the authors refer to hyper-contractility after RGA-3/4 depletion and imply (and to some extent document) that this phenotype is suppressed by CYK-4 mutants. The authors should more explicitly state if this is an accurate conclusion.</p><p>5) In the subsection “Mutations in the active site of CYK-4 can be suppressed by RGA-3/4 depletion”, the authors refer to an allelic series of CYK-4 mutants. It might be helpful to explicitly state why the different mutants exhibit this gradation in effect.</p><p>6) In the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors state that their data indicate that CYK-4 has to act catalytically on RhoA•GTP. The authors need to explain how their data support this conclusion.</p><p>7) Is it possible that the suppressor mutations in ECT-2 (<italic>xs110</italic> and <italic>xs111</italic>) affect other functions than GEF activity? It might be worth discussing this possibility.</p><p>8) In the subsection “Mechanism of ECT-2 activation and Positive Feedback”, the authors refer first to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and then to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig5">Figures 2, 4, 5</xref> as supporting two conclusions. It would help if the authors elaborate to explicitly state what data in these figures support these conclusions.</p><p>9) The authors should explicitly state what they think the GAP active site does to influence ECT-2 GEF activity.</p><p>10) In the subsection “Mechanism of ECT-2 activation and Positive Feedback”, the authors state that CYK-4 GAP binds RhoA•GTP, but the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> in fact shows it binding RhoA:GDP. This should be explained.</p><p>11) The model diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) did not really do much to help me understand how they authors think CYK-4 activates RhoA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>CYK-4 plays a crucial role in cytokinesis as a non-motor subunit of centralspindlin, which bundles microtubules to form the central spindle and midbody. However, the role of the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 remains unclear or controversial as the authors nicely describe in the Introduction. The cell biological and genetical data that the Glotzer lab has been providing in a recent series of papers are indeed very difficult to explain with Rac or Cdc42 as sole targets of CYK-4 but are consistent with the positive role of CYK-4 on RhoA activation. A major difficulty of this theory is that a GAP usually promotes conversion of a GTPase from GTP-form to GDP-form, which is in general an inactive form, by stimulating the GTP hydrolysis. A clear molecular mechanism for CYK-4 to activate RhoA has been a huge missing link in the file of cytokinesis.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examined various mutations in the GAP domain of CYK-4 including the E448K mutation that had previously been identified as a temperature-sensitive lethal allele <italic>(or749ts)</italic> and can be suppressed by loss-of-function of the CED-10/Rac or its effectors. By combination with the loss-of-function of NOP-1, a mysterious activator of Ect2 RhoGEF specific for nematodes, and RGA-3/4, a well conserved GAP that specifically inactivates Rho, the authors have strengthen their previous conclusion “that the RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 has an essential role in RhoA activation” (this is the title of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria, 2012</xref>) except for a concern about the presence of other Rac proteins in addition to CED-10 (see below), which was not considered. Very interestingly, a screen for suppressors of <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> identified two novel alleles of Ect2 RhoGEF that cause its hyper activation, consistently with the proposed role of CYK-4 in RhoA activation. Finally, the authors tried to reveal biochemical mechanisms of RhoA activation by CYK-4 and found the direct binding between the GEF domain of ECT-2 and the C-terminal fragment of CYK-4 containing C1 and RhoGAP domains.</p><p>These are all interesting findings. However, it is questionable whether these are sufficient to support the authors’ rather strong claim that the non-canonical activity of CYK-4 RhoGAP domain promotes RhoA activation though its interaction with the GEF domain of ECT-2. The novel interaction between CYK-4 GAP and ECT-2 GEF domains relies solely on a single binding experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (7C and 7D are just unconvincing attempts to explain the hyper activation of ECT-2 by the new <italic>ect-2</italic> alleles suggested by the in vivo phenotype). I really appreciate the amount of work necessary for the cell biology and genetics experiments. However, these are just strengthening their own already published claim. To propose a molecular mechanism of RhoA activation by the CYK-4 RhoGAP domain, stronger in vitro data should be provided at lease those obvious and feasible ones such as the influences of all the GAP mutations studied in vivo on the CYK-4-ECT-2 interaction.</p><p>Another concern is that the authors' logics are sometimes inconsistent. For example, as the explanations for the similar weaker cortical accumulation of the E448K and EE mutants, which show very similar in vivo phenotypes (slow ingression and regression at ∼50% ingression around 300s, weaker cortical accumulation, no furrowing upon <italic>nop-1</italic> loss-of-function), they employed different reasonings, indirect effect on the function of C1 domain and the weakened interaction with RhoA, respectively. I agree with the authors on that mutations inside a protein fold might make the folding less stable more frequently than surface mutations and understand that a concern about this possibility prompted the current studies. However, this is an issue to be answered by proper biochemical/biophysical assays such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, which was undertaken in a recent paper from the Glotzer lab (White et al., 2013 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707682/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707682/</ext-link>). Otherwise, based on the phenotypic similarity, it would be more reasonable to explain the phenotype of the E448K mutation is also caused by the reduced affinity to Rho (or other GTPases). Anyway, there are different possible mechanisms for the cortical recruitment of CYK-4 that are not necessarily exclusive to each other; C1-phosphoinositide interaction, GAP-Rho interaction, interaction with astral microtubule gathered by the ingressing furrow. This should be explained more explicitly rather than picking up a convenient one for individual cases.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) A table of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study with strain names and genotypes should be provided.</p><p>2) The following statements are ambiguous: “The RhoGAP activity of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP functions non-canonically” (title), “serve as a RhoGAP” and “consistent with CYK-4 RhoGAP activity” (Abstract). It should be clarified what the authors mean by “RhoGAP”. ‘RhoGAP activity’ could be any kind of activity that the RhoGAP domain has, the GAP activity against any Rho-family GTPase or a GAP activity specifically for Rho (but not for other GTPases such as Rac or Cdc42). It might be helpful to use “RhoGAP” for a domain name and “Rho-GAP”, “Rac-GAP”, “Rho-family-GAP” etc. for referring.</p><p>3) In the subsection “RhoA activation during cytokinesis”, the authors state: “The direct activator of RhoA during cytokinesis is the RhoGEF ECT-2”. There are other RhoA activators during cytokinesis such as GEF-H1 (Birkenfeld J 2007 Dev. Cell <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488622">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488622</ext-link>). “A major activator of RhoA…” would be reasonable.</p><p>4) In the subsection “RhoA activation during cytokinesis”, you claim that “recruitment of ECT-2 to the spindle midzone involves regulated binding between ECT-2 and CYK-4…”. So far, the regulation of the interaction between CYK-4 and ECT-2 by phosphorylation by PLK-1 has only been shown in mammalian cells although there is no strong reason to imagine that the same regulation might not work in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>5) Please clarify the following reference: “…it appears to be required to activate RhoA (D'Avino 2004)”. Although D'Avino et al. claimed “these observations are consistent with RacGAP50C inhibiting Rac and promoting Rho activity” and put RacGAP50C upstream to Rho in their model, this does not necessarily mean RacGAP50C is “required” for RhoA activation.</p><p>6) “These results suggest that this mutation in CYK-4 affects more than the RhoGAP activity of CYK-4 or that CED-10/Rac1 is not the relevant target of the GAP domain, or both” (Introduction). This is neglecting another obvious possibility that there might be another Rac that works redundantly with CED-10. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two additional Rac-related genes, RAC-2 and MIG-2.</p><p>7) “…Subsequent analysis demonstrated that <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> does cause a phenotype in <italic>ced-10</italic>-embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria et al., 2012</xref>)” (Introduction). This might be due to elevated RAC-2 and MIG-2 activities by the <italic>cyk-4</italic> mutation, which still remained after the depletion of CED-10. Imperfect restoration of the wild-type behavior does not discredit the importance of the suppression of Rac and downstream effectors.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1A, 1B, 3A, 3B</xref>: Why is there a big difference between the central spindle signal of CYK-4<sup>∆C1</sup>::GFP and CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup>::GFP? Five slices with 2.5 µm intervals should cover a range of 10 µm, which covers more than two thirds of the thickness of the 50%-ingressed cleavage furrow. For quantification, it is not clear how the usage of mCherry::PH as a standard is justified. The PH domain labels the plasma membrane by binding to phosphoinositides, which might be regulated by Rho-fmaily GTPases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914539">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914539</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114633/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114633/</ext-link>). Indeed, mCherry::PH signal at the 50%-ingresssed furrow is stronger in <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup><italic>::gap</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B ii</xref>) than in <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> the first row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B i</xref>). The intensities of mCherry::PH used for standardization must be presented.</p><p>9) Another issue related to these experiments is that how CYK-4 accumulates at the furrow cortex is not clear. Although the authors mention it as accumulation on the plasma membrane, it might be reflecting the interactions between the C1 domain and phosphoinositides or between RhoGAP-Rho, or the compaction of the equatorial asters by the ingressing furrow.</p><p>10) How about the temperature sensitivity of EE and R459A?</p><p>11) In the subsection “The <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic> allele, E448K, exhibits defects in membrane association”, the authors state: “the onset of furrow ingression is delayed relative to controls in <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>E448K</italic></sup> embryos, but not in <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>∆C1</italic></sup> embryos”. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the deformation of the plasma membrane in the E448K embryo starts at the similar timing to the WT one (∼ at the 9th time point) while it becomes debatable in the ∆C1 embryo in the 11th or 12th time point. From the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, no clear difference is detected in the timing of the furrow initiation while the ingression is clearly slower in the E448K embryos.</p><p>12) Please clarify the following passage: “…such that it facilitates the abscission step in <italic>cyk-4(or749ts)</italic>; <italic>ced-10(n1933)</italic> embryos”. It is not clear why the abscission was suddenly mentioned while no experiment has been performed to specifically examine it.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>: Controls are missing to prove that the bands in the bead-bound fractions represent the specific binding to RhoA instead of beads or GST. Binding to the GST-alone beads needs to be performed in parallel. How is the binding affected by the E448K mutation?</p><p>14) In the subsection “Mutants in the active site of the CYK-4 GAP domain are cytokinesis-defective”, the authors claim: “Thus, the GAP activity of CYK-4 is not essential for post embryonic development but…”. This is superficially true. However, there is another possibility that the mutant message/product might delay the consumption of the wild-type message/product derived from the heterozygous mother and kept the level of functional CYK-4 enough for post embryonic development (but not for maturation of germ line). The sentences “Thus, while early embryos require the GAP activity of CYK-4, this requirement is relaxed post embryonically” and “…as some cell types may not require the GAP activity of CYK-4, as seen in post embryonic cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>” (subsection “GEF activation model accounts for previous results”) should also be reconsidered.</p><p>15) “CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> hyper accumulates on the membrane as compared to WT CYK-4; this localization suggests that CYK-4<sup>R459A</sup> is well folded in vivo” – is this logical? In general, partial misfolding might result in tighter membrane binding by forming small aggregates.</p><p>16) The sentence: “If furrow formation is dependent on CYK-4 binding to either CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42, then inactivation of these GTPases would be predicated to cause a phenotype at least as severe as a mutation that weakens the GTPase binding site of CYK-4”. This inexplicitly assumes that these GTPases are positive regulators of the furrow formation. Thus, the logical conclusion of experimental observations is that furrow formation is independent of CYK-4 binding to them or that these are not positive regulators of the furrow formation.</p><p>17) Figure 1–figure supplement 4 and 5: Is the structure on which CYK-4<sup>E448K</sup>::GFP was detected really the gonad membrane? The DIC image is not clear which structure is stained. Only after comparison with the images in Figure1–figure supplement 5 can readers understand what the structure labeled with the CYK-4 mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> is.</p><p>18) Please clarify this statement: “These data demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the CYK-4 GAP domain must have a function that is distinct from maintaining CED-10/Rac1 in an inactive sate”. This assumes that CED-10 is the only GTPase to be inactivated by CYK-4.</p><p>19) “However, CYK-4 and ECT-2 form a protein complex through their regulatory N-termini, therefore the C-terminal RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 will be in the vicinity of the ECT-2 RhoGEF domain” (subsection “<italic>cyk-4</italic> suppressor mutations activate <italic>ect-2</italic>). This is not true. Whether the C-termini are in the vicinity is nothing to do with the fact that they bind through the N-termini.</p><p>20) In the same subsection: “…the E129K substitution, but not G707D, significantly reduces binding of the ECT-2 N- and C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>)…”. As the MBP-ECT-2_N wild type and E129K proteins are the different protein samples prepared independently, strictly, the data provided can't exclude a possibility that MBP-ECT-2_N wild-type shows stronger non-specific binding to the GSH-beads or GST than the E129K mutant. Control experiments with GST instead of GST-ECT-2_DHPH should be performed in parallel.</p><p>21) In the Results: “The ECT-2G707D variant exhibits a modest increase in GEF activity compared to wild-type ECT-2 over a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).” This is not really convincing. The same amount of the wild-type and mutant proteins are supposed to have been loaded on the gel. However, there is a small but clear difference in the intensity of the bands, especially the ∼50 kDa minor ones. I am afraid that there might also be a similar difference between the main bands. The difference between 1 µg and 1.2 µg is barely detectable by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In general, it is not trivial to quantify protein concentration with the precision of less than 10% error. Anyway, in the first place, it is questionable whether such a minor difference in the GEF activity can explain the dramatic in vivo phenotype.</p><p>22) The references in this sentence are misleading: “Accurate reconstitutions will need to account for the facts that cytokinetic RhoA activation involves the CYK-4 C1 domain, the ability of CYK-4 to bind to ZEN-4, and the ability of ZEN-4 to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basant, et al., 2015</xref>).” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> does not test the oligomerization.

The authors should directly address how these observations relate to their conclusions concerning their model for how CYK-4 functions as an activator of RhoA.</italic></p><p>We have more extensively addressed the differential activity of CYK–4 GAP activity towards Rho family GTPases in the Discussion. We suggest that it may be inactive towards RhoA because it would induce futile cycling of RhoA. We now mention that the activity toward Rac activity could have other functions in other contexts: “Not only does this model explain why CYK–4 retains GAP activity towards RhoA, it also explains why its ability to inactivate RhoA is attenuated. High turnover rates of RhoA•GTP induced by CYK–4 might rapidly consume RhoA•GTP at the site of production, yielding a futile cycle of RhoA activation and inactivation.”</p><p>We have also added the statement (subsection “GEF activation model can account for many previous results”): “We do not rule out the possibility that, in certain contexts, CYK–4 or its orthologs negatively regulate Rac or Cdc42. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that the Xenopus ortholog of CYK–4 regulates junctional GTPases.”</p><p><italic>2) With respect to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors should discuss why there is some furrow ingression in embryos expressing CYK-4 lacking the C1 domain, and lacking</italic> nop-1 <italic>and</italic> ced-10 <italic>(in contrast to CYK-4</italic><sup><italic>E448K</italic></sup><italic>).</italic></p><p>In embryos expressing CYK–4<sup>∆C1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) we observe some furrowing which is due to the presence of NOP–1 as it is absent in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The furrowing in <italic>CYK–4</italic><sup><italic>∆C1</italic></sup> embryos is slightly enhanced when CED–10 is mutated, however these embryos are not defective for NOP–1. We did not present data on CYK–4<sup>∆C1</sup>, <italic>nop–1(-)</italic> or <italic>ced–10(-)</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) In two places (subsection “The</italic> cyk-4(or749ts) <italic>allele, E448K, exhibits defects in membrane association” and “CYK-4 GAP domain mutations that prevent RhoA binding are highly defective in RhoA activation”), the authors conclude results paragraphs by stating that an observation is “important” without explaining why it is important. Doing so might help clarify their conclusions.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for helping to clarify the manuscript. In the first case is it important because it shows that suppression of CYK–4 <sup>E448K</sup> by inactivation of <italic>ced–10(-)</italic> is completely dependent on NOP–1. That is, <italic>nop–1(-)</italic> and CYK–4<sup>WT</sup> embryos are cytokinesis competent (and viable), but <italic>nop–1(-)</italic>, CYK–4<sup>E448K</sup> and <italic>ced–10(-)</italic> are completely defective in furrowing which would not be the prediction if the sole function of the GAP activity of CYK–4 is to maintain CED–10 in the inactive state.</p><p>The revised text now reads: “Importantly, when NOP–1 activity is compromised, inactivation of CED–10/Rac1 does not suppress the defect in furrow ingression caused by CYK–4<sup>E448K</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, I</xref>), suggesting that CYK–4 does not act directly on CED–10.”</p><p>Similarly in the second case, the result shows that whereas CYK–4<sup>WT</sup> is capable of inducing furrow ingression in the absence of NOP–1 CYK–4EE is not. The revised text now reads: “Thus, Rho GTPase binding by CYK–4 is essential for centralspindlin-mediated cytokinetic ingression.”</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Mutations in the active site of CYK-4 can be suppressed by RGA-3/4 depletion”, the authors refer to hyper-contractility after RGA-3/4 depletion and imply (and to some extent document) that this phenotype is suppressed by CYK-4 mutants. The authors should more explicitly state if this is an accurate conclusion.</italic></p><p>We did not intend to imply that all of the hypercontractility observed in RGA–3/4-depleted embryos is CYK–4 dependent. Indeed, in a previous publication we showed that the hypercontractility <italic>during pseudocleavage</italic> in RGA–3/4-depleted embryos is NOP–1 dependent. Thus RGA–3/4 depletion enhances RhoA activity, irrespective of the activator – which in pseudocleavage is NOP–1 and in cytokinesis is primarily CYK–4. We modified this sentence to clarify this point without getting into too much detail: “As previously shown, depletion of RGA–3/4 causes cortical hypercontractility in otherwise wild-type embryos, <italic>during both pseudocleavage and during cytokinesis</italic>, and results in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schonegg et al., 2007</xref>)”. In addition, we added this to the Discussion: “However, loss of CYK–4 GAP activity and loss of RGA–3/4 counterbalance each other <italic>during cytokinesis</italic>”.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “Mutations in the active site of CYK-4 can be suppressed by RGA-3/4 depletion”, the authors refer to an allelic series of CYK-4 mutants. It might be helpful to explicitly state why the different mutants exhibit this gradation in effect.</italic></p><p><italic>6) In the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors state that their data indicate that CYK-4 has to act catalytically on RhoA•GTP. The authors need to explain how their data support this conclusion.</italic></p><p>These are two excellent suggestions, which we have addressed by adding a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2A</xref>) and by adding a paragraph to the Discussion (“This working model is supported by the finding that full activation […] within the ECT– 2 GEF domain”).</p><p><italic>7) Is it possible that the suppressor mutations in ECT-2 (</italic>xs110 <italic>and</italic> xs111<italic>) affect other functions than GEF activity? It might be worth discussing this possibility.</italic></p><p>Two lines of evidence indicate that these mutations increase the overall activity of ECT–2. First, the mutations cause an increase in contractility. Second, biochemical evidence indicates that <italic>xs111</italic> impairs the auto inhibitory binding between the N-and C-termini of ECT–2 and that <italic>xs110</italic> causes a modest increase in GEF activity. While circumstantial this interpretation is consistent with the partial suppression caused by depletion of RGA–3/4.</p><p><italic>8) In the subsection “Mechanism of ECT-2 activation and Positive Feedback”, the authors refer first to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, and then to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 2, 4, 5</italic></xref> <italic>as supporting two conclusions.

This should be explained.</italic></p><p>Please see points 5 and 6 above.</p><p><italic>11) The model diagram (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref><italic>) did not really do much to help me understand how they authors think CYK-4 activates RhoA.</italic></p><p>We hope the additional paragraph and supplemental figure make our model more explicit and clarify this point (please see points 5 and 6, above).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Specific points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A table of the</italic> C. elegans <italic>strains used in this study with strain names and genotypes should be provided.</italic></p><p>Our strain table has been provided.</p><p><italic>2) The following statements are ambiguous: “The RhoGAP activity of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP functions non-canonically” (title), “serve as a RhoGAP” and “consistent with CYK-4 RhoGAP activity” (Abstract). It should be clarified what the authors mean by “RhoGAP”. ‘RhoGAP activity’ could be any kind of activity that the RhoGAP domain has, the GAP activity against any Rho-family GTPase or a GAP activity specifically for Rho (but not for other GTPases such as Rac or Cdc42). It might be helpful to use “RhoGAP” for a domain name and “Rho-GAP”, “Rac-GAP”, “Rho-family-GAP” etc. for referring.</italic></p><p>We have clarified the substrate for the RhoGAP activity in the Abstract. In addition, where possible, we have used the agnostic term GAP domain in many places and where we discuss RGA–3/4, we refer to it as a RhoA GAP.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “RhoA activation during cytokinesis”, the authors state: “The direct activator of RhoA during cytokinesis is the RhoGEF ECT-2”. There are other RhoA activators during cytokinesis such as GEF-H1 (Birkenfeld J 2007 Dev. Cell</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488622"><italic>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488622</italic></ext-link><italic>). “A major activator of RhoA…” would be reasonable.</italic></p><p>ECT–2 is required for all RhoGAP activity during cytokinesis in human cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We have revised this sentence to read: “The primary direct activator of RhoA during cytokinesis is the RhoGEF ECT–2”.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “RhoA activation during cytokinesis”, you claim that “recruitment of ECT-2 to the spindle midzone involves regulated binding between ECT-2 and CYK-4…”. So far, the regulation of the interaction between CYK-4 and ECT-2 by phosphorylation by PLK-1 has only been shown in mammalian cells although there is no strong reason to imagine that the same regulation might not work in</italic> C. elegans<italic>.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct about this point. We do not wish to imply that this has been established for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins, though, like the reviewer, we have no reason to believe that it is not the case for the following reasons. First, preliminary experiments suggested that Plk1 phosphorylation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CYK–4 facilitates binding by <italic>C. elegans</italic> ECT–2. Secondly, Plk–1 depletion has been shown to impair completion of cytokinesis (PMID 20823068). Finally, in the sentences that precede this remark, we state: “Though these proteins are conserved, their names are distinct in each organism. For simplicity, <italic>C. elegans</italic> names will be used throughout this manuscript with the exception that we will refer to RHO–1 with the more common name RhoA.” Thus, it is explicit that the statement in question does not necessarily refer to the nematode proteins and, indeed, the cited references refer to experiments in cultured mammalian cells.</p><p><italic>5) Please clarify the following reference: “…it appears to be required to activate RhoA (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><italic>D'Avino 2004</italic></xref><italic>)”. Although D'Avino et al. claimed “these observations are consistent with RacGAP50C inhibiting Rac and promoting Rho activity” and put RacGAP50C upstream to Rho in their model, this does not necessarily mean RacGAP50C is “required” for RhoA activation.</italic></p><p>We have edited this phrase to “it appears to promote RhoA activation”. In addition, the previous sentence also cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Avino, 2004</xref> and states: “in others it appears to be important to negatively regulate Rac1”.</p><p><italic>6) “These results suggest that this mutation in CYK-4 affects more than the RhoGAP activity of CYK-4 or that CED-10/Rac1 is not the relevant target of the GAP domain, or both” (Introduction). This is neglecting another obvious possibility that there might be another Rac that works redundantly with CED-10.</italic> C. elegans <italic>has two additional Rac-related genes, RAC-2 and MIG-2.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have addressed this point by a number of avenues. First, in the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canman et al., 2008</xref>, reported:</p><p>“RNAi of CDC–42 or MIG–2 also did not ameliorate the CYK–4GAP(E448K) cytokinesis phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, RNAi of CED–10 or RAC–2 led to substantial rescue, allowing 70% and 24%, respectively, of CYK–4GAP(E448K) embryos to successfully complete the first cytokinesis. Simultaneous RNAi of CED–10 and RAC–2 did not increase the efficiency of rescue over RNAi of RacCED–10 alone (Figure Supplement 4D).”</p><p>Thus previous work does not support a cytokinetic role for RAC–2 or MIG–2. However, as the authors noted in the supplemental information, the conservation between CED–10 and RAC–2 at the nucleotide level are such that either of these dsRNAs could, in principle, deplete both CED–10 and RAC–2.</p><p>To clarify this issue, several years ago, we examined whether a strong loss of function mutation in <italic>ced–10</italic> could suppress the cytokinetic defect in <italic>cyk–4(or749ts)</italic> and found that it could (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria, 2012</xref>). This strongly suggested that CED–10 is the major Rac protein whose activity modulates cytokinesis. If RAC–2 had a significant role, mutation of <italic>ced–10</italic> would not be predicted to phenocopy the potential co-depletion of both CED–10 and RAC–2. Furthermore, mutation of <italic>ced–10</italic> and depletion of the <italic>arp2/3</italic> subunit ARX–2 identically modified the phenotype <italic>cyk–4(or749ts)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loria, 2012</xref>). If both CED–10 and RAC–2 functioned upstream of <italic>arx–2</italic>, mutation of <italic>ced–10</italic> would be predicted to be less effective than depletion of ARX–2.</p><p>To further examine whether other Rac proteins will modulate cytokinesis in the early embryo, we depleted either ARX–2 or RAC–2 in <italic>cyk–4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup> embryos. We found that depletion of ARX–2, but not RAC–2, rescued cytokinesis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that RAC–2 is not a target for the GAP domain of CYK–4.</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>mig-2</italic> gain of function alleles (mutations in the equivalent of G12 of Ras) are viable, though they exhibit cell migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zipkin, 1997</xref>). These gain of function phenotypes are significantly stronger than the corresponding null mutation. This indicates that the <italic>mig–2</italic> alleles are indeed activated alleles and the high viability of these strains suggests that <italic>mig–2</italic> does not regulate cytokinesis. To further investigate the possibility that <italic>mig–2</italic> does affect cytokinesis, we obtained a gain of function allele <italic>mig–2(gm103)</italic> and tested whether this allele affects cytokinesis in NOP–1 or ZYG–9 depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). These two depletions were chosen because they are effective ways of sensitizing cytokinesis to genetic perturbations (see PMID 17669650, 22918944 for examples). Unlike <italic>cyk–4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup> embryos, <italic>mig– 2</italic>;<italic>nop–1</italic> embryos successfully finish cytokinesis, indicating that activation of MIG–2 does not affect the centralspindlin-dependent pathway for furrow formation. In addition, <italic>mig–2</italic>;<italic>zyg–9</italic> embryos form both anterior and posterior furrows, indicating that the central spindle-independent and central spindle-dependent pathways are not affected by activation of MIG–2.</p><p>Next, we depleted either ARX–2 or RAC–2 from <italic>nop–1;ced–10 cyk–4(or749ts)</italic> embryos. We found that neither arx–2 nor rac–2 depletion modified the cytokinesis phenotypes in <italic>nop–1;ced–10;cyk–4(or749ts)</italic> embryos, i.e. <italic>arx–2 nop–1;ced–10 cyk– 4(or749ts)</italic> and <italic>rac–2;nop–1;ced–10 cyk–4(or749ts)</italic> embryos had no furrow ingression during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that RAC–2, nor any other proteins upstream of ARX–2, are critical targets for the GAP activity of CYK–4.</p><p>We note that previous studies have also concluded that: “by contrast, <italic>ced–10</italic> is uniquely required for cell-corpse phagocytosis, and <italic>mig–2</italic> and <italic>rac–2</italic> have only subtle roles in this process. (PMID 11714673)”.</p><p>Thus, there are precedents for different Rac proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> functioning both redundantly and non-redundantly.</p><p><italic>7) “…Subsequent analysis demonstrated that</italic> cyk-4(or749ts) <italic>does cause a phenotype in</italic> ced-10<italic>-embryos (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><italic>Loria et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>)” (Introduction). This might be due to elevated RAC-2 and MIG-2 activities by the</italic> cyk-4 <italic>mutation, which still remained after the depletion of CED-10.

Five slices with 2.5 µm intervals should cover a range of 10 µm, which covers more than two thirds of the thickness of the 50%-ingressed cleavage furrow.

Although the authors mention it as accumulation on the plasma membrane, it might be reflecting the interactions between the C1 domain and phosphoinositides or between RhoGAP-Rho, or the compaction of the equatorial asters by the ingressing furrow.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment that the exact mechanism by which CYK–4 accumulates at the furrow cortex is not entirely clear. However, the results in this manuscript suggest that membrane association of CYK–4 involves both its C1 domain and its ability to bind RhoA. In addition, our results indicate that it is not mediated by the compaction of the astral microtubules because its membrane localization domain is required, which would not be predicted to (nor are they seen to) affect central spindle assembly.</p><p><italic>10) How about the temperature sensitivity of EE and R459A?</italic></p><p>CYK–4<sup>EE</sup> and CYK–4<sup>R459A</sup> fail to support viability at both 16°C and 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>11) In the subsection “The</italic> cyk-4(or749ts) <italic>allele, E448K, exhibits defects in membrane association”, the authors state: “the onset of furrow ingression is delayed relative to controls in</italic> cyk-4<sup>E448K</sup> <italic>embryos, but not in</italic> cyk-4<sup>∆C1</sup> <italic>embryos”.

How is the binding affected by the E448K mutation?</italic></p><p>We have repeated these experiments to provide the requested controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as these additional controls render the figure significantly more complicated, we have not replaced the supplemental figure (though it would be straightforward to do if the editor/reviewers deemed it appropriate). The EE mutant serves as an internal control for CYK–4 GAP domains non-specifically binding to GST. We have not investigated the binding to RhoA by <italic>E448K</italic> allele because (i) this allele is not a primary focus of the manuscript, it only features in the manuscript to show that it is not an appropriate allele for specifically assessing GAP function and as an tool to obtain suppressor alleles; (ii) as a Ts allele, its behavior is expected to be temperature dependent and it is not uncommon for Ts alleles to exhibit more severe defect in vitro.</p><p><italic>14) In the subsection “Mutants in the active site of the CYK-4 GAP domain are cytokinesis-defective”, the authors claim: “Thus, the GAP activity of CYK-4 is not essential for post embryonic development but…”. This is superficially true. However, there is another possibility that the mutant message/product might delay the consumption of the wild-type message/product derived from the heterozygous mother and kept the level of functional CYK-4 enough for post embryonic development (but not for maturation of germ line). The sentences “…while early embryos require the GAP activity of CYK-4, this requirement is relaxed post embryonically” and “…as some cell types may not require the GAP activity of CYK-4, as seen in post embryonic cells in</italic> C. elegans<italic>” (subsection “GEF activation model accounts for previous results”) should also be reconsidered.</italic></p><p>While it is formally possible that zygotic rescue is due to the indirect mechanism the review alludes to, however, we think this is very unlikely as equivalent zygotic rescue is not observed with CYK–4<sup>∆C1</sup> which would be predicted to rescue via similar indirect effects.</p><p><italic>15) “CYK-4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup> <italic>hyper accumulates on the membrane as compared to WT CYK-4; this localization suggests that CYK-4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup> <italic>is well folded in vivo” – is this logical? In general, partial misfolding might result in tighter membrane binding by forming small aggregates.</italic></p><p>As R459 is a charged residue on the surface of the protein, there is no reason a priori why it would cause misfolding. Furthermore, a misfolded protein would not be predicted to localize in a highly specific site in a cell cycle specific manner. Finally, this type of behavior has been observed previously with the RhoGAP RGA–3/4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanin et al., 2013</xref> PMID 24012485).</p><p><italic>16) The sentence: “If furrow formation is dependent on CYK-4 binding to either CED-10/Rac1 or CDC-42, then inactivation of these GTPases would be predicated to cause a phenotype at least as severe as a mutation that weakens the GTPase binding site of CYK-4”. This inexplicitly assumes that these GTPases are positive regulators of the furrow formation. Thus, the logical conclusion of experimental observations is that furrow formation is independent of CYK-4 binding to them or that these are not positive regulators of the furrow formation.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct that this is an implicit assumption of the experiment. To address this concern, we have made this assumption explicit: “If furrow formation is dependent on CYK–4 binding to either CED–10/Rac1 or CDC–42 to generate a positive regulatory complex, then inactivation of these GTPases would be predicted to cause a phenotype at least as severe as a mutation that weakens the GTPase binding site of CYK–4.”</p><p><italic>17) Figure 1–figure supplement 4 and 5: Is the structure on which CYK-4</italic><sup><italic>E448K</italic></sup><italic>::GFP was detected really the gonad membrane? The DIC image is not clear which structure is stained. Only after comparison with the images in Figure1–figure supplement 5 can readers understand what the structure labeled with the CYK-4 mutant in Figure 1–figure supplement 4 is.</italic></p><p>To clarify this point, we have merged Figure 1–figure supplements 4 and 5.</p><p><italic>18) Please clarify this statement: “These data demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the CYK-4 GAP domain must have a function that is distinct from maintaining CED-10/Rac1 in an inactive sate”. This assumes that CED-10 is the only GTPase to be inactivated by CYK-4.</italic></p><p>See point 6 above.</p><p><italic>19) “However, CYK-4 and ECT-2 form a protein complex through their regulatory N-termini, therefore the C-terminal RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 will be in the vicinity of the ECT-2 RhoGEF domain” (subsection “</italic>cyk-4 <italic>suppressor mutations activate</italic> ect-2<italic>). This is not true. Whether the C-termini are in the vicinity is nothing to do with the fact that they bind through the N-termini.</italic></p><p>The issue here appears to be a semantic one related to the definition of vicinity. When two proteins form a complex, they are in the vicinity of each other (i.e. within ∼ 10 nm, depending on the size/shape of the proteins). Assuming the various domains are connected by flexible linkers, the interaction of one domain on each of the two proteins would greatly favor the interaction with the other, by virtue of increasing their effective concentration. This is described in detail in an excellent review by Kuriyan and Eisenberg (PMID 18075577).</p><p><italic>20) In the same subsection: “…the E129K substitution, but not G707D, significantly reduces binding of the ECT-2 N- and C-terminal (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref><italic>)…”. As the MBP-ECT-2_N wild type and E129K proteins are the different protein samples prepared independently, strictly, the data provided can't exclude a possibility that MBP-ECT-2_N wild-type shows stronger non-specific binding to the GSH-beads or GST than the E129K mutant. Control experiments with GST instead of GST-ECT-2_DHPH should be performed in parallel.</italic></p><p>We have performed this additional control experiment which demonstrated that the interaction is not mediated via the GST domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Again, we leave the original simpler figure as the E129K mutant provides and internal control that MBP-ECT–2N constructs do not non-specifically interact with GST tagged ECT–2C constructs.</p><p><italic>21) In the Results: “The ECT-2G707D variant exhibits a modest increase in GEF activity compared to wild-type ECT-2 over a range of concentrations (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref><italic>)”. This is not really convincing. The same amount of the wild-type and mutant proteins are supposed to have been loaded on the gel. However, there is a small but clear difference in the intensity of the bands, especially the ∼50 kDa minor ones. I am afraid that there might also be a similar difference between the main bands. The difference between 1 µg and 1.2 µg is barely detectable by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In general, it is not trivial to quantify protein concentration with the precision of less than 10% error. Anyway, in the first place, it is questionable whether such a minor difference in the GEF activity can explain the dramatic in vivo phenotype.</italic></p><p>This mutation certainly provides rescue of both <italic>cyk–4(or749)</italic> and <italic>cyk-4</italic><sup><italic>R459A</italic></sup>; structural homology modeling suggests this mutation lies near the Rho binding interface and a reproducible increase in specific activity is observed. The reviewer questions whether this change is specific activity is sufficient to explain the phenotype in vivo. Given the available information, the simplest interpretation is that the mutation increase GEF activity. It is possible that the in vivo assay in dilute aqueous solutions doesn’t fully capture the effect that this mutation has in vivo.</p><p><italic>22) The references in this sentence are misleading: “Accurate reconstitutions will need to account for the facts that cytokinetic RhoA activation involves the CYK-4 C1 domain, the ability of CYK-4 to bind to ZEN-4, and the ability of ZEN-4 to oligomerize (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>) (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><italic>Basant, et al., 2015</italic></xref><italic>).”</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>does not test the oligomerization.

They have been relocated within the sentence to address this reviewer’s concerns. Although the reviewer is correct that mutation in the oligomerization domain does not prevent furrowing, it is important to note that the defect in oligomerization motif was assayed in the presence of NOP–1, which we have shown is sufficient to induce furrowing in <italic>cyk–4</italic> mutant embryos. However, this point is addressed by Basant et al. In that paper we showed that <italic>nop–1;air–2</italic> embryos are defective in contractility and this defect can be completely reversed by depletion of par–5. Furthermore, the hypercontractility phenotype caused by depletion of PAR–5 is phenocopied by mutation of ZEN–4 S682A (which is unable to bind PAR–5). PAR–5 was previously shown to inhibit centralspindlin oligomerization by binding to phospho-S682 MKLP1 (PMID 20451386). Collectively, these results indicate that the defect in RhoA activation in <italic>nop–1; air–2</italic> mutants is caused by a failure of centralspindlin to oligomerize. Furthermore, in Basant et al., we showed that the hypercontractility caused by PAR–5 depletion (which is phenocopied by mutation of ZEN–4 S682A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is ECT–2-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figire 1 C, D</xref>) and is associated with an increase in RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In summary, hyperoligomerization of ZEN–4 (either PAR–5 depletion or S682A) induces hyperactivation of RhoA and hypo-oligomerization of ZEN–4 (aurora B inhibition) prevents RhoA activation.</p><p><italic>23) “RhoA inactivation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><italic>Miller and Bement, 2009</italic></xref><italic>)” (subsection “GEF activation model accounts for previous results”) – this is misleading, as the major claim of this paper is the importance of the flux of RhoA turnover facilitated by combination of GEF and GAP for the formation of a sharp zone of the active form of RhoA.</italic></p><p>While the authors of this paper interpret their results as indicating the importance of flux, they did not directly measure flux. They did demonstrate that inactivation of the GAP activity of CYK–4 results in an increase in RhoA activation. Indeed the Abstract of that paper states: “We propose that the GAP domain of MgcRacGAP has two unexpected roles throughout cytokinesis: first, it transiently anchors active Rho, and second, it promotes local Rho inactivation, resulting in the constant flux of Rho through the GTPase cycle”.</p><p><italic>24) Legend for Figure 6–figure supplement 1: What was the temperature?</italic></p><p>These experiments were performed at 25°C.</p><p><italic>25) In the subsection “Image quantification”, it is not clear how the time-series data sets of the normalized cortical distance were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.
