key importance for basic and translational immunology alike. To study T cells in vivo, we developed a new knock-in mouse line, which expresses a fusion protein of granzyme B, a key component of cytotoxic granules involved in T cell-mediated target cell-killing, and monomeric teal fluorescent protein from the endogenous <italic>Gzmb</italic> locus. Homozygous knock-ins, which are viable and fertile, have cytotoxic T lymphocytes with endogeneously fluorescent cytotoxic granules but wild-type-like killing capacity. Expression of the fluorescent fusion protein allows quantitative analyses of cytotoxic granule maturation, transport and fusion in vitro with super-resolution imaging techniques, and two-photon microscopy in living knock-ins enables the visualization of tissue rejection through individual target cell-killing events in vivo. Thus, the new mouse line is an ideal tool to study cytotoxic T lymphocyte biology and to optimize personalized immunotherapy in cancer treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cytotoxic, or killer, T cells are a key part of the immune system. They carry a lethal mixture of toxic chemicals, stored in packages called cytotoxic granules. Killer T cells inject the contents of these granules into infected, cancerous or otherwise foreign cells, forcing them to safely self-destruct. In test tubes, T cells are highly efficient serial killers, moving from one infected cell to the next at high speed. But, inside the body, their killing rate slows down. Researchers think that this has something to do with how killer T cells interact with other immune cells, but the details remain unclear.</p><p>To get to grips with how killer T cells work in their natural environment, researchers need a way to follow them inside the body. One approach could be to use genetic engineering to attach a fluorescent tag to a protein found inside killer T cells. That tag then acts as a beacon, lighting the cells up and allowing researchers to track their movements. Tagging a protein inside the cytotoxic granules would allow close monitoring of T cells as they encounter, recognize and kill their targets. But fluorescent tags are bulky, and they can stop certain proteins from working as they should.</p><p>To find out whether it is possible to track killer T cells with fluorescent tags, Chitirala, Chang et al. developed a new type of genetically modified mouse. The modification added a teal-colored tag to a protein inside the granules of the killer T cells. Chitirala, Chang et al. then used a combination of microscopy techniques inside and outside of the body to find out if the T cells still worked. This analysis showed that, not only were the tagged T cells able to kill diseased cells as normal, the tags made it possible to watch it happening in real time. Super-resolution microscopy outside of the body allowed Chitirala, Chang et al. to watch the killer T cells release their toxic granule content. It was also possible to follow individual T cells as they moved into, and destroyed, foreign tissue that had been transplanted inside the mice.</p><p>These new mice provide a tool to understand how killer T cells really work. They could allow study not only of the cells themselves, but also their interactions with other immune cells inside the body. This could help to answer open questions in T cell research, such as why T cells seem to be so much more efficient at killing in test tubes than they are inside the body. Understanding this better could support the development of new treatments for viruses and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytotoxic T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic granules</kwd><kwd>immune synapse</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>STED microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB894/A10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rettig</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB894/P1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krause</surname><given-names>Elmar</given-names></name><name><surname>Rettig</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRTG1830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ravichandran</surname><given-names>Keerthana</given-names></name><name><surname>Rettig</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB894/A17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leinders-Zufall</surname><given-names>Trese</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new knock-in mouse endogenously labels cytotoxic granules and can be used with all modern super-resolution imaging techniques to study T cell function in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are not only essential for the removal of foreign agents such as viruses or bacteria, but also play a key role in modern personalized cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Porter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharma and Allison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minutolo et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the major CTL function, that is the killing of cells through release of cytotoxic substances from cytotoxic granules (CGs) at the immune synapse (IS), is of utmost interest for basic and clinical science alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dustin and Long, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffiths et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). The release of perforin and granzymes from CGs has been studied in great detail using cultured primary CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kupfer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dustin and Long, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffiths et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voskoboinik et al., 2015</xref>), but corresponding approaches have neglected the fact that CTLs act in concert with other immune cells to perform their function in vivo. In essence, CTL function in isolation differs considerably from CTL function in vivo. However, in vivo studies on CTLs have been scarce due to their technical difficulties and the lack of suitable markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mempel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Germain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lodygin and Flügel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Torcellan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malo and Hickman, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We report here the generation of a GzmB-mTFP knock-in (KI) mouse that expresses a fluorescent fusion protein consisting of granzyme B (GzmB), a CG-resident serine protease, and monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP) from the endogenous <italic>Gzmb</italic> locus. The new GzmB-mTFP-KI allows the observation of individual CTLs and even CGs in living mice at any time point of interest. We show that GzmB-mTFP-KIs are viable, fertile and free of any obvious defects, that their T cell-specific functions are wild-type-identical, and that their CTLs can be imaged with all major super-resolution techniques in vitro and in vivo. We expect that the GzmB-mTFP-KI will be a highly valuable tool to investigate CTL function in vitro and in vivo - in the context of both, basic CTL biology and clinical aspects of CTL function, such as CTL-based personalized cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a GzmB-mTFP-KI mouse line</title><p>To create a specific, endogenous fluorescent label for cytotoxic granules (CG) we chose GzmB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masson and Tschopp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krahenbuhl et al., 1988</xref>), which belongs to a family of serine proteases that induce apoptosis of target cells and which is present in CGs of natural killer cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters et al., 1991</xref>).

Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and a corresponding HDR fragment, we replaced the Stop codon in exon 5 of the mouse <italic>Gzmb</italic> gene with a sequence encoding a flexible GGSGGSGGS linker, which has a high probability to be cleaved in the acidic environment of the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2014</xref>), the coding sequence of monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP), and a Stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Comparison of endogenous GzmB-mTFP and Syb2-mRFP fluorescence in CTLs on poly-ornithine or anti-CD3 coated coverslips again revealed excellent co-localization (Pearson's coefficient of correlation 0.88 ± 0.10 for poly-ornithine, and 0.86 ± 0.08 for anti-CD3, n = 25; Manders' coefficient of correlation 0.86 ± 0.08 for GzmB-mTFP vs. Syb2-mRFP and 0.79 ± 0.17 for Syb2-mRFP vs. GzmB-mTFP on poly-ornithine, 0.79 ± 0.13 for GzmB-mTFP vs. Syb2-mRFP and 0.81 ± 0.13 for Syb2-mRFP vs. GzmB-mTFP on anti-CD3, n = 25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). These data show that the cleavage of GzmB-mTFP we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) occurs inside CGs, so that the mTFP in the GzmB-mTFP-KI represents an excellent endogenous marker for studies of CG maturation, transport and fusion, without affecting GzmB localization and function. To visualize CG transport along the microtubular network, we incubated primary CTLs from GzmB-mTFP-KIs with silicon rhodamine(SiR)-tubulin, seeded them onto anti-CD3 coated coverslips to induce immune synapse (IS) formation and followed transport of CGs along microtubuli by live stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

The apparent resolution as determined by 'full width at half maximum (FWHM)' analysis was dependent on the recording conditions and the position of the cell within an islet. Typically within the first 40 µm from the islet surface, we reached a resolution of ~1 µm. While using two-photon instead of confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) did not increase the maximal resolution, the signal to noise ratio and the light-penetration depth were substantially increased.

While in vitro studies indicated that CTL-mediated target cell killing is highly efficient, two-photon imaging of lymph nodes in living mice demonstrated that CTLs kill on average only 4.5 target cells per day and require the cooperativity of several CTLs acting in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nolz and Hill, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halle et al., 2017</xref>). This surprising inefficiency in vivo is most likely caused by rate-limiting steps like CTL priming, CTL trafficking, CTL properties and target cell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halle et al., 2017</xref>). For the optimization of vaccines and CTL-based immunotherapies it is therefore of utmost importance to study CTL behavior in the physiological setting of a living organism.</p><p>We report the generation of a GzmB-mTFP-KI, in which all CGs of T cells are endogenously fluorescent due to an mTFP-tag at the CG-resident enzyme GzmB. We chose the mTFP tag because of its ideal suitability for two-photon imaging in vivo and for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drobizhev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gossa et al., 2015</xref>). mTFP is a derivative of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) from <italic>Clavularia</italic> coral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ai et al., 2006</xref>), is monomeric (26.9 kDa) unlike the tetrameric CFP, has a high brightness, photostability and quantum yield, is only weakly acid sensitive and has a narrow emission spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Day et al., 2008</xref>). The brightness, photostability and high quantum yield of mTFP are ideally suited for longitudinal, non-invasive imaging over extended time periods. In addition, mTFP is tolerated by the immune system upon adoptive transfer, which favors its use for imaging immune cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gossa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The biggest concern when using fusion protein tags is that the attached tag might interfere with the expression, localization or function of the tagged protein, in our case GzmB. GzmB is synthesized as a zymogen and cleaved by cathepsin C in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenne and Tschopp, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krahenbuhl et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caputo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perišić Nanut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voskoboinik et al., 2015</xref>), which removes an N-terminal 18-residue signal peptide and the downstream activation dipeptide Gly-Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caputo et al., 1993</xref>). To avoid interference with proper GzmB localization we therefore chose the C-terminus for fusion of mTFP. Further, we added a flexible GGSGGSGGS linker between GzmB and mTFP, which is cleaved in CGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Our co-localization analyses with perforin and the CG v-SNARE synaptobrevin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and TIRF imaging of individual CG fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrate that the mTFP and GzmB in the GzmB-mTFP-KI are correctly and specifically localized to CG, so that GzmB is not functionally compromised (see below) and mTFP can be used as a very faithful CG marker.</p><p>Beyond subcellular protein trafficking and localization, tags can affect protein function. Indeed, a recently published GzmB-tdTomato-KI exhibits reductions of 75% in GzmB expression, of 30% in CTL degranulation and of 25% in GzmB protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mouchacca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mouchacca et al., 2015</xref>). In striking contrast to this, our analyses of GzmB-mTFP-KI CTLs did not reveal any changes in GzmB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), CG transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>), CG fusion efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>), degranulation capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or killing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This may be partly due to the smaller size of mTFP as compared to tdTomato (26.9 vs. 54.2 kDa). More importantly, though, the fact that GzmB-mTFP appears to be efficiently cleaved into GzmB and mTFP in the acidic environment of the CG lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) contributes substantially to the almost perfect functionality of GzmB in the GzmB-mTFP-KI, so that GzmB can operate in an unperturbed manner while mTFP can still be used to follow CG localization, movement and fusion.</p><p>The advantages and potential of the novel GzmB-mTFP-KI are manifold. While many current in vivo studies require the removal of CTLs from lymphatic tissue and their exogenous labeling and re-injection via the tail vein, no manipulations are necessary for confocal or two-photon imaging in the GzmB-mTFP-KI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further, the subcellular targeting of GzmB-mTFP to CGs allows the investigation of individual CGs without compromising analyses of single CTLs in tissue.

cell) activity in vivo by tracking Granzyme B levels and localisation in real-time. This will be an excellent resource for groups studying a range of T and NK cell functions in many contexts from anti-viral defences to tumour immunotherapy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Studying the biology of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo with a fluorescent Granzyme B-mTFP knock-in mouse&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jennifer L Stow (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Advanced in vivo microscopy offers the ability to track fluorescently tagged cells, organelles and proteins in their native tissue environments providing invaluable insights for physiology and pathophysiology. Moreover, the ability to do so seamlessly, without perturbing endogenous localization or function, is the ultimate goal for such studies. The behaviour of cytotoxic granules (CGs) in T cells has long been a preoccupation of immunologists and others, due to their essential role in cell-cell killing, now a topic of intense interest in cancer immunotherapies.</p><p>Your study describes the construction of a fluorescent fusion protein GzmB- mTFP consisting of mTFP, a cleavable linker and the CG enzyme, granzymeB and the generation of a knock-in mouse expressing this probe in CTLs. Elegant imaging is used to show remarkable localization and colocalization of the fusion protein and other markers in CGs. The behaviour of the fusion protein and CGs are carefully measured in ex vivo cells and in mice, to ensure no aberrant features have been introduced. With no impediment to normal function, this CG probe appears to be superior to others available. Finally, the WT and KI mice are subjected to allografts in the eye to provide a very nice demonstration in vivo of cell infiltration and granule formation in CTLs. More sophisticated studies in the future no doubt will allow discrimination of new aspects of CG behaviour in cell-cell killing using further super-resolution microscopy and CLEM.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>You are commended on a rigorously performed study, the KI mouse and its protein GzmB-mTFP cells will be extremely valuable for many investigators and the mice have the hallmarks of becoming iconic models for future CG studies. As such, this study represents a major, enabling contribution to the field. There are some issues that should be addressed. First of all, as this will be a resource for the field, how will you make the mice available to the community?</p><p>If the data are available some quantification of granzyme and fusion protein levels in Figures 1 C and D would be helpful since the relative levels in WT and KI mice appear to differ between these panels. It would certainly be interesting in the future to follow the expression of the fusion protein over longer time periods and under different stimulation conditions in the KI mice.</p><p>What is the expression of the reporter in NK cells and activated CD4 T cells? A more detailed description of the model would be welcome. In the in vivo experiment, it would be important that the author stained for CD8 T cell and NK cells. A negative result on a CD4 staining is not enough to claim that cells are CD8 T cells. For the in vivo imaging in general it would be important to show controls with T1D and similar/identical imaging conditions in the micro without the knockin. The green fluorescence channel has a lot of autofluorescence and that autofluorescence might appear granular, so it would be helpful to see evidence that this is specific mTFP fluorescence.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Do you have a way to look at the kinetics of the cleavage process, perhaps through a pulse-chase experiment or cruder kinetic study of granule formation during CTL maturation.</p><p>In this context, could the authors comment on whether they see any evidence for cleavage of the fusion protein before the CG (eg at the level of post-Golgi vesicles) where proteolytic processing is possible? Can cleavage be prevented in the lysosome/granules after dissipating the pH drop, or by incubation of the cells with protease inhibitors that would intersect at the endo-lyosomal comparments? This is not necessary to do immediately but of future interest, but if you have data on this it would strengthen it.</p><p>Can you draw new conclusions from the longitudinal analyse of the T1D model? New biology is not needed at this stage, but it should be clear that the tools will be useful for generating quantitative data to address open questions in biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58065.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>You are commended on a rigorously performed study, the KI mouse and its protein GzmB-mTFP cells will be extremely valuable for many investigators and the mice have the hallmarks of becoming iconic models for future CG studies.

We have quantified the levels on the blots shown in Figure 1C and D and give the values in the Results section (paragraph one). We fully agree that the expression kinetics of the fusion protein, also in comparison to the corresponding WT levels, should be done quantitatively in the future. We can state, however, that in the imaging experiments shown in Figures 2-5 we always observed a robust fluorescence without the requirement to change the intensity of the excitation laser(s).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the expression of the reporter in NK cells and activated CD4 T cells?

We do find, however, a small fraction of GzmB-mTFP<sup>+</sup> cells which are CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>. These cells most likely represent NK cells, for which we do not currently have a specific staining. We have revised the Figure 5 and now show the CD4/CD8 stainings in panel B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Do you have a way to look at the kinetics of the cleavage process, perhaps through a pulse-chase experiment or cruder kinetic study of granule formation during CTL maturation.</p></disp-quote><p>A pulse-chase experiment does not work in this case as the mutant is not inducible. One could do sub-cellular fractionation, purify different granule/organelle populations and quantify the amount of the GzmB-mTFP fusion protein and the cleavage products GzmB and mTFP. We will initiate these experiments after the lock-down, also in an effort to purify fusogenic granules based on their fluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this context, could the authors comment on whether they see any evidence for cleavage of the fusion protein before the CG (eg at the level of post-Golgi vesicles) where proteolytic processing is possible?

We envision the dissipation of the pH drop to be difficult, because we have recently demonstrated that this manipulation leads to a change in diameter, density and microtubular transport of CGs (PMID: 32269094). The treatment with protease inhibitors might be an attractive alternative which could be tested in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you draw new conclusions from the longitudinal analyse of the T1D model? New biology is not needed at this stage, but it should be clear that the tools will be useful for generating quantitative data to address open questions in biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed developed the GzmB-mTFP knock-in mouse in combination with the ACE to generate quantitative data addressing open questions in biology. Our interest is in the function of immune cells in vivo, which is why the focus will be on immune diseases like FHL rather than on diabetes like in T1D. We have initiated these experiments before the lock-down by crossing the GzmB-mTFP knock-out with perforin knock-out mice, which serves as a model for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) type 2. As evident from the attached image we confirmed in in vitro experiments that perforin-deficient CTLs have reduced killing capacity. In upcoming in vivo experiments in the ACE we now want to investigate whether these CTLs also have additional deficits (e.g. in migration) and whether the remaining killing ability is mediated by the Fas/FasL pathway. We just started the breeding of the double-transgenic mice again in our animal facility and expect the first offspring in about six months.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Islets of Langerhans were incubated with CTLs derived from GzmB-mTFP KI (left) and GzmB-mTFP KI/Perforin KO mice (middle) and imaged by confocal microscopy.</title><p>CTLs started to infiltrate the islets and kill them, which resulted in a detachment of islets from the culture dish.
