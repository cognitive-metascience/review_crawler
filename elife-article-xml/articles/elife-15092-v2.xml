However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the <italic>Mus musculus Bdnf</italic> gene. The metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of β-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression were observed after direct ventricular application of β-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that β-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15092.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15092.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15092.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Exercise is not only good for our physical health but it benefits our mental health and abilities too. Physical exercise can affect how much of certain proteins are made in the brain. In particular, the levels of a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF for short) increase after exercise. BDNF has already been shown to enhance mental abilities at the same time as acting against anxiety and depression in mice, and might act in similar way in humans. Nevertheless, it is currently not clear how exercise increases the production of BDNF by cells in the brain.</p><p>Sleiman et al. have now investigated this question by comparing mice that were allowed to use a running wheel for 30 days with control mice that did not exercise. The comparison showed that the exercising mice had higher levels of BDNF in their brains than the control mice, which confirms the results of previous studies. Next, biochemical experiments showed that this change occurred when enzymes known as histone deacetylases stopped inhibiting the production of BDNF. Therefore Sleiman et al. hypothesised that exercise might produce a chemical that itself inhibits the histone deacetylases.</p><p>Indeed, the exercising mice produced more of a molecule called β-hydroxybutyrate in their livers, which travels through the blood into the brain where it could inhibit histone deacetylases. Further experiments showed that injecting β-hydroxybutyrate directly into the brains of mice led to increase in BDNF.</p><p>These new findings reveal with molecular detail one way in which exercise can affect the expression of proteins in the brain. This new understanding may provide ideas for new therapies to treat psychiatric diseases, such as depression, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15092.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15092.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>physical exercise</kwd><kwd>bdnf</kwd><kwd>beta hydroxybutyrate</kwd><kwd>HDAC inhibitors</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005993</institution-id><institution>National Council for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sleiman</surname><given-names>Sama F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lebanese American University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRDC seed grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sleiman</surname><given-names>Sama F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD076914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ninan</surname><given-names>Ipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS21072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Moses V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG025970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Moses V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A potential link between metabolic changes resulting from exercise and gene expression in the brain has been revealed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been traditionally thought that physical activity and the processes of learning and memory formation are independent and carried out by different organ systems. However, from an evolutionary perspective, these processes needed to be tightly intertwined to ensure the survival of animal species. Indeed, physical effort usually occurred in response to an imminent danger. Responding to that danger not only required running, but also necessitated better functioning of the brain through increased plasticity in order to adapt to new sources of stress, to learn to avoid dangers or better respond to them, and to map surroundings and learn the locations of hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noakes and Spedding, 2012</xref>) All of these responses require improved memory.</p><p>Physical exercise produces many benefits in the brain that enhance cognitive function, blood flow and resistance to injury. One mechanism to account for the changes in brain plasticity is through the action of growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cotman et al 2007</xref>). A major contributor to the processes of learning and memory formation involves brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways. It has been known for over two decades that physical activity or neuronal activity markedly enhances <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Isackson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neeper et al., 1995</xref>) and that this increase in BDNF protein leads to activation of signaling pathways that result in exercise-dependent enhanced learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaynman et al., 2004</xref>). Though these results are widely recognized, it is important to note that very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link exercise and <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression. Regulation of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression occurs by many means, but how exercise influences the expression of trophic factors is not understood. In this paper, we are interested in understanding how physical exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene expression. This is a significant question, since cognitive ability and synaptic plasticity are influenced by the levels of BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaynman et al., 2004</xref>) and BDNF signaling is reduced in many neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009</xref>).</p><p>During development, BDNF is required for the survival of specific neuronal populations and it participates in axonal and dendritic growth and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alsina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bibel and Barde, 2000</xref>). A number of studies have indicated that decreased levels of BDNF are associated with depression and become enhanced following antidepressant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duman and Monteggia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinowich et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, exercise frequently leads to an increase in BDNF in the central nervous system to promote improvement in cognitive ability and depressive-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marais et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo-Neustadt et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, physical activity has been shown to have anti-depressant effects and to improve outcomes in animal models and for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frazzitta et al., 2014</xref>) or Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, by understanding the molecular mechanisms by which exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression, we aim to harness the therapeutic potential of physical exercise and eventually identify novel therapeutic targets for both psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>In animal models, exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA expression in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cotman et al., 2007</xref>), most prominently in the hippocampus. BDNF production provides trophic support and increases in synaptogenesis and dendritic and axonal branching and spine turnover. Blocking BDNF signaling attenuates the exercise-induced improvement of spatial learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaynman et al., 2004</xref>), as well as the exercise-induced expression of synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaynman et al., 2006</xref>). However, how BDNF is selectively increased after physical activity-dependent changes in the nervous system is not well understood.</p><p>One mechanism that has been proposed is that exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression through the induction of expression of Fndc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wrann et al., 2013</xref>), a PGC-1α-dependent myokine. This hypothesis proposes that the FNDC5 protein is cleaved into a small circulating protein called irisin, which has been associated with the browning of fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bostrom et al., 2012</xref>). However, there are contradictory reports about whether <italic>Fndc5</italic> is translated and expressed at high levels after exercise and whether irisin is produced and found in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). This raises questions about how and whether a myokine can be responsible for the induction of <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene regulation.</p><p>A second hypothesis is that exercise may induce BDNF levels by altering the epigenetic landmarks of the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koppel and Timmusk, 2013</xref>). Because exercise induces metabolic changes and because epigenetics lies at the interfaces between the environment and changes in gene expression, it is conceivable that an endogenous molecule is produced after exercise, which can serve as a metabolite as well as a regulator of <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcription. In this paper, we provide a mechanism demonstrating that exercise induces the accumulation of a ketone body (D-β-hydroxybutyrate or DBHB) in the hippocampus, where it serves both as an energy source and an inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) to specifically induce BDNF expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exercise induces Bdnf expression in the hippocampus</title><p>To assess how exercise enhances <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene expression, we established a voluntary running protocol for mice (4 weeks of age), which has been previously shown to mediate increases in BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marlatt et al., 2012</xref>). Mice were individually housed in cages and divided into two groups: control and exercise. Each mouse in the exercise group was provided with a running wheel, whereas the control group mice were not. Mice were not forced to run on the wheels, but rather were allowed to run voluntarily. Long term running for up to 30 days was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for distance and time. We chose this exercise model because of its voluntary aspect. Stress has been reported to decrease BDNF levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 2005</xref>). For that reason, we avoided any handling or stress induction in the mice. Animals were sacrificed and tissues were collected for analysis. To determine the effects of voluntary running in the hippocampus, we initially focused our study on selective promoters from the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene, which has a complex structure containing multiple promoters that generate many transcripts with a common coding exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pruunsild et al., 2011</xref>). Promoter I (pI), a neuronal activity dependent promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabuchi et al., 2002</xref>) and other nearby promoters (pIIA, pIIB, pIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pruunsild et al., 2011</xref>), were also assessed for mRNA expression. Our results showed that voluntary exercise for 4 weeks significantly induced BDNF promoter I and II expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown). Western blot analysis of the hippocampus of animals after voluntary running showed a significant increase of mature BDNF protein levels, as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15092.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The experimental design and time course of the exercise regime is shown.</title><p>Exercise induces changes in brain BDNF levels in a voluntary exercise protocol (16).

A number of studies have reported that blocking HDACs enhances memory formation and the expression of synaptic plasticity genes, such as <italic>Creb, Bdnf</italic> and <italic>CamkII</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koppel and Timmusk, 2013</xref>). HDACs catalyze the deacetylation of histones and are divided into four classes. Class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8), II and IV are zinc dependent enzymes and are represented by at least 11 different proteins, whereas class III includes the sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have found that the general class I/IIb HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (vorinostat), a clinically approved anticancer agent and memory enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2009</xref>) and TSA (trichostatin A), a broad-spectrum inhibitor, were effective in inducing <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA in primary cortical neuron cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

While these results implicate class I HDAC inhibition in the regulation of synaptic plasticity genes, such as <italic>Bdnf</italic>, it is not clear how exercise is translated into increases in BDNF.

These results suggest that exercise may modulate <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene expression in the hippocampus by inducing changes to the epigenetic landscape of its promoter. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and showed that the binding of both HDAC2 and HDAC3 to the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoter in hippocampi of exercise animals was decreased, in comparison to sedentary animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). Even though some variation was detected in the basal binding of HDAC3 to the <italic>Bdnf</italic> pI promoter, the overall data is consistent with exercise inducing a significant decrease in HDAC3 binding to the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoter.

For example, exercise is often associated with increases in ketone body production. The ketone body D-β-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) is a major energy metabolite that is increased in the liver after prolonged exercise. DBHB levels are frequently increased after caloric restriction, fasting and ketogenic diets and DBHB is believed to serve as a signaling molecule in response to metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newman and Verdin, 2014</xref>). DBHB is synthesized from acetyl-CoA generated from the β-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. As DBHB production is sensitive to environmental factors, nutritional states and energy levels, it has been hypothesized that ketone bodies may serve as an intermediary to regulate gene expression and chromatin structure. Interestingly, DBHB is transported in the blood stream to the brain where it can serve as an energy source. In addition, DBHB also has been shown to act as a class I HDAC inhibitor in non-neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>). To assess the effects of voluntary running, we measured DBHB levels in the hippocampus following exercise.

In order to mimic the increases in DBHB in the brain observed after exercise, we injected mice with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a structural analog of glucose that inhibits glycolysis and increases the brain’s capacity to utilize ketone bodies as fuel. 2-DG is transported by glucose transporters into the cell where it binds to, but cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase, resulting in the inhibition of the first step of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralser et al., 2008</xref>). This inhibition leads to the activation of a compensatory mechanism resulting in the production of ketone bodies by the liver. By activating this alternative energy pathway, 2-DG treatment induces DBHB levels in the brain. Interestingly, we found that 2-DG injection, like exercise, also induces both DBHB levels and <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in the hippocampus to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Interestingly, co treatments of a DBHB transporter inhibitor (AR-C155858) with 2-DG attenuated the 2-DG-induced DBHB levels and <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression.

We incubated hippocampal slices with DBHB (0.8 mM) and then carried out field recording of post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in CA1 evoked by stimulating the Schaffer collateral fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yano et al., 2006</xref>). Paired pulsed facilitation (PPF) was measured as the ratio of fEPSP slopes in response to two stimuli delivered to the Schaffer collateral inputs. PPF was followed after interstimulus intervals of 20–40 milliseconds. Incubation of hippocampal slices with DBHB (0.8 mM, 3 hrs) increased the fEPSP slope which was blocked by K252a (200 nM). Consistent with these results, DBHB decreased paired pulse ratio in a K252a-dependent manner suggesting a pre-synaptic modulation mediated by TrKB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). The actions of BDNF upon synaptic transmission are known to result in an increase in the frequency of synaptic currents, indicating a presynaptic role of BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). In fact, BDNF rapidly increases spontaneous neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jovanovic et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1998b</xref>), which require TrkB receptors localized at pre-synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 1998</xref>). These measurements indicated that DBHB treatment enhanced glutamatergic transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and that this DBHB-induced effect was blocked by K252a, a frequently used inhibitor of TrkB receptors in synaptic transmission experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takei et al., 1998</xref>).

Hence the presynaptic enhancement by DBHB is dependent upon the BDNF TrkB receptors. These findings are consistent with an increase of BDNF by DBHB in the hippocampus and furthermore indicate there are additional physiological outcomes mediated by DBHB that involve an increase in neurotransmitter release.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15092.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DBHB increases glutamatergic transmission at the CA3-CA1 synapses in a TrkB-sensitive manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average fEPSP slope in control (6 slices/6 mice), DBHB (6 slices/6 mice), K252a (6 slices/3 mice), and K252a+DBHB (6 slices/3 mice) groups.

It is highly conceivable that DBHB might act to increase the levels of BDNF, which can rescue neurons that are vulnerable in Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</xref>). Indeed, treatment of Alzheimer’s disease 3xTgAD mice with 2-DG to induce ketone bodies delayed the progression of bioenergetic deficits in the brain and the associated β-amyloid burden. Similar to our experiments, 2-DG was capable of inducing BDNF in 3xTgAD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2011</xref>). Brain is a major source of the secretion of BDNF after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rasmussen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, changes in the levels of BNDF have been suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, addiction and eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</xref>). A number of studies have shown that exercise can also improve depressive-like behavior through increased levels of hippocampal BDNF, which can enhance plasticity and synaptogenesis and reduce neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cotman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duman and Monteggia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marais et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinowich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo-Neustadt et al., 2000</xref>). Given that histone acetylation in the hippocampus and cortex is associated with effects on learning and memory, the ketone body DBHB serves as a metabolic signal to link environment changes to epigenetic effects on the transcription of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF.</p><p>Ketone bodies are widely distributed from the liver to the heart, muscle and the brain after fasting, dieting and intense exercise. When glucose levels are reduced, ketone bodies, produced in the liver from fatty acids in the form of DBHB and acetoacetate, serve as an energy source. In the brain, the levels of ketone bodies can reach very high levels (1–5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson and Williamson, 1980</xref>). A number of studies have demonstrated neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies in neurodegenerative and neuronal activity, such as under epileptic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maalouf et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It is probable there are multiple mechanisms that are involved in the effects of exercise in increasing trophic factor expression. For example, it has been reported that exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression through the induction of hippocampal expression of Fndc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wrann et al., 2013</xref>), a PGC-1α and ERRα -dependent myokine. Once BDNF protein levels increase, TrkB signaling in turn inhibits <italic>Fndc5</italic> expression in a negative feedback mechanism. We found prolonged exercise decreased <italic>Fndc5</italic> expression levels consistent with elevated BDNF protein in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wrann et al., 2013</xref>). However, DBHB did not induce <italic>Pgc-1α, Fndc5</italic>, or <italic>Erra</italic> mRNA in primary neurons (data not shown), suggesting that there are alternative ways of affecting BDNF levels. The complexity of the BDNF gene and its alternative promoters and splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>) indicates that several regulatory mechanisms must exist to explain its many functions in synaptic transmission and neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in the hippocampus and not in all the other regions of the brain. How this specificity is achieved is not clear. One possible explanation suggests that exercise may regulate the levels or functions of ketone body transporters in different regions of the brain. Indeed, acute exercise induces <italic>Mct2</italic> transporter expression in the hippocampus immediately after and up to 10 hr post-exercise. This exercise-induced upregulation of <italic>Mct2</italic> was associated with increases in BDNF and TrkB levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takimoto and Hamada, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our finding of an endogenous metabolite, DBHB, which upregulates <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcription in the hippocampus, provides one explanation linking the effects of exercise and peripheral metabolism to changes in epigenetic control and gene expression in the brain. There are multiple links between metabolic changes resulting from exercise and epigenetic modulation. For example, it has been reported that the blood levels of some Kreb’s cycle intermediates such as α-ketoglutarate are increased after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leibowitz et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, α-ketoglutarate is an essential co-substrate for jumanji histone demethylases as well as for the tet proteins (DNA demethylases). Another molecule that may play a critical role in linking metabolic changes induced by exercise to epigenetic modulation is acetyl CoA which serves as the source of the acetyl group for all acetylation reactions catalyzed in the body including those catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. Finally, coenzymes such as NAD+, or FAD produced during metabolic reactions are also required by sirtuins and the histone demethylase LSD1, respectively.</p><p>In this paper, we provide evidence that an endogenous molecule, DBHB, that crosses the blood brain barrier, is increased by physical exercise to enhance the expression of a fundamental trophic factor in the brain and in turn affect synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further studies aiming at identifying molecules that can also serve the dual purpose of an energy fuel and epigenetic modulator will help us accumulate additional members of the “exercise pill”. The identification of these molecules is of great interest as many people afflicted with depression or with neurodegenerative diseases are likely to benefit from the ability of exercise to stimulate BDNF through small metabolites, such as DBHB. The involvement of ketone bodies in many other syndromes, such as glucose utilization, diabetes and epilepsy, suggests they represent vital molecules with broad metabolic effects upon chromatin and gene expression.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15092.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A proposed model by which exercise induces <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in the hippocampus.</title><p>Exercise induces DBHB synthesis in the liver.

In particular, they demonstrate that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) rise in their exercise paradigm and this leads to increased BDNF. They mimic this rise in vitro by treating hippocampal slices and report an increase in BDNF. Finally, they used ICV injections of BHB to demonstrate that this also could activate BDNF transcription. The proposed mechanism suggests an exercise-induced elevation in circulating levels of BHB inhibits the repressing effects of HDAC2 and 3 on the Bdnf promoter 1. Collectively, the studies are well described and provide interesting results. Indeed, the results will likely be of wide interest in the fields of neuroscience, exercise physiology and metabolic research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Because exercise can induce BDNF expression through BHB-independent mechanisms, the physiological relevance of this pathway is not clear. Studies informing the necessity of this pathway on the beneficial effects of hippocampal BDNF on cognitive function, antidepressant efficacy or synaptic plasticity would strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>The Western data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> needs to be quantified before reaching the conclusion that BDNF levels are elevated, especially as the samples from exercise animals appear to be over loaded.</p><p>The authors made the initial observation that exercise induces BDNF expression driven by both promoters 1 and 2.

I think the authors need to discuss this feature of the data. Concern about the issue is heightened by the western blot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where the upregulation of BDNF protein levels is not entirely convincing.

Studies informing the necessity of this pathway on the beneficial effects of hippocampal BDNF on cognitive function, antidepressant efficacy or synaptic plasticity would strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this pertinent comment. In order to address this comment, we have performed two different types of experiments to address the physiological relevance of DBHB.</p><p>First, we injected 2- Deoxy- D-glucose (2-DG) alone or in combination with a DBHB transporter inhibitor, AR-C 155858 and assessed both BDNF promoter I expression as well as DBHB levels. DBHB levels increase when there is a switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism. We have found that glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG induces both BDNF promoter π expression and DBHB levels in the hippocampus, whereas injecting 2-DG along with AR-C155858 attenuated both DBHB levels and the induction of BDNF π expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). These results suggest that increased DBHB levels in the hippocampus by physiologically manipulating glucose metabolism can contribute to BDNF promoter 1 induction by HDAC2/3 inhibition. This is important because exercise mediates its positive effects on learning and memory through BDNF expression (Erickson et al., 2011). Our results showing that DBHB accumulation in the hippocampus can affect BDNF expression suggest a role for DBHB in mediating the learning and memory effects through BDNF expression.</p><p>In a second physiological approach, we have also found that DBHB induces presynaptic glutamate release, which is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Hippocampal slices were prepared and incubated with DBHB for 3 hr before measurements of CA1 field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) after stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Pair pulse facilitation (PPF) due to an accumulation of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presynaptic terminal was observed and is indicative of enhanced transmitter release. This DBHB induced response could be blocked by treatment with K252a, a frequently used inhibitor of TrkB receptors in synaptic transmission experiments (Chen et al., 2015; Li et al., 1998; Takei et al., 1998). These findings are consistent with an increase of BDNF by DBHB in the hippocampus and furthermore indicate that one physiological outcome of DBHB is an increase in neurotransmitter release through a TrkB dependent mechanism.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the production of DBHB is indeed involved in the induction of BDNF expression and that the induced and activated BDNF pathway plays important roles in mediating the effects of DBHB on glutamate release.</p><p><italic>The Western data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> needs to be quantified before reaching the conclusion that BDNF levels are elevated, especially as the samples from exercise animals appear to be over loaded.</italic></p><p>We have quantified the western blot presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> comparing BDNF levels from the hippocampi of control and exercise mice and the quantification is presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. The western blots were quantified using image J software. The quantification shows a significant increase in BDNF protein levels in hippocampi of exercise animals as compared to ctrl animals. The significance was assessed by student T-test and p-value&lt; 0.05. These results are consistent with previously published results showing that exercise induces BDNF levels in the hippocampus using immunofluorescence and Elisa techniques (Cotman and Berchtold, 2002).</p><p><italic>The authors made the initial observation that exercise induces BDNF expression driven by both promoters 1 and 2. It is not clear why subsequent experiments only focus on promoter 1.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> convincingly shows that exercise increases hippocampal expression of mRNA for the promoter I BDNF transcript, but the data seemingly indicates that there is no significant effect on the levels of expression detected with primers within the translated region of the transcript, presumably because promoter I does not account for a major fraction of BDNF expression.

Densitometric quantification, with normalization against the actin band, might dispel this concern.</italic></p><p>We have quantified the western blots and included the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> as mentioned above. Indeed, BDNF protein levels are induced in the hippocampi of exercise animals as compared to control animals. We have found that both promoter 1 and 2 are significantly induced by exercise. Even though the coding exon was not significantly induced, we observe a trend suggesting the increase. This trend is consistent with the western blot quantification data. Indeed, DBHB also induces promoter 2 (Data not shown) as well as the coding fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C and D</xref>). We focused on promoter 1 because previous microarray data (Tong et al., 2001) have detected an increase in promoter 1 in exercise rats as compared to control rats.</p><p><italic>Some of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> are compelling. However, the data in 3B, interpreted to indicate that exercise decreases the HDAC3 occupancy of BDNF promoter I, does not provide statistical analysis, and the statistical significance is unclear.</italic></p><p>We have increased the n number from 3 to 7 for each group for theexperiment and included statistical data. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> suggest that exercise significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreases HDAC3 binding to the BDNF promoter 1.</p><p><italic>The evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that exercise increases BHB in brain seems quite convincing. However, in the Discussion, the authors cite published evidence that brain BHB levels may reach 1-5 mM, yet they report levels of 10-15 mM (calculated assuming a brain density of 1.0 g/ml), and I found two studies reporting ketogenic diet or alcoholic ketoacidosis producing maximum brain β-hydroxybutyrate levels of 180 and 120 μM (Samala et al., 2011 and Schrieber and Ungar, 1984). The dose of ICV injections of the BHB needs to be justified. Is it known whether these doses affect metabolic function in key peripheral tissues? Does this dose affect other brain regions?</italic></p><p>The DBHB levels are expressed in mmole/gram. The grams in the denominator refer to the normalization to the total amount of hippocampal protein and not the grams of hippocampal tissue. We have clarified this point in the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. From here, the concentration extrapolations are not accurate. The concentrations obtained, if we consider the volume used for DBHB measurement per the manufacturers’ instructions, have an average of 0.9mM (Control) and 1.3mM (Exercise). Therefore, considering our measurements and the observation that exercise modulates HDAC binding to the BDNF promoter, we chose the concentrations for ICV to be close to the measured levels and also close to the concentrations reported to have effects on HDAC inhibition (Shimazu et al., 2013).</p></body></sub-article></article>
