Despite a detailed understanding of the circuit specializations in retina that generate waves, whether central circuit specializations also exist to control their propagation through visual pathways of the brain is unknown. Here we identify a developmentally transient, corticothalamic amplification of retinal drive to thalamus as a mechanism for retinal wave transmission in the infant rat brain. During the period of retinal waves, corticothalamic connections excite LGN, rather than driving feedforward inhibition as observed in the adult. This creates an excitatory feedback loop that gates retinal wave transmission through the LGN. This cortical multiplication of retinal wave input ends just prior to eye-opening, as cortex begins to inhibit LGN. Our results show that the early retino-thalamo-cortical circuit uses developmentally specialized feedback amplification to ensure powerful, high-fidelity transmission of retinal activity despite immature connectivity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18816.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18816.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18816.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain of a developing fetus has a big job to do: it needs to create the important connections between neurons that the individual will need later in life. This is a challenge because the first connections that form between neurons are sparse, weak and unreliable. They would not be expected to be able to transmit signals in a robust or effective way, and yet they do. How the nervous system solves this problem is an important question, because many neurological disorders may be the result of bad wiring between neurons in the fetal brain.</p><p>When an adult human or other mammal “sees” an object, visual information from the eye is transmitted to a part of the brain called the thalamus. From there it is sent on to another part of the brain called the cortex. The cortex also provides feedback to the thalamus to adjust the system and often acts as a brake in adults to limit the flow of information from the eyes.</p><p>Murata and Colonnese investigated whether the fetal brain contains any “booster” circuits of neurons that can amplify weak signals from other neurons to help ensure that information is transferred accurately. The experiments monitored and altered visual activity in the brains of newborn rats – which have similar activity patterns to those observed in human babies born prematurely. Murata and Colonnese found that in these rats the feedback signals from the cortex to the thalamus actually multiply the visual signals from the eye, instead of restraining them. This causes a massive amplification in activity in the developing brain and explains how the fetal brain stays active despite its neurons being only weakly connected.</p><p>The booster circuit stops working just before the eyes first open (equivalent to birth in humans) as the connections between neurons become stronger, and is replaced by the braking mechanism seen in adults. This is important, because continued amplification of signals in the adult brain might cause excessive brain activity and epilepsy. The findings of Murata and Colonnese may therefore help to explain why epileptic seizures have different causes and behave differently in children and adults.</p><p>The next step following on from this work is to find out how the braking mechanism forms in young animals. Future studies will also focus on understanding the precise role the booster circuit plays in early brain development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18816.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18816.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>activity depedent development</kwd><kwd>retinal waves</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colonnese</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The absence of functional inhibition is a developmentally transient circuit property of corticothalamic feedback that is essential for the central transmission of spontaneous retinal waves.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the central nervous system, before the development of sensory input or behavioral experience, specialized circuitry generates spontaneous activity that is required for circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirkby et al., 2013</xref>). In sensory isocortex the vast majority of spontaneous activity is not generated locally, but rather in the peripheral sense organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khazipov et al., 2013a</xref>). For example, prior to vision the retina generates waves of spontaneous firing that refine receptive field characteristics in visual thalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>). Retinal waves drive robust firing in LGN, superior colliculus, and VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>) through a complex interaction between these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weliky and Katz, 1999</xref>) that remains poorly understood. In the retina, transient circuit properties are responsible for wave propagation, most prominently hyper-connectivity of starburst amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>), but the degree to which the central transmission of retinal waves, or spontaneous activity in other systems, requires similar specializations is unknown.</p><p>During the period of retinal waves, early ganglion cell activity undergoes both amplification and transformation in the brain in ways substantially different from the adult transmission of retinal activity, suggesting the presence of unique developmental circuitry. For example, the relative amplification of ganglion cell spiking in developing thalamocortical circuits is approximately 40-fold that of the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence of similar amplification is observed in late second and early third trimester human neonates (born preterm), who show sensory-evoked and spontaneous EEG events that are paradoxically large, reaching amplitudes of over 1 millivolt, compared to microvolts in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vanhatalo and Kaila, 2006</xref>). These strong neonatal activities persist despite low synaptic density (5–10% of the adult) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggelopoulos et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourgeois and Rakic, 1993</xref>), weak individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etherington and Williams, 2011</xref>), and poor action-potential reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCormick and Prince, 1987</xref>). Not only is retinal wave activity amplified in the thalamocortical pathway, it is also transformed into synchronized rapid oscillations that enhance propagation and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khazipov et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luhmann et al., 2016</xref>). Cortical activity during the period of retinal waves follows nearly exactly the macro-patterning of retinal activity: periods of silence lasting 30–60 s are interrupted by 500 ms–2 s waves that occur in clusters lasting up to 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>). However, the cortical activity within waves is organized in rapid ‘spindle-burst’ oscillations (8–30 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kummer et al., 2016</xref>) that are not present in retina and not observed in adult cortical activity, suggesting transitory early circuit properties are responsible for their production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tolner et al., 2012</xref>). Spindle-bursts are not limited to VC, but are ubiquitous throughout neonatal cortex. They are the rodent homologue of delta-brushes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khazipov et al., 2013a</xref>), one of the major components of the human preterm EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">André et al., 2010</xref>), and their absence in patients indicates a poor prognosis. Thus understanding their central generative mechanisms would be a critical contribution to neonatal health and development.</p><p>We hypothesized that spindle-burst oscillations and retinal-wave amplification arise in LGN, but depend critically on corticothalamic feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weliky and Katz, 1999</xref>). To test this we recorded simultaneously from LGN and primary VC of head-fixed, unanesthetized rats both during the period of retinal waves (P5-11), and immediately after (P13-14), when mature cortical activity patterns have begun to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colonnese, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoy and Niell, 2015</xref>). We investigated the relative roles of retina, thalamus and cortex by pharmacological or optogenetic modulation of each region. Our results demonstrate a developmentally unique role for the corticothalamic projection that results from the late development of inhibition relative to excitation, and is necessary for the propagation and synchronization of retinal wave-driven activity through thalamus and cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine the thalamic contribution to the generation of spindle-burst oscillations evoked by spontaneous retinal waves, we made simultaneous recordings from the LGN and monocular VC in head-fixed, unanesthetized rats. We focused on post-natal days (P) 9–11, the time of peak stage-III (glutamatergic) retinal wave activity when cortical activity is dominated by 20–30 Hz spindle oscillations that synchronize all layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>). Linear multi-electrode arrays were used to acquire local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit spike activity (MUA) through the depth of LGN and VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Whole-field visual stimulation was used to identify L4 in VC and eye-specific lamina in LGN. The LGN channel with maximal contralateral visual response was used for analysis. The VC and LGN recordings were not topographically aligned. This allows investigation of the oscillations in each structure reported here, but not precise phase relationships between LGN and VC during spontaneous activity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18816.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Thalamic spindle-burst oscillations are transmitted to visual cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup.

Activity within these active periods consisted of spindle-shaped oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) in superficial layers with a primary frequency of 20.8 ± 0.8 Hz (n = 7, mean ± SEM) and elevated MUA in all layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,H</xref>). Activity in LGN had a similar structure: 5–10 s periods of spiking activity alternating with periods of low or absent spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the amplitude of the LGN LFP was lower than the median spike amplitude, it was not analyzed further. To determine if the spindle-burst oscillations observed in VC originate in LGN, we quantified the frequency modulation of LGN MUA. Spike-rate modulation in LGN showed a primary frequency of 23.1 ± 0.6 Hz (n = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), similar to VC. Thus, spindle-burst oscillations are also observed in LGN. Combined with the absence of significant oscillatory ganglion cell firing during waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>), and the location of the VC spindle-bursts’ current sink in the input layer, this data supports a thalamic origin of spindle-burst oscillations.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spindle-burst oscillations require retina and thalamus</title><p>To quantify the contribution of retinal input to spontaneous activity in LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we acutely silenced both eyes by intraocular injection of the blood brain barrier-impermeant glutamate receptor antagonists APV and CNQX. Silencing was confirmed by loss of the visual response (not shown). As predicted, retinal silencing dramatically reduced firing rates in LGN (–86.6 ± 3.9%, mean ± SEM) and VC (–67.2 ± 10.2%). The continuity of activity, measured as the proportion of the recording with spike activity (periods containing at least two spikes with an interval of less than 500 ms, called 'events'), was also significantly reduced (LGN –88.5 ± 6.5%, VC –90.6 ± 2.3%). Examination of the distribution of event lengths after retinal silencing showed that events over 5 s in duration were reduced in LGN and eliminated in VC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A4,B4</xref>). Retinal silencing largely eliminated the prominent peak in LGN MUA and VC LFP spectra in the spindle-burst range, leaving only lower frequency activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A5,B5</xref>). In combination with previous results showing that spindle-burst oscillations are driven by retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>), the present retinal silencing data confirms that in LGN, as in VC, spontaneous retinal activity is the primary driver of spontaneous activity and spindle-burst oscillations. In the absence of retinal input, spontaneous activity in the intact thalamocortical loop can provide at most 20% of normal LGN firing.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18816.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spindle-burst oscillations require retinal and thalamic activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blockade of spontaneous retinal waves reduces thalamic firing and spindle-burst oscillations.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that VC provides critical amplification and transformation of the retinal input in LGN by silencing VC with local application of APV and CNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Silencing VC at P9-11 during the peak of stage III waves reduces LGN spike-rate by 79.2 ± 5.6% and continuity by 68.4 ± 9.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D2</xref>). Remarkably, these activity reductions are of similar magnitude to those caused by retinal silencing. The fact that silencing of either retina or VC results in a greater than 50% reduction in firing indicates that they act synergistically to drive LGN. One explanation is that VC participates in feedback amplification as part of an excitatory loop with LGN that is necessary for the generation of effective thalamic spiking during retinal waves. The effect of VC silencing was limited to the LGN; spike-rates for all contacts from the same shank located 20–100 µm below the last visually responsive contact were not affected (+3.1 ± 17.1%, p=1.000, n = 6, Wilcoxon signed rank test), indicating that the pharmacological silencing of VC did not have systemic effects. Event duration was reduced, but not as severely altered as by retinal silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D5</xref>), indicating that retina initiates and maintains activity in LGN, but VC prolongs it.

To determine whether corticothalamic feedback is also critical for the stage II retinal waves (cholinergic) present during the first post-natal week, we examined the effect of VC silencing at P5-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Spindle-burst oscillations are slower at this age, resulting in a peak frequency of the L4 LFP spectra of 12.2 ± 1.7 Hz (data not shown). Spontaneous LGN spike-rate frequency is similarly down-shifted (16.0 ± 1.2 Hz). Silencing VC at this age significantly reduced spike-rates (−52.0 ± 7.4%) and continuity (−49.8 ± 10.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C2</xref>), showing that corticothalamic amplification is present at this age as well. However, there was no significant effect of VC silencing on either spike spectra or event duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C3–5</xref>). Thus during the first post-natal week, the role of VC is limited to amplification. At this age, LGN is able to generate spindle-oscillations in response to retinal waves, albeit with a lower frequency than during the second postnatal week. The difference between P5-7 and P9-11 demonstrates a shift in the role of corticothalamic feedback from simple amplifier to active participant in the shaping of LGN oscillations.</p><p>Spontaneous activity in VC dramatically changes between P11 and P13.

To determine if the LGN requirement for corticothalamic feedback is restricted to the period of retinal waves, and what role VC plays in the maturation of spontaneous activity, we silenced VC while recording from LGN at P13-14. VC silencing at this age does not decrease LGN activity, but rather increases spike rates (+26.2 ± 5.4%) and there is slight but not significant increase in continuity (+13.5 ± 5.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E2</xref>).

Thus the excitatory role of corticothalamic feedback is limited to the period of retinal waves, and cortex becomes inhibitory to thalamus around eye-opening.</p><p>Together the VC silencing experiments indicate a continually changing role for corticothalamic feedback in the transmission of retinal activity during development. During the period of retinal waves, VC essentially gates LGN output, first as a simple amplifier of LGN, and later in the second post-natal week, by amplifying and patterning oscillations in LGN. This amplification role ends before eye-opening, after which corticothalamic feedback plays a less prominent role in the generation and patterning of retinal transmission through thalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Absence of inhibition facilitates corticothalamic feedback excitation</title><p>To determine the mechanism of early corticothalamic feedback excitation and rhythmogenesis, we took advantage of the fast kinetics and high sensitivity of the blue light drivable channelrhodopsin Chronos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) to gain control of VC neurons within a few days of birth.

During cholinergic retinal waves, connectivity is sufficient for VC to amplify retinal waves in LGN but its reliability and velocity are insufficient to synchronize LGN firing.

Finally, at the transition to the third week (after P13), VC afferents recruit an inhibitory circuit, which reduces their ability to synchronize activity at high frequencies and makes the net effect of corticothalamic feedback inhibitory, as in the adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Corticothalamic feedback excitation specifically amplifies spindle-burst oscillations</title><p>During the period of stage III retinal waves, visual responses can be evoked in retina (through closed eyelids) and these are transmitted to VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>).

Before vision, when spontaneous retinal waves instruct circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>), the corticothalamic projection provides excitatory feedback amplification to thalamus. Although retina initiates activity in central visual circuits, retinal waves alone provide as little as 20% of the total drive. Corticothalamic feedback amplification accounts for the remaining 80%, effectively gating transmission of retinal waves in thalamus. During the second post-natal week corticothalamic excitation not only amplifies, but also synchronizes, thalamic firing, effectively conditioning its own input. Our results show that the transmission of early spontaneous activity is not simply feed-forward, and that feedback circuits can have specialized developmental properties that ensure the reliable transmission of early activity from the periphery to the cortex. The mechanism is the delayed development of inhibitory recruitment by the corticothalamic projection. This is a common observation in developing circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le Magueresse and Monyer, 2013</xref>), yet the functional significance has been difficult to prove.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Feedback amplification provides the primary thalamic drive during retinal waves</title><p>The present work reinforces previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weliky and Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>) that sustained (&gt;2 s) thalamocortical activity before eye-opening is driven by central transmission of retinal waves. Neither VC alone, nor an intact LGN-VC loop, is capable of producing more than brief bursts of activity. In contrast, without VC, firing in LGN is dramatically reduced but sustained activity is still present. Only the longest events—caused by sustained firing between waves occurring in a cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>)—are suppressed by VC silencing, demonstrating that corticothalamic feedback maintains activity during waves but does not initiate activity. The fact that VC and retina are both necessary for over 50% of LGN spiking shows their drive is multiplicative, not additive. Together our findings suggest that VC makes a feed-forward excitatory loop with thalamus that amplifies the drive from retina. In ferrets corticothalamic feedback synchronizes activity between eye-specific lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weliky and Katz, 1999</xref>), but its role in amplification and oscillation generation is unknown, as is whether this function is unique to rodents.</p><p>In addition to amplifying retinal activity, central circuits transform ganglion cell firing during waves into spindle-burst oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>). Almost all activity in early VC, as well as every other cortical region examined, occurs as rapid oscillations necessary for synaptic stabilization in the developing circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khazipov et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013b</xref>). Determining the similarities and differences between the cortical areas in how these rhythms are generated will inform our understanding of how regional specialization develops. In all areas, rapid oscillations occur in response to spontaneous and evoked firing of the dominant input (eg. whisker in barrel cortex), with a frequency inversely proportional to its temporal and spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khazipov et al., 2013b</xref>). Here we identify LGN as the locus of generation of VC spindle-bursts, similar to somatosensory (VPN) thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013a</xref>). Unlike VPN, corticothalamic feedback plays a critical role for setting the frequency and amplitude of LGN firing. During the first post-natal week, corticothalamic connections are capable of directly driving LGN, but only at long latency and with poor reliability, consistent with their low density in LGN at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seabrook et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grant et al., 2016</xref>), and they are not necessary for rhythmogenesis. How spindle-bursts are generated in LGN is unknown, but likely involves a combination of functional connectivity with the thalamic reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evrard and Ropert, 2009</xref>) and intrinsic excitability of relay neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lo et al., 2002</xref>). Between the first and second post-natal weeks, roughly synchronized to the switch between cholinergic and glutamatergic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>), the timing and reliability of corticothalamic connectivity improves, changing its role from simple amplification to synchronization and rhythmogenesis. LGN can still generate its own weak (15 Hz) oscillations in the first week, but it requires VC to generate normal (25 Hz) activity in the second week. Because corticothalamic projections are only capable of synchronizing LGN at these frequencies at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and L5/6 neurons are synchronized by the spindle-oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>), we suggest that the faster spindle-burst oscillations are generated in the feedback circuit between the two structures.</p><p>The role of corticothalamic feedback appears specific to spindle-bursts, as it is not important for the generation of the other major early oscillation, Early-Gamma Oscillations (EGOs). In contrast to spindle-bursts, EGOs activate only the input and superficial layers of a single column, and occur only in response to temporally and spatially limited input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khazipov et al., 2013b</xref>), for example in response to a single deflection of the principle whisker in barrel cortex. VC EGOs do not occur in response to retinal waves, but can be induced by visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>), allowing us to examine their cortical dependence. While LGN spiking during the period of EGOs was reduced by VC silencing, the normalized oscillation power was unaffected, suggesting that VC provides amplification but not rhythmogenesis for EGOs. Poor modulation of EGOs by corticothalamic projections is consistent with the conduction delays (&gt;20 ms) and lack of L5/6 firing during EGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>) which should prevent corticothalamic projections from contributing to such rapid synchronization of LGN.

The prominent role of corticothalamic feedback in patterning LGN responses to glutamatergic waves suggests it is particularly critical for synaptic refinement driven by these waves. The role of glutamatergic waves remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerschensteiner, 2016</xref>), but their perturbation reduces segregation of C-lamina and maintenance of A-lamina segregation in LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015b</xref>) as well as orientation selectivity in VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>One of the most surprising roles for corticothalamic feedback is the acceleration of spindle-oscillations during late pre-visual development. A similar near doubling of occipital delta-brush frequencies occurs in human infants between 27 and 35 gestational weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">André et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, acceleration of early oscillations is a conserved feature of cortical development, for which we have identified a mechanism. Why does frequency increase? Driving cortical inputs at 10 Hz causes synaptic depression in immature somatosensory cortex at age equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minlebaev et al., 2011</xref>), while higher frequencies cause potentiation. Thus the acceleration in oscillation frequency may be a function of the change from ‘burst-based’ plasticity rules used to grossly align topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butts et al., 2007</xref>), to more precise spike-timing dependent plasticity that can take advantage of the increasing specificity of firing patterns within retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008</xref>) to reduce poly-innervation of relay cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaubert-Miazza et al., 2005</xref>) and refine orientation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Overall our results show that thalamocortical circuits function as an integrated circuit even during early development, and suggest that spontaneous retinal activity influences the development of corticothalamic feedback to LGN and reticular thalamus (RT).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transient feedback excitation is terminated by development of corticothalamic inhibition</title><p>This is a systematic investigation of the functional development of a ‘modulator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherman and Guillery, 2009</xref>) feedback pathway in vivo. Previous investigations have focused on driver inputs, such as retinogeniculate and thalamocortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>). For drivers, feedforward inhibition develops later than excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ziburkus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colonnese, 2014</xref>), but their functional effect remains excitatory. Here we show that for a modulator its role during development is different from its role in the adult, switching from an excitatory and amplifying role early, to a modulatory, net-inhibitory role later. This principle may apply to other modulatory feedback projections, such as intra-cortical feedback, which largely synapse on interneurons and develop later than feedforward connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berezovskii et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2013b</xref>). It should be noted we used coarse assays of corticothalamic function which, while sufficient to reveal developmental differences in this pathway, reveal little about its adult function, which appears to have excitatory or inhibitory effects that are strongly dependent on stimulus and behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denman and Contreras, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crandall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The lack of thalamocortical feedback inhibition has implications for seizure susceptibility during infancy, because thalamocortical synchronization through RT is an important mechanism of seizure spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paz et al., 2013</xref>). Preterm infants and neonates are highly susceptible to seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakhade and Jensen, 2009</xref>), and excitatory feedback amplification through thalamus may amplify paroxysmal events. Conversely, lack of inhibitory recruitment by cortex likely contributes to the differences in frequency and propagation of neonatal seizures. Our results suggest that manipulating RT function would be a poor candidate for seizure prevention in preterm populations.</p><p>The mechanism by which functional corticothalamic inhibition develops between P11 and P13 likely involves the recruitment of RT, and not LGN, interneurons, as they are poorly driven by VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jurgens et al., 2012</xref>). It is also unlikely to be due to a change in the polarity of GABA<sub>A</sub> currents, as GABA is inhibitory in LGN during the first post-natal week. Regardless of the localization of the relevant synaptic potentiation to the cortico-reticular or reticular-LGN synapse, it is clear that the development of effective feedforward inhibition brings to a close the net excitatory feedback loop that amplifies retinal-wave transmission, as well as the ability of cortex to synchronize rapid oscillations within LGN. Feedforward inhibition in both VC and LGN is potentiated between P11 and P13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colonnese, 2014</xref>), suggesting a common factor is responsible. One prominent candidate for future work includes an increase in continuous activity driven by midbrain neuromodulatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>) and/or spontaneous non-wave retinal activity.</p><p>We have identified a clear developmental role for the late development of inhibition, relative to excitation. A high excitatory to inhibitory ratio during development has been suggested to compensate for low synaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le Magueresse and Monyer, 2013</xref>), however a clear correlation with specific developmental events is lacking. By showing a strong contribution to corticothalamic gating of retinal waves, we establish a specific role for late inhibitory development, and provide potential experimental predictions to test its role in circuit formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>All experiments were conducted with approval from The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> (eighth Edition, National Academies Press). Long–Evans female rats with litters at postnatal day 4 (P4, birth P0), or pregnant female rats at embryonic day 11–19, were acquired from Hilltop Lab Animals (Scottdale, PA) and housed at one litter per cage on a 12 hr light 12 hr dark cycle. Both males and females were used. No formal sorting or randomization of subjects was applied, and experiments and analysis was not blind to age or treatment. Eyelid opening occurred between P13 and P14. In vivo recording methods are extensively described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berzhanskaya et al., 2016</xref>). Topical lidocaine (2.5%) and systemic Carprofen (5 mg/kg) were used as analgesic pre-operatively. To place the headplate, under isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 1.5–2% maintenance, verified by toe pinch), the scalp was resected, the skull was cleaned, and a stainless plate with a hole was placed so that the region over occipital cortex was accessible, and the plate was fixed with dental cement. The pups were monitored for signs of stress after recovery from anesthesia. For recording, the animal was head-fixed, and the body was supported within a padded enclosure and warmed with an electric blanket. Temperature was monitored with a thermocouple placed under the abdomen and maintained at 34–36°C. Movement was detected using a piezo-based detector placed under the enclosure. For VC recording, the skull above the monocular primary visual cortex was thinned, and the monocular primary visual cortex was targeted with the following coordinates: 0.5–1.0 mm anterior from the lambda suture, and 2.5–3.0 (P5-7), 2.8–3.3 (P9-11), or 3.0–3.5 (P13-14) mm lateral from <italic>lambda.</italic> Co-ordinates for LGN were 2.0–2.5 mm anterior and 3.0–3.5 mm lateral (p5-7), 2.3–2.8 mm anterior and 3.3–3.8 mm lateral (p9-11), or 2.5–3.0 mm anterior and 3.5–4.0 mm lateral from the lambda (p13-14). Extracellular activity was recorded using single shank linear multi-electrode arrays (NeuroNexus, MI). A combination of linear ‘edge’ arrays with 100 or 20 µm separation or ‘Poly2’ design of two parallel rows with 50 um separation were used. Electrodes were coated with DiI (Life Technologies, CA) before insertion for histological verification of electrode location. In animals older than P8, recording was initiated only after verifying that contralateral visual evoked firing on presumptive LGN electrodes preceded that of V1 electrodes (three animals were not recorded for this reason). For P5-7 animals (prior to visual responsiveness), recordings were initiated if both presumptive LGN or V1 locations displayed prominent 1–5 s firing periods that were interrupted by 10–60 s periods of network silence, indicative of retinal waves at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>). Post-mortem reconstruction of the electrode tract was used to verify placement within central dLGN or monocular V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by reference to a developmental atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khazipov et al., 2015</xref>). In total, three P5-7 animals were excluded post-mortem because the electrode was not located in the dLGN. An Ag/AgCl wire was placed over right frontal cortex (~1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to <italic>bregma</italic>) as ground. Electrical signals were digitized using the Neuralynx (Bozeman, MT) Digital Lynx S hardware with Cheetah (v5.5) software. dEEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz to 9 kHz, and digitized at 32 kHz. Cortical recordings were referenced to a contact site located in underlying white matter. LGN recordings were referenced to a contact just dorsal to LGN. MUA was extracted by threshold crossing of −50 µV following 300 Hz–9 kHz band-pass. Visual stimuli were provided by a 100 ms whole-field flash (100 lux) every 30 s to the contralateral or ipsilateral eye on a background of low light (&lt;1 lux).</p><p>For LGN silencing, the LGN electrode was removed after control recording, and 1 μl of 1 mM Muscimol and 1% Chicago Sky Blue in saline was injected using a Nanoject II (Drummond) at the same stereotaxic coordinates used for the LGN recording. Recordings began 10 min after application of the solution. The injection site was confirmed to be located in LGN in all animals by post-recording histology. Retinal silencing was also performed acutely after obtaining baseline visual responses. The surface of the eye was prepared with 2.5% lidocaine. Eyes were stabilized with blunt forceps and 2–5 μl of APV (5 mM)/CNQX (2 mM) in saline was injected intravitreally under the microscope. Recordings resumed at least 15 min after recovery from anesthesia. Retinal silencing was verified by loss of visual response (n = 2 removed for remaining visual response). For VC silencing, 1–3 μl of APV (5 mM)/CNQX (2 mM) in saline was applied over the small hole above the visual cortex. Recordings started 10 min after application of the solution. VC silencing was confirmed by verifying the complete secession of firing in all layers of VC for the electrodes under the drug placement. Because LGN and VC recordings were not aligned, we cannot be certain that the aligned portion of VC was completely inhibited by the treatment. However, the drug eliminated activity at all depths (~1.2 mm) of VC. Assuming a similar horizontal spread (2 mm diameter), inhibition will, at a minimum, affect all of monocular VC. Recording began 10 min after application and effects were stable for at least 30 min after application, when recording was terminated.</p><p>AAV9-Synapsin-promoter-Chronos-GFP (tier 3.5e13 GC/ml) was obtained from Penn Vector Core. P0-1 rat pups were cold anesthetized and 50–100 nl of viral solution was injected into the visual cortex at multiple depths (Nanoject II). At least 5 days post injection yielded strong expression of Chronos-GFP in VC and in cortical axons in LGN, and expression was verified in all animals recorded. To activate Chronos in vivo, a 400 µm diameter optic fiber (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) coupled with 470 nm LED (Thorlabs) was placed over VC, and 2.5 mW flashes of 470 nm LED illumination were used for activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Analysis</title><p>Neural signals were imported into Matlab (Mathworks, MA). Spike-times and dEEG were down sampled to 1 kHz. Before analysis, animals were eliminated for unstable baseline LFPs (fluctuation larger than the maximum amplitude of visual response) or variable spike activity (&gt; 20% change between the start and end of recording) (n = 5). Cortical L4 was identified in each recording as the channel with the earliest negative deflection and the fastest spike response in the mean visual evoked response as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berzhanskaya et al., 2016</xref>). For LGN, contralateral- and ipsilateral- responsive regions were identified by 100 ms flashes to either eye. The channel for analysis in LGN was selected by the earliest spike response to contralateral visual stimuli and used for detailed analysis. For P5-7, because of the lack of visual response at this age, cortical L4 was identified as that with the largest spike response during spindle bursts, and the recording site in LGN with the strongest spike activity during spindle bursts was used for detailed analysis.</p><p>For all analyses, activity for each animal was calculated from the entirety of a continuous 20 min period prior and 20 min period after manipulation (following 15 min recovery from anesthesia). For spectral analysis in VC, LFP spectra were obtained over a fixed window (2 s for spontaneous and 0.3 s for visually evoked response) by the multitaper method using the freely available Chronux package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra and Bokil, 2007</xref>) with taper parameters [3 5]. Animal mean spectra were calculated by averaging spectral windows. To reduce the effect of the 1/f relationship, mean multi-taper spectra were multiplied by frequency. For LGN, animal mean MUA spectra were obtained by calculating the fourier transform of the auto-correlation of total MUA. Time-series spectra for LGN MUA used for display (representative traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) were calculated by filtering the MUA time series with a Gaussian window (5 ms alpha) and applying the multi-taper method as above. For both signals, the frequency axis was resampled on a log scale to equalize the representation of high and low frequencies and reduce the multiple comparisons problem. For normalization, frequency power at each band was divided by the mean 2–55 Hz power.</p><p>Events were defined as at least two spikes occurring with intervals of less than 500 ms.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An excitatory cortical feedback loop gates retinal wave transmission in thalamus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including John Huguenard (Reviewer #2), Jose-Manuel Alonso (Reviewer #3), and Sacha B Nelson (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report follows on this group's highly innovative work documenting novel forms of network responses in the developing brain. The results help explain a key puzzle surrounding the role of spontaneous activity in developing sensory systems. Despite sparse and weak synapses and reduced excitability, peripheral waves are robustly transmitted to central structures. This is an excellent paper that provides very exciting results about the function and development of the corticogeniculate pathway</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is <italic>eLife</italic> policy to include some reference to the biological system in the title. This often means including reference to the preparation or experimental organism in the title. This might be realized by including the word &quot;mammalian&quot; or &quot;rodent&quot; prior to the word thalamus in the current title.</p><p>2) This is the first paper the Reviewing editor has handled for <italic>eLife</italic> that received three reviews with no major points raised. The full reviews are included for your information, but the suggestions for revision are advisory. You may consider this paper acceptable pending minor revision.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Murata and Colonnese use simultaneous multi-electrode recording from LGN and visual cortex in awake rats and optogenetic and pharmacological manipulation of retinal, thalamic and cortical activity to demonstrate that corticothalamic feedback amplifies the propagation of retinal waves through the LGN to the cortex. The effect is developmentally regulated and changes to net inhibition around the time of eye opening.</p><p>The results help explain a key puzzle surrounding the role of spontaneous activity in developing sensory systems. Despite sparse and weak synapses and reduced excitability, peripheral waves are robustly transmitted to central structures.</p><p>The experiments appear to have been carefully done and are very clearly reported. I have no major recommendations for improvement.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This report follows on this group's highly innovative work documenting novel forms of network responses in the developing brain. In particular, during the early postnatal period (first two weeks after birth) in rodents there is a distinct mode of thalamocortical network activation with sensory spindles occurring during spontaneous activity (retinal waves) in sensory organs. In this report the authors use silicon probe recordings from dLGN and VC in unanesthetized animal, and make several key observations: 1) early cortical spindles are dependent on thalamic relay of sensory information, 2) corticothalamic feedback produces a very powerful amplification of the sensory signal arising from spontaneous retinal waves, 3) this reinforcement of thalamic activity by cortical feedback during early development disappears later when retinal waves no longer occur, 4) the loss of reinforcement coincided with the development of feedforward inhibition, and 5) the latter appears to be due to cortical recruitment of thalamic inhibition, as inhibitory responses in LGN can be produced by optogenetic activation of deep layer VC neurons.</p><p>Overall, the results are interesting, the points well illustrated, and the statistical analysis compelling. I only have a few minor concerns, as follows:</p><p>1) In my opinion, there is a dearth of primary data in many of the illustrations. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is composed exclusively of derived data, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> only shows anecdotal responses in a, and even those are derived spike rasters or spectrograms.</p><p>2) Results section, subsection: “Transmission of retinal waves requires corticothalamic feedback”. A more precise location than &quot;just below LGN&quot; would be appropriate.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent paper that provides very exciting results about the function and development of the corticogeniculate pathway. The experiments are well designed, the data are of high quality and the results are really exciting and beautifully presented. The paper is a pleasure to read and reports several important new results that are likely to be very influential in the field. The main finding that the corticothalamic feedback has a net excitatory effect on LGN at early developmental states and only switches to inhibitory at the end of the postnatal second week (around eye opening) is very interesting and supported by strong and convincing data. Multiple other findings reported in this paper are also interesting and novel. To choose just one example, the finding that silencing the visual cortex reduces LGN activity just as much as silencing of the retina in the Discussion is very interesting and important.</p><p>I have no major criticisms. This is one of few rare papers where I find myself making multiple notes in the manuscript not because of problems with the paper but because of novel insights that the authors report and that I want to remember. The significance of the findings is very high and the results have potential important implications both in basic and clinical research.
