this organization is important for genome function. Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) approaches allow 3D architectures of genomes to be visualized. Scalable FISH technologies, which can be applied to whole animals, are needed to help unravel how genomic architecture regulates, or is regulated by, gene expression during development, growth, reproduction, and aging. Here, we describe a multiplexed DNA FISH Oligopaint library that targets the entire <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome at chromosome, three megabase, and 500 kb scales. We describe a hybridization strategy that provides flexibility to DNA FISH experiments by coupling a single primary probe synthesis reaction to dye conjugated detection oligos via bridge oligos, eliminating the time and cost typically associated with labeling probe sets for individual experiments. The approach allows visualization of genome organization at varying scales in all/most cells across all stages of development in an intact animal model system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42823.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains the instructions needed to build and maintain a living organism.

The basic unit of genome organization is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes assemble into higher order structures whose biogenesis, maintenance, regulation, and purpose are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickmore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonev and Cavalli, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meaburn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu and Ren, 2017</xref>). DNA fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) technologies and chromatin conformation capture techniques allow 3D architectures of genomes to be assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauman et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). Studies using these technologies have begun to reveal how DNA is organized within nuclei. For instance, chromatin capture experiments show that many eukaryotic genomes are assembled into megabase-sized structures termed topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs, and larger organizational units termed compartments, are thought to allow subregions of chromosomes to share and integrate long-range transcriptional regulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dekker and Heard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dekker and Mirny, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vernimmen and Bickmore, 2015</xref>). Additionally, DNA FISH and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have shown that the position of genes within nuclei is often not random: active genes tend to localize near nuclear pores and/or the nuclear interior while inactive genes tend to localize to the nuclear periphery, distant from nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez-Sandoval and Gasser, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemaître and Bickmore, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pickersgill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Steensel and Belmont, 2017</xref>). Finally, DNA FISH experiments have shown that individual chromosomes tend to occupy distinct non-overlapping regions of subnuclear space, even in interphase nuclei (termed chromosome territories) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremer and Cremer, 2010</xref>). Many questions concerning the large-scale architecture of genomes remain unanswered, including the following: how the various aspects of genome architecture, such as gene position, TADs, or territories differ in different cell types or across developmental time, and how such changes relate to gene expression during development. Technologies that enable rapid and flexible analysis of genome organization in an intact animal would allow such questions to be addressed.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an excellent model for studying genome organization in an intact animal due to its size (1 mm), lifespan (~3 days to reproductive maturity), genome size (100 Mb across five autosomes and one sex chromosome), and transparent body. Whole-chromosome DNA FISH experiments have been instrumental for our current understanding of chromosome architecture and dynamics in model organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau et al., 2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabeshima et al., 2011</xref>). Such studies are limited, however, by the cost and time associated with generating DNA FISH probe sets. For example, a previous chromosome level DNA FISH experiment in <italic>C. elegans</italic> used 127 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones split into 50 amplification reactions for three chromosome probe generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabeshima et al., 2011</xref>). Oligopaint technology has made DNA FISH probe production faster, cheaper, and more flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>). Oligopaint takes advantage of massively parallel DNA synthesis technologies to create user defined libraries containing hundreds of thousands of individual DNA oligos each comprised of a short (42 bp) DNA sequence that hybridizes to a genome, as well as additional ‘barcode’ sequences that serve two major functions. First, barcodes allow probes to be repeatedly amplified from an Oligopaint library, thus providing a virtually inexhaustible supply of oligos for DNA FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murgha et al., 2014</xref>). Second, barcodes allow pre-labeled detection oligos to be used to detect Oligopaint oligos, thus obviating the need for fluorescently labeling probes for each DNA FISH experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beliveau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previously, the Oligopaint technology has been used to visualize chromosome territories in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells in normal and mutant contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we describe a rapid, flexible and inexpensive Oligopaint strategy that enables visualization of chromosome territories and sub-chromosome regions in a whole intact organism. Specifically, we report methods for using this library to simultaneously visualize all six <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes, as well as three megabase and 500 kilobase subregions of these chromosomes, in all/most cells of <italic>C. elegans</italic> across all stages of development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> oligopaint library design.</title><p>An Oligopaints bioinformatics pipeline was used to identify 42 bp DNA sequences in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (genome reference Ce10) that (1) uniquely map to the genome, (2) exhibit similar melting temperatures and similar GC content, (3) lack repetitive stretches, and (4) lack predicted secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>). [Note, an updated bioinformatics pipeline for identifying probes is now available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beliveau et al., 2018</xref>).] The results of our bioinformatic search revealed approximately nine suitable probe sequences per kilobase of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We generated an Oligopaint library that contained, on average,~2 probe sequences per kb of genomic DNA across each <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> shows the distribution of all (25,174) chromosome I probes. Few gaps between probes exceeded 5 kb (33 out of 25,174), with the largest gap spanning ~18 kb. A subtle decrease in probe density is observed on chromosome arms, perhaps due to an increase in repetitive sequences in these regions, which biased against probe selection (C. elegans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998</xref>). Similar probe distributions are observed for the other five <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In total, the library consisted of 170,594 oligos (termed primary Oligopaint oligos), which each contain 42 bp of unique genomic sequence flanked by barcode sequences that allow for DNA FISH targeting each of the six <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes, as well as three megabase, or 500 kb subregions of these chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Bridge oligos (also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nir et al., 2018</xref>)) were designed to base pair with barcode sequences contained within primary probes as well as base pair with dye-conjugated detection oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Detection oligos were designed that base pair with bridge oligos and are conjugated to three fluorophores (Alexa 488, Cy3, and Alexa 647) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Thus, bridge oligos are intermediate probes that hybridize to the primary probe and provide a docking site for labeled detection probes. Bridge oligos provide versatility (and cost savings) to DNA FISH experiments as these oligos allow any primary probe set to be coupled to any detection probe set with minimal additional cost. Bridge oligos also allow for more than one fluorophore to be targeted to primary probes, which expands the number of objects that can be visualized with a standard three channel microscopy system (see six chromosome FISH experiments below). By using 1) detection oligos with fluorophores on both 3’ and 5’ termini, 2) two detection oligos per bridge oligo, and 3) bridge oligos that target the 5’ and 3’ barcode sequence of primary probes, it is possible to have each primary oligo recognized by eight fluorophores. To conduct DNA FISH, unlabeled primary probes are first PCR amplified from the Oligopaint library as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beliveau et al. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murgha et al., 2014</xref> (also see Materials and methods). Second, primary Oligopaint oligos are hybridized to fixed samples of <italic>C. elegans</italic> overnight (see below and Materials and methods). Third, samples are hybridized with a mixture of bridge oligos and dye-conjugated detection oligos for 3 hr the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Together, this three-step strategy allows many DNA FISH experiments to be conducted fairly cheaply after a single primary probe synthesis step.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42823.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of oligonucleotide sequences across the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome.</title><p>Potential probe sequences were identified as described in Materials and methods.

A detailed description of this fixation and hybridization protocol can be found in Materials and methods. To test our <italic>C. elegans</italic> Oligopaint library, we amplified a primary probe set targeting chromosome II (27,360 unique probes) and asked if this probe set was able to specifically label chromosome II. The behavior and morphology of chromosomes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline are well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, homologous chromosomes pair at the pachytene stage of Meiosis I at a defined region of the germline (termed pachytene region). Oocytes are arrested in diakinesis of meiosis I and chromosomes are highly condensed with homologs connected via a single chiasmata (termed bivalents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villeneuve, 1994</xref>). Mature sperm harbor highly condensed chromosomes and are haploid. To address specificity, we imaged germ cells of animals subjected to chromosome II DNA FISH. This analysis detected the expected chromosomal structures in pachytene germ cells, oocytes, and sperm; fluorescent staining was observed on a single bivalent in oocytes and in one region of the nucleus in sperm and pachytene germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). HIM-8 is required for X chromosome homolog pairing during meiosis and, consequently, X chromosomes are present as two univalents (and not a single bivalent) in <italic>him-8</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). To further address specificity, we imaged oocytes of wild type and <italic>him-8 (e1489)</italic> mutant animals subjected to X chromosome Oligopaint.

[Note, an alternative protocol that allows for greater efficiency using isolated embryos (90%) is described in Materials and methods.] We next measured the % of nuclei within a given animal that were stained by chromosome II DNA FISH. We randomly chose DAPI-stained nuclei (from animals that showed staining) and asked if these nuclei were positive for chromosome II DNA FISH signals. Out of 50 randomly chosen somatic nuclei 50/50 had DNA FISH signal. Likewise, 50/50 germline nuclei were positive for DNA FISH signals. We conclude that our library and hybridization strategy allows for robust and specific labeling of a whole chromosome in many cell types and many developmental stages simultaneously in large numbers of animals.

In pachytene stage adult germ cells, <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes are paired, condensed, and localized near the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson et al., 2011</xref>). DNA FISH illuminated six regions of distinct colors concentrated near the nuclear periphery in pachytene germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Six chromosome DNA FISH staining was robust: 50/50 randomly chosen DAPI positive nuclei were stained successfully. Six chromosome FISH staining was also successful in somatic nuclei. Six distinct colors were often distinguishable in the nuclei of intestinal and hypodermal nuclei, as well as nuclei whose small size and positioning within the animal were indicative of ventral cord neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).

Note, because the six color strategy described above visualizes an overlap of two colors (each of which is also used to define a separate chromosome), rigorously defining the subnuclear space occupied by individual chromosomes is not possible using this six color approach.

We used our Oligopaint library to simultaneously visualize all six chromosomes in 1- and 10-day-old animals (<italic>C. elegans</italic> typically live about 2 weeks) to ask if the aging process might affect the genomic architecture. For this analysis, we imaged intestinal nuclei as these cells are postmitotic, have large nuclei, and are easily identifiable due to their idiosyncratic size, shape, and location within the animal. As expected, all six chromosomes occupied largely distinct territories in intestinal cells of 1-day-old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, in 10-day-old animals, chromosomes were no longer organized into discrete territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Quantification (see Materials and methods) of the space occupied by chromosomes I, II and III in young and aged animals revealed an ~50% increase in the volume of all three chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) as well as an increase in the degree to which chromosomes I, II and III overlapped in subnuclear space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The data confirm that the discrete chromosome territories observed in young intestinal nuclei are lost as the worms ages. We asked if the loss of chromosome territories in older animals were a consequence of aging or a function of time. To do so, we conducted a similar analysis on young and old animals harboring a mutation (<italic>e1370</italic>) in <italic>daf-2. daf-2</italic> encodes a insulin-like receptor and loss-of-function mutations in <italic>daf-2</italic> and mutations in <italic>daf-2</italic> such as <italic>e1370</italic> cause animals to live twice as long as wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>).

DNA FISH experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have historically relied on 1) labeling PCR products that cover a single small (5–10 kb) region, or 2) YACs to generate probes targeting larger regions (up to whole chromosomes). Such approaches are low throughput and rigid in the sense that new probe sets need to be produced for each new DNA FISH experiment. Such experiments have also been limited by the types of cells that can be queried, as most DNA FISH protocols rely on dissection of tissues, which is low throughput and limits the number of cell types that can be analyzed at one time. Here we describe an Oligopaint DNA FISH library and hybridization strategy that allow for visualization of all six <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes at varying scales. The ability to rapidly and cheaply produce <italic>C. elegans</italic> DNA FISH probes, in conjunction with improvements to hybridization protocols, enables DNA FISH in all/most cells across all stages of development in an intact animal. These improvements should empower studies asking if/how higher-order chromatin structures regulate, and/or are regulated by, changes in gene expression that occur during growth and development. Given the invariant cell lineage of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it should now also be possible to ask if chromosome- chromosome interactions or homolog pairing, or the size, morphology, or sub-nuclear positioning, of chromosomal territories (or subregions of these territories) vary predictably by cell type, age, or developmental trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>). 872,946 oligonucleotide sequences met this criteria, and 170,594 probes sequences were chosen for the library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A series of barcode sequences were appended to each 42 bp hybridization sequence, which resulted in each primary probe being 150 bp. Barcode sequences can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. The 170,594 sequences were ordered as two 90 k oligonucleotide chips from Custom Array (Bothell, WA). Note that a step by step protocol for Oliogpaint probe synthesis can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. To obtain primary probes for Oligopaint experiments, desired primary probes were first amplified using primers specific to the outermost barcode sequences, which correspond to the individual chromosome barcodes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Single stranded probe (primary probe) generation was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, PCR was used to append a T7 polymerase site to the 5’ end of chromosome specific barcode sequence, followed by T7 polymerase reactions to generate ssRNA. ssRNA was reverse transcribed into ssDNA. Unwanted ssRNA species were degraded using base hydrolysis. Finally, long ssDNA oligos were purified using the Zymo-100 DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit with oligo binding buffer. Probes were stored at 100 pmol/ul at −20C. An aliquot of the library is available to qualified labs upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bridge and detection probes</title><p>Bridge oligos were ordered from IDT at 25 or 100 nmole scales using standard desalting procedures.

Animals were pelleted (3 k rpm for 30 s), and washed two times with M9 solution. Animals were resuspended in 10 ml of M9 solution and rocked for ~30 min at room temperature. Animals were pelleted and aliquoted to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (30–50 ul of packed worms per tube). Samples were placed in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. Frozen worm pellets were resuspended in cold 95% ethanol and vortexed for 30 s. Samples were rocked for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were spun down (3 k rpm for 30 s), supernatant discarded, and washed twice in 1X PBST (10X Phosphate- Buffered Saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific: 70011–044) diluted to 1X in H2O, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma: X100). 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution (4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS) was added and samples were rocked at room temperature for 5 min, washed twice with 1X PBST, and resuspended in 2X SSC (20X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer (Thermo Fischer Scientific: 15557–044) diluted in H2O) for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were spun down and resuspended in a 50% formamide 2X SSC solution at room temperature for 5 min, 95°C for 3 min, and 60°C for 20 min. Samples were spun and resuspended in 60 ul of hybridization mixture (10% dextran sulfate, 2X SSC, 50% formamide, 100 pmol of primary probe per chromosome and 2 ul of RNAse A (sigma 20 mg/ml)).

All territory quantifications were done using standard tools in ImageJ along with the 3D objects counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). First, each individual nucleus was segmented from the original file to generate individual nuclei files. The four-channel stack was then split to create individual files for each chromosome (each chromosome is represented by a single fluorophore/channel). To remove background noise and create a binary mask, each image was subjected to thresholding using the default ImageJ thresholding using ‘auto’ across every image. Once masks were obtained the 3D objects counter tool was utilized to select objects larger than 30 voxels (eliminating further background signal). Object masks for each channel were loaded into the 3D Manager plugin for ImageJ, and all objects for a given chromosome were merged into a single object. The colocalization and measure 3D functions within 3D manager were used to determine the volume of each chromosome as well as the volume of overlap between each chromosome.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Kennedy and Wu Labs for helpful discussions.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Multiplexed DNA FISH strategy for Assessing Genome Architecture in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Brian D Slaughter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #4, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Susan Strome (Reviewer #1); Barbara Panning (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript details the adaptation of DNA chromosome Oligopaints for use in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. By altering the hybridization strategy from other DNA oligo-paint protocols, the authors have come up with a bridge oligo method that allows for improved flexibility in the labeling of the FISH oligo pools. Fields et al. designed a set of ~170,000 <italic>C. elegans</italic> oligos arrayed on two 90,000-oligo chips. Each has a unique 42 bp primary oligo plus 3 barcodes, 1 for that oligo's chromosome, 1 for that oligo's 3 MB location, and 1 for that oligo's 0.5 MB location. Using the library of composite oligos in combination with bridge oligos and detection oligos conjugated to 1 of 3 fluorophores, the investigators can perform DNA FISH with up to 6 combinations to image whole chromosomes and/or 0.5-3 MB regions of chromosomes.</p><p>Having established the effectiveness and versatility of the method, the authors then use this method to assess chromosome organization during aging. They show that chromosomal territories become less distinct (enlarged and disorganized) with more overlap (suggesting that chromosomal territories are not maintained) and that this disorganization is age and not time related. Finally, they identify one molecular player, <italic>mes-3</italic>, knockdown of which phenocopies age-related chromosome disorganization.</p><p>This manuscript will be of broad interest – the FISH method will be useful for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community and the finding that chromosome organization is altered with age will be intriguing to the aging community. Overall, the manuscript is a nice methods paper that will provide a useful resource for broad use within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community to address key questions about how genome architecture influences multiple processes and cell types within a developing and aging organism. The reviewers shared enthusiasm for the paper, and would be supportive of publication given that the concerns below are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figure 2, more work should be given to demonstrate the specificity of the Oligopaint approach. To demonstrate specificity, Oligopaint could be done on animals in which oocytes carry a fusion of two chromosomes – painting one of the chromosomes of the fusion should paint only half of the long fused chromosome. Probably easier would be to paint the X chromosomes in <italic>him-8</italic> mutant oocytes, in which the X chromosomes exist as univalents instead of a bivalent.</p><p>STORM data:</p><p>Subsection “Using OligoSTORM to super resolve <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes within whole animals”: The authors need to be cautious using FISH and STORM to quantify particle density. First, there is no way to know if all the probes are getting activated since STORM is a stochastic method. Thus, an unknown percent of the probes could remain in the dark state and never be activated; or probes might not be deactivated and sent back to the dark state. Second, there is no way to know if all of the probes have hybridized, thus it is dangerous to assume that the probes are still equally distributed once they have been hybridized in the worm. The authors should address both of these in the manuscript.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>C. elegans</italic> Oligopaint library design: The authors mention that the oligos are &quot;evenly spaced&quot; with about 2 probes per kilobase of genomic DNA. Is this true all the way across the chromosome? In other organisms the probes are on average evenly spaced, but there are some regions where this can't occur because of repetitive DNA or potential crosstalk of the sequence with another chromosome. Furthermore, the authors use this equal distribution of probes to quantify the density of DNA in the STORM experiment. If regions of the genome are not evenly covered, then that needs to be mentioned and addressed in the STORM quantification.</p><p>Beyond this point, the authors should make more clear what the utility of the STORM analysis is, and what specially it adds to the manuscript. The chiasmata between homologs is easily represented with standard fluorescent microscopy. If true, the 'core' idea would be of interest. However, STORM is very sensitive to environment, and more work should be done to determine that the 'core' at the center of each chromosome IV homolog is real, and not an artifact of STORM. It needs to be verified with a further method. The size of the gradient of STORM density is on the order of a micron. It true, standard, high resolution, confocal data should be able to see this same gradient. Using one color to mark the chromosome, followed by DAPI quantification, may also see it. Is there evidence of such a 'core' density difference from Hi-C data?</p><p>If the authors can demonstrate that this core is missing from other chromosomes, or is missing in some condition such as aged <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it would also go a long way in determining that this is not an artifact of STORM.</p><p>Are the authors able to use STORM to resolve any detail on the scale (reported as 80 nm) of their improved resolution? And if so, what is the relationship between what conclusions can be made with super resolution imaging yet with relatively low probe density (2 probes per kb)? Further discussion on this point would be useful.</p><p>More thorough explanation of methods and more discussion:</p><p>Some sections of Materials and methods are quite minimal. Especially since this is a Tools and Resources article, the Materials and methods should provide protocols that are detailed enough for others to use the technology.</p><p>Specifically, the authors combined 3 colors in different combinations to come up with 6 signatures for the 6 chromosomes (Figure 3A). This is very effective in outlining the 6 chromosomes in cases where there is either separation of the chromosomes, or very discrete chromosome territories. However, in cases where there are not discrete territories, and overlap between chromosomes becomes dramatic, separation of 6 chromosomes with 3 colors becomes very difficult. The authors acknowledge this in the Figure 6 figure legend – and quantification in Figure 6B and CD was done on 3 chromosomes only because of this difficulty. This should be explained more thoroughly in the text.</p><p>The separation of chromosomes with this method, especially in circumstances of chromosome overlap, is a key, others will want to do this in mutants, aged cells etc. Part of this being considered as a tool and resource is a full description of methods not just for probe design, but data analysis. More explanation is needed on criteria for considering a region positive or negative for a color, and how the final determination of where a chromosome is, in cases of high degree of overlap, should be discussed with rigor so others can reproduce it.</p><p>In the section with the <italic>mes-3</italic> RNAi – while the images in aging intestinal nuclei and <italic>mes-3</italic> hypodermal nuclei look relatively similar, the quantitation of overlap was quite different. Is that a function of different cell types? Or does it reflect that different mechanisms underlie the breakdown of nuclear organization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42823.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figure 2, more work should be given to demonstrate the specificity of the Oligopaint approach.

We reanalyzed the distribution of our probe sets on a log2 scale and noted subtle differences in probe density between the center and arms of chromosomes, which could conceivably explain the chromosome “core” phenomena we described in our original submission. Also, we noticed “core-like” structures using other microscopy approaches (see below), however, these structures were also present in non-biological structures. The new data raise concerns that cores are real. Obviously more work is needed before the STORM data can be included in the paper. The amount of this work is substantial and I am not in a position to have the work done at the moment (first author has left the lab for a postdoc position and I don’t have anyone in the lab to replace him at the moment). Because STORM was not even mentioned by our reviewers in the synopsis of our paper, or listed as a strength of the paper, I’ve decided the best way forward here is simply to remove the data from the revised manuscript. Should editor/reviewers disagree, and prefer that we include the data, we would be happy to do so. In this case, we would put the data in the supplement along with a detailed description of the reasons for and against believing “cores” might be real.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “C. elegans Oligopaint library design: The authors mention that the oligos are &quot;evenly spaced&quot; with about 2 probes per kilobase of genomic DNA.

During the course of these experiments, however, we also noticed “core-like” structures (using these same approaches) in fluorescent beads. We can’t think of any reason why fluorescent beads should have cores. For this reason (and because of the subtly non-random distribution of probe sets shown in new Figure 1A) we’ve decided it is best to tap the breaks on chromosome “cores” for the time being. Therefore, STORM is no longer a part of the revised manuscript.

The supplementary files also describe necessary equipment, reagents (including catalog numbers and buffer compositions), and software required to carry out the experiments described in this manuscript. We believe that this format should allow for an easier adaption of the technology described here for other labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, the authors combined 3 colors in different combinations to come up with 6 signatures for the 6 chromosomes (Figure 3A). This is very effective in outlining the 6 chromosomes in cases where there is either separation of the chromosomes, or very discrete chromosome territories. However, in cases where there are not discrete territories, and overlap between chromosomes becomes dramatic, separation of 6 chromosomes with 3 colors becomes very difficult. The authors acknowledge this in the Figure 6 figure legend – and quantification in Figure 6B and CD was done on 3 chromosomes only because of this difficulty. This should be explained more thoroughly in the text.</p><p>The separation of chromosomes with this method, especially in circumstances of chromosome overlap, is a key, others will want to do this in mutants, aged cells etc. Part of this being considered as a tool and resource is a full description of methods not just for probe design, but data analysis. More explanation is needed on criteria for considering a region positive or negative for a color, and how the final determination of where a chromosome is, in cases of high degree of overlap, should be discussed with rigor so others can reproduce it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the revised manuscript in three ways to address this issue.</p><p>First, we have modified the main text to do a better job explaining how we can visualize 6 colors with three fluorophores.</p><p> <italic>“C. elegans</italic> possess six chromosomes. […] Overlapping Alexa 647 (green) or Cy3 (red) channels produces a yellow pseudocolor that can be differentiated from Alexa 647 (green) or Cy3 (red) alone (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>Second, we have added Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to clearly illustrate the principle of multicolor labeling.</p><p>Third, we have added a few sentences to the end of our 6 chromosome FISH section to explain why defining the space occupied by 6 chromosomes simultaneously using 3 colors is not possible. Finally, our new Supplementary files (6-8) contain information needed to reproduce the types of DNA FISH analyses that are described in our paper.</p><p>“Note, because the 6 color strategy described above visualizes overlap between two colors (each of which is also used to define a separate chromosome), rigorously defining the subnuclear space occupied by individual chromosome is not possible using the 6 color approach. Single channel probe sets are recommended for experiments in which knowing the precise space occupied by a chromosome is relevant (see Figure 5 for examples).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the section with the mes-3 RNAi – while the images in aging intestinal nuclei and mes-3 hypodermal nuclei look relatively similar, the quantitation of overlap was quite different. Is that a function of different cell types? Or does it reflect that different mechanisms underlie the breakdown of nuclear organization.</p></disp-quote><p>We reanalyzed our data and found that the nuclear volume (using DAPI) of intestinal cell nuclei is 5-10x that of skin cell nuclei. Thus, there is more total space in intestinal cells for chromosomes to overlap. In other words, it is possible that degree of overlap is the same in both cell types but that the volume of this overlap is quite different, given the different volumes of these nuclei. We think this likely explains why the quantifications of chromosome overlap, which we presented in the original submission, looked different between the two cells types, and we agree that presenting the data as we did was confusing. To better illustrate our main point, we decided to present data showing changes in chromosome sizes after aging or <italic>mes-3</italic> RNAi (instead of degree of overlap) in the main text of the revised manuscript (Figure 5B and D). This analysis shows that there is a similar overall degree of chromosomal expansion in the two cells types (as hinted at by the images), while also showing the differences in chromosome size between the two cell types. The old analysis, which showed that aging or <italic>mes-3</italic> RNAi increased the degree to which chromosomes overlapped (old Figure 6B/D), is now Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
