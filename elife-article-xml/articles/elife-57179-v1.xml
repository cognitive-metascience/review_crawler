cellular compartment. In recent years it has become obvious that protein complexes and lipids are not uniformly distributed within membranes. Current hypotheses suggest that flotillin proteins are required for the formation of complexes of membrane proteins including cell-wall synthetic proteins. We show here that bacterial flotillins are important factors for membrane fluidity homeostasis. Loss of flotillins leads to a decrease in membrane fluidity that in turn leads to alterations in MreB dynamics and, as a consequence, in peptidoglycan synthesis. These alterations are reverted when membrane fluidity is restored by a chemical fluidizer. In vitro, the addition of a flotillin increases membrane fluidity of liposomes. Our data support a model in which flotillins are required for direct control of membrane fluidity rather than for the formation of protein complexes via direct protein-protein interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every living cell is enclosed by a flexible membrane made of molecules known as phospholipids, which protects the cell from harmful chemicals and other threats. In bacteria and some other organisms, a rigid structure known as the cell wall sits just outside of the membrane and determines the cell’s shape.</p><p>There are several proteins in the membrane of bacteria that allow the cell to grow by assembling new pieces of the cell wall. To ensure these proteins expand the cell wall at the right locations, another protein known as MreB moves and organizes them to the appropriate place in the membrane and controls their activity. Previous studies have found that another class of proteins called flotillins are involved in arranging proteins and phospholipid molecules within membranes. Bacteria lacking these proteins do not grow properly and are unable to maintain their normal shape. However, the precise role of the flotillins remained unclear.</p><p>Here, Zielińska, Savietto et al. used microscopy approaches to study flotillins in a bacterium known as <italic>Bacillus subtilis.</italic> The experiments found that, in the presence of flotillins, MreB moved around the membrane more quickly (suggesting it was more active) than when no flotillins were present. Similar results were observed when bacterial cells lacking flotillins were treated with a chemical that made membranes more ‘fluid’ – that is, made it easier for the molecules within the membrane to travel around. Further experiments found that flotillins allowed the phospholipid molecules within an artificial membrane to move around more freely, which increases the fluidity of the membrane.</p><p>These findings suggest that flotillins make the membranes of bacterial cells more fluid to help cells expand their walls and perform several other processes. Understanding how bacteria control the components of their membranes will further our understanding of how many currently available antibiotics work and may potentially lead to the design of new antibiotics in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>functional membrane microdomain</kwd><kwd>penicillin binding protein</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>membrane organisation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vidi 864.09.010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheffers</surname><given-names>Dirk-Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BR 2915/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bramkamp</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 86/1452-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bramkamp</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>721.014.008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirsch</surname><given-names>Anna KH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>starting grant 757913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirsch</surname><given-names>Anna KH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship DAAD-GSSP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savietto</surname><given-names>Abigail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship SFRH/BD/78061/2011- POPH/FSE/FCT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Sousa Borges</surname><given-names>Anabela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Correct cell wall synthesis in bacteria depends on flotillin-mediated membrane fluidity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The shape of a bacterium is predominantly defined by the structure of its peptidoglycan. Although there is a great variety in bacterial shapes, the overall chemistry of peptidoglycan is very similar between bacteria and thus the shape of peptidoglycan is primarily determined by the temporal and spatial regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis. In rod-shaped bacteria, peptidoglycan synthesis is thought to be mediated by two protein assemblies, the elongasome and the divisome, that synthesise peptidoglycan along the long axis and across the division plane of the cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Typas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). These complexes contain a set of proteins required for the final steps of synthesis and translocation of the peptidoglycan precursor, LipidII, from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, and proteins that incorporate LipidII into peptidoglycan. These include SEDS (Shape, Elongation, Division and Sporulation) proteins that can perform glycosyl transferase reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>), and Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) that are divided in class A PBPs (aPBPs) that catalyse both glycosyl transferase and transpeptidase reactions, class B PBPs (bPBPs) that only catalyse transpeptidase reactions and low molecular weight PBPs that modify peptidoglycan, as well as hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morales Angeles and Scheffers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Coordination of these complexes is linked to cytoskeletal elements, MreB (-like proteins) for the elongasome and FtsZ for the divisome. In models, the cytoplasmic membrane is often depicted as a passive environment in which these machineries are embedded. However, it is becoming clear that the structure of the membrane plays a critical role in the coordination of peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strahl and Errington, 2017</xref>). Inward membrane curvature serves as a localisation trigger for MreB and the elongasome, and enhanced local synthesis at bulges straightens out the membrane sufficient to convert spherical cells to a rod shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ursell et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> the motion of MreB along the membrane is associated with elongasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garner et al., 2011</xref>), and the velocity of MreB patches is related to growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billaudeau et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that MreB motion can be used as a marker for elongasome activity. Interestingly, MreB localises to and organises regions of increased membrane fluidity (RIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strahl et al., 2014</xref>), which in turn is linked to the presence of LipidII, which favours a more fluid membrane and promotes local membrane disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganchev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witzke et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of LipidII synthesis by genetic or chemical means results in a dissolution of membrane structures observed with the dye FM 4–64 and release of MreB from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muchová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schirner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next to RIFs, membrane regions of decreased fluidity have been identified in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strahl and Errington, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bramkamp and Lopez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez and Koch, 2017</xref>). These so-called functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) are thought to be organised by the bacterial flotillin proteins, are enriched in isoprenoid lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López and Kolter, 2010</xref>), and can be found in so-called Detergent Resistant Membrane (DRM) fractions of the membrane. Since the formulation of the FMM hypothesis, FMMs have been linked to many processes, such as protein secretion, biofilm formation, competence and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mielich-Süss and Lopez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mielich-Süss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach and Bramkamp, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dempwolff et al., 2012</xref>). Cell morphology defects are linked to cell wall synthesis, and analysis of the protein content of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> DRMs identified several PBPs, MreC and other proteins involved in cell wall metabolism as well as the two flotillins, FloA and FloT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López and Kolter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach and Bramkamp, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yepes et al., 2012</xref>). FloA is constitutively expressed, whereas FloT is expressed primarily during stationary growth, cell wall stress and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicolas et al., 2012</xref>). Super resolution microscopy showed that the flotillins and other proteins found in DRMs do not colocalise and have different dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dempwolff et al., 2016</xref>), so it is unlikely that FMMs are regions in the membrane that offer a favourable environment in which these membrane proteins are continuously present and active. Recently, the hypothesis has been put forward that FMMs/flotillins form a platform for the formation of functional protein oligomers, as work in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> showed that multimerisation of Type 7 secretion systems and PBP2a depends on FMMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez and Koch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mielich-Süss et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have analysed the role of flotillins in peptidoglycan synthesis in <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> Our results show that, at high growth rates, flotillins control membrane fluidity in a manner that is critical for peptidoglycan synthesis and MreB dynamics, but have no effect on PBP oligomerisation. This results in a new model for flotillin function in the physical organisation of membranes during fast growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Absence of flotillins shifts peptidoglycan synthesis to division Septa</title><p>In previous studies, a double deletion of <italic>floA/floT</italic> was either reported to suffer severe shape defects and perturbed membrane structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dempwolff et al., 2012</xref>), or to not have strong shape defects but with a change in the overall lipid ordering of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach and Bramkamp, 2013</xref>). We grew wild type and Δ<italic>floAT</italic> strains and analysed exponentially growing cells. We did not observe striking shape defects but did see an increase in median cell length and distribution of cell lengths in the absence of flotillins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,G</xref>). To look at effects on peptidoglycan synthesis, we labelled cells with HADA, a fluorescent D-Alanine analogue that reports on sites of active peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuru et al., 2012</xref>), and with fluorescent vancomycin (Van-FL), which labels LipidII and peptidoglycan containing pentapeptide side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel and Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morales Angeles et al., 2017</xref>). This revealed a significant accumulation of peptidoglycan synthesis stains at division septa in the Δ<italic>floAT</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). To look at membrane structure, cells were labelled with FM4-64, Nile-Red and DiI-C12, which are lipid dyes that accumulate in zones enriched in fluid lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strahl et al., 2014</xref>). Again, the stains accumulated at the septa in the Δ<italic>floAT</italic> strain, which also showed some accumulation of FM4-64 and DiI-C12 in patches, suggesting that the more fluid regions of the membrane are coalescing into larger regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D–F</xref>). The HADA, FM4-64 and Nile-Red measurements were repeated using a wild type strain expressing endogenous GFP, allowing simultaneous imaging of both strains on the same slide, and gave similar results, confirming that the observed signal increase is not due to variation between microcopy experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In this mixed-strain experiment, Nile-Red labelling at the lateral membrane was the same between wild type and Δ<italic>floAT</italic> strains, indicating that there is no difference in dye diffusion between the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Inspection of the septa by electron microscopy revealed that there was no difference between the thicknesses of the septa between the wild type and Δ<italic>floAT</italic> strain, ruling out that the increase in signal was due to formation of thicker septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The shift of peptidoglycan synthesis to the division site could hint at stress in the overall peptidoglycan synthesis route.

To exclude the possibility that an alteration of peptidoglycan modification resulted in the delocalisation of HADA and Van-FL, we used D-Alanine-D-Propargylglycine (D-Ala-D-Pra), a clickable dipeptide analogue which is exclusively incorporated into peptidoglycan via LipidII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarkar et al., 2016</xref>).

Analysis of the movement of a fully functional mRFPruby-MreB fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>) by time lapse TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy, confirmed that MreB patch mobility is higher in cells grown on LB than in cells grown on SMM, with MreB speeds similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billaudeau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">2</xref>).

We purified <italic>B. subtilis</italic> FloT and tested the impact of FloT on the membrane, when reconstituted in POPC-d31 liposomes (Schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). FloT decreases the spectral width of the <sup>2</sup>H quadrupolar splitting, reflecting an increase in motion on the atomic scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The <sup>2</sup>H spectrum encodes the local order parameter S<sub>CD</sub> of the carbon-deuterium in absence and in presence of FloT. Strikingly, FloT has an important impact on the order parameter along the entire acyl chain. It is remarkable that the protein significantly decreases the order parameter S<sub>CD</sub>, reaching even the inner carbon atoms of the acyl chain, indicating a different packing behaviour and increased membrane fluidity upon interaction with FloT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The strong fluidising effect described for FloT is notably different from the effects other proteins have when reconstituted into liposomes, such as plant remorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>) or the membrane binding peptide of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheidt and Huster, 2009</xref>).

Upon interactions with FloT the lamellar phase remains intact with formation of a few smaller objects, indicating that the overall liposome structure is not affected and that its phase is maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lipid ordering of FloT probed by <sup>2</sup>H solid-state NMR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wide-line <sup>2</sup>H spectra of POPC-d31 liposomes with or without FloT at a lipid-to-protein molar ratio of 25:1 acquired at 298 K.

In vitro, flotillins enhance the fluidity of a model membrane, and in vivo, the membranes of fast growing flotillin-mutant cells are less fluid even though the fatty acid composition in these cells is identical. Therefore, we propose that the effect of flotillins on membrane fluidity is direct, through a change in the packing behaviour of the lipids resulting in an efficient separation of states of liquid ordered and disordered lipid domains in the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach and Bramkamp, 2013</xref>). We found that membrane fluidity is not solely a function of temperature, but also of growth conditions. In vivo, flotillins may also recruit specific, more rigid lipids, such as hopanoids and carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bramkamp and Lopez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López and Kolter, 2010</xref>) which have been found in association with FMMs, and whose synthesis could be growth condition dependent. The predominantly physical role in membrane organisation for flotillins fits with our observation that adding a chemical fluidiser is sufficient to restore MreB dynamics and cell shape to fast growing cells that lack flotillins. We propose that in fast-growing cells on rich medium, flotillin-mediated control of membrane fluidity is critical and sufficient to allow essential membrane bound processes, such as peptidoglycan synthesis, to proceed normally.</p><p>A sufficiently fluid membrane is necessary for the efficient recruitment and movement of MreB, and provides a more favourable environment for the peptidoglycan precursor LipidII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ursell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schirner et al., 2015</xref>). It has recently been shown that modulation of either MreBCD or PBP1 levels is sufficient to alter the shape of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dion et al., 2019</xref>), underscoring the importance of both systems. In the absence of flotillins, the activity of the MreBCD component is strongly reduced – as evidenced by the reduction of MreB speed – and the overall rigidity of the membrane is increased. This results in a less favourable environment for the peptidoglycan precursor LipidII, which prefers more liquid, disordered membrane phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganchev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witzke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvez et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that the reduction in elongasome activity, which does not impact the growth rate itself, is compensated by increased peptidoglycan synthesis activity around division sites in flotillin mutants, which is sufficient to keep the overall cell shape intact, although cells are elongated. The accumulation of lipid dyes indicative of increased fluidity at division sites is in line with a recent study that showed phases of different fluidity in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> membranes, with more fluid membranes and LipidII localising at midcell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvez et al., 2019</xref>) where the membrane is most bent. Our findings are also in agreement with the recent observation that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells elongate and lose organisation of MreB when membrane fluidity is decreased by altering the membrane fatty acid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gohrbandt, 2019</xref>) (H. Strahl, personal communication). It could very well be that the shift of fluidity towards the septum is only relative as the overall fluidity of the membrane is decreased in the absence of flotillins. This is yet to be determined, as the resolution of Laurdan imaging does not allow conclusive statements about local fluidity changes at the septum. The observation that reduced MreB mobility and therefore altered lateral cell wall synthesis lead to accumulation of Van-FL and HADA staining at the septum is not immediately conclusive. Since septal PG synthesis is MreB independent in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, a direct effect of MreB seems unlikely. Rather, a reduction of overall membrane fluidity in a flotillin knock-out might impair LipidII dynamics within the membrane. MurG is the enzyme that catalyses the final step of LipidII synthesis. There are several reports that MurG localises to the septum in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohammadi et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that the septum is a place of increased LipidII synthesis and a change in membrane fluidity would create problems for LipidII molecules to diffuse away from their insertion site, resulting in reduced lateral PG synthesis and MreB mobility. Alternatively, the reduced MreB mobility and reduced lateral PG synthesis lead to a reduced LipidII consumption at the lateral wall, and the excess LipidII is used by the septal PG synthesis machinery, thereby leading to an increase in midcell PG. It remains to be tested which of these possibilities is responsible for the observed phenotype. Nevertheless, in both cases the increase in cell wall staining at the septum would be indicative of a higher local synthesis activity.</p><p>It may seem paradoxical that cells elongate when elongasome activity is reduced, but one has to remember that a large amount of the peptidoglycan synthesis contributing to elongation of bacterial cells is actually taking place at midcell, before the ingrowth of the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pazos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varma and Young, 2009</xref>). A relative increase in peptidoglycan synthesis at future division sites makes the activity of PBP1 critical and explains why its deletion has such a dramatic effect in cells lacking flotillins. Restoring fluidity using a chemical fluidiser allows the MreBCD component to again efficiently drive peptidoglycan synthesis during elongation, which is sufficient to suppress the flotillin mutant phenotype. The net effect of this is that cells lacking PBP1 and flotillins grown with benzyl alcohol behave as cells that only lack PBP1, which is quite similar to wild type. At low growth rates, there is no difference between wild type cells and cells lacking flotillins with respect to membrane fluidity, and the speed of MreB is similar between the two cell types. Thus the deletion of flotillins does not exacerbate the phenotype of cells lacking PBP1. The reason for the change in membrane fluidity between cells grown on rich or minimal medium is not yet clear – it does not seem to be caused by a large shift in the fatty acid composition of the membranes. Various factors could play a role, such as the synthesis of specific lipids (hopanoids, isoprenoids) on either type of medium, but also protein crowding, which is higher in membranes of fast-growing cells than in slow-growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szenk et al., 2017</xref>). It will be an important future challenge to establish the cause for this difference. An overall rigidification of the membrane may also lead to retardation of processes which require membrane modifications such as division and sporulation, which is indeed observed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> flotillin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dempwolff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donovan and Bramkamp, 2009</xref>).</p><p>One of the proposed roles for flotillin proteins is that they form a ‘platform’ that transiently interacts with membrane proteins that need to oligomerise into functional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez and Koch, 2017</xref>). We tested this hypothesis for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PBPs by comparing their localisation and oligomerisation in wild type and flotillin mutant strains. Although we were capable of detecting a high MW complex containing various PBPs (notably PBP1, 2a, 2b, 3 and 4), the complex was not dependent on the presence of flotillins. We also note that PBP1 was present in the complex, as well as present in a large smear in the first dimension native gel, which would explain why PBP1 was detected by mass spectrometry analysis of a native PAGE band containing FloA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2015a</xref>). PBP5, on the other hand, was not part of the high MW complex, which fits with its role in processing of the terminal D-Ala from stem-peptides that have not been cross-linked, which it exercises over the entire surface of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuru et al., 2012</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that flotillins may affect PBPs that are not easily detected by Bocillin-FL, our results do not provide any evidence for a role for flotillins in the oligomerisation of PBPs in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. This extends the finding of the Graumann lab that found either transient or no colocalisation between flotillins and other proteins present in DRM fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dempwolff et al., 2016</xref>). Although it is obvious that peptidoglycan synthesis is altered in the absence of flotillins, our data strongly suggest that the basis for this alteration is in the physical organisation of the membrane rather than inefficient formation of divisome or elongasome complexes in the absence of flotillins, because flotillin mutants strains show no synthetic phenotype on minimal medium, and the defects on rich medium can be reverted by chemically fluidising the membrane.</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide a new model for flotillin function in the physical organisation of membranes during fast growth. The observation that flotillins differentially affect the membrane in different growth conditions also explains the diversity of phenotypes described for flotillin mutants in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

so-called micro-domains in the bacterial membrane that have been proposed to act as protein scaffolds for the local recruitment of protein complexes, including cell wall synthetic proteins. In this work, Zielinska et al. provide evidence for an alternative mechanism whereby Flotillins instead function to regulate fluidity of the membrane, indirectly affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and thus cell wall synthesis. In the future, it will be important to determine whether the proposed mechanisms are mutually exclusive or whether Flotillins indeed perform both functions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Membrane fluidity controls peptidoglycan synthesis and MreB movement&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that the work conveys a potentially interesting message with regards to a new model of Flotillin function, they both indicate that the results are yet too preliminary to fully disprove the existing hypothesis that Flotillins form a physical platform for the recruitment of cell wall synthetic complexes. Specifically, the reviewers insist on two key points that need further investigations to strengthen the conclusions:</p><p>i) The quantification of Peptidoglycan and/or precursor accumulation at the septa is not supported by the EM images and Laurdan staining experiments. Comparison of fluorescence intensities between conditions is particularly delicate, requiring very precise microscope calibrations and possibly imaging of distinct cell genotypes in the same field of view. The conclusions that PG accumulation and membrane fluidity increase at septa in the floAt mutant is central to the authors' hypothesis and should be verified by a complementary approach.</p><p>ii) The benzyl alcohol rescue experiment is currently the main piece of evidence that challenges the previous model, but is it sufficient?

They discovered this phenomenon by observing differences in cell wall synthesis at division sites and related differences in lipid staining in a flotillin deletion mutant. An important discovery was that they could exacerbate the phenotype by combining it with a deletion in the non-essential peptidoglycan synthase PBP1. What completed their experiments was the fact that they could restore the phenotype by fluidizing the cell membrane with an alcohol.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that highlights the importance of membrane fluidity, the role of bacterial flotillins in this, and the fact that this physiological characteristic changes under different growth conditions and can be adjusted by specific membrane proteins.</p><p>I agree with their overall conclusion but some conclusions seem to me incorrect (outlined below). The paper is clearly written, and experiments generally well performed. However, the microscopic figures are far too small. Even when displayed on a large screen many cellular details are not visible, e.g. Laurdan staining that does not show any clear septa. Firstly, a paper should be readable when printed, secondly, microscopic images should be clear so that phenotypic differences are clearly observable. This is currently not the case and should be improved.</p><p>I do not agree with the conclusion in the Discussion (second paragraph) that membrane fluidity and peptidoglycan synthesis is higher at septa in order to compensate the absence of flotillins. This reasoning does not make sense because what should be compensated for? The overall fluidity still changes. It is also a bit difficult how this can be compensated, in other words, how can the fluidity be increased at septa? Moreover, if there would be more peptidoglycan synthesis, then cells would divide faster, thus be shorter, since the authors show that septa do not become wider (Supplementary Figure 1). But a floAT deletion strain is not shorter (Figure 2). This discrepancy might be related to the possibility that the authors have not measured the septal intensities in Figure 1 correctly. That is, they should have compared the intensities of septa with that of the lateral wall, because it might well be that a floAT deletion strain has an overall more permeable cell wall that facilitate fluorophore diffusion. In fact the laurdan images in Figure 3 even suggest this. Maybe the authors measured the relative increase in intensity at septa, but I was unable to determine this from their experimental description. Moreover, and importantly, their laurdan images show no evidence for an increase of fluidity in septa. This seems to contradict their own argumentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The experiments are well done and for the most part convincing. The problem is that their conclusions are overstated. The claim that all effects are explained by a direct action of flotillins on membrane fluidity rather than primarily affecting the assembly or activity of a PBP is not supported by the data. In fact most of the experiments (except potentially the benzyl alcohol addition, see below) can be explained by the floAT double mutant affecting primary septal PG synthesis or turnover. This does not mean that the manuscript is not suited for <italic>eLife</italic>, the data should just be interpreted differently.</p><p>1) One could state that all of the observed effects are due to floAT control of a septal PBP or septal PG remodeling. First, the claim that there is more lipidII/PG precursors in Figure 1 in the float mutants is based on a small difference and is weak. The signal is barely above background and HADA does not mark sites of PG synthesis, rather it marks sites of PG remodeling/turnover, as it depends on the exchange of the labeled D-ala in lipid II on the extracytoplasmic side. Moreover, the fact that floAT cells depend strongly on PBP1 for cell division, provides genetic evidence that the double mutant is under septal PG stress, which would probably be observable by applying PG stress in the cytoplasm (with Fosfomycin for example) and extracellularly with β-lactams or glycopeptides or bacitracin or A22.</p><p>If PBP biosynthetic activity is reduced (or PG degradation increased) in the floAT mutants, would this not lead to a (slight) accumulation of lipid II at the septum as well, and this could explain the observation in Figure 1? Also, this effect on PG stress could easily explain the reduction in MreB movement. Finally, my understanding was that an increase in lipidII would INCREASE membrane fluidity, but they show in Figure 3 that fluidity is reduced in the floAT mutant.</p><p>2) Growth rate effect: I disagree that the difference between LB and SMM can be pinned on growth rate. The cellular metabolism is completely different in minimal vs. rich medium so how can the authors rule out that a change in biosynthetic pathways does not affect lipid composition, PG (bactoprenol or lipidII) synthesis, isoprenoids or simply certain membrane proteins, all of which could alter membrane fluidity. The growth rate argument does not hold here, and it could only be proven if the authors stick to LB and lower growth rate there, ideally by reducing temp, but there could be complications on fluidity arising from a temperature shift. Inducing ppGpp would also be possibility, but this could also reprogram cell metabolism and make the interpretation ambiguous. Perhaps use diluted LB?</p><p>3) The benzyl alcohol addition experiment is the best (and in my opinion only) argument for their claim on membrane fluidity, but how do we know that this compound directly affects the membrane, rather than acting indirectly, like SMM, changing metabolism? How quick are the changes observed after addition of BA? Are the changes in fluidity and MreB localization still observed when cells are pre-treated with protein synthesis inhibitors and /or cerulenin (FA inhibitor)? By the way, are FRAP measurements of membrane-tethered GFP consistent with a change in fluidity?</p><p>The bottom line is: I'm not a fan of the previous flotillin model either, but I don't think the authors provide compelling evidence in favor of their model. In fact, their experimental data does not completely exclude the previous model about flotillins facilitating PG assembly/turnover machines either.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Flotillin mediated membrane fluidity controls peptidoglycan synthesis and MreB movement&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leendert Hamoen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Overall the study is solid, convincing, well presented and certainly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, some clarifications should be provided before the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p><p>1) It is not clear why a reduction in MreB mobility in the membrane of floAT cells grown in LB would lead to increased vancomycin-FL and HADA staining at the septum. This relationship is poorly accounted for in the manuscript. MreB is not at the septum, so why would lower mobility of MreB cause an increase in septal lipid II? This observation is thus circumstantial. MreB and septal lipid II could be both affected because of reduced fluidity, but those events do not have to be linked:</p><p>– Perhaps membranes are less fluid and if lipid II is inserted at the septum, it is less likely to diffuse away in floAT cells because of the reduced fluidity?</p><p>– Or there is just a preference for lipid II to accumulate there because the membrane is curved and fluidity at the curvature is affected in the absence of FloAT? If that's the case, what does the additional deletion of pbp1 really tell us (although it is interesting)?</p><p>2) To clarify these issues, these questions should be discussed and it could be easier for the reader if the order of the results were turned around and tell the story more linearly. For example, rather than going from PG studies to membrane fluidity studies, the manuscript could present the established part first (NMR, fluidity, MreB) and then argue that reduced MreB mobility prompted imaging with HADA, Vanco-FL and finally check the pbp1floAT triple mutant. The current read takes a circular path (starting with PG and ending with MreB) and again there is no compelling causality between MreB movement and septal PG presented here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57179.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

An important discovery was that they could exacerbate the phenotype by combining it with a deletion in the non-essential peptidoglycan synthase PBP1. What completed their experiments was the fact that they could restore the phenotype by fluidizing the cell membrane with an alcohol.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that highlights the importance of membrane fluidity, the role of bacterial flotillins in this, and the fact that this physiological characteristic changes under different growth conditions and can be adjusted by specific membrane proteins.</p><p>I agree with their overall conclusion but some conclusions seem to me incorrect (outlined below). The paper is clearly written, and experiments generally well performed. However, the microscopic figures are far too small. Even when displayed on a large screen many cellular details are not visible, e.g. Laurdan staining that does not show any clear septa. Firstly, a paper should be readable when printed, secondly, microscopic images should be clear so that phenotypic differences are clearly observable. This is currently not the case and should be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the overall very positive comments. We have made adjustments to the figures to make them clearer. For easy reading we have inserted the figures in the text, but high resolution files are now also available that would be used for the published version.</p><p>We also want to point out that microscopic images showing laurdan measurement do not aim to highlight individual cells or even subcellular region (e.g.) septa. The resolution is not good enough to make strong claims about membrane fluidity measured by laurdan GP in distinct membrane regions. We provide an overview in a heat map coloration to support the calculated values shown in individual graphs. The micrographs allow the reader to quickly judge about the effect of flotillins deletions or benzyl alcohol addition on the overall membrane fluidity. We feel the provided images serve this idea perfectly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not agree with the conclusion in the Discussion (second paragraph) that membrane fluidity and peptidoglycan synthesis is higher at septa in order to compensate the absence of flotillins. This reasoning does not make sense because what should be compensated for? The overall fluidity still changes. It is also a bit difficult how this can be compensated, in other words, how can the fluidity be increased at septa?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot draw a definitive conclusion on the increase of fluidity at the septum in a flotillin deficient strain. Therefore, we have rephrased the statement in the Discussion to clearly indicate that it is speculative. We do note, however, that it is in line with other recent findings from the Zapun lab on increased fluidity at the division site.</p><p>The statement now reads:</p><p>“Our data indicate that the reduction in elongasome activity, which does not impact the growth rate itself, is compensated by a shift to increased peptidoglycan synthesis activity around division sites in flotillin mutants, which is sufficient to keep the overall cell shape intact, although cells are elongated. […] This is yet to be determined, as the resolution of Laurdan imaging does not allow conclusive statements about local fluidity changes at the septum.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, if there would be more peptidoglycan synthesis, then cells would divide faster, thus be shorter, since the authors show that septa do not become wider (Supplementary Figure 1). But a floAT deletion strain is not shorter (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree – increased peptidoglycan synthesis around the septum does not necessarily mean that all the peptidoglycan is contributing to the septum and allows faster division. In fact a recent preprint from the Deckers-Hebestreit and Strahl labs in which membrane fluidity is lowered by changing the fatty acid composition also shows a disruption of MreB activity (and thus lateral wall synthesis) while cells are slightly elongated (personal communication H. Strahl, length measurements were not provided in the preprint but do show elongation. Preprint: Biorxiv 10.1101/852160). It may seem paradoxical that cells elongate by synthesis around the division site but this is not uncommon, as is mentioned in the Discussion and backed up with various references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This discrepancy might be related to the possibility that the authors have not measured the septal intensities in Figure 1 correctly. That is, they should have compared the intensities of septa with that of the lateral wall, because it might well be that a floAT deletion strain has an overall more permeable cell wall that facilitate fluorophore diffusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tackled this issue in two ways – first, we repeated a series of experiments with two membrane dyes and one PG dye using a wild type strain expressing GFP, which allowed mixing of the two strains and direct comparison of septal signal intensities to exclude the possibility that differences in microscopy setup cause the measured intensity difference (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B). Second, we have excluded the possibility that diffusion is different between the strains. This cannot be done with a peptidoglycan synthesis dye as these could also be differently distributed because of differences in peptidoglycan. Thus, we compared intensities at the lateral wall for the membrane dye Nile Red, in the new experiment with the mixed strains. No difference in lateral intensity was observed indicating that there is no difference in fluorophore diffusion (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact the laurdan images in Figure 3 even suggest this. Maybe the authors measured the relative increase in intensity at septa, but I was unable to determine this from their experimental description. Moreover, and importantly, their laurdan images show no evidence for an increase of fluidity in septa. This seems to contradict their own argumentation.</p></disp-quote><p>Laurdan is used to determine overall membrane fluidity in cells and does not have the resolving power in our setup to say anything about differences at the septum. We have added a statement to clarify this to the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The experiments are well done and for the most part convincing. The problem is that their conclusions are overstated. The claim that all effects are explained by a direct action of flotillins on membrane fluidity rather than primarily affecting the assembly or activity of a PBP is not supported by the data. In fact most of the experiments (except potentially the benzyl alcohol addition, see below) can be explained by the floAT double mutant affecting primary septal PG synthesis or turnover. This does not mean that the manuscript is not suited for eLife, the data should just be interpreted differently.</p><p>1) One could state that all of the observed effects are due to floAT control of a septal PBP or septal PG remodeling. First, the claim that there is more lipidII/PG precursors in Figure 1 in the float mutants is based on a small difference and is weak. The signal is barely above background and HADA does not mark sites of PG synthesis, rather it marks sites of PG remodeling/turnover, as it depends on the exchange of the labeled D-ala in lipid II on the extracytoplasmic side. Moreover, the fact that floAT cells depend strongly on PBP1 for cell division, provides genetic evidence that the double mutant is under septal PG stress, which would probably be observable by applying PG stress in the cytoplasm (with Fosfomycin for example) and extracellularly with β-lactams or glycopeptides or bacitracin or A22.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the remark. We have carried out an additional control as suggested by the reviewer by growing the cells with sublethal amounts of fosfomycin to apply PG stress while keeping growth rate constant. This stress has an effect – such as bulging in wildtype cells. We have included an image (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F) that shows that the flotillin mutant also suffers from the fosfomycin stress. Importantly, if the flotillin deletion would lead to general PG stress such as caused by fosfomycin, the fosfomycin treated wildtype cells should look like the flotillin deletion without fosfomycin – which is not the case.</p><p>We included a remark to state that flotillin deletion does cause peptidoglycan synthesis stress. Other stressors were not included as they would impact on membrane processes (bacitracin, glycopeptides) or cause a potential accumulation of precursor (betalactams).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If PBP biosynthetic activity is reduced (or PG degradation increased) in the floAT mutants, would this not lead to a (slight) accumulation of lipid II at the septum as well, and this could explain the observation in Figure 1? Also, this effect on PG stress could easily explain the reduction in MreB movement.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the reduction of the activity of some specific PBPs (2a and H) can lead to reduced MreB movement, but it is not evident that this of itself would result in increased LipidII at the septum – one could also argue that the unprocessed LipidII accumulates at the lateral wall. But a general reduction in biosynthetic activity or increase of degradation would also be expected to affect septum formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, my understanding was that an increase in lipidII would INCREASE membrane fluidity, but they show in Figure 3 that fluidity is reduced in the floAT mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to explain this point better in the text – the overall fluidity of the membrane is reduced, but a shift resulting in a relative local increase of disordered lipids and LipidII at the septum would still keep the membrane more fluid at the septum relative to the rest of the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Growth rate effect: I disagree that the difference between LB and SMM can be pinned on growth rate. The cellular metabolism is completely different in minimal vs. rich medium so how can the authors rule out that a change in biosynthetic pathways does not affect lipid composition, PG (bactoprenol or lipidII) synthesis, isoprenoids or simply certain membrane proteins, all of which could alter membrane fluidity. The growth rate argument does not hold here, and it could only be proven if the authors stick to LB and lower growth rate there, ideally by reducing temp, but there could be complications on fluidity arising from a temperature shift. Inducing ppGpp would also be possibility, but this could also reprogram cell metabolism and make the interpretation ambiguous. Perhaps use diluted LB?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are alternative explanations for the differences observed between LB and SMM. We compared these to growth rate because in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> literature the same point is made about growth rate and MreB velocity, which our paper shows may have a different cause – but we do observe a correlation between growth rate, fluidity and MreB velocity. We have modified our remarks to make it clear that growth rate or growth conditions determine fluidity. We agree that this needs to be investigated more carefully but think that is beyond the scope of the current paper as various causes need to be investigated such as the presence of specific lipids in the membrane in certain growth conditions, or differences in crowding of the membrane by membrane proteins during various growth conditions. We have tried the suggested experiment with diluted LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This experiment revealed that we could lower growth rate by diluting LB up to 5 times (stronger dilutions led to excessive lysis) – but not to the growth rate observed with SMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Importantly, at all these conditions cell dimensions were still completely different. Cells grown on (diluted) LB are wider and longer than SMM grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Also, at all LB dilutions, the phenotype of the triple mutant remains – elongated cells and delocalized cell wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57179-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The benzyl alcohol addition experiment is the best (and in my opinion only) argument for their claim on membrane fluidity, but how do we know that this compound directly affects the membrane, rather than acting indirectly, like SMM, changing metabolism?</p></disp-quote><p>The action of benzyl alcohol as a membrane fluidizer is well established in the literature. It acts by increasing membrane hydration, as has been shown in experiments on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Konopasek et al., 2000). We have clarified this in the text. But we agree that this was the sole experiment indicating a link between flotillins, membrane fluidity and cell wall synthesis (e.g. MreB dynamics). We therefore thought about a direct proof to show that flotillins really fluidize membranes. We teamed up with Dr. Birgit Habenstein in Bordeaux and used purified and reconstituted FloT for solid-state-NMR experiments (see answer below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How quick are the changes observed after addition of BA? Are the changes in fluidity and MreB localization still observed when cells are pre-treated with protein synthesis inhibitors and /or cerulenin (FA inhibitor)? By the way, are FRAP measurements of membrane-tethered GFP consistent with a change in fluidity?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggested experiments but have added a different, in vitro, experimental approach that provides an independent line of evidence that flotillin proteins are capable of fluidizing membranes. Using solid state NMR to determine lipid mobility in liposomes with and without reconstituted flotillin we show that the addition of FloT is sufficient to fluidize the liposomal membranes, to a much larger extent than observed for other membrane inserted proteins. This experiment has now been added to the paper in an additional section and Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The bottom line is: I'm not a fan of the previous flotillin model either, but I don't think the authors provide compelling evidence in favor of their model. In fact, their experimental data does not completely exclude the previous model about flotillins facilitating PG assembly/turnover machines either.</p></disp-quote><p>We do hope that with the series of new data including the in vitro characterization of FloT, we have now proven the fluidizing effect of flotillins.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall the study is solid, convincing, well presented and certainly suitable for publication in eLife. Nevertheless, some clarifications should be provided before the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p><p>1) It is not clear why a reduction in MreB mobility in the membrane of floAT cells grown in LB would lead to increased vancomycin-FL and HADA staining at the septum. This relationship is poorly accounted for in the manuscript. MreB is not at the septum, so why would lower mobility of MreB cause an increase in septal lipid II? This observation is thus circumstantial. MreB and septal lipid II could be both affected because of reduced fluidity, but those events do not have to be linked:</p><p>– Perhaps membranes are less fluid and if lipid II is inserted at the septum, it is less likely to diffuse away in floAT cells because of the reduced fluidity?</p><p>– Or there is just a preference for lipid II to accumulate there because the membrane is curved and fluidity at the curvature is affected in the absence of FloAT? If that's the case, what does the additional deletion of pbp1 really tell us (although it is interesting)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with some of the possible explanations provided. We have included a new paragraph in the Discussion to clarify this issue, in which some of the possibilities raised are included, and in which the relation between MreB and septal staining is further clarified and supported with additional references (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To clarify these issues, these questions should be discussed and it could be easier for the reader if the order of the results were turned around and tell the story more linearly. For example, rather than going from PG studies to membrane fluidity studies, the manuscript could present the established part first (NMR, fluidity, MreB) and then argue that reduced MreB mobility prompted imaging with HADA, Vanco-FL and finally check the pbp1floAT triple mutant. The current read takes a circular path (starting with PG and ending with MreB) and again there is no compelling causality between MreB movement and septal PG presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed a reorganization of the text with Dr. Mignot – we found that this would cause other problems with the organization of the text and Dr. Mignot agreed that changing the organization was not a must.</p></body></sub-article></article>
