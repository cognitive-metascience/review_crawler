replication, repair and recombination to avoid genomic instability. Yet, it is unclear how the 5’nuclease mechanisms of DNA distortion and protein ordering robustly mediate efficient and accurate substrate recognition and catalytic selectivity. Here, single-molecule sub-millisecond and millisecond analyses of FEN1 reveal a protein-DNA induced-fit mechanism that efficiently verifies substrate and suppresses off-target cleavage. FEN1 sculpts DNA with diffusion-limited kinetics to test DNA substrate. This DNA distortion mutually ‘locks’ protein and DNA conformation and enables substrate verification with extreme precision. Strikingly, FEN1 never misses cleavage of its cognate substrate while blocking probable formation of catalytically competent interactions with noncognate substrates and fostering their pre-incision dissociation. These findings establish FEN1 has practically perfect precision and that separate control of induced-fit substrate recognition sets up the catalytic selectivity of the nuclease active site for genome stability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21884.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21884.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21884.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell divides it must copy its genetic information, which is found in the form of strands of DNA. Damage to the DNA may lead to cancer or a number of genetic diseases. However, every time a cell divides more than 10 million toxic “flaps” of excess DNA are generated. A protein called flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) keeps the DNA in good repair by cutting off the flaps in a highly specific and selective manner.</p><p>Many proteins that interact with DNA are attracted to specific genetic sequences within the DNA strands. However, this is not the case for FEN1 and several other “structure-specific” proteins that help to repair and replicate DNA strands. So how do these proteins select the correct regions of DNA to interact with?</p><p>Rashid et al. used single-molecule fluorescence measurements to examine how purified FEN1 proteins interact with DNA flaps. The results show that FEN1 can perfectly recognize and correctly remove flaps through a process called “mutual-induced fit”, where the DNA and FEN1 are shaped by each other to produce a highly specific structure.</p><p>Further work is now needed to examine whether other proteins that are related to FEN1 use a similar process to ensure that they always cut DNA in the same way. More detailed and direct examination of the structure of FEN1 through other experimental methods may also help to reveal how the mutual-induced fit process enables FEN1 to achieve such high levels of precision. This could increase our understanding of how problems with FEN1 and similar proteins lead to different genetic diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21884.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21884.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Human purified proteins</kwd><kwd>expressed proteins in E. coli</kwd><kwd>recombinant protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004052</institution-id><institution>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2201 CRG3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rashid</surname><given-names>Fahad</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaher</surname><given-names>Manal S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sobhy</surname><given-names>Mohamed A</given-names></name><name><surname>Joudeh</surname><given-names>Luay I</given-names></name><name><surname>Piwonski</surname><given-names>Hubert</given-names></name><name><surname>Tainer</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Habuchi</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamdan</surname><given-names>Samir M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1149521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Chunli</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivanov</surname><given-names>Ivaylo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Chunli</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivanov</surname><given-names>Ivaylo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamdan</surname><given-names>Samir M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure specific nucleases that act in DNA replication, repair and recombination actively mold their DNA while transforming their own structure to achieve precise cleavage of their cognate DNA and avoid the deleterious cleavage of noncognate DNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biologically-critical, structure-specific 5’nucleases are highly conserved endo- or exo-nucleases that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds that are one nucleotide into the 5’end of single-stranded(ss)/double-stranded(ds)-DNA junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including nicks, gaps, flaps, bubbles and four-way junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balakrishnan and Bambara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsutakawa and Tainer, 2012</xref>).

Whereas sequence-based specificity partially explains the secret of replication fidelity, key information is missing about the basis for the structure-based excision required at more than 10 million Okazaki fragment sites during human DNA replication. Strikingly, FEN1 maintains exquisite specificity with extreme efficiency that enhances the hydrolysis rate of target phosphodiester bonds by ~10<sup>17</sup>, and in vitro reaction rates resemble those of enzyme-substrate encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 2009</xref>). FEN1 recognizes dsDNA bearing a double-flap (DF) nick junction consisting of short ssDNA or ssRNA 5’flaps and strictly one nucleotide (nt) ssDNA 3’flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kao et al., 2002</xref>). DF intermediates are produced during Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand and during long-patch base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations that reduce FEN1 expression or alter its activity are linked to cancers and genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balakrishnan and Bambara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henneke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kucherlapati et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2011</xref>). In cells, the 5’flap is complementary to the template strand, enabling the junction to equilibrate and form a single nt 3’flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon 5’flap cleavage, the 3’flap complements the newly unpaired template base to create a DNA ligase 1 sealable nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). FEN1 contacts duplex DNA from both sides of the flap junction through a 100° bend stabilized by the interaction of the superfamily-conserved hydrophobic wedge with the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). A superfamily-conserved helical gateway covered by a unique FEN1 helical cap forms a narrow cavity at the DNA junction. This gateway is suitable to select for threading ss 5’flaps with a free end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gloor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sobhy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, clamping the 5’flap away from the active site is a proposed selection mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orans et al., 2011</xref>). A small cavity makes contacts with the 3’flap and may impose specificity for the single nt 3’flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Part of the cap-helical gateway, which contains catalytically indispensable residues, and the 3’flap-binding pocket appear disordered without DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>), but it is ordered when bound to the 3’flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapados et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting DNA-induced ordering of the cap-helical gateway. Comparison of substrate and product complexes shows that the scissile phosphate nucleotide is fully paired at the nick junction and away from the active site’s metal ions, suggesting that unpairing flanking nucleotides may move ssDNA into the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>By building upon these strong static structural and ensemble biochemical results, we reasoned that single-molecule experiments could resolve mechanistic unknowns by deconvoluting DNA bending, protein disorder-to-order transitioning, active-site assembly and incision. Like other 5’nucleases, FEN1 displays maximum catalytic efficiency for its cognate substrate but it is only residually active on substrates that vary only slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kao et al., 2002</xref>). To define the mechanism for this catalytic efficiency and selectivity, we used single-molecule (sm)FRET at a millisecond to sub-millisecond temporal resolution to simultaneously measure in real time DNA conformational changes and catalysis when FEN1 encounters cognate or noncognate flap substrates as well as when the disorder-to-order transition or the active site is perturbed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FEN1 actively bends the DNA</title><p>A major question in DNA damage recognition is whether the DNA distortion observed in protein−DNA complexes occurs spontaneously and is captured by the protein (termed conformational selection) or if the protein actively sculpts the DNA into the distorted conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine which is the case for FEN1, we started by establishing the conformational state of DF substrates alone using an ideal non-equilibrated (NonEQ) DF substrate containing 6 nt ssDNA 5’flap and 1 nt ssDNA 3’flap primers with no complementarity with the template strand (NonEQ DF-6,1). DNA bending was monitored by placing an Alexa Fluor-647 acceptor 12 nt into the upstream dsDNA and a Cy3 donor at the 5’flap end (NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or 15 nt into the downstream dsDNA (NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The substrates contained biotin to allow for immobilization on a polyethylene glycol-coated coverslip via biotin-NeutrAvidin linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The experiments were performed using custom-built setups operating in either the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) mode at a standard temporal resolution of 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sobhy et al., 2011</xref>) as the primary method or the confocal mode for higher temporal resolution.</p><p>The single-molecule time traces of the substrate alone showed a single FRET state with no transition from this state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>); FRET efficiency histograms generated from multiple single molecules fit to a single Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The conformer of the duplex arms of the substrate was insensitive to variation in the concentration of divalent metal ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), type of metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) or 5’flap length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The flap-labeling scheme was sensitive to variation in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration when the 5’flap length exceeded 6 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This could explain why previous work suggested that a double-flap substrate is a dynamic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craggs et al., 2014</xref>). To test for short-lived alternative conformers, we used confocal-based smFRET to increase the temporal resolution to 5 ms on surface-immobilized DNA and to sub-ms on freely diffusing DNA in solution. Importantly, we found that substrate remained as a single conformer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Potential mean force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that extended DNA (~165°) was the most energetically favorable conformer in DF-6,1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Base stacking at the nick junction and between the 3’flap base and the first base on the 5’flap stabilized this extended conformer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The energetic cost required to bend the DNA up to ~140° was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and similar to that in dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). This was followed by a rapid increase in the energy required to surpass a significant barrier of ~14 kcal/mole to break the base stacking and bend the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data suggest that DF substrate remains in an extended form that must be actively bent.</p><p>In fact, adding FEN1 to DNA NonEQ DF-6,1 in both labeling schemes showed transitions to the bent states in a single step to form a stable FEN1−DNA<sub>bent</sub> complex that rarely dissociated during our 60 s standard acquisition time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We calculated the DNA bending dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic>) from the FRET efficiency histogram-binding isotherm to be 3.9 ± 0.4 nM and 4.6 ± 0.6 nM for NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> and NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This dissociation constant agreed with the nM range of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> from bulk cleavage assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 2009</xref>) and the DNA binding dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d-binding</sub></italic>) of FEN1 and NonEQ DF-6,1 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The change in FRET in both NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> and NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> was confirmed by time-resolved bulk FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p>To mimic the in vivo junction, we used equilibrated (EQ) DF-6,1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). FEN1 actively bent EQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> to a similar extent and similar <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> as DF-NonEQ 6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Nonetheless, time traces showed multiple transitions between bent and unbent states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The reduced stability of the bent conformer in the equilibrated substrate suggests that a bound 3’flap could dissociate from the 3’flap-binding pocket. The dissociated 3’flap in the equilibrated substrate would pair with the template strand before FEN1 could rebind it while in the non-equilibrated substrate it would remain available for rebinding FEN1. Dwell time analysis of the bent (τ<sub>bending</sub>) and unbent (τ<sub>unbending</sub>) states at increasing FEN1 concentrations indicated that the apparent first-order rate constant for DNA bending (<italic>k<sub>bending</sub></italic> = 1/τ<sub>bending</sub>) increased linearly while that for DNA unbending (<italic>k<sub>unbending</sub></italic> = 1/τ<sub>unbending</sub>) remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is the trend expected for a 1:1 binding equilibrium where <italic>k<sub>bending</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>unbending</sub></italic> correspond to the association and dissociation of FEN1, respectively. Notably, the second-order association rate constant (<italic>k<sub>on-bending</sub></italic>) calculated from the slope of the linear fit of the concentration dependence of <italic>k<sub>bending</sub></italic> was diffusion-limited (1.4 ± 0.03×10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), and the average value of <italic>k<sub>unbending</sub></italic> (<italic>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></italic>) was 0.45 ± 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear what caused the much higher <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> reported in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sobhy et al., 2013</xref>), but we suggest that both slower association and faster dissociation rates were influenced. Nonetheless, the FRET states of NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> alone and when bent by FEN1 and the relative comparison of bending the cognate with the noncognate substrates are similar under low and high <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> conditions as shown below.</p><p>To see if active bending of the ss/ds-DNA junction may be a conserved feature in 5’nucleases, we tested human mismatch repair exonuclease 1 (EXO1), which recognizes an ideal junction of either a nick or a 3’ overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orans et al., 2011</xref>). EXO1 actively bent a DNA nick with diffusion-limited <italic>k<sub>on-bending</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>); the donor and acceptor had identical positions to those in NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub>. Free MD simulations showed that the nick behaved similarly to flap substrates for bending angles in the 140°−180° range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The bent conformer of EXO1 had similar FRET to that of FEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), consistent with the structures of their DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FEN1 never misses cleavage of its correct substrate</title><p>To examine active-site assembly with respect to DNA bending, we replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> to simultaneously monitor DNA bending and 5’flap cleavage using the flap-labeling scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Time traces indicated that FEN1 always bent NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> before cleaving the Cy3-containing 5’flap; remarkably every DNA bending event led to a successful cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We confirmed DNA bending before cleavage by the clear anti-correlated change in the donor and acceptor intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Direct comparison of donor fluorescence in the presence of FEN1 and either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions indicated that there is a strong correlation between the loss of donor particles and the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> that coincided with the introduction of FEN1 into the flow cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This confirms that the loss of donor particles is due to 5’flap cleavage and not due to donor photobleaching. Analysis of FRET values before cleavage from individual time traces showed that FEN1 cleaved NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> from a fully bent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and remained bent for 160 ± 7 ms prior to cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). FEN1 cleavage generates two products: 5’flap ssDNA and nicked dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that excess nicked dsDNA but not 5’flap ssDNA influences FEN1 activity, which suggests that only nicked dsDNA is a competitive inhibitor of FEN1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarantino et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we also observed that the lag time before cleavage is not influenced by the presence of excess 5’flap ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, SPR showed only residual transient binding of FEN1 to ssDNA at concentrations that were orders of magnitude above <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> of DF-6,1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Our single-molecule cleavage measurement is not inhibited by lack of 5’flap ssDNA product release. Therefore single-turnover <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> (<italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic>) could be determined directly from the lag time prior to cleavage (<italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> = 1/τ<sub>before cleavage</sub>). However, since 5’flap release would still contribute to the dwell time before cleavage, our single turnover should be treated as an apparent value. Notably, our <italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> (6.3 ± 0.2 s<sup>−1</sup>) was comparable to that determined by bulk cleavage assays (<italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> 12.3 s<sup>−1</sup>−&gt;5 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algasaier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stodola and Burgers, 2016</xref>), with the slight difference explained by the lower reaction temperature in the single molecule assays. The diffusion-limited rates of DNA bending and cleavage before protein dissociation provide direct evidence that the reaction of FEN1 on a cognate substrate is limited by encounters between the enzyme and the substrate.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21884.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cleavage of cognate substrate by FEN1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cleavage of NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub>.

The nick position relative to the donor and acceptor would differ by one base pair if EQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> existed in a SF form compared to that in NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These data therefore suggest that FEN1 actively sculpts the 3’end of its in vivo equilibrated nick junction to create a 3’flap and to drive its ordering. The active DNA bending and its subsequent use to induce protein ordering through active formation of a 3’flap suggest that there is an induced-fit mechanism between FEN1 and DNA that functions in a mutual way.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Substrate verification by 3’flap-induced protein ordering</title><p>The ability of FEN1 to actively create a 3’flap at the nick junction of its equilibrated DF substrate raises the possibility that it could also create a 3’flap at nick junctions of noncognate substrates.

The superfamily semi-conserved R47 in the hydrophobic wedge is poised to mediate this coordination: it stacks against the first base pair on the 3’flap side of the junction while its side chain C-caps the α2 in the gateway and stacks with K128 on α5 in the cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

To test possible threading and its coordination with the 3’flap-induced protein ordering, we used a modification that prevented 5’flap threading. Blocking the threading by immobilizing a DF substrate through a biotin attached at the end of a 30 nt ssDNA 5’flap (termed DF-30,1<sub>blocked-dsDNA</sub>) impaired DNA bending to comparable <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></italic> of SF-6,0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the markedly reduced <italic>K<sub>d-binding</sub></italic> captured by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Notably, the bent DNA in the unthreaded substrate was distorted, but it did not reach the same final FRET state as when the 5’flap was not blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Importantly, our new results indicate that initial DNA bending by FEN1 did not require threading, but that full bending required 5’flaps, if present, to be able to thread. The increased <italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic> of the unthreaded substrate upon removal of its 3’flap (SF-30,0<sub>blocked-dsDNA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) indicates that 3’flap binding did not require 5’flap threading.

They further showed that FEN1 stabilizes the cognate substrate through remarkable selectivity for its key features of a fully paired nick junction, a 3’flap and a 5’flap while promoting the dissociation of noncognate substrates. Our observation of FEN1’s ability to significantly bend the DNA in the blocked-threaded complex challenges our previous conclusion that 5’flap threading is strictly required to induce DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sobhy et al., 2013</xref>).

FEN1 therefore likely has intrinsic mechanisms that block the probable formation of catalytically competent active sites in noncognate substrates to inhibit off-target incision.</p><p>We reasoned that there are two possible mechanisms for controlling incision that can be tested experimentally. The 3’flap-induced protein ordering could act once per DNA bending event, locking the DNA into either a catalytically competent or incompetent conformation. In this mechanism, the <italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> after DNA bending should be similar between cognate and noncognate substrates regardless of whether or not the lifetime of the bent conformer is limiting. Alternatively, the protein could lock the DNA into a bent conformer and go through multiple cycles of disorder-to-order transitioning to search for a catalytically competent conformation of protein and DNA. In this mechanism, the <italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> would be slower for noncognate substrates, particularly under conditions when the lifetime of the bent conformer exceeded that required for cleavage. We found that the <italic>k<sub>STO</sub></italic> of FEN1 in all tested noncognate substrates was similar and comparable to that in the cognate substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicates that the 3’flap-induced protein ordering locked the DNA into either a catalytically competent conformation to be immediately incised or into an incompetent conformation that led to immediate DNA release from the bent conformation. Directly observing FEN1 conformation will lead to further understanding on how it prevents cleavage in noncognate substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Role of active site residues in positioning the 5’flap and junction</title><p>Given that FEN1 actively bends the DNA, it is unclear how FEN1 positions the junction before it locks down the DNA conformation. We therefore tested the role of key active-site residues. Mutating individual gateway residues Y40, K93, R100 or one of the metal-coordinating aspartic acidic residues (D181) to alanine markedly reduced the bent conformer’s stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results revealed a direct role for active-site residues in stabilizing the bent DNA conformer. Interestingly, <italic>k<sub>on-bending</sub></italic> was reduced up to 11 fold in gateway mutants, with R100 and to a lesser extent Y40 being critical residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result is surprising, given that these gateway residues appear to be disordered prior to DNA binding. Thus, active-site residues evidently contribute to active positioning of the junction while the 5’flap is being threaded through the unstructured cap-helical gateway. Moreover, D181A had only a minor effect on <italic>k<sub>on-bending</sub></italic>, implying that the metal ions do not interact with the phosphates during DNA bending and 5’flap threading. Importantly, this could provide a mechanism that protects the 5’flap from nonspecific cleavage.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21884.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Role of active-site residues in active positioning of the 5’flap and the junction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar chart comparing <italic>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></italic> of WT-FEN1 and the FEN1 active-site mutants Y40A, K93A, R100A and D181A on NonEQ DF6,1<sub>Flap</sub>. <italic>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></italic> is calculated as described in 1G.

DNA sculpting: FEN1 actively bend a variety of structures to verify the key features of its cognate DF substrates of fully paired ss/dsDNA nick junction, threaded 5’flap into the cap-helical gateway and 3’flap. Protein ordering: FEN1 actively pulls the 3’end of the nick junction to create a 3’flap and drive protein ordering, which in turn orders the active site and locks the DNA conformation. Decision: the active site and locked DNA conformer are always in catalytically competent form in cognate substrate, while they are primarily in catalytically incompetent form in noncognate substrates (no 5’flap threading, no 3’flap, mispair junctions) and FEN1 mutants (R47A, K93A and R100A). DNA release or catalysis: the DNA will shift or unpair to move the scissile phosphate into the active site for cleavage as probed by the flap/junction positioning-residue Y40, while in noncognate substrates FEN1 promotes DNA dissociation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21884.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21884.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21884-fig6-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig6s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21884.019</object-id><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Sequences of DNA constructs used in this study.</title><p>Schematic of the substrates with internal-labeling and flap-labeling schemes used in this study including their sequences.

Y40 is proposed to play various roles in substrate positioning, including placing FEN1 at the junction, at the 5’flap in the cap-helical gateway and at the scissile phosphate in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algasaier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>).

The mechanisms for these dynamic changes that occur during macromolecular interactions are the subject of intense interest with two major proposed mechanisms, 'induced fit' and 'conformational selection’. Findings so far have suggested that many processes are regulated by conformational change before substrate binding by the substrate’s selective binding to the active form of the enzyme, indicating that functional or conformational selection is in play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). However the high precision required for DNA replication and repair has consistently raised issues of whether or not these might involve unusual mechanisms of chemistry or physics. In this context, how DNA-repair enzymes specifically recognize and remove damage in DNA is a decades-long debate. Does the damage destabilize the DNA duplex leading to disruption of the DNA structure (extrahelical base flipping or DNA bending) before its subsequent capture by the repair enzymes or do these enzymes actively sculpt the DNA as part of their recognition of the damage?</p><p>With the FEN1 single-molecule results, a picture emerges of induced conformational changes to both substrate and protein playing key roles in stabilizing a transition state that has been thoroughly vetted using multiple checks and is poised for catalysis with remarkable specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In this process, FEN1 can differentiate between substrates whose incision is good for the cell (cognate) or toxic (noncognate) even if these substrates have small differences in their binding affinities. Active DNA bending does not create a significant energy barrier as evident by diffusion-limited on-rates in FEN1 and EXO1. We propose that different members of the 5’nuclease family share similar DNA-bending-induced disorder-to-order transitioning but differ in the mechanisms that couple this transitioning with active-site assembly. In FEN1, the coupling of protein transitions of the 3’flap-binding pocket and the 5’flap-binding helical gateway with DNA sculpting uncovers how dynamic protein segments are critical contributors to substrate binding and catalytic selection.</p><p>As part of the active DNA sculpting process, we observed single-molecule measurements consistent with a mutual induced-fit mechanism, with the protein bending the DNA and the bent DNA inducing a protein-conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Substrate distortion by ~90° and DNA-induced conformational changes in proteins are features that extend beyond 5’nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gwon et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). More generally, the FEN1-type induced-fit mechanism may be central to detecting chemically subtle but biologically critical differences between correct and incorrect substrates for multiple DNA and RNA processes. Here, nuclease precision in replication comes from induced fit that regulates the compatibility of the distorted DNA conformer with active-site assembly and its off rate to allow cleavage of cognate but not noncognate substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>The diffusion-limited bending of the cognate substrate by FEN1 and its cleavage from the first encounter represents a practically perfect precision reaction whose rate is limited by diffusion. The stochastic cleavage behavior of noncognate substrates after multiple cycles of DNA bending and dissociation of FEN1 has a fundamental bearing on how enzyme specificity is understood. In cases in which an enzyme encounters noncognate substrates and cleaves them after multiple trials, results on substrate specificity from classical biochemical techniques that monitor product formation become misleading. Furthermore, multiple attempts to cleave noncognate substrates are likely to be insignificant inside the cell. These findings advance our insight into a previously unidentified mechanism in structure-specific nucleases for extreme specificity towards their cognate substrates inside the cell.</p><p>The 3’flap binding pocket is distant from the active site, raising the question why FEN1, along with some other structure-specific nucleases, utilizes long-range DNA-induced conformational coupling, in contrast with local coupling as observed in EXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gwon et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakurai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). FEN1 cleaves 5’flaps containing RNA, DNA or mismatches of various lengths. We anticipate that long-range DNA-induced conformational coupling could provide a mechanism that enhances flexibility in nuclease substrates. The action of 3’flap-induced protein ordering as a key step that locks the FEN1 interaction with the junction could provide the advantage of limiting the sampling time between the disordered protein form and noncognate substrates that could otherwise lead to nonspecific cleavage. This active site control via a long-range induced-fit mechanism suggests why mutations distant from the FEN1 active site have a dramatic effect on genomic stability and disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, evolutionary selection against toxic and mutagenic DNA instability may have developed the unusual DNA-induced conformational coupling seen in FEN1 as a previously unrecognized part of repair and replication nuclease fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Human FEN1 (amino acids: 2–380) was cloned into a pE-SumoPro expression vector (Lifesensors), which encodes an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-Tag followed by SUMO protein.

This generated a transformation matrix file, which was then used in the subsequent analysis of fluorescent molecules to map the donor and acceptor positions. The fluorescent molecules were registered as Gaussian point spread functions (PSF) around the brightest pixel in both channels and aligned with each other using the transformation matrix file. Donor and acceptor intensities were extracted by using software as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holden et al., 2010</xref>) and the apparent FRET efficiency was subsequently calculated.

A water immersion objective (UPLSAPO60XW NA 1.2, Olympus) and an oil immersion objective (UPLSAPO100XO NA 1.4, Olympus) were used for solution-phase smFRET and smFRET on surface-immobilized molecules, respectively. A circularly polarized beam was obtained by inserting a Berek compensator (Mo. no. 5540, Newport) in the excitation beam path. The laser beam was made Gaussian and expanded to fill the back aperture of the objective lens before introducing it into the microscope using a spatial filter with a 30 µm pinhole. The laser beam was reflected off the surface of a longpass dichroic Di02 R532−25 × 36 (Semrock Inc.) into the objective. The excitation power at the sample plane was set to 400Wcm<sup>−2</sup> or 255 Wcm<sup>−2</sup> for solution-phase smFRET or smFRET on surface-immobilized molecules respectively.

The donor and acceptor paths were equipped with a band-pass FF01-580/60-25-D (Semrock Inc.) and a longpass LP02-664RU-25 filter (Semrock Inc.), respectively, before being focused onto single-photon avalanche diodes (τSPAD, PicoQuant). Fluorescence intensity trajectories were recorded by a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module (HydraHarp 400, PicoQuant) in the time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) mode, which allowed for recording the arrival time of each photon emitted by the fluorophores. The SymPhoTime software (PicoQuant) was used for the data acquisition as well as for controlling the excitation lasers and TCSPC module.</p><p>The solution-phase smFRET experiments were performed in a home-made flow-through chamber by sandwiching a paraffin film spacer (0.13 mm thick, Bemis Inc.) between two glass coverslips.

Samples were prepared by mixing imaging buffer with appropriate dilutions of the stock enzyme and stock DNA solutions. The solution was allowed to flow onto the flow cell by pipetting the solution into one side of the chamber while applying suction to the opposite end. Then, the flow cell was placed on the microscope. In all solution-phase smFRET experiments, the reaction buffer was used with the addition of 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM Trolox. In the solution-phase smFRET experiments, the excitation laser was focused approximately 40 µm above the surface of the bottom cover slip. The fluorescence intensity trajectories on the donor and acceptor channels were recorded for 15 min to obtain between 3500–8000 bursts from individual DNA molecules. SymPhoTime script was used to analyze the bursts and generate burst histograms. The intensity trajectories were first binned to 0.5 ms, and bursts above 35 total counts were considered for the analysis. The FRET efficiency was calculated by the integrated intensity of each burst in the donor and acceptor channels. OriginPro was used to fit the histograms of the FRET efficiency to Gaussian peaks.</p><p>The smFRET experiments on surface-immobilized molecules were performed using either the microfluidic flow chamber used in the TIRF-based FRET experiments or pre-made sticky-Slide VI<sup>0</sup>.4 microfluidic chambers (ibidi GmbH), with cover slips identical to those used in the TIRF-based FRET experiments. The DNA substrates were immobilized on the glass cover slips according to the procedures described above. The smFRET experiments were performed in the presence of the oxygen scavenger and the triplet quencher used in the TIRF-based FRET experiments. The excitation laser was focused on the surface of the cover slip using back reflection. Fluorescence intensity trajectories of individual molecules were acquired by first scanning a 10 × 10 µm section of the coverslip using a scanning piezo stage. Then, individual molecules were manually chosen from the image and the trajectories were sequentially acquired, with the laser focus dwelling on each point for 10 s. The SymPhoTime software was used for the image acquisition and stage positioning.</p><p>Once fluorescence intensity trajectories were acquired, SymPhoTime was used to generate traces by binning the data to either 2, 5 or 10 ms and then exporting the donor and acceptor counts.

Then, the FRET efficiency trace was calculated using the intensity trajectories of the donor and acceptor, and the histograms of the FRET efficiency were generated from the selected regions of the traces. Aberrant traces were excluded for further analysis. The selected regions were exported by the MATLAB script into files readable by HaMMy, a software used for analysis of single-molecule FRET trajectories using hidden Markov modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinney et al., 2006</xref>). The FRET trajectories were analyzed by a two-state model using HaMMy. Another custom-written MATLAB script was then used to collate the results from HaMMy and generate lists of dwell times for low FRET (that is, bent) and high FRET (that is, unbent) states.

In all other cleavage experiments, imaging started after the protein had reached the microfluidic chamber but before it reached the focal volume. This delay in acquisition was to reduce particle loss due to acceptor photobleaching since the waiting time before cleavage markedly increased under these suboptimal conditions. Selective loss of the donor signal was confirmed by direct excitation of the acceptor at the end of the cleavage experiment.</p><p>Due to short lag time before cleavage, manual counting of frames in the bent state was used to calculate the cleavage dwell time for each trace. All particles in the field of view were grouped into the following five different categories as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>. (a) Molecules with aberrant intensity that suffered from strong noise, photoblinking, step bleaching or deviation from the average intensity. These particles were excluded from further analysis. (b) Molecules that had acceptor photobleaching before the loss of the donor signal. These molecules do not influence dwell time analysis, which depends only on the donor signal. They were therefore excluded. (c) Molecules that went to the low FRET bent state followed by a single-step loss in the donor signal. This formed the bulk of the traces of cognate substrates. (d) Molecules that lost their donor signal without going into the low FRET bent state. This excluded minority population could result from donor photobleaching events and/or 5’flap cleavage that occurs at a faster rate than the acquisition time. (e) Molecules that stayed in the unbent high-FRET state within our imaging time. These molecules were also excluded from the cleavage analysis as they exhibit no FEN1 binding. The following criteria were used to perform dwell time analysis for the selected particles. (a) A minimum FRET change of 0.2 between unbent and bent frames was applied as a filtering criterion before selecting traces for dwell time analysis. (b) Each selected trace was checked for anti-correlated behavior between the donor and acceptor upon change in the FRET efficiency. (c) With noncognate substrates, the dwell time was calculated by counting the number of frames spent in the lower FRET state before the donor signal was lost in the last bent step. MATLAB was used to calculate the mean of the cleavage dwell time by fitting with gamma distribution function and the error in the mean by bootstrap. In the viscosity measurement, a falling balls viscometer (Gilmont) was used to calculate the absolute viscosity. The density of the solution was measured from the mass of 1 ml of the same solution as used to calculate the viscosity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Time-resolved bulk FRET measurements</title><p>The measurements were performed on a QuantaMaster 800 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International Inc.) coupled with a supercontinuum fiber laser source. The fluorophore lifetime was determined by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method. The excitation was carried out at 535 nm and emission was collected at 568 nm using 5 nm bandwidths for the excitation and emission. A longpass filter with 550 nm cut-on was placed on the emission side to prevent scattered light. The instrument response function (IRF) was determined using a colloidal silica suspension. The decay time traces were acquired at 10,000 counts. The measurements were performed at room temperature using the same 5’ flap constructs and buffer composition as in the smFRET experiments. The determination of the lifetimes was done using IRF reconvolution and a multi-exponential decay function incorporated in the FluoFit software package (PicoQuant). The donor lifetime curve was fitted to two-exponential decay. The best fit was selected based on reduced chi-square and randomness of the residuals.</p><p>The FRET efficiency, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, refers to the conformational change resulting from the action of the enzyme on the substrate. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is calculated from the measured lifetime of the donor in the donor-only and donor-acceptor substrates at the respective enzyme concentration using the following Equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mtext>and</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are the amplitude-weighted average lifetimes of the donor excited-state in the donor-only and donor-acceptor substrates in the presence of the enzyme, respectively.<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>The dissociation bending constant (<italic>K<sub>d-bending</sub></italic>) was calculated by fitting the data to a standard quadratic equation for simple bimolecular association (S+F ⇌ SF) under equilibrium conditions:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>E</italic> is the FRET value at any protein concentration, <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>E</italic><sub>f</sub> are the initial and final FRET values, and S and F represent the substrate and FEN1 concentrations, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding</title><p>SPR binding was performed on a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare Inc.). Biotinylated DNA substrates were immobilized on S-series streptavidin sensor chips in HBS-EP buffer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The response unit (RU) of the immobilized substrate is stated in the figure legends. FEN1 was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against the smFRET reaction buffer containing CaCl<sub>2</sub> (no oxygen-scavenging solution was added). Serial dilutions of FEN1 were made using the same reaction buffer. For each concentration, the run started with a surface-regeneration injection of reaction buffer +1 M NaCl at a flow rate of 100 µL/min for 120 s, followed by protein sample injection at a flow rate of 20 µL/s for 90 s for DF-6,1 or 20 µL/s for 120 s for the other substrates. The sensorgrams were corrected for bulk refractive index and residual nonspecific binding to the surface using a blank flow cell. The sensorgrams were processed using Biacore T100 Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare Inc.).

Each reaction mixture was incubated further at 37°C and equal aliquots were removed and quenched by equal volumes of 2X denaturing buffer (90% deionized formamide, 100 mM EDTA) at the following time intervals (0, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10 mins).

In total, four substrate DNA models (denoted NonEQ DF-6,1, SF-6,0, EQ DF-6,1 and nicked DNA) were generated. A dsDNA 47-mer with sequence d(5’-TGACCGTTGTTTGACGGTCGTGAGGAGGAAAGTTCCTCCTACGGCAG-3’)•d’(5’-CTGCCGTAGGAGGAACTTTCCTCC<bold>T(25</bold>)<bold>C</bold>(<bold>26</bold>)<bold>A</bold>(<bold>27</bold>)CGACCGTCAAACAACGGTCA-3’), identical to the one used in the smFRET experiments, was first constructed in a canonical B-DNA conformation with the UCSF CHIMERA program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The model NonEQ DF-6,1 was built by adding 5’ ssDNA flap (5’-TTTTTA-3’) and a single-nucleotide 3’ flap (G-3’) at the junction of the two DNA duplexes (between bases C26 and T25). The SF-6,0 and EQ DF-6,1 models were constructed by adding 5’ flap ssDNA (5’-TTTTA-3’) at base C26 and 5’ flap ssDNA (5’-TTTTAC-3’) at base A27, respectively. Each system was solvated with TIP3P water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen and Jenson, 1998</xref>) with a minimum distance of 15.0 Å from the DNA to the edge of the periodic simulation box. The systems were then neutralized by the addition of Na<sup>+</sup> counterions. Additionally, 100 mM NaCl concentration was introduced to mimic physiological conditions. First, the water and ions were subjected to 3000 steps of steepest descent and 1500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization while restraining all DNA atoms with a force constant of 2 kcal/mol Å<sup>2</sup>. All restraints were then released. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) was used to treat the long-range electrostatic interactions. The cutoff for non-bonded interactions was set to 10 Å. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm. We imposed a 1-fs simulation time step during equilibration. The temperature of the simulated systems was then gradually increased to 300 K over 50 ps in the NVT ensemble. Subsequently, equilibration dynamics was carried out in the NPT ensemble (p=1 atm and T = 300 K) for an additional 50 ns. Then, 800-ns production runs were carried out for each simulation system in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (p=1 atm and T = 300 K). We utilized hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) as a method to increase the simulation time step to 4 fs during the production runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>). The substrate-bending angle for each system was defined and computed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>. Data were analyzed with the CPPTRAJ code in AMBER15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2015</xref>) and TCL scripts in VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The effective free-energy profile (potential of mean force; PMF) for bending the NonEQ DF-6,1 DNA substrate was estimated using the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hénin et al., 2010</xref>) with the COLVARS module of NAMD 2.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). ABF is a widely used enhanced sampling approach, which computes average forces along a predefined reaction coordinate (RC) and then applies an adaptive biasing potential to flatten the underlying free energy landscape. As a result, all points along the RC can be sampled efficiently. In our case, the RC was defined as the bending angle between the two-dsDNA fragments of the substrate. The exact definitions of the two vectors and the fragments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>.</p><p>First, we carried out a 20-ns targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schlitter et al., 1994</xref>), with a force constant of 100 kcal/mol Å<sup>2</sup> applied to all nucleic acid heavy atoms. This simulation transformed the DNA from a straight conformation (bending angle of ~180°) to the bent conformation observed in the FEN1/DNA complex (bending angle of ~90°). The target configuration of the bent DNA was directly taken from the FEN1/DNA X-ray structure 3Q8L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</xref>). In the ABF simulations, the reaction coordinate was segmented into nine discrete windows with a confining wall potential (<italic>k</italic> = 50 kcal/mol) placed at the boundaries. Snapshots collected from the TMD trajectory were used to seed the ABF windows. Each window was further subdivided into small 0.2<sup>0</sup> bins. Force averages were then accumulated into the bins and continuously updated in the course of the ABF simulation. Cancellation of the averaged forces through the gradual introduction of an adaptive bias led to enhanced sampling and overcoming of energy barriers along the RC. Since the instantaneous forces may fluctuate considerably, the application the adaptive bias was delayed until an adequate number of force samples was collected (2000 samples). PMF reconstruction was then accomplished by integration of the averaged forces from the bins.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vlad-Stefan Raducanu for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present paper uses single-molecule FRET methods, complemented by other ensemble-averaging biophysical approaches, to understand how the flap endonuclease FEN1 interacts with its substrate. In particular, the authors focus on the classical question of induced fit or conformational selection as the two main models that describe recognition of a substrate and productive interaction with it. A series of elegant single-molecule experiments are described that provide great detail of the kinetic steps underlying flap cleavage with a number of different cognate and noncognate substrates. The main conclusion is that both protein and DNA undergo conformational changes upon binding to ensure great selectivity and specificity in enzymatic activity. The work is comprehensive and detailed, and other complementary tools such as MD simulations, ensemble time resolved FRET, biochemical cleavage assays and surface plasmon resonance are employed to support their findings and interpretations. The results are intriguing and the findings are very relevant to the field, specifically for the area of DNA replication/ repair and for the broader area of enzymology. However, a number of important arguments and conclusions in the manuscript are not backed up by the data shown. Discrimination between the different models and scenarios requires high accuracy in the quantitative determination of FRET levels, transition rates etc. While the numbers in the manuscript seem to make sense, the underlying raw data, distributions, and analyses to arrive at these numbers are either not shown or not adequately explained. Before a decision can be made regarding publication, a revised manuscript should submitted that addresses the following comments:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– A major disagreement exists between the present manuscript and one of the authors' previous reports (Sobhy et al., Cell Reports 2013). Here, human FEN1 binds with about 5 nM Kd to various DNA substrates whereas in the previous work, the Kd was about 50 times higher. In addition, k-bending/binding is diffusion limited here, whereas in the previous work it is orders of magnitude lower. This discrepancy needs to be resolved.</p><p>– Along these lines, the authors claim in the previous work that, &quot;we find a multistep mechanism that verifies all substrate features before inducing the intermediary-DNA bending step that is believed to unify 5' nuclease mechanisms. This is achieved by coordinating threading of the 5' flap of a nick junction into the conserved capped-helical gateway, overseeing the active site, and bending by binding at the base of the junction.&quot; These statements, if they are true, certainly steal some thunder from the current manuscript; however, in the absence of discussion of the previous results here, it is unclear whether or not the authors chose to disregard their previously published study because it was incorrectly performed. This issue needs resolution. In addition, the authors should cite a related single molecule FRET study of FEN1 by the Penedo lab published in Nucleic Acids Research 2014.</p><p>– Many of the critical arguments in the manuscript are based on the authors' ability to very precisely construct the distributions of times elapsed between bending and cutting. From the description in the manuscript it is not clear how this experimentally is exactly done. The authors need to clarify how they determine the exact moment of bending, and whether they exclude certain molecules based on the properties in their FRET traces.</p><p>– It is stated that the fraction of binding/bending events that result in cleavage is 100%. Please provide supporting data/statistics are provided to bolster this claim.</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, the authors analyze the delay time between FRET decrease (bending) and disappearance of donor signal (flap cutting). How do they know the disappearance of donor signal is not caused by donor bleaching? The authors should provide experimental evidence to exclude this scenario.</p><p>– For non-optimal substrates, cleavage and product release is still observed, but only after many rounds of nonproductive binding/bending events. The authors treat the final binding event differently from the earlier binding events but why? A strong possibility is that each binding event can lead to cleavage but with a lower rate than in the case of optimal substrates. How is this possibility excluded? If it can be shown that the dwell time distribution of the final binding event is quantitatively different from the dwell time distributions of the earlier binding events, perhaps the current interpretation can be favored. Otherwise, the interpretation and with the last paragraph in subsection “FEN1 avoids off-target DNA cleavage in the DNA lockdown step” is suspect.</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors show a rise-and-decay distribution of the times elapsed between bending and cutting. It is argued that this distribution is caused by the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps, including a disorder-order transition and cleavage chemistry. An important property of rise-and-decay distributions is that they only arise if the underlying steps are roughly equally rate limiting. In a subsequent, elegant experiment, the authors slow down the disorder-order transitions by a factor of 3-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result provides a strong prediction; namely, that the rise-and-decay distribution should now collapse into a distribution that is entirely determined by the disorder-order transition as the rate-limiting step. However, when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, a rise-and-decay distribution is seen with an even larger number of rate-limiting steps. This disconnect needs to be resolved.</p><p>– The argument for mutual induced fit is very speculative. Protein conformational changes are not measured directly and any conformational change inferred does not seem well supported by the data. It is strongly recommend that these claims be removed.</p><p>– The conclusions drawn based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> rely on the authors' ability to reliably distinguish fairly similar FRET levels. It is described how the confocal FRET data was analyzed to do so, but the data aren't actually shown. Given the high level of confidence needed to believe the accuracy of the FRET values, it is critical that the authors to show these data, the observed variation within the sets of three experimental replicates, and the fitting of the data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single-molecule FRET unveils induced-fit mechanism for substrate selectivity in flap endonuclease 1&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but some of the comments seem to have been misunderstood and as a result, their revision in response did not adequately answered the questions. These few remaining issues (outlined below) need to be addressed before acceptance:</p><p>1) &quot;For non-optimal substrates, cleavage and product release is still observed but after many rounds of nonproductive binding/bending events. The authors treat the final binding event differently from the earlier binding events but why? A strong possibility is that each binding event can lead to cleavage but with a lower rate than in the case of optical substrates. How do they exclude this possibility? If they can show that the dwell time distribution of the final binding event is quantitatively different from the dwell time distributions of the earlier binding events, perhaps their current interpretation can be favored.&quot;</p><p>In response to this comment, the authors compared the lifetimes of the bound state in the presence of calcium with the lifetime of the final bound state before cleavage. However, such a comparison does not address the issue at hand, because one cannot rule out the possibility that having calcium instead of magnesium may change the kinetics on non-optimal substrates. Because the non-optimal substrates show multiple binding events (1, 2,.…, n-1) before the nth binding event results in cleavage, they should build the histogram of dwell times of prior binding events and compare it to the dwell time histogram of the final event. Only if the two are substantially different, would this conclusion be supported.</p><p>2) &quot;– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors show a rise-and-decay distribution of the times elapsed between bending and cutting. It is argued that this distribution is caused by the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps, including a disorder-order transition and cleavage chemistry. An important property of rise-and-decay distributions is that they only arise if the underlying steps are roughly equally rate limiting. In a subsequent, elegant experiment, the authors slow down the disorder-order transitions by a factor of 3-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result provides a strong prediction; namely, that the rise-and-decay distribution should now collapse into a distribution that is entirely determined by the disorder-order transition as the rate-limiting step. However, when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, a rise-and-decay distribution is seen with an even larger number of rate-limiting steps. This disconnect needs to be resolved.&quot;</p><p>Again, the authors seem to have misunderstood the comment. At least one of the statements in the original manuscript is wrong, but which one has not been identified.</p><p>3) &quot;– The data analysis seems to assume that productive release occurs instantaneously because the dwell time between initial bending and fluorescence disappearance is interpreted as a reaction time. Please provide justification for this supposition.&quot;</p><p>This is essentially a non-answer because the disappearance of ssDNA flap is defined as cleavage (&quot;the ssDNA flap has no interaction with FEN1, whose disappearance is defined as cleavage in our assay&quot;). Of course, with such a definition, product release is simultaneous with cleavage. However, cleavage should really relate to the chemical reaction of backbone scission; there is no a priori reason to believe that the cleavage product should be released instantaneously. This issue still needs to be addressed.</p><p>4) Regarding the observation that upon addition of viscogen, the dwell-time distribution remains a rise and decay (which implies that multiple rate-limiting steps continue to exist), it is stated that the presence of visogen itself would introduce a more complicated free-energy landscape that would result in additional rate-limiting steps. While this is possible in principle, it is not clear that the width of the dwell-time distribution necessarily is caused by diffusion. This statement should be clarified or omitted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21884.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>– A major disagreement exists between the present manuscript and one of the authors' previous reports (Sobhy et al., Cell Reports 2013).

We are unclear as to why K<sub>d-bending</sub> was high in our previous study (Sobhy et al., Cell Reports 2013), but we suspect that it might have resulted from a faulty preparation of the oxygen scavenging system. Here we also optimized the purification of the native FEN1 by using cleavable SUMO-fusion tag. Both slower association and faster dissociation rates contributed to the higher K<sub>d-bending</sub> as pointed out by the reviewers. Nonetheless, the FRET values of the unbent and bent states in the flap- labeling scheme, the only labeling scheme used in Sobhy et al., and the relative comparison of bending cognate and noncognate substrates remain valid findings as confirmed by the current study under optimal K<sub>d-bending</sub>. In the revised manuscript we added the following paragraph to address this point.</p><p>“It is unclear what caused the much higher K<sub>d-bending</sub> reported in our earlier work (Sobhy et al., 2013), but we suggest that both slower association and faster dissociation rates were influences.

We apologize for the too brief explanation linking the current findings with those from Sobhy’s et al. This is now addressed in what we hope is suitable detail in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Sobhy et al. used the flap-labeling scheme to address the relationship between 5’flap threading into the cap-helical gateway and DNA bending. This labeling scheme showed that blocking 5’flap threading by introducing biotin/streptavidin moiety on the 5’flap resulted in minor change in FRET compare to that when threading was allowed. Indeed this experiment is reproducible under optimal K<sub>d-bending</sub> (data not shown). Sobhy et al. therefore proposed that 5’flap threading is strictly required for inducing DNA bending and consequently that DNA bending occurs at the conclusion of substrate recognition; the paragraph that is highlighted by the reviewers. In the current study, we relied on the internal-labeling scheme that directly reports on the geometry of the duplex DNA. This labeling scheme led to a different result, showing significant distortion of the duplex DNA when the 5’flap threading process was blocked. However, this distortion was still less than that observed when 5’flap threading was allowed. We also found that altering residues in the gateway decreased the on rate of DNA bending. Although these new results also suggest that 5’flap threading is required for proper distortion of the DNA, as originally proposed by Sobhy et al., the significant DNA bending reported in the current study made it difficult to conclusively rule out the possibilities that FEN1 might be threading the 5’flap after it significantly bends the DNA or while it bends the DNA. These results advance our knowledge on the relationship between 5’flap threading and DNA bending but they also highlight the complexity in understanding the exact timing mechanism of 5’flap threading relative to DNA bending. In the current study, we also performed kinetic analysis of on- and off-rates on non-cognate substrates, combined with high temporal resolution FRET measurements, and showed that FEN1 was able to bend both cognate and noncognate substrates but displayed remarkable selectivity to stabilize the bent conformer for cognate substrate. These results together with the significant distortion of the DNA upon blocking 5’flap threading are more consistent with a model that FEN1 bends the DNA and uses it to interrogate the features of the substrate. In the revised manuscript, we added discussion linking the findings on 5’flap recognition from the flap-labeling scheme in Sobhy et al. with the internal-labeling scheme in the current study. We also added the following conclusion paragraph that comments on the proposed models in both studies.</p><p>“Collectively these results demonstrate that FEN1 bends both cognate and noncognate substrates and that K<sub>d-bending</sub> is higher for noncognate substrates. This is consistent with our previous findings under high K<sub>d-bending</sub> conditions (Sobhy et al., 2013). They further showed that FEN1 stabilizes the cognate substrate through remarkable selectivity for its key features of a fully paired nick junction, a 3’flap and a 5’flap while promoting the dissociation of noncognate substrates. Our observation of FEN1’s ability to significantly bend the DNA in the blocked-threaded complex challenges our previous conclusion that 5’flap threading is strictly required to induce DNA bending (Sobhy et al., 2013). Our new results are consistent with a model in which FEN1 actively bends DNA to interact with the ss/ds-DNA junctions and subsequently verifies these interactions by the 3’flap-induced protein ordering.”</p><p>The reviewers appropriately requested that we reference the work of Cragg et al. (NAR 2014). This study proposed that double flap substrate alternates between bent and unbent states. We believe that relying on the flap-labeling scheme is the reason why Cragg et al. proposed that double flap substrate is a dynamic structure. We found that this dynamic nature is a result of local variation in the geometry of the 5’flap rather than altering the conformation of the duplex DNA when the 5’flap length exceeds 6 nt.</p><p>Reproduction of Cragg et al. experiments and their discussion were provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we added the following statement in the main text to address this point.</p><p>“The flap-labeling scheme was sensitive to variation in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration when the 5’flap length exceeded 6 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This could explain why previous work suggested that a double-flap substrate is dynamic structure (Craggs et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>– Many of the critical arguments in the manuscript are based on the authors' ability to very precisely construct the distributions of times elapsed between bending and cutting.

The authors need to clarify how they determine the exact moment of bending, and whether they exclude certain molecules based on the properties in their FRET traces.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s expert insights on these points. In the revised manuscript, we provide a more detailed description on the assignment of cleavage events and their analysis in the Methods section. We also provide an extra detailed analysis of all particles in the entire field of view for both cognate and non-cognate substrates in a new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B,E</xref>. These analyses now demonstrate quantitatively our ability to assign the 5’flap cleavage event.</p><p><italic>– It is stated that the fraction of binding/bending events that result in cleavage is 100%. Please provide supporting data/statistics are provided to bolster this claim.</italic> </p><p>We didn’t intend to make that claim, and we regret this misunderstanding. What we meant is that in the case of cognate substrate, all the effective particles judged to have been cleaved based on the criteria described in detail in the Methods section in the revised manuscript and shown in the new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> are cleaved on first bending step. We trust that the new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> and the detailed description of data analysis in the Methods section will remove this confusion on our part in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, the authors analyze the delay time between FRET decrease (bending) and disappearance of donor signal (flap cutting). How do they know the disappearance of donor signal is not caused by donor bleaching? The authors should provide experimental evidence to exclude this scenario.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for making this point. In the revised manuscript, we performed detailed analysis of the control experiments that compare Cy3 loss under condition where FEN1 bends the cognate DNA without cleaving it (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions) or bend it and cleave it (Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions) to show that Cy3 signal loss is due to cleavage; new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>. The Cy3 signal loss under Ca<sup>2+</sup> was ~20% while the signal loss under Mg<sup>2+</sup> was ~80%. Similar results were found for the non-cognate substrate as shown in new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>.</p><p>We further analyzed the time dependent signal loss of Cy3 in cognate substrate in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> as shown in new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>. In presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the number of Cy3 lost was slow and saturated around 20%.</p><p>While in case of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, there is an abrupt change in the rate of signal loss at around 6 s that coincides with the arrival of FEN1 to the flow cell.</p><p>Taken together these analysis show that Cy3 signal loss is mostly observed due to cleavage and not photo-bleaching.</p><p><italic>– For non-optimal substrates, cleavage and product release is still observed, but only after many rounds of nonproductive binding/bending events. The authors treat the final binding event differently from the earlier binding events but why? A strong possibility is that each binding event can lead to cleavage but with a lower rate than in the case of optimal substrates. How is this possibility excluded? If it can be shown that the dwell time distribution of the final binding event is quantitatively different from the dwell time distributions of the earlier binding events, perhaps the current interpretation can be favored. Otherwise, the interpretation and with the last paragraph in subsection “FEN1 avoids off-target DNA cleavage in the DNA lockdown step” is suspect.</italic> </p><p>The lifetimes of the bent conformer in non-cognate substrates were determined in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Indeed, these lifetimes were significantly different than that observed for the last bending step before cleavage in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, either longer or shorter. This difference served as the base for our interpretation of how FEN1 avoids the cleavage of non-cognate substrates.</p><p>Briefly, the relationship between the lifetime of the bent conformer in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the dwell time of the last bent state before cleavage in presence of Mg2 can be categorized into two behaviors. In one group, the lifetime was rate limiting and therefore not supporting the time required for catalysis. In the second it was 3-4 folds longer than the time required for catalysis. If every abortive bending event represents a step where catalysis proceeds at slower rates, then the anticipation would be that the lag time in the last DNA bending event that led to cleavage would be longer in both categories than cognate substrate, particularly in the second category where the life time of the bent conformer is significantly longer that required for catalysis. What we observed is that the lag times before cleavage were different than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and was quantitatively similar in both cognate and non-cognate substrates. A scenario where catalysis proceeds at slower rate is shown in the case of the active site mutant FEN1-Y40A where the lag time before cleavage was 3 times longer than that in cognate and non-cognate substrates.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors show a rise-and-decay distribution of the times elapsed between bending and cutting. It is argued that this distribution is caused by the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps, including a disorder-order transition and cleavage chemistry. An important property of rise-and-decay distributions is that they only arise if the underlying steps are roughly equally rate limiting. In a subsequent, elegant experiment, the authors slow down the disorder-order transitions by a factor of 3-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result provides a strong prediction; namely, that the rise-and-decay distribution should now collapse into a distribution that is entirely determined by the disorder-order transition as the rate-limiting step. However, when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, a rise-and-decay distribution is seen with an even larger number of rate-limiting steps. This disconnect needs to be resolved.</italic> </p><p>Here we clarify our logic. If we assume that the distribution of the lag time should reflect the rate-limiting 3’flap-induced conformational changes step, it is still possible that the underlying distribution of conformational changes upon addition of viscogen may become a more complex distribution in itself. This can be understood from a simple diffusion model where the rate of folding is inversely proportional to the solution viscosity. Assuming that without viscogen, the conformational change was distributed exponentially, it can be argued that upon addition of viscogen, the conformational changes would assume multi-exponential behavior due to different degree of friction provided to different residues in the protein by the viscogen and thus showing apparent multi-exponential steps in the dwell times of cleavage. In fact, if we plot the standard deviation of the dwell time vs viscosity, we found a near linear relationship (a new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as would be predicted by a simple diffusion model. In simple terms this could imply that when adding viscogen, the energy bounds of folding get larger causing the distribution of individual rates of protein folding to show a greater standard distribution among themselves. In the revised manuscript, we discussed the rise and decay distribution of dwell times in the presence of viscogen as follow:</p><p>“The shape of the histograms in the presence of viscogen however remains rise and decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the 3’flap-induced protein ordering is likely to involve multistep processes that are being slowed down by the presence of viscogen. In fact, the standard deviation of kSTO was almost linearly proportional to the viscosity as would be predicted by a simple diffusion where different protein regions experience different friction upon increasing viscogen concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).”</p><p><italic>– The argument for mutual induced fit is very speculative. Protein conformational changes are not measured directly and any conformational change inferred does not seem well supported by the data. It is strongly recommend that these claims be removed.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this thoughtful recommendation. In the revised manuscript, we have revisited our arguments about mutual induced fit and used instead induced fit only. We agree with the reviewer that we are not sensitive to protein conformational changes. We are sensitive however to the pulling of 1 nt 3’ flap, which from previous structural studies is established to induce the conformational changes in the protein. In the revised manuscript, we also clarified in a suggestive way why we think that the induce- fit relationship between FEN1 and DNA is of a mutual nature by relying on the argument that 3’flap is being actively pulled after DNA bending.</p><p><italic>– The conclusions drawn based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> rely on the authors' ability to reliably distinguish fairly similar FRET levels. It is described how the confocal FRET data was analyzed to do so, but the data aren't actually shown. Given the high level of confidence needed to believe the accuracy of the FRET values, it is critical that the authors to show these data, the observed variation within the sets of three experimental replicates, and the fitting of the data.</italic> </p><p>This is a key point that we are pleased to improve. We have added a new supplementary figure to show all the histograms pertaining to the figure in a new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In fact we repeated all the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in order to add one more control experiment showing no effect of FEN1 on dsDNA. This resulted in minor changes in all of the original FRET readings due the slight differences in the laser alignment conditions of the confocal microscope. As can be seen in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the readings are extremely consistent among themselves and with those in the originally submitted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and have very low standard deviation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but some of the comments seem to have been misunderstood and as a result, their revision in response did not adequately answered the questions.

We compared dwell time of missed events in presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in all noncognate substrates as well as the FEN1 mutants Y40A and R47A and found them to be similar to Ca<sup>2+</sup> data. These new data are provided in a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> (panel F).

As the reviewers pointed out, when the rate constant of one of the steps (e.g. conformational change) decreases while others remain constant, that step acts as the ratelimiting step and the histogram should exhibit a single-exponential decaying profile. When this step slows down, the mean dwell time should become longer and this indeed what we observed experimentally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The standard deviations in the absence or presence of different glycerol concentrations were in the range of 60-70% of their mean, suggesting that the shape of the histograms is similar and that the number of rate limiting steps did not increase in presence of viscogen. This similarity in the rise and decay fits can be visually seen should we bin our data according to some optimal binning rule like Scott’s rule. However, we have decided to present them at the experimental temporal resolution since it reflects the closest representation of the raw data.</p><p>The reviewers are therefore correct that there are still multiple rate-limiting steps contributing to the cleavage reaction. One possibility is that there are multiple distinct steps of conformational changes in this reaction that will slow down when the viscosity of the solution increases. This includes the 3’flap-induced protein ordering that in itself could be multiple steps and potentially subsequent conformational changes that are required to unpair the DNA and shift it into the active site. If this is the case, all the steps will slow down when the viscosity of the solution increases, and therefore, overall reaction rate will decrease while the rise-and-decay shape of the histogram will remain the same. We therefore believe the statement in the original manuscript that 3’flap-induced protein ordering is the probable rate-limiting step is incorrect. In the revised manuscript we corrected this statement and also commented on the shape of the histograms as pointed out by the reviewers. The paragraph now reads as follows: “The shape of the histograms in the presence of viscogen however remains a rise and decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in contrast to the prediction of collapsing into a single exponential decay should protein-ordering act in a single rate-limiting step. This suggests that the 3’flap-induced protein ordering likely involves multistep processes that are being slowed by the presence of viscogen and/or these multisteps control different rate-limiting steps during catalysis such as DNA unpairing and/or DNA shifting into the active site.”</p><p><italic>3) &quot;– The data analysis seems to assume that productive release occurs instantaneously because the dwell time between initial bending and fluorescence disappearance is interpreted as a reaction time. Please provide justification for this supposition.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>This is essentially a non-answer because the disappearance of ssDNA flap is defined as cleavage (&quot;the ssDNA flap has no interaction with FEN1, whose disappearance is defined as cleavage in our assay&quot;). Of course, with such a definition, product release is simultaneous with cleavage. However, cleavage should really relate to the chemical reaction of backbone scission; there is no a priori reason to believe that the cleavage product should be released instantaneously. This issue still needs to be addressed.</italic> </p><p>Our definition of cleavage, and the conventional one used in literature, is from the moment FEN1 binds the DNA, the complex undergoes all the necessary conformational changes, the incision takes place and the 5’flap departs the complex. We provided evidences that are supported by previous literature that 5’flap release is not a limiting step, but certainly that doesn’t mean it is not contributing to the dwell time that we refer to as a single turnover. However, the strongest evidence for our proposition that majority of the dwell time before cleavage corresponds to catalysis rather than 5’flap release is that our single turnover is similar to those from bulk cleavage assays that are not sensitive to 5’flap release in case of cognate substrate. To remove any potential confusion in the definition of single turnover, we added the following statement in our revised manuscript: “However, since 5’flap release would still contribute to the dwell time before cleavage, our single turnover should be treated as an apparent value.”</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the observation that upon addition of viscogen, the dwell-time distribution remains a rise and decay (which implies that multiple rate-limiting steps continue to exist), it is stated that the presence of visogen itself would introduce a more complicated free-energy landscape that would result in additional rate-limiting steps. While this is possible in principle, it is not clear that the width of the dwell-time distribution necessarily is caused by diffusion. This statement should be clarified or omitted.</italic></p><p>We have omitted this statement from the revised manuscript as suggested and also the associated figure panel for clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
