In primates, considerable evidence accumulated in the past 15 years indicates that these operations involve the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In humans, OFC neurodegeneration or dysfunction is associated with abnormal decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fellows, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hodges, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rahman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waltz and Gold, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, neural signals recorded in OFC during choices correlate with subjective values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arana et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gottfried et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howard and Kahnt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klein-Flügge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters and Büchel, 2009</xref>). In non-human primates, neurons in OFC appear intimately involved with the decision process. One series of studies examined head-fixed monkeys choosing between different juices. Relative values were inferred from choices and used to interpret neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Different groups of cells in OFC were found to encode the value of individual goods (<italic>offer value</italic>), the binary choice outcome (<italic>chosen juice</italic>) and the <italic>chosen value</italic>. These variables capture both the input (<italic>offer value</italic>) and the output (<italic>chosen juice</italic>, <italic>chosen value</italic>) of the choice process, suggesting that the groups of neurons identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Supporting this hypothesis, trial-by-trial fluctuation in neuronal activity correlates with choice variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>), the activity dynamics of neuronal populations in OFC reflects an internal deliberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>), and suitable electrical stimulation of OFC biases or disrupts economic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). Complementing these empirical findings, computational work showed that neural networks whose units resemble the groups of cells identified in OFC can generate binary choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedrich and Lengyel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solway and Botvinick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In summary, primate studies consistently implicate the OFC in the generation of economic decisions.</p><p>In comparison, the picture emerging from research in rodents is more heterogenous. Anatomically, the primate OFC (areas 13/11) appears homologous to the rodent lateral orbital (LO) area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ongür and Price, 2000</xref>). Consistent with this understanding, LO lesions in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>) and OFC lesions in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">West et al., 2011</xref>) induce similar effects on goal-directed behavior under reinforcer devaluation. A series of studies found evidence consistent with a neuronal representation of value and other decision variables in LO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feierstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roitman and Roitman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Duuren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Duuren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). For example, van Duuren and colleagues showed that neurons in LO reflects both the magnitude and the probability of upcoming rewards. As a caveat, these experiments did not include real economic choices or trade-offs between competing dimensions. Other experiments showed that LO lesions disrupted choices, but some results have been contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mobini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rudebeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>). Concurrently, several studies cast doubt on the notion that neurons in LO encode economic values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roesch et al., 2006</xref>), or that values represented in this area affect economic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stott and Redish, 2014</xref>). Again, an important caveat is that these experiments did not include any dimensional trade-off. However, in one recent study, rats performed a juice choice task similar to that used in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, the authors found that optogenetic inactivation of LO did not disrupt choices. This result raised the possibility that economic decisions operate in fundamentally different ways in rodents and primates, or perhaps that seemingly minor differences in task design induce different decision mechanisms (see Discussion).</p><p>Assessing whether economic decisions in primates and rodents are supported by homologous brain areas is valuable from a comparative perspective. More importantly, many aspects of the decision circuit identified in non-human primates and discussed above remains poorly understood. For example, it is unclear whether different groups of neurons identified in relation to behavior correspond to different anatomical cell types, or whether these neurons reside in different cortical layers. It is also unclear whether these groups of neurons are differentially connected with each other and with other brain regions. Addressing these questions in monkeys is technically difficult. However, these issues can in principle be addressed using genetic tools available in mice. For this reason, establishing a credible mouse model to investigate this decision circuit is potentially transformative.</p><p>Here we present such model. More specifically, the study describes three primary results. First, we developed a mouse version of the juice choice task. In the experiments, head-fixed mice chose between two liquid rewards (juices) offered in variable amounts. Each juice was associated with an odor, and the odor concentration indicated the juice quantity. In each trial, the two odors indicating the offers were presented simultaneously from two directions, and the animal revealed its choice by licking one of two liquid spouts. Apart from using olfactory stimuli instead of visual stimuli, this task closely resembled that used for monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Mice learned the task rapidly and generally exhibited choice patterns similar to those measured in primates. Second, we used optogenetics to examine the effects of LO inactivation on choices. Inactivation was induced by optically activating GABAergic interneurons expressing channel-rhodopsin2 (ChR2). LO inactivation severely disrupted the decision process, in the sense that it altered the relative values of the two juices and consistently increased choice variability. Hence, economic decisions in mice require area LO. Third, we recorded and analyzed the spiking activity of neurons in LO. Different groups of cells encoded the value of individual offers, the binary choice outcome and the chosen value. In this respect, neuronal responses in LO closely resembled those recorded in the primate OFC. The main difference between the two species was that neurons in LO represented offers and values in a spatial frame of reference, whereas the representation in the primate OFC was good-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, neurons in LO preferentially encoded the value offered on the ipsi-lateral side, suggesting that economic decisions in mice ultimately involved a competition between the two hemispheres. These results address outstanding questions and establish a new and powerful approach to study the neural circuit underlying economic decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Economic choice behavior in mice</title><p>We developed a behavioral paradigm similar to that previously used for monkeys. In essence, we let mice choose between two liquid rewards (juices) offered in variable amounts. During the experiments, mice were head-fixed, and two liquid spouts were placed close to their mouth, on the two sides. For each juice, the offered quantity varied from trial to trial. A key aspect of the experiment was to effectively communicate to the animal the two options available on any given trial. We represented offers using olfactory stimuli because mice can easily learn to make subtle olfactory discriminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wachowiak et al., 2009</xref>). We used odor identity to represent a particular juice type, and odor concentration to represent juice quantity. In each trial, the animal was presented with two odors from the two directions (left, right). The odors, representing the offers, were presented for 2.8 s (offer period), at the end of which the animal heard an auditory ‘go’ signal. The animal indicated its choice by licking one of the two liquid spouts, and the corresponding juice was delivered immediately thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Throughout the experiments, we used five odor concentrations, corresponding to five quantity levels for each juice. Juice quantities varied on a linear scale, while odor concentrations varied roughly linearly on a log2 scale. Juice quantities and left/right positions varied pseudo-randomly from trial to trial (see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Economic choices in mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Task diagram. In the experiments, mice chose between two liquid rewards (juices, schematized by the two lick tubes) offered in variable amounts. For each offer, the juice identity (water or sugar water) was represented by the odor identity, and the juice quantity was represented by the odor concentration.

We refer to the two juices as A and B, with A preferred. If the two juices were offered in equal amounts (1B:1A), the animal would reliably choose juice A (by definition). However, if juice B was offered in sufficiently large amount against 1A, the animal chose B. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, the mouse was roughly indifferent between 1A and 2B. For a quantitative analysis, we ran a logistic regression (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 1</xref>). The logistic fit provided measures for the relative value of the two juices (ρ) and for the sigmoid steepness (η), which is inversely related to choice variability. For example, for the session in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, we measured ρ = 2.2 and η = 2.1.</p><p>The present study is based on 19 mice (see Materials and methods) and a total of 335 sessions. Animals typically performed for 250–400 trials per session. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the whole behavioral data set (excluding trials with optogenetic inactivation; see below). Across sessions and across mice, relative values varied broadly (mean(ρ)=2.39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similarly, the sigmoid steepness varied from session to session (mean(η)=1.19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In general, ρ &gt;1 implies that choices are based on values that integrate juice type and juice quantity. In this sense, mice reliably presented non-trivial choice patterns, as previously observed for monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Conversely, the sigmoid steepness measured in mice was generally lower (higher choice variability) than that recorded in monkeys.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavior, population analysis.</title><p>The figure illustrates the entire behavioral data set (19 mice).

One concern was whether low odor concentrations were hard to discern, and whether choices were ultimately dictated by perceptual ambiguity. One argument against this hypothesis follows from the fact that we observed similar choice patterns independently of the pairing between odors and juice type. For an additional control, we trained two animals in a ‘flipped’ version of the task, in which higher odor concentrations represented smaller juice amounts. These two mice learned the task and eventually performed very similarly to the other animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). More specifically, the relative value and sigmoid steepness measured for these two mice was statistically indistinguishable from those measured for the other 17 mice (p=0.12 and 0.15 for ρ and η, respectively; <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, asterisks).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inactivation of area LO disrupts economic decisions</title><p>To shed light on the role of LO in economic decisions, we examined how inactivation of this area affects choices. In a series of experiments, we inactivated LO by optically activating GABAergic interneurons expressing ChR2. We chose this protocol because exciting inhibitory cells often induces a more complete shut-down of projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>First, we tested the effects of LO inactivation in two VGAT-ChR2 mice, which (in principle) express ChR2 in all GABAergic cells throughout the brain. In each session, inactivation and control trials were pseudo-randomly interleaved. Inactivation was induced by shining blue light bilaterally in area LO during the offer and choice periods (see Materials and methods). This manipulation consistently disrupted choices. Across sessions, LO inactivation altered the relative value in a seemingly erratic way, and consistently reduced the sigmoid steepness (i.e., it increased choice variability). These effects were quantified with logistic analyses (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 5</xref>), which provided measures of relative value (ρ<sub>stim OFF</sub>, ρ<sub>stim ON</sub>) and sigmoid steepness (η<sub>stim OFF</sub>, η<sub>stim ON</sub>).

In other words, LO inactivation increased choice variability (choices became more noisy). This effect was highly significant in both animals.

One concern was the extent of the inactivated region. Since VGAT-ChR2 mice express ChR2 in interneurons throughout the brain, and since the light spreads to some extent through the brain, the behavioral effects described above could in principle be due to the inactivation of neighboring areas such as the olfactory bulb or the motor cortex. To address this issue, we conducted a second experiment. In this case, we tested PV-Cre mice, in which we injected AAV-DIO-ChR2 specifically in area LO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). PV neurons are inhibitory cells that target the perisomatic domain of local pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In this preparation, optical stimulation activated PV neurons exclusively in the injected region, resulting in specific inactivation of area LO. We repeated optogenetic inactivation experiments in five PV-Cre mice. Confirming our initial results, in each mouse the distribution of relative values was significantly broader under LO inactivation than in normal conditions (all p&lt;0.002, <italic>F</italic> test for equality of variance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–h</xref>). Furthermore, in each mouse, the sigmoid steepness was consistently lower under LO inactivation than in normal conditions (all p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, paired <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–h</xref>).</p><p>Another concern was the fact that area LO is not far from the eyes. Thus the blue light shone during stimulation trials might be seen by the mouse. In principle, such visual input could distract the animal or otherwise interfere with its choosing. To address this issue, we conducted a control experiment, in which we repeated the same light stimulation protocol of area LO in three mice that did not express ChR2 (see Materials and methods). In this case, the stimulation did not affect choices in any appreciable way. In particular, the distributions of relative values under stimulation were indistinguishable from those measured without stimulation (all p&gt;0.2, <italic>F</italic> test for equality of variance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i–l</xref>).

In general, choices can be influenced by other factors besides the juice types and juice quantities. For example, previous work in unrestrained pigeons and rats found consistent side biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kagel et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, other things equal, monkeys tend to choose on any given trial the same juice chosen in the previous trial (choice hysteresis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>). Here we examined three possible sources of choice biases related to the spatial configuration of the offers (side bias) and to the outcome of the previous trial (choice hysteresis, direction hysteresis).

Thus one concern was whether the behavioral deficits described above were due to interference with olfactory processes caused by inactivation of piriform cortex and/or the olfactory bulb. More generally, we sought to assess whether choice deficits reflected inactivation of some area different from LO. To address this issue, we examined the 5 PV-Cre mice and we conducted a regression analysis relating choice deficits to viral infection in different brain areas. We proceeded as follows.</p><p>First, using histological images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>), we quantified for each mouse the extent of viral infection by brain region. Across five animals, some degree of infection was measured in 12 distinct areas, namely FrA, PrL, MO, VO, LO, DLO, OB, M1, M2, CgI, AI and EX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franklin and Paxinos, 2013</xref>). For each animal and each area, we quantified the number of stained pixels and interpreted it as a measure of the infected volume. (Some areas were infected only in a subset of mice. Conversely, for areas PrL, MO, VO and LO, we had measures from two AP coordinates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) We thus obtained a matrix where rows and columns represented mice and areas, respectively, and each element indicated the infected volume.</p><p>Second, we noted that the primary effect of the optogenetic manipulation on choices was to decrease the sigmoid steepness η (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We used this procedure because the number of areas exceeded the number of measurements (i.e., the number of animals). The LASSO regression is parsimonious in the sense that it limits the number of covariates in the final model. If inactivation of a particular area reduced choice performance, the regression coefficient obtained for that area would be positive. Of all the areas included in the analysis, only three presented a non-zero coefficient, and only one of them, namely LO, presented a positive sign. In other words, only for area LO did the choice deficit and the volume of infection correlate in the predicted direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

To identify a small number of variables that best accounted for the whole data set, we used a stepwise procedure and a best-subset procedure.

First, we developed a mouse model of economic choice behavior. The task was very similar to that used in monkey studies, as animals chose between different juices offered in variable amounts. Choice patterns were comparable to those measured for monkeys, although choice variability was generally higher. Of note, initially naïve animals were able to learn the choice task within a few weeks. Second, we showed that economic decisions in mice depend on area LO. Specifically, optogenetic inactivation of LO induced erratic changes of relative value and consistently increased choice variability. Third, we showed that neurons in LO encode different variables reflecting the input (offer values) and output (choice outcome, chosen value) of the decision process. This neural representation closely resembles that previously identified in primates, except that the reference frame in the mouse LO was spatial while that in the monkey OFC was good-based. We next elaborate on each of these results.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LO is necessary for economic decisions</title><p>Previous work found that lesion or inactivation of orbital cortex in primates and rodents disrupts performance under reinforcer devaluation. This observation is often interpreted as relevant to neuroeconomics, under the assumption that values driving goal-directed behavior are equivalent to values driving economic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Doherty, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padoa-Schioppa and Schoenbaum, 2015</xref>). Our results demonstrate more directly that economic decisions critically depend on the orbital cortex.</p><p>Our choice task relied on olfactory stimuli and licking responses. Since viral injections extended beyond LO, one concern was whether choice deficits induced by optical stimulation were due to inactivation of the olfactory bulb or other olfactory areas. Along similar lines, choice deficits could in principle reflect some generic motor impairment. However, insofar as optical stimulation reduced licking, this effect did not explain any difference in choices. Moreover, a LASSO regression analysis attributed optically induced choice deficits to area LO. As a caveat, since the LASSO regression forces most coefficients to zero, one cannot rule out that choice deficits were partly due to inactivation of olfactory regions. A more subtle question is whether LO inactivation disrupted decisions per se, as opposed to olfactory processes to which LO could in principle contribute. We cannot definitively exclude the latter hypothesis based on our current data. However, recent studies indicate that LO inactivation preserves performance in tasks that rely on olfaction but do not require any economic decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), while it affects economic decisions relying on non-olfactory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gore et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, most likely, LO inactivation in our experiments disrupted economic decisions, not olfactory processes.</p><p>Our results on the effects of LO inactivation stand in contrast to those of a recent study that failed to disrupt economic decisions through optogenetic inactivation of area LO in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). The discordance is striking because the choice task used in the other study is very similar to ours. Furthermore, as a positive control, the other study reported that LO inactivation affected performance under reinforcer devaluation. Several considerations are in order. In itself, their failure to disrupt economic decisions is not particularly informative. Viral infection is typically more reliable in mice than rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Witten et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, inactivation through ChR2 stimulation of interneurons is often more effective than inactivation through halo-rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raimondo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>), which they used. Thus the most cogent questions pertain to their positive control. In this respect, two elements seem most relevant. First, their experiments were not temporally counterbalanced. All their rats were initially trained in the economic choice task, and tested under LO inactivation. Subsequently, animals were trained in the reinforcer devaluation task, and tested under LO inactivation. Viral injections were performed after the initial training. Since viral infection takes time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Witten et al., 2011</xref>), LO inactivation was almost certainly more effective in reinforcer devaluation experiments than in economic choice experiments. Second, a close observation of their behavioral data reveals that in the last three training sessions, the performance of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (their Figure 6a). If data from these three sessions were combined, the difference between the two groups of rats would presumably be comparable to the difference observed under LO inactivation (their Figure 6c). These various factors, possibly in addition to subtle differences in task design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>), can explain the discrepancy between the two studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Representation of subjective values in LO</title><p>Our recordings revealed that neurons in LO encoded different variables intimately related to the decision process. Specifically, neurons encoded the spatial configuration of the offers (<italic>position of A</italic>), the decision input (<italic>offer value ipsi</italic>), and the decision output (<italic>chosen side</italic>, <italic>chosen value</italic>). Comparing our results to those of monkey studies, there are notable similarities and interesting differences. On the one hand, three variables represented in LO (<italic>offer value ipsi</italic>, <italic>chosen side</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic>) are analogous or identical to those previously identified in the primate OFC (<italic>offer value</italic>, <italic>chosen juice</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic>). On the other hand, a major difference is that input and output in LO are represented in a spatial frame of reference. In contrast, in the primate OFC, input and output are defined in a non-spatial, good-based reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The finding that neurons in LO represent options and values in a spatial reference frame confirms previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feierstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roesch et al., 2006</xref>). However, a striking aspect of our results is that LO cells in our experiments represented values offered on the ipsi-lateral side. The majority of cortical representations are entirely or preferentially contra-lateral. One exception is the olfactory system, as sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium send their axonal projections ipsi-laterally to the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Olmos et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Royet and Plailly, 2004</xref>). Offers in our task were represented by olfactory stimuli. Thus one possibility is that the ipsi-laterality found in LO was ‘inherited’ from the spatial representation in the olfactory bulb. Supporting this hypothesis, connections between the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex, and between piriform and orbital cortices are primarily ipsi-lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datiche and Cattarelli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis and Macrides, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hintiryan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Illig, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, ipsi-laterality in LO might be ‘endogenous’. In other words, the encoding of offer value might be ipsi-lateral even if offers are represented by visual stimuli. Future research should examine this intriguing issue.</p><p>Two groups of responses identified in LO encoded variables <italic>offer value ipsi</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic>. Importantly, these variables reflect the subjective values of the options and integrate the two dimensions varied in our experiments, namely juice type and quantity. Our result matches a large body of work in human and non-human primates. It also confirms and extends previous observations in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roitman and Roitman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Duuren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, one earlier study in rats failed to find any systematic relation between the effects induced by changes in reward quantity and those induced by changes in delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roesch et al., 2006</xref>). The reasons for their negative result are not clear, but several factors might contribute. First, in the earlier study, most of the analysis focused on the time window following reward delivery. However, we found that value-encoding responses are most prominent immediately after the offer, and that neuronal responses at juice delivery mostly represent the binary choice outcome. Second, in the earlier study, reduced activity at juice delivery in long delay trials might be due to the animal's inability to predict the reward timing (because of the long delay), as opposed to temporal discounting per se. In fact, at the time of delivery, the subjective value of the juice should no longer depend on the preceding delay. Third, in their study, the two dimensions were never manipulated at the same time. In fact, trials were blocked, both dimensions were fixed within a block, and firing rates were compared across blocks. If the value representation in LO is range adapting as is the value representation in the primate OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Kable, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>), neurons in the blocked design might appear untuned. Thus range adaptation might explain why varying the reward quantity had only a modest effect on neuronal activity. In conclusion, future work should re-examine the representation of temporally discounted values in area LO with more suitable task design and data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of economic decisions in mice</title><p>As noted above, the variables represented in the mouse LO closely resembled those encoded in the primate OFC, except for the fact that they were defined in a spatial reference frame. Modeling work has shown that the three groups of cells identified in the primate OFC are computationally sufficient to generate binary choices, suggesting that economic decisions are formed in a neural circuit within this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017</xref>). Importantly, current models may be formulated equally well in spatial terms. In other words, neurons encoding the variables identified here are also sufficient to generate binary choices, indicating that economic decisions in mice could be formed within area LO. With this premise, one aspect of our results is noteworthy.</p><p>In the primate OFC, neurons encoding different variables, including <italic>offer value A</italic> and <italic>offer value B</italic>, are found in close proximity of each other. This salt-and-pepper distribution suggests that the competition between values happens throughout the OFC and in both hemispheres. In contrast, in the mouse LO, neurons in each hemisphere predominantly represent the value of the good offered on the ipsi-lateral side. This lateralized distribution seems to imply that decisions in our task ultimately involve a competition between the two hemispheres, as previously observed in other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma and Okuda, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom and Hynd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazzoli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilgetag et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Knaap and van der Ham, 2011</xref>). Future work should test this hypothesis more directly, and assess whether the same lateralized organization holds when binary decisions are made in a spatially richer environment (e.g., with free moving animals).</p><p>In conclusion, we established a genetically tractable animal model of economic choice behavior, and we demonstrated a clear homology between the mouse LO and the primate central OFC. We gathered strong evidence that economic decisions depend on LO. We also showed that neurons in LO represent the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that decisions emerge from a neural circuit within this area. With respect to the decision mechanisms, the main difference between mice and primates appears to be that decision variables in LO are represented in a spatial reference frame. The fact that neurons in each hemisphere predominantly represent the value offered on one side suggests that economic decisions in mice involve a competition between the two hemispheres.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>This study reports on 19 mice of different strains, including C57BL/6J (B6; N = 2; Jackson Laboratory, stock #000664), <italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J (PV-Cre; N = 7; Jackson Laboratory, stock #008069) and Tg(Slc32a1-COP4*H134R/EYFP)8Gfng/J (VGAT-ChR2; N = 10; Jackson Laboratory, stock #014548).

The same cannulas were implanted in non-injected and in injected mice, and surgery damage was very similar in the two groups. Mice were randomly assigned to different groups. For the neuronal recordings, we initially set up to collect a dataset comparable to those we typically record in monkeys, consisting of 500–1000 cells. For the inactivation experiments, we did not perform any ex-ante power analysis. After the pilot experiments (N = 2 mice, VGAT), we decided to replicate the experiments in 5 mice and 10–15 sessions per animal.</p><p>All surgeries were conducted under general anesthesia induced with Isoflurane, alone or in combination with Ketamine. A titanium head plate implanted on the bregma was used to restrain the animal and as a landmark for the neuronal recordings.

For the optogenetic experiments, we implanted cannulas with an optical fiber (200 µm core diameter) bilaterally at 2.7 mm anterior, 1.4 mm lateral.

During the experiment, the mouse was placed in a plastic tube with the head fixed. Two odor delivery systems and two liquid spouts were placed symmetrically on the left and on the right of the animal head, and close to the mouth. In each session, the animal chose between two liquid rewards offered in variable amounts, delivered from left and right lick ports. We refer to the liquid rewards as ‘juices’ for uniformity of language with the monkey studies. On any trial, the offered juice types were signaled with different odors, and juice amounts were signaled by the corresponding odor concentration. Before each trial, a vacuum sweep removed the odors remaining from the previous trial. Immediately thereafter, the two odors (the offers) were presented simultaneously from two directions (left, right). The odor presentation lasted for 2.8 s, after which the animal indicated its choice by licking one of the two spouts. The liquid spouts were fixed and did not retract during odor presentation. The response period started with an auditory ‘go’ cue and licking before the go cue was disregarded. Licking was detected by two photodiodes located posterior to the liquid spouts. If the animal did not respond within 4 s, the trial was aborted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In forced choices, where only one juice was offered, trials in which the animal licked the wrong spout were considered errors. Such cases were almost inexistent in monkey experiments, but occurred sometimes in mouse experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Upon error trials, we aborted the trial and repeated the same offer in the subsequent trial.</p><p>Throughout the experiments, we used the same two liquid rewards, namely water and 12% sucrose water. We always labeled sucrose water as ‘juice A’ and water as ‘juice B’. In the vast majority of sessions, sucrose water was preferred to water. This point can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, showing that in 96% of sessions we measured ρ &gt;1. Odors were mint and 4-Pentenoic acid. The association between the juices and the odors varied pseudo-randomly across mice. The juice amount offered to the animal varied between 0 and 6 drops (eight drops for mice #39 and #53). The amount was monotonically related to the represented odor concentration, which varied roughly linearly on a log2 scale (e.g., odor levels 1, 2, 4 and 8 ppm representing quantities 1, 2, 3 and 4 of juice). In each session, the left/right location of the two juices varied pseudo-randomly from trial to trial. Juice delivery took 150–900 ms depending on the juice amount (~150 ms per quantum). Independent of the amount, the reward period was kept constant and equal to 900 ms, to maintain a consistent trial duration. Excepting this rule, when mice #39 and #53 received 8 drops of juice, the reward period lasted 1.2 s. Odor presentation for the next trial started 650 ms after the end of the reward period. For most mice, we used higher odor concentrations to represent larger amounts of juice. However, we also trained two mice in a ‘flipped’ version of the task, in which higher odor concentrations represented smaller amounts of juice. Although training took longer, the two mice reached a similar level of performance in the choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Typically, mice performed the task for ~30 min each day, during which they completed ~300 correct trials and received 0.8–1.6 ml of liquid reward. The multiplicity of offer types was fixed within each session and the offer type was randomly selected at the beginning of each trial. Sessions typically included ~40% of forced choices (20% for each juice). In forced choice trials, error trials were followed by a 3 s additional delay (with white noise). (For some sessions in mice #36 and #41, the delay lasted 5 s; in mouse #39, the delay lasted 1 s.)</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Training protocol</title><p>With experience, our training protocol became more standard. Eventually, training developed in four steps. (1) Mice were trained in a direction discrimination task. We presented the odor from the left or from the right in random alternation, and we delivered the juice only when the animal licked the corresponding spout. Mice typically took ~10 days to reach 80% accuracy. (2) We introduced the association between odor concentration and juice quantity. We used the same scheme as in (1), but the odor was presented at different concentrations and coupled with different juice quantities. Mice typically took ~3 days to reach 80% accuracy. (3) We introduced the association between different odors and different juice types. Specifically, we repeated steps (1) and (2) using a second odor and a second juice type (in some cases, we experimented with 3 or four juice types). Mice typically took 6–10 days to reach 80% accuracy. (4) We presented mice with the full choice task, where animals choose between the two juice types offered in variable amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We trained the animal on the choice task for at least 5 days before starting the experiments.</p><p>Of the two mice trained in the ‘flipped’ version of the task, one (#39) was naïve while the other (#53) had already been trained in the standard task. Both mice took ~20 extra days to reach performance level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optical stimulation, neuronal recordings, and histology</title><p>Optical stimulation was performed with blue light (473 nm Blue DPSS Laser, Shanghai Laser). Core fibers (200 µm, Doric) were connected through two cannulas inserted bilaterally in area LO. To precisely control the stimulation timing, we used an acousto-optic device (AO modulator/shifter, Optoelectronics) and an associated RF Driver MODA110-B4-30 (Optoelectronics). To inactivate area LO, we typically used 3–9 mW intensity, 10 ms pulses and 10–33 Hz frequency. The stimulation started at the beginning of odor presentation and lasted 3.8 s (i.e., throughout the offer period plus 1 s). In most sessions, stimulation conditions (OFF or ON) varied pseudo-randomly on a trial-by-trial basis. In a subset of sessions, trials were divided in blocks of 20–30 trials. The optical inactivation experiments were conducted on N = 2 VGAT-ChR2 mice (29 sessions total), N = 5 PV-Cre mice injected with AAV-DIO-ChR2 in area LO (78 sessions total), and N = 3 control mice (39 sessions total).</p><p>We recorded the spiking activity of individual neurons from LO of eight mice. Recording locations spanned 2.5–3.1 mm anterior, 1.0–1.7 mm lateral and 1.0–2.0 mm ventral. Extracellular activity was recorded with a 16 channel array, with or without optical fiber (Neuronexus). The array was advanced before each session. Electric signals were ampliﬁed (10,000 gain) and band-pass ﬁltered (300 Hz - 6 kHz; Neuralynx). Spikes were identified with a threshold, digitized (40 kHz; 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design), and stored to disk for off-line spike sorting (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Design).</p><p>At the end of the recording experiments, we injected a dye (DiI) roughly at the center of the recording region. The animal was then perfused. The brain was extracted, mounted on an optimal cutting temperature compound and frozen. Subsequently, the brain was sliced (approximately 33 µm sections) with a low-temperature Cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and pasted on cover glass. Sections were then examined and photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000 B microscopy). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> illustrates the reconstructed locations of recordings.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Reconstructed locations of neuronal recordings for six mice.</title><p>Recording regions for all animals were transferred on the same hemisphere.

= − a<sub>2</sub>/a<sub>1</sub> and ε<sub>stim ON</sub> = − a<sub>5</sub>/a<sub>4</sub>. We constructed analogous logistic models to test whether LO inactivation specifically affected choice hysteresis or direction hysteresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis, neuronal activity</title><p>Preliminary observations revealed that the activity of neurons in LO varied as a function of the offered and chosen juices, but also depended on the spatial contingencies of the choice task. This is unlike what we found in the primate OFC, where firing rates are independent of the spatial contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grattan and Glimcher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Thus the present analysis was designed to capture the spatial components of the choice task. Apart from this aspect, our analyses closely resembled those previously conducted in monkey studies. Neuronal activity was examined in 5 time windows: pre-offer (0.6 s preceding the offer); post-offer (0.2–0.8 s after offer on); late delay (0.6–1.2 s after offer on); pre-juice (0.6 s preceding juice delivery); post-juice (0.6 s following the beginning of juice delivery). An ‘offer type’ was defined by two juice quantities offered to the mouse, independent of the spatial configuration and the animal's choice. A ‘trial type’ was defined by an offer type, a spatial configuration (e.g., juice A on the left), and a choice. A ‘neuronal response’ was defined as the activity of one neuron in one time window as a function of the trial type. Sessions typically included 10–12 offer types (including forced choices), and ~30 trial types. Error trials in forced choices were excluded from the analysis. We also excluded from the analysis trial types with ≤2 trials. Neuronal responses were constructed by averaging spike counts across trials for each trial type.</p><p>Our analyses aimed at identifying the variables encoded in area LO and proceeded in steps. First, the activity of each cell in each time window was examined with a 3-way ANOVA (factors offer type ×position of A × chosen side), followed by a 1-way ANOVA (factor trial type). The latter was used to identify ‘task-related’ responses. Specifically, we imposed a significance threshold of p&lt;0.001, and neuronal responses that passed this criterion were included in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Second, we defined a series of variables that neurons in LO might potentially encode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For each neuronal response, we performed a linear regression against each variable (separately). If the regression slope differed significantly from zero (p&lt;0.05), the variable was said to ‘explain’ the neuronal response. For each variable, the regression also provided an R<sup>2</sup>. For variables that did not explain the neuronal response, we arbitrarily set R<sup>2</sup> = 0.</p><p>Third, we conducted population analyses to identify a small subset of variables that best accounted for our data. Based on the regressions, we identified for each response the variable that provided the best fit (highest R<sup>2</sup>). We then computed the number of responses best explained by each variable, separately for each time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). To identify the variables that best accounted for the whole population, we proceeded as in previous studies, using two methods of variable selection ‒ stepwise and best subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glantz and Slinker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). The stepwise method is an iterative procedure. In the first step, we selected the variable that provided the highest number of best fits within any time window, and we removed from the data set all the responses explained by this variable. In the second step, we repeated the procedure with the residual data set. We defined the ‘marginal explanatory power’ of a variable X as the percent of task-related responses explained by X and not explained by any other selected variable. At each step, we imposed that the marginal explanatory power of each selected variable be ≥5%. We then continued the procedure until additional variables failed to meet the 5% criterion. In contrast, the best subset method is an exhaustive procedure. For this analysis, we pooled responses from different time windows. For each possible subset of <italic>d</italic> variables, we computed the number of responses explained in the data set, and we identified the subset that explained the highest number of responses. We repeated this procedure for <italic>d</italic> = 1,2,3...</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Grant Black for help with animal training, Andreas Burkhalter for help with the histology, and Alessandro Livi for help with the figures.

This study established a mouse model to study value-based decisions by adapting to mice the economic decision task that was developed by Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006, and has been a powerful paradigm in primates. The authors show that optogenetic inactivation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LO) impaired the behavioral performance in this task. Furthermore, the authors found that LO neurons in mice showed the types of activity observed in monkeys although LO neurons in mice exhibited biases in activity related to the choice/movement direction.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that this is an important study addressing long-standing questions regarding the role of OFC in economic decision making. Furthermore, they thought that establishing a mouse model is a great step toward further mechanistic studies. The manuscript is clearly written, and the data are well presented. The reviewers, however, raised some technical concerns that require further investigations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most importantly, the reviewers thought that it remains unclear whether the optogenetic inactivation is confined to the intended area (LO). From the data provided, it is unclear whether the authors can exclude the possibility that observed behavioral effects (increased choice variability) are due to an off-target effect such as inactivation of the piriform cortex or anterior olfactory nucleus which are right beneath the LO. Due to the small size of mice, compared to rats, this issue appears to be particularly important. This would be an issue for both the GAD mouse but also the PV-Cre mice, as the virus injections do appear to include more ventral structures (Figure 3G, right).</p><p>2) Somewhat related to the above issue, we thought that it remains unclear whether the LO inactivation influenced the more basic sensorimotor choice behavior as opposed to specifically influencing economic decisions. It would be very helpful to examine the effect of LO inactivation in a simpler odor-guided two choice behavior.</p><p>3) The reviewers ask for more detailed descriptions of methods (reviewer 2, comments 1-3; reviewer 3, comments #2). Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors conduct a nice study, implementing an economic decision task in mice that is quite similar to their primate studies, enabling comparable analyses between the species. They find that mice exhibit similar choice patterns to primates, albeit with more trial-to-trial variability, in part reflecting more prominent biases. Bilateral optogenetic inactivation of LO, either by ChR2 activation of GAD or PV neurons, increases choice variability and often a reliance on biases; this positive result is in contrast to previous work in rats. Electrophysiological recordings from LO reveal qualitatively similar responses to what the authors have observed in primates. An interesting difference is that value and choice representations in the mouse appear to be spatial in contrast to primates.</p><p>Overall, I have no major issues with the analyses performed in this study. My biggest concern, however, is that their optogenetic result reflects off-target effects of the piriform cortex or accessory olfactory bulb, which are just ventral to LO. This could be particularly problematic as their task is olfactory based, and their optogenetic result (increased choice variability) could in principle reflect reduced ability to discriminate the olfactory cues. Additionally, their results differ from recent work in the rat (Gardner et al., 2017), which they discuss. However, it is worth noting that the rat brain is much bigger with a cortex that is twice as thick as the mouse. It could be that, because of the smaller distance between LO and the AOB/piriform in the mouse, light from a fiber placed in LO can more easily reach these deeper structures in the mouse than the rat. This would be an issue for both the GAD mouse but also the PV-Cre mice, as the virus injections do appear to include more ventral structures (Figure 3G, right). Have the authors confirmed that olfactory detection is not impaired with their optogenetic inactivations? Do they have any catch trials that they could analyze to this effect? This is a fundamental issue that needs to be clarified.</p><p>Can the authors further confirm that there were not off target effects of overlying motor cortex, which was also infected with virus (Figure 3G, left)? Were they any changes in response times, number of licks, etc.?</p><p>Additionally, in the Discussion section, when the authors attempt to reconcile their results with the Gardner paper, they include the following statements: &quot;Second, a close observation of their behavioral data reveals that in the last 3 training sessions, the performance of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (their Supplementary Figure 2A). If data from these three sessions were combined, the difference between the two groups of rats would presumably be comparable to the difference observed under LO inactivation (their Supplementary Figure 2C).&quot; Out of curiosity I attempted to track this down, but I'm confused. Are they referencing the Gardner et al., 2017 paper? Supplementary Figure 2 in that paper does not have A or C subpanels, and I couldn't make sense of their statement from that figure. Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, &quot;Neural mechanisms of economic choices in mice&quot;, the authors examine the role lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LO) in economic choice behavior in mice. In the current manuscript, they adapt the choice task used in non-human primates for mice to test whether LO is necessary for choice behavior and examine how variables that affect choices are encoded in single neuron responses. The authors demonstrate a role for LO in controlling choice behavior and show similar patterns of neural responses as observed in monkeys. However, the neural responses related to preference are more affected by spatial aspects of the task in mice. The ability to carry out these kinds of studies in a mouse model opens the door for tests of mechanism not possible in the non-human primate model. There are a few areas that the authors could clarify for a more complete description of their findings:</p><p>1) For readers familiar with the previous work in primates, the description of the rodent task would benefit from greater clarification of details. Describing the liquid reward as 'juices' creates an expectation that mice are choosing between apple juice, grape juice, fruit punch, tea, etc. The Materials and methods describe training mice to choose between different quantities of water and 12% sucrose solution. In the rodent literature, these are not typically referred to as juices, but just fluid reward. Here juices A and B are used to refer to the preferred and non-preferred fluid – in two-bottle preference tests, mice typically prefer sucrose. In this paradigm, how often is water the preferred option? As mice are fluid restricted and sucrose solution presents an osmotic challenge, does preference change over the course of a session, or over the course of days of testing?</p><p>2) There does not seem to be an introduction of a wider range of juice offers or olfactory cues. Indeed, it would be very surprising if mice (or rats) could flexibly adapt and produce reliable behavior in the more complex version of the task that monkeys perform. I would suggest making it more explicitly clear in the Results that the rodent menu is reduced compared to the monkey, and include in the Discussion the experimental advantages to the rodent model for elucidating mechanism as well as the reduced flexibility in the behaviors available to study.</p><p>3) Were the spouts continuously available, or did they retract between trials? If spouts are continuously available, behavior between trials may provide another index of spatial biases in the animals.</p><p>4) Licks before the 'go' cue were discarded. Did this 'anticipatory' licking correspond with the spatial encoding of LO neurons?</p><p>5) In the optogenetic stimulation experiments, the timing of stimulation was set to coincide with odor cue onset. Related to #4, if a mouse were engaged in anticipatory licking, did optogenetic stimulation affect that behavior as well as choice? Was stimulation ever delivered in a different temporal window?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Neural mechanisms of economic choices in mice&quot;, the authors developed a mouse behavior paradigm to examine economic decisions based on similar behavioral tasks in non-human primates. The authors examined the involvement of the lateral OFC in this task using optogenetic silencing methods and performed extracellular recording from individual neurons in the lateral OFC to investigate neuronal coding of various variables relevant to the economic decision process. The authors found that inactivation of LO disrupted mice's performance of the economic decision task and increased the stereotypy of choices independent of subjective values. The authors also found that neuronal responses in different trial epochs encoding different aspects of the economic choices, with early responses mostly encoding offer value on the ipsilateral side, late responses mostly encoding the spatial direction of choices, and some other neurons encoding the chosen value on the ipsilateral side. This is a timely study that successfully translated economic decision paradigm from primates to rodents and provided sophisticated analysis of the neuronal activity in the lateral OFC to show that OFC neurons encode important behavioral variables related to economic decisions. The compelling evidence provided in this study support that the rodent OFC plays a similar role in economic choice behavior as in primates, which opens up the possibility to investigate at more mechanistic level the neural circuit basis of economic decision-making.</p><p>1) While successfully training mice to perform this advanced economic decision task is certainly a prize, this behavioral task is quite complex that contains multiple cognitive components and requires several stages of training. This leads to my concern of whether silencing LO specifically impaired economic decision-making, or it might have also disrupted other processes involved in this task. For example, would LO inactivation also disrupts the sensorimotor process, which can be critical for the choice behavior based on odor-reward association? From the data plot in Figure 3, it seems that LO inactivation also disrupted the performance in the easiest trials, where there was only one odor and one rewarded side, and correct responses may only require the odor-reward association. A potential experiment to test this possibility is to inactivate LO in a simpler odor discrimination 2AFC task. If mice's performance is also impaired, then it would be difficult to tell whether LO was only involved in economic decisions or it is generally required for sensorimotor choice behavior. In fact, given the broad projection of OFC neurons and the nonselective nature of silencing methods, it may not be unexpected that the inactivated OFC neurons may also be involved in more general choice processes. If this is the case, the authors may need to confine their interpretation of inactivation results and rely more on the analysis of the recording data to understand the function of OFC neurons.</p><p>2) The authors did not provide sufficient details of virus injection, such as the volume and titer of injected virus, and the injection methods etc, which can influence the range of expression. Although the author optically targeted the LO region, the virus infection regions seem to be quite large (Figure 1G). Photo stimulation may potentially influence neighboring regions. While this issue can be difficult to address experimentally given the difficulty of the task training, the authors should at least discuss the potential caveats.</p><p>3) The authors found that neuronal activity in different time epochs encode different aspects of the economic decisions. It would be interesting to perform optogenetic silencing restricted in different trial epochs. This would be an optional set of experiments that might not be required to support the current conclusions in this study, but this would provide more informative results to support the specific role of OFC in the economic decisions.</p><p>4) It is still very intriguing why LO mainly encode values associated with the ipsilateral side. The authors speculated that this may be specific to the olfactory sensory pathways. This explanation can be better supported if the authors could provide references or evidence supporting that the circuit pathways linking olfactory bulb eventually to OFC are also primarily ipsilateral.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neural mechanisms of economic choices in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

More specifically, we focused on the 5 PV-Cre mice used for the key inactivation experiments. As noted by the reviewers, viral infections were not confined to area LO. Based on the histology (Figure 3G), we quantified the infected volume for each area surrounding LO. Across mice, we found infected tissue in 12 brain areas, namely FrA, PrL, MO, VO, LO, DLO, OB, M1, M2, CgI, AI and EX.</p><p>The primary effect of the optogenetic manipulation on choices was to decrease the sigmoid steepness η (Figure 5). For each session, we quantified this effect by defining the steepness stimulation index (SSI):</p><p>SSI = 2 * (η<sub>stim ON</sub> – η<sub>stim OFF</sub>) / (η<sub>stim ON</sub> + η<sub>stim OFF</sub>)</p><p>For each mouse, we defined the choice deficit as CD = –mean(SSI), where the average was across sessions and the minus sign made it so that more severe behavioral impairments corresponded to larger CDs.</p><p>To address the issue at hand, we conducted a regression analysis in which we sought to explain the choice deficit (CD) as a function of the infected volume in each area. Since the number of infected brain areas exceeded the number of animals, we used a LASSO regression. This procedure limits the number of covariates. Furthermore, if inactivation of a particular area reduced choice performance, the regression coefficient obtained for that area should be positive. Of all the areas included in the analysis, only 3 presented a non-zero coefficient, and only one – namely LO – presented a positive sign. In other words, only for area LO did the volume of infection correlate with the behavioral choice deficit.</p><p>This result strongly supported our interpretation and is described in a new section in the revised manuscript (subsection “<italic>Choice deficits reflect LO inactivation”</italic>, Figure 6, Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Somewhat related to the above issue, we thought that it remains unclear whether the LO inactivation influenced the more basic sensorimotor choice behavior as opposed to specifically influencing economic decisions. It would be very helpful to examine the effect of LO inactivation in a simpler odor-guided two choice behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree that in principle choice deficits induced by optical stimulation could be caused by some motor impairment as opposed to interference with the economic decision process per se. The results of the LASSO analysis described above, which included areas M1 and M2, argue against this hypothesis. However, to further scrutinize this issue, we examined the licking activity in the 5 PV-Cre mice. We found that optical stimulation did affect licking to some extent. Specifically, in the relevant time window, optical stimulation reduced the average number of licks by roughly 8%. While quantitatively modest, this reduction was statistically significant. Of course, this observation does not imply that choice deficits were caused by motor impairments. The crucial question is whether the choice deficit – i.e., the decrease in sigmoid steepness – was at all correlated with the motor deficits across sessions and subjects. To address this issue, we defined for each session the lick stimulation index (LSI) where nlicks was the average number of licks per trial:</p><p>LSI = 2 * (nlicks<sub>stim ON</sub> – nlicks<sub>stim OFF</sub>) / (nlicks<sub>stim ON</sub> + nlicks<sub>stim OFF</sub>)</p><p>In essence, LSI quantified the effect optical stimulation on licking. We thus examined the relation between LSI and the steepness stimulation index (SSI) defined above (point 1). Critically, we did not find any correlation between the two measures in any of the 5 animals (all r ≤ 0.2; all p ≥ 0.35). On this basis, we concluded that choice deficits were caused by specific interference with the decision process and not by generic motor impairments.</p><p>These results are reported in the new section (subsection “<italic>Choice deficits reflect LO inactivation”</italic>, Figure 6, Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers ask for more detailed descriptions of methods (reviewer 2, comments 1-3; reviewer 3, comments #2).

We revised the Discussion to include the following paragraph:</p><p>“Since viral injections extended beyond LO, one concern was whether choice deficits induced by optical stimulation were due to inactivation of the olfactory bulb or other olfactory areas. […] As a caveat, since the LASSO regression forces most coefficients to zero, one cannot rule out that choice deficits were partly due to inactivation of olfactory regions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
