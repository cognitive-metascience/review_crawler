Observations that HIFα hydroxylation can be impaired even when oxygen is sufficient emphasise the importance of understanding the complex nature of PHD regulation. Here, we use an unbiased genome-wide genetic screen in near-haploid human cells to uncover cellular processes that regulate HIF1α. We identify that genetic disruption of the Vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), the key proton pump for endo-lysosomal acidification, and two previously uncharacterised V-ATPase assembly factors, TMEM199 and CCDC115, stabilise HIF1α in aerobic conditions. Rather than preventing the lysosomal degradation of HIF1α, disrupting the V-ATPase results in intracellular iron depletion, thereby impairing PHD activity and leading to HIF activation. Iron supplementation directly restores PHD catalytic activity following V-ATPase inhibition, revealing important links between the V-ATPase, iron metabolism and HIFs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22693.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22693.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22693.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms have developed strategies to survive in low oxygen environments. Central to this response are proteins called Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs), which activate genes involved in energy production and blood vessel growth when oxygen is scarce.</p><p>When plenty of oxygen is present, HIFs are rapidly broken down. This is important because HIFs have also been linked to the growth and spread of cancers. Oxygen sensing enzymes, termed prolyl hydroxylases, play a principal role in controlling the break down of HIFs when oxygen is abundant. However, the activity of these prolyl hydroxylases can be reduced by changes in the nutrient or iron levels present in the cell. This raises questions about how other cell mechanisms help to control HIF levels.</p><p>By using a technique called an unbiased forward genetic screen to study human cells, Miles, Burr et al. set out to identify the cellular pathways that regulate HIF levels when oxygen is still abundant. Disrupting a pump called the V-ATPase – which normally helps to break down unwanted proteins by acidifying the cellular compartments where they are destroyed – stabilised HIFs. Moreover, Miles, Burr et al. identified two previously uncharacterised genes that are required for the V-ATPase to work correctly.</p><p>While the V-ATPase is typically associated with the destruction of proteins, a different, unexpected aspect of its activity is responsible for stabilising HIFs. Blocking activity of the V-ATPase reduces levels of iron inside the cell. This inhibits the activity of the prolyl hydroxylases, resulting in HIFs being activated.</p><p>Overall, the findings presented by Miles, Burr et al. show key links between oxygen sensing, the use of iron and the V-ATPase. Further work is now needed to investigate how V-ATPase activity affects levels of HIFs found inside cells during diseases such as cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22693.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22693.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Vacuolar ATPase</kwd><kwd>Hypoxia Inducible factors</kwd><kwd>Iron</kwd><kwd>HIF</kwd><kwd>Vma12</kwd><kwd>Vma22</kwd><kwd>vATPase</kwd><kwd>TMEM199</kwd><kwd>CCDC115</kwd><kwd>PHD</kwd><kwd>transferrin</kwd><kwd>ferritinophagy</kwd><kwd>prolyl hydroxylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102770/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burr</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name><name><surname>Grice</surname><given-names>Guinevere L</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathan</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K50127X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miles</surname><given-names>Anna L</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathan</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unbiased genome-wide human forward genetic screen identifies the vacuolar ATPase complex and assembly factors as regulators of HIF stability through their actions on intracellular iron metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIFs are major transcriptional regulators of cellular responses to oxygen availability, promoting several metabolic adaptations to ensure cell survival. In aerobic conditions, the HIFα subunit is constitutively expressed but rapidly degraded by the proteasome, in a process requiring two post-translational modifications: (i) prolyl hydroxylation of the HIFα oxygen dependent degradation (ODD) domain by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruick and McKnight, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>), and (ii) subsequent ubiquitination by the von-hippel lindau (VHL) E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maxwell et al., 1999</xref>). Prolyl hydroxylation of HIFα acts as the recruitment signal for VHL, which rapidly ubiquitinates the ODD domain facilitating proteasomal degradation. Indeed, HIF1α (the ubiquitously expressed HIFα isoform) is a very short-lived protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berra et al., 2001</xref>), and the efficiency of VHL in promoting proteasomal degradation has led to the recent development of small molecules that hijack the VHL complex to selectively destroy target proteins as a potential therapeutic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bondeson et al., 2015</xref>). Despite this clear role for proteasomal degradation of HIF, it has been reported that lysosomal inhibitors can lead to stabilisation of the HIFα subunit in both normal oxygen levels and in hypoxia. Moreover, this stabilisation can lead to a functional HIF response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2006</xref>), and upregulation of target genes to promote glucose metabolism and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hubbi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Initial observations regarding lysosomal degradation and HIFs arose from studies using Bafilomycin A (BafA) to chemically inhibit the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), the main complex responsible for acidification of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. BafA treatment stabilised HIF1α and prevented its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2006</xref>). Others report similar findings, with several proposed mechanisms to explain the stabilisation of HIF1 upon BafA treatment, including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bremm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubbi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selfridge et al., 2016</xref>), mitochondrial uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhdanov et al., 2012</xref>) and binding of the V-ATPase to VHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). However, the relative importance of these mechanisms compared to the canonical degradation of HIF1α by prolyl hydroxylation and VHL mediated proteasomal degradation was not clear.</p><p>We recently developed a forward genetic screen in near-haploid KBM7 cells to identify genes that regulate HIF1α in aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burr et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we used this screen to focus on cellular pathways enriched for gene-trapping insertions, and find that mutations in several V-ATPase subunits result in increased HIF1α levels. In addition, we identify two uncharacterised V-ATPase accessory proteins, TMEM199 and CCDC115, which we show are required for V-ATPase function and form the mammalian orthologue of the yeast Vma12p-Vma22p V-ATPase assembly complex. Although the V-ATPase is required for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maxson and Grinstein, 2014</xref>), we find that the mechanism for HIF1α stabilisation following V-ATPase inhibition is through intracellular iron depletion, leading to decreased PHD activity. Iron supplementation to V-ATPase depleted cells directly restores PHD hydroxylation of HIF1α in cellular assays and in vitro. These findings support a novel role for the V-ATPase and its assembly factors in regulating HIF1α levels through the control of intracellular iron levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion or inhibition of the V-ATPase stabilises HIF1α in aerobic conditions</title><p>We developed a forward genetic screening approach to identify genes involved in the regulation of HIF1α under aerobic conditions using near haploid human KBM7 cells expressing a HIF1α-specific fluorescent reporter (HIF1α-GFP<sup>ODD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burr et al., 2016</xref>).

This approach successfully identified genes involved in the canonical proteasomal degradation of HIF1α (PHD2 and VHL) as well as genes involved in mitochondrial regulation of HIF1α (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid synthase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burr et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we noted that several other genes were enriched for trapping insertions compared to the control library, although their significance levels were lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we ranked genes most enriched for trapping insertions according to biological process and molecular function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As expected, the HIF pathway was ranked highly, due to the enrichment of trapping insertions in genes such as PHD2, VHL and CUL2. However, the top ranked biological process was transferrin transport and V-ATPase function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), principally relating to mutagenesis of genes encoding five V-ATPase subunits: ATP6AP1, ATP6V1A, ATP6V1G1, ATP6V0A2 and ATP6V0D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

HIF1α accumulation following inhibition of V-ATPase activity was unexpected, given the clear role for the proteasome in degrading ubiquitinated HIF1α in normal oxygen tensions. Rather than V-ATPase inhibition directly preventing HIF1α degradation, we find that HIF1α is stabilised due to depletion of intracellular iron, which results from decreased transferrin uptake and reduced conversion to ferrous iron within endosomal compartments. These findings may have diverse physiological implications, particularly as germline mutations in V-ATPase subunits are associated with several human diseases. Homozygous mutations in a V0 subunit isoform (ATP6V0A3) cause infantile osteopetrosis (failure of bone resorption) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kornak et al., 2000</xref>), while mutations in kidney specific isoforms (ATP6V0A4) cause distal tubular renal acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, several cancer cell types express V-ATPase complexes at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capecci and Forgac, 2013</xref>), possibly as a mechanism for regulating cytosolic pH, which appear to render tumour cells more susceptible to cell death when the V-ATPase is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perut et al., 2014</xref>). Given the diverse role of the V-ATPase, it will be of future interest to examine whether known germline or somatic human mutations in V-ATPase subunits impact on the HIF pathway in animal models.</p><p>While HIF1α degradation by proteasome independent mechanisms, such as CMA, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bremm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubbi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selfridge et al., 2016</xref>), we did not observe any effect on HIF1α levels in HeLa cells when key mediators of CMA were depleted (HSC70 and LAMP2A). The ability of iron treatment to completely restore HIF1α turnover when the V-ATPase is inhibited, without altering the lysosomal degradation of EGFR or the autophagy cargo receptor NCOA4, also argues against a role for CMA in HIF1α regulation. It remains possible that non-proteasomal degradation of HIF1α may occur in certain cell types and under particular conditions. The requirement for the AAA ATPase P97 in HIF1α degradation suggests that it may be incorporated into larger complexes that require unfolding prior to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandru et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, we find that the major consequence of V-ATPase inhibition is stabilisation of HIF1α by preventing prolyl hydroxylation.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with prior studies showing impaired uptake of transferrin following V-ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Straud et al., 2010</xref>), and confirm the importance of V-ATPase activity in regulating iron through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozik et al., 2013</xref>), endosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckenroth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohgami et al., 2005</xref>) and ferritinophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancias et al., 2014</xref>). Directly measuring the levels of free intracellular iron within the cytosol is challenging, as reagents typically used for these assays rely on indirect enzymatic assays, and most Fe(II) is rapidly bound to enzymes or incorporated into the biosynthesis of iron-sulphur complexes. However, IRP2 is a sensitive marker of intracellular iron availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iwai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salahudeen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vashisht et al., 2009</xref>), and its induction following V-ATPase inhibition is consistent with depletion of ferrous iron. Furthermore, our in vitro hydroxylation assay clearly shows that supplementation with Fe(II) can completely restore prolyl hydroxylation of HIF1α, confirming that V-ATPase inhibition reduces the available pool of intracellular Fe(II).</p><p>The V-ATPase is not only implicated in iron uptake and conversion to Fe(II), but also required for the release of iron from ferritin stores via ferritinophagy. Using HIF1α stabilisation as a sensitive marker for intracellular iron, we find that inhibition or disruption of the V-ATPase both alters iron uptake and degradation of ferritin. However, HIF1α was only stabilised in the transferrin receptor deficient cells, implying that increased ferritin turnover is not sufficient to compensate for prolonged loss of transferrin-mediated iron uptake. Conversely, while loss of NCOA4 activated IRP2, there was still sufficient intracellular iron for PHDs to function and HIF1α was not stabilised. These findings are consistent with decreased transferrin uptake and conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) being the predominant mechanisms for reduced PHD activity when the V-ATPase is inhibited, and highlight the relative importance of iron uptake versus release from intracellular stores. Interestingly, Fe(III) supplementation to the media was sufficient to restore HIF1α turnover when the V-ATPase was inhibited or following depletion of the transferrin receptor. Thus, transferrin-independent uptake of iron can occur when there is sufficient extracellular iron availability, presumably by transporters such as Zip14, which mediate non-transferrin bound iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liuzzi et al., 2006</xref>). It will be of interest to explore the biological implications of transferrin-independent mechanisms and the role of ferritinophagy in future studies. Moreover, it is plausible that HIF activation and V-ATPase activity serve as a feedback mechanism to control intracellular iron, particularly as HIFs promote genes involved in iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pantopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peyssonnaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simpson and McKie, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The identification of TMEM199 and CCDC115 as V-ATPase assembly proteins has interesting implications for our understanding of how the human V-ATPase complex forms. In yeast, Vma12p and Vma22p dimerise and are thought to promote the assembly of the membrane embedded complex (V0), which can subsequently associate with the peripheral complex (V1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill and Stevens, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirata et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jansen et al., 2016c</xref>). Similarly to the yeast Vma12 studies, we find that TMEM199 is predominantly localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, implying that it is likely to be involved in V-ATPase assembly, rather than forming part of the mature complex. Human germline mutations in TMEM199 and CCDC115 cause disorders with a liver storage disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansen et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2016c</xref>) and it remains to be determined how impaired glycosylation relates to V-ATPase function, or if these defects relate to other roles of TMEM199 and CCDC115. However, it is of interest that all described TMEM199 and CCDC115 human mutations have impaired glycosylation of transferrin, suggesting a role for the V-ATPase associated factors in iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jansen et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2016c</xref>). ATP6AP1 (also known as Ac45) was also identified in our forward genetic screen and has recently been identified as the human orthologue of the yeast Voa1 V-ATPase assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2016a</xref>). Human mutations in ATP6AP1 have a distinct phenotype to that of TMEM199 and CCDC115 mutations, resulting in immunodeficiency as well as abnormal glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2016a</xref>). Furthermore, human mutations in another V-ATPase assembly factor, VMA21, cause an autophagic myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramachandran et al., 2013</xref>). The explanation for the diverse nature of human diseases caused by mutations in V-ATPase assembly factors is unclear. Moreover, while yeast studies support the role of Vma12p, Vma21p and Vma22p in V-ATPase assembly, this has not been studied in mammalian cells, where they may serve additional regulatory functions on V-ATPase activity. Addressing the pathological role of these human V-ATPase mutations on iron metabolism and HIFs in animal models will be important in future studies. Nevertheless, our findings show that V-ATPase activity can alter HIF signalling through regulating intracellular iron.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, antibodies and reagents</title><p>HeLa, HEK293T and RCC10 cells were cultured and maintained at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Calf Serum (HyClone) and 100IU/ml Penicillin G and 100 µg/ml Streptomycin.

Based on a genetic screen the authors identify several subunits of V-ATPase to control degradation of HIF1α under normoxic conditions. The authors correlate the activity of prolyl hydroxylases, which flag HIF1α for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with the import of iron provided by the endocytic pathway. The manuscript reports that supplementation of iron rescues stabilization of HIF1α induced both by chemical (bafilomycin A) and genetic inhibition of V-ATPase. In addition to mere stabilization of HIF1α, the authors demonstrate the activation of HIF1 target genes proving that the inhibition of V-ATPase can trigger a hypoxic program.</p><p>The manuscript presents a suggestive set of data in favor of authors' conclusion, yet it lacks full verification of the claims. The effect of iron depletion on HIF1α by a means that is independent on inhibition or depletion of V-ATPase should be determined. In addition, the authors should provide more evidence that HIF1α stabilization due to V-ATPase inhibition is mediated by PHD activity, and not by the increase in mRNA levels, or other mechanisms leading to the accumulation of non-hydroxylated pool of HIF1α. The existing data linking iron and PHD activity should be presented.</p><p>The authors identified the novel assembly factors of V-ATPase TMEM199 and CCDC115, which are orthologues of yeast Vma12p and Vma22p and similarly to V-ATPase subunits influence the stability of HIF1α protein. The authors confirm interaction between both proteins via co-immunoprecipitation, verify their cellular localization and show that V-ATPase functionally depends on these proteins. Thus, they are good candidates for assembly factors. To fully support authors' conclusion, the integrity of V-ATPase could be addressed via Western blot and immunoprecipitation. To strengthen the link between V-ATPase biogenesis and function, the uptake of iron by the cells depleted of TMEM199 and CCDC115 should be determined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors have screened for cellular proteins that contribute to the degradation of HIF1 α under conditions of oxygen sufficiency. They identify components of the lysosomal V-ATPase and two uncharacterized proteins that may function as V-ATPase assembly factors. Examination of the activity of the prolyl hydroxylase that mediates the HIF hydroxylation that leads to degradation reveals that when the V-ATPase is inhibited, PHD activity is reduced. They trace this loss of PHD activity to cytosolic depletion of the iron cofactor.</p><p>The authors have taken a relatively important biological question (how is the HIF transcription factor regulated) and used a broad, relatively low-bias, forward genetic screen (gene trapping in a near-haploid cell line) to identify genes involved in HIF degradation in aerobic conditions. What they found (components of the V-ATPase) is fairly well-supported by the evidence and the mechanism they propose (impaired iron uptake) makes sense biologically.</p><p>I have two major concerns with these studies in their current form.</p><p>First, the evidence that TMEM199 and CCDC115 are V-ATPase assembly factors is not as strong as it could be. Several approaches could be useful in strengthening this aspect of the manuscript. The authors present a single assay of lysosomal function, the degradation of EGFR. While these data are consistent with their hypothesis, it would be strengthened if additional evidence were presented. Is the acidification of the lysosome impaired in the absence of these factors? A pH-sensitive fluorescent dye is available and could easily be used here. Will the yeast homologues of these proteins substitute for their human counterparts in a human cell lacking TMEM or CCDC? Are any proteins (other than EGFR) that are turned over in the lysosome and are also affected by depletion of these proteins?</p><p>A second concern is that the authors attribute the loss of PHD activity to a loss of iron uptake in the V-ATPase-deficient cells. Cytosolic iron levels are maintained by uptake, yes, but also by the balance between storage and mobilization of iron in ferritin. Ferritin is turned over in the lysosome by an autophagic process that requires the cargo receptor NCOA4 and an appropriately acidified lysosome. While the authors show that increased iron uptake after external iron supplementation will restore cytosolic iron levels and lead to PHD activation, the defect associated with the V-ATPase may not be defective iron uptake, but defective iron recycling from ferritin. The rapid onset of PHD inactivation, even in cells pre-loaded with iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggests this may be the case. Drugs that inhibit the lysosomal V-ATPase, e. g., bafilomycin A, will also inhibit the acidification of the endosome, so these drugs don't really distinguish between impaired uptake of iron and impaired turnover of ferritin. The authors should clarify this experimentally. Iron uptake may be measured directly in assays using stable or radioactive isotopes of iron. Although direct measurement of cytosolic iron levels is technically fraught, as the authors explain, indirect measurements are possible, however. Iron Regulatory Protein 2 is rapidly degraded via the proteasome in iron-replete cells and is a good indicator of cytosolic iron availability. If the author's iron hypothesis is correct, IRP2 levels should increase with inhibition of the V-ATPase. Proteins involved in autophagic delivery of ferritin to the lysosome could be depleted and PHD activity measured. This approach would add additional clarity to the mechanism of iron depletion. As this is the most novel aspect of these studies, it represents an important opportunity for novel and significant observations.</p><p>The concerns I outlined above are important, because the role of the two new proteins as assembly factors is far from certain and they should present stronger evidence using more than one experimental approach to support their claim. My second concern is equally important. Investigators in the iron field have not focused on the regulation of ferritin turnover until very recently because the genetic components that carry out the turnover have only recently been identified. The role of ferritin turnover in the lysosome is the potentially novel finding in this study. We already know that PHD is an iron-dependent enzyme and that chelators that block iron uptake will lead to inactivation of PHD. We already know that drugs that inhibit the V-ATPase will inhibit the uptake of Tf-bound iron, but this effect is kind of small in cultured cells unless you treat for many hours. What we don't know is the relative importance of the flow of iron through ferritin and the turnover of ferritin in the lysosome in maintaining cytosolic iron levels and the activity of cytosolic iron enzymes. They should take a look at this before they ascribe their effects to impaired uptake. If the authors choose not to do further studies, then they must acknowledge the ambiguity and inconclusive nature of their results. Furthermore, the impact and significance of these studies will be lessened.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Degradative pathways of HIF have been well studied, however precise mechanisms and role in hypoxia mediated cell effects are still not clear. The major pathway by which HIF is regulated is through a proteasomal degradation pathway initiated by PHD-dependent hydroxylation of HIF. However, it has been shown that altering lysosomal and chaperone-mediated autophagy can also lead to HIF activation. The present work through a novel forward genetic screen identified several lysosomal V-ATPases that lead to increased HIF-1α expression. Interestingly, this is not via direct lysosomal degradation pathway that was previously shown. The strength of the manuscript is the novel mechanism downstream of lysosomal function. The authors show that HIF-1α stabilization following V-ATPase disruption or inhibition is via changes in cellular iron levels. It is clear that several stimuli and several different mechanisms can alter HIF-1α expression and activity. This work provides interesting downstream mechanism from lysosomes, but understanding the physiological or pathological context of this pathway in HIF-1α activation is missing. Along the same lines, as the author's state there are several diseases due to V-ATPase mutations, some experimental data would be important to show that the initiation or progression of these disease are related to iron handling and/or HIF-1α activation.</p><p>The authors rule out CMA pathways due to no effect following disruption of HSC70 and LAMP2A. However, HSC70 disruption is not efficient. Similarly, LAMP2A disruption is not complete and it is not clear if this is specific for LAMP2A or are all LAMP2 isoforms reduced. The authors must demonstrate that indeed CMA is reduced by showing that degradation of well-characterized targets of CMA are altered.</p><p>The authors state, &quot;HIF activation and V-ATPase activity serves as a feedback mechanism to control iron uptake, particularly as HIFs promote iron uptake under conditions of iron deficiency&quot;. HIF-2α is the major isoform that leads to iron uptake, if this pathway is an important feedback mechanism for cellular iron response HIF-2α expression and activity should be assessed.</p><p>Similar to what is shown following BafA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, increase in HIF-1α target gene following ATP6V1a1, TMEM199, and CCDC115 disruption would be important to demonstrate the increase in HIF-1α is functional.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22693.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>As you will see from the individual comments of the Referees appended below, the findings of this work were found interesting but too preliminary.

The iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) has been extensively used to demonstrate the requirement for ferrous iron in PHD function (e.g. PMID 11292861 and 8260699) (subsection “Disrupting the V-ATPase decreases intracellular iron levels and prevents HIF1α prolyl hydroxylation”, second paragraph). To corroborate existing data we show (i) that DFO treatment prevents HIF1α hydroxylation in ourin vitroassay (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref>), and (ii) DFO treatment in cells stabilises our HIF1α-GFP reporter and endogenous HIF1α (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C, D</xref>). Importantly, HIF1α stabilisation by DFO is reversed by culturing the cells with iron (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C, D</xref>), similarly to BafA treatment with iron supplementation.</p><p>We demonstrated that HIF1α mRNA levels do not alter following V-ATPase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>), and have made this point clearer in the revised manuscript (subsection “Iron supplementation restores HIF1α turnover in cells when V-ATPase activity is disrupted”, first paragraph). Our in vitro and cell assays also clearly show that PHD activity is impaired by V-ATPase inhibition. Importantly, prolyl hydroxylation and HIF1α turnover is restored with iron treatment, which strongly argues against a PHD independent mechanism for HIF1α stabilisation.</p><p><italic>The authors identified the novel assembly factors of V-ATPase TMEM199 and CCDC115, which are orthologues of yeast Vma12p and Vma22p and similarly to V-ATPase subunits influence the stability of HIF1α protein.

We have therefore focused on the functional integrity of the V-ATPase when TMEM199 or CCDC115 are depleted, by measuring endosomal acidification. Using a pH sensitive transferrin receptor, with a phlourin attached to the extracellular domain (Tfnr-phl) (PMID 15907472), we now show that TMEM199 and CCDC115 depletion prevents acidification of endosomal compartments, similarly to BafA treatment or depletion of core V-ATPase subunits (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This localisation of Tfnr-phl to neutral compartments also strengthens the link between iron metabolism and the V-ATPase, as the release of iron from transferrin requires a low pH (e.g. PMID 21788477 and 16227996). Please also see comments to Reviewer 2 with regard to iron uptake and studies of iron metabolism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I have two major concerns with these studies in their current form.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, the evidence that TMEM199 and CCDC115 are V-ATPase assembly factors is not as strong as it could be.

We find that TMEM199 and CCDC115 depletion prevent acidification of endosomal compartments, similarly to BafA treatment or depletion of core V-ATPase subunits (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, both TMEM199 and CCDC115 are required for endosomal acidification by the V-ATPase.</p><p>2) To further examine the degradative consequences of V-ATPase inhibition or disruption we measured lysosomal degradation of MHC Class I. The KSHV gene product, K3, ubiquitinates MHC Class I at the cell surface, facilitating Class I clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. This pathway has been extensively studied and provides a robust experimental model to examine lysosomal degradation (PMID 12006494, 10799607 and 8260699). Using K3 expressing HeLa cells we show that TMEM199 and CCDC115 depletion increases MHC Class I expression at the cell surface and prevents Class I degradation (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also observe similar results with depletion of known V-ATPase components (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>3) The role of TMEM199 and CCDC115 in lysosomal degradation is also supported by the increase in NCOA4 protein levels in TMEM199 or CCDC115 deficient cells. We show that NCOA4, the autophagy cargo receptor, accumulates in TMEM199 or CCDC115 depleted HeLa cells, similarly to depletion of core V-ATPase subunits or BafA treatment (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>).</p><p>In combination, these studies of endosomal acidification and lysosomal degradation strongly support a role for TMEM199 and CCDC115 in V-ATPase function. The genetic complementation studies suggested by this reviewer were also a valid suggestion, which we had already tried. However, neither TMEM199 nor CCDC115 complemented the yeast Vma12/Vma22 mutant phenotypes, and Vma12/22 did not prevent HIF1α stabilisation in the human TMEM199 or CCDC115 deficient cells. This is perhaps not surprising, given that the sequence identities are low.</p><p><italic>A second concern is that the authors attribute the loss of PHD activity to a loss of iron uptake in the V-ATPase-deficient cells. Cytosolic iron levels are maintained by uptake, yes, but also by the balance between storage and mobilization of iron in ferritin. Ferritin is turned over in the lysosome by an autophagic process that requires the cargo receptor NCOA4 and an appropriately acidified lysosome. While the authors show that increased iron uptake after external iron supplementation will restore cytosolic iron levels and lead to PHD activation, the defect associated with the V-ATPase may not be defective iron uptake, but defective iron recycling from ferritin. The rapid onset of PHD inactivation, even in cells pre-loaded with iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggests this may be the case. Drugs that inhibit the lysosomal V-ATPase, e. g., bafilomycin A, will also inhibit the acidification of the endosome, so these drugs don't really distinguish between impaired uptake of iron and impaired turnover of ferritin. The authors should clarify this experimentally. Iron uptake may be measured directly in assays using stable or radioactive isotopes of iron. Although direct measurement of cytosolic iron levels is technically fraught, as the authors explain, indirect measurements are possible, however. Iron Regulatory Protein 2 is rapidly degraded via the proteasome in iron-replete cells and is a good indicator of cytosolic iron availability. If the author's iron hypothesis is correct, IRP2 levels should increase with inhibition of the V-ATPase. Proteins involved in autophagic delivery of ferritin to the lysosome could be depleted and PHD activity measured. This approach would add additional clarity to the mechanism of iron depletion. As this is the most novel aspect of these studies, it represents an important opportunity for novel and significant observations.</italic> </p><p><italic>The concerns I outlined above are important, because the role of the two new proteins as assembly factors is far from certain and they should present stronger evidence using more than one experimental approach to support their claim. My second concern is equally important. Investigators in the iron field have not focused on the regulation of ferritin turnover until very recently because the genetic components that carry out the turnover have only recently been identified. The role of ferritin turnover in the lysosome is the potentially novel finding in this study. We already know that PHD is an iron-dependent enzyme and that chelators that block iron uptake will lead to inactivation of PHD. We already know that drugs that inhibit the V-ATPase will inhibit the uptake of Tf-bound iron, but this effect is kind of small in cultured cells unless you treat for many hours. What we don't know is the relative importance of the flow of iron through ferritin and the turnover of ferritin in the lysosome in maintaining cytosolic iron levels and the activity of cytosolic iron enzymes. They should take a look at this before they ascribe their effects to impaired uptake. If the authors choose not to do further studies, then they must acknowledge the ambiguity and inconclusive nature of their results. Furthermore, the impact and significance of these studies will be lessened.</italic> </p><p>The relationship between V-ATPase biogenesis and function with regard to iron metabolism is an important point that we were keen to address (see also comments to reviewer 1). The focus on iron uptake as the sole mechanism for HIF1α stabilisation following V-ATPase inhibition was not intended, particularly as the conversion of ferric to ferrous iron requires acidification of endosomes (e.g. PMID 21788477 and 16227996), and we should have made this clearer in the manuscript. Kozik et al. already provide evidence for BafA and siRNA-depletion of V-ATPase preventing iron/transferrin uptake and recycling of the transferrin receptor (PMID 23263279). However, as the V-ATPase is not only involved in iron uptake, we now include several new experiments that confirm TMEM199 or CCCDC115 depletion leads to decreased intracellular iron levels:</p><p>1) We demonstrate that Tfnr-phl is visualised in non-acidified endosomal compartments (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As low pH is required for iron release from the transferrin receptor and conversion to the ferrous form, these experiments are consistent with V-ATPase inhibition leading to cytosolic iron depletion.</p><p>2) We have measured IRP2 (IREB2), NCOA4 and ferritin levels following BafA treatment or depletion of V-ATPase subunits to confirm that cytosolic iron is reduced and to explore ferritin recycling (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). IRP2 levels increase following BafA treatment, similarly to levels observed with DFO, confirming that V-ATPase inhibition causes cytosolic iron depletion. NCOA4 markedly accumulates following BafA treatment, consistent with a block in autophagic lysosomal degradation. However, unlike DFO treatment, where NCOA4 increases and ferritin is degraded, BafA treatment does not affect ferritin levels, as autophagy is blocked. We also show that depletion of either known V-ATPase subunits or TMEM199/CCDC115 increase IRP2 expression and NCOA4 similarly to BafA treatment, providing further evidence that disrupting the V-ATPase results in cytosolic iron depletion (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>).</p><p>3) To further delineate the importance of iron uptake compared to recycling we have depleted several key components of iron homeostasis (NCOA4, IRP2 and the transferrin receptor) and measured their ability to stabilise HIF1α (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Mixed populations of transferrin receptor KOs markedly increased HIF1α levels, with IRP2 depletion having a modest effect. Thus, decreasing iron uptake or disrupting iron sensing can lead to intracellular iron depletion. However, no change in HIF1α levels were observed in the NCOA4 KOs at various time points post transduction (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B-D</xref>). Interestingly, NCOA4 depletion did increase the levels of IRP2, but transferrin receptor and ferritin levels did not change, suggesting that upregulating iron flux through the endosomal pathway is sufficient to maintain intracellular iron levels when NCOA4 is depleted (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>4) We also examined the effect of iron supplementation on mixed populations of transferrin receptor null cells. Iron treatment restored HIF1α turnover (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G, H</xref>), suggesting that iron can be taken up from cells by a transferrin independent mechanism. Defining the nature of this transferrin independent mechanism is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but it is likely to involve transporters such as Zip14, which are known to be involved in non-transferrin-bound iron uptake (PMID 16950869) (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Together, these new findings suggest that decreasing iron uptake and release from acidic endosomes is the dominant mechanism for HIF1α stabilisation following V-ATPase inhibition, although there is a contribution of NCOA4 to maintaining iron homeostasis by activating IRP2 (Discussion, fourth paragraph). We believe these additional experiments on iron metabolism have significantly strengthened the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Degradative pathways of HIF have been well studied, however precise mechanisms and role in hypoxia mediated cell effects are still not clear. The major pathway by which HIF is regulated is through a proteasomal degradation pathway initiated by PHD-dependent hydroxylation of HIF. However, it has been shown that altering lysosomal and chaperone-mediated autophagy can also lead to HIF activation. The present work through a novel forward genetic screen identified several lysosomal V-ATPases that lead to increased HIF-1α expression. Interestingly, this is not via direct lysosomal degradation pathway that was previously shown. The strength of the manuscript is the novel mechanism downstream of lysosomal function. The authors show that HIF-1α stabilization following V-ATPase disruption or inhibition is via changes in cellular iron levels. It is clear that several stimuli and several different mechanisms can alter HIF-1α expression and activity. This work provides interesting downstream mechanism from lysosomes, but understanding the physiological or pathological context of this pathway in HIF-1α activation is missing. Along the same lines, as the author's state there are several diseases due to V-ATPase mutations, some experimental data would be important to show that the initiation or progression of these disease are related to iron handling and/or HIF-1α activation.</italic> </p><p>We were pleased that this reviewer found our mechanistic studies interesting and novel. We agree that exploring the physiological and pathological role of the V-ATPase in iron metabolism and HIF signalling will be important, and forms the basis of our future studies. However, this work will likely involve establishing transgenic animal models and is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Without such models, we can only speculate as to the importance of iron handling and HIFs in the disease process, which we now make clear in the revision. Interestingly, some existing data does already support a role for TMEM199 and CCDC115 in iron metabolism, as patients with these mutations have impaired transferrin glycosylation. We have included this point in the revised text (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>The authors rule out CMA pathways due to no effect following disruption of HSC70 and LAMP2A. However, HSC70 disruption is not efficient. Similarly, LAMP2A disruption is not complete and it is not clear if this is specific for LAMP2A or are all LAMP2 isoforms reduced. The authors must demonstrate that indeed CMA is reduced by showing that degradation of well-characterized targets of CMA are altered.</italic> </p><p>The sgRNA were designed to target all forms of LAMP2 but the antibody only recognises LAMP2A. We have also now used siRNA to confirm that HSC70 depletion does not lead to HIF1α stabilisation (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, we apologise that we did not make our points sufficiently clear regarding CMA. Depletion of HSC70 and LAMP2 suggested that CMA is not involved in HIF1α degradation but confirmation that autophagy/lysosomal degradation is not responsible for HIF1α stabilisation is demonstrated by the BafA and iron supplementation experiments.</p><p>If any autophagy pathway were responsible for the stabilisation of HIF1α following V-ATPase inhibition, HIF1α turnover would not be rescued by iron treatment. To clarify this point we show that EGFR degradation is still impaired following BafA treatment, irrespective of iron supplementation (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). Furthermore, NCOA4, an autophagy cargo receptor, still accumulates in BafA and iron treated cells (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10H</xref>). Together, these findings providing clear evidence that autophagy is still blocked following BafA and iron treatment, and therefore CMA or any other pathway leading to lysosomal degradation cannot be responsible for the restoration of HIF1α degradation we observe. This has been clarified in the main text (Discussion).</p><p><italic>The authors state, &quot;HIF activation and V-ATPase activity serves as a feedback mechanism to control iron uptake, particularly as HIFs promote iron uptake under conditions of iron deficiency&quot;. HIF-2α is the major isoform that leads to iron uptake, if this pathway is an important feedback mechanism for cellular iron response HIF-2α expression and activity should be assessed.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point we were keen to address. We find that HIF2α is also stabilised in HeLa cells by BafA treatment or depletion of V-ATPase subunits, similarly to HIF1α (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In addition, we find that Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1, also known as HMOX1), a predominantly HIF2α target gene (PMID 19706526) that degrades heme and releases iron, is also upregulated (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p><italic>Similar to what is shown following BafA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, increase in HIF-1α target gene following ATP6V1a1, TMEM199, and CCDC115 disruption would be important to demonstrate the increase in HIF-1α is functional.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is important to show that HIF1α is functional following depletion of TMEM199, CCDC115 or core V-ATPase subunits, and now include data showing the well validated HIF1 target, Carbonic Anhydrase 9, is induced (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
