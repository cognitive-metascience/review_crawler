Recent studies using fast-freeze electron microscopy and capacitance measurements reported an ultrafast mode of endocytosis operating at physiological temperatures. Here, using rat hippocampal neurons, we optically monitored single synaptic vesicle endocytosis with high time resolution using the vesicular glutamate transporter, synaptophysin and the V0a1 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase as probes. In this setting, we could distinguish three components of retrieval operating at ultrafast (~150–250 ms, ~20% of events), fast (~5–12 s, ~40% of events) and ultraslow speeds (&gt;20 s, ~40% of events). While increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> slowed the fast events, increasing temperature accelerated their time course. In contrast, the kinetics of ultrafast events were only mildly affected by these manipulations. These results suggest that synaptic vesicle proteins can be retrieved with ultrafast kinetics, although a majority of evoked fusion events are coupled to slower retrieval mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36097.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells or neurons exchange information at junctions called synapses. To send a message to its neighbor, a neuron must release molecules called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These then bind to receptor proteins on the neighboring cell. But neurons do not release neurotransmitter molecules one at a time. Instead they release them in packages called vesicles. Each vesicle contains about 1,000 molecules, which it releases by fusing with the cell membrane. The entire process takes less than one thousandth of a second.</p><p>Synaptic vesicles are complex structures made up of many different proteins and lipids. To help ensure that neurons do not run out of vesicles, cells retrieve and recycle these components via a process called endocytosis. A number of studies have attempted to measure how long this retrieval process takes. But the studies – which used a variety of different techniques – yielded results ranging from a few hundredths of a second to more than a minute.</p><p>Chanaday and Kavalali have now resolved this discrepancy by using fluorescence microscopy to study the retrieval process in rat brain cells. By attaching a fluorescent tag to specific molecules within the vesicle membrane, Chanaday and Kavalali were able to track individual vesicles. The results revealed that neurons retrieve vesicles from synapses via three different pathways. At temperatures like those in the rodent or human body, an ‘ultraslow’ pathway takes more than 20 seconds to retrieve vesicles. By contrast, a ‘fast’ pathway takes about 5 to 12 seconds. The quickest option, an ‘ultrafast’ pathway, retrieves vesicles in about 150 to 250 milliseconds. Increasing the temperature speeds up the fast pathway but has no effect on the ultrafast pathway.</p><p>Neurons can thus retrieve vesicles from synapses in about 200 milliseconds, or one fifth of a second. Nevertheless, they retrieve about 80% of their vesicles using the two slower pathways. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for vesicle retrieval will help reveal how synapses work, as well as what can go wrong. Changes in components of synaptic vesicles contribute to several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Developing drugs that target synaptic vesicle recycling could be a promising therapeutic avenue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic vesicle recycling</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>single vesicle release</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH066198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single synaptic vesicle imaging shows that kinetically distinct endocytic pathways are differentially regulated by calcium and temperature, and influence the fidelity of synaptic vesicle protein retrieval.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses form the basic computational units in the brain as they transfer and process information with exquisite temporal and spatial precision. In presynaptic terminals, this is achieved through fast neurotransmitter release via fusion of synaptic vesicles within hundreds of microseconds upon the arrival of a presynaptic action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Südhof, 2013</xref>). In order to maintain synaptic performance during activity, synaptic vesicle proteins and lipids need to be retrieved and recycled. In contrast to the rapidity of the synaptic vesicle fusion process, the time course of endocytosis and its temporal relationship to presynaptic activity are widely debated. Early studies using electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence imaging with FM dyes postulated retrieval and recycling of synaptic vesicles to occur within 30—90 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller and Heuser, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>). However, subsequent experiments proposed a faster time course — spanning only about 2 s — for synaptic vesicle endocytosis based on capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</xref>), a time course also corroborated by FM dye-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingauf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kavalali et al., 1999</xref>). In recent years, experiments using fast-freeze EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) or improved capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>) produced estimates within 100—500 ms for synaptic vesicle retrieval in central synapses. This so-called ultrafast synaptic endocytosis appeared to predominantly occur near physiological temperatures (~36°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe and Boucrot, 2017</xref>). In contrast, experiments using synaptic vesicle proteins labeled with pHluorin (a pH-sensitive derivative of GFP) to optically monitor single synaptic vesicle endocytosis gave rise to variable and often contradicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>) with the extra complication that these studies were typically conducted at room temperature.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to monitor retrieval of single synaptic vesicles with improved time resolution at near physiological temperatures to resolve the discrepancies between fast EM and capacitance measurements and optical approaches. Besides enabling direct visualization of single vesicle retrieval kinetics, visualizing pHluorin-tagged synaptic vesicle protein dynamics provides the unique advantage of examining synaptic vesicle retrieval in a molecularly specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kavalali and Jorgensen, 2014</xref>). Under these conditions, using fluorescently tagged vesicular glutamate transporter, synaptophysin and V0a1 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase as probes, we detected three components of synaptic vesicle endocytosis: ultrafast (~150–250 ms), fast (~5–12 s) and ultraslow (&gt;20 s). This indicates that multiple endocytic pathways with different kinetics are operating at presynaptic terminals. Interestingly, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> and temperature were robust regulators of fast events, the kinetics of ultrafast events were relatively impervious to these manipulations. Overall, these results provide a bridge between dynamic optical measurements of synaptic vesicle protein retrieval and EM or capacitance based methods that monitor membrane trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring endocytosis with vGluT1-pHluorin</title><p>The vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) bound to the pH sensitive derivative of GFP, pHluorin has been widely used to track synaptic vesicle trafficking based on its low plasma membrane expression and high signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). The pHluorin fluorescence is quenched in the acidic environment of the synaptic vesicle lumen and peaks after fusion with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Under strong stimulation (e.g. 40 Hz 5 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), recapture of synaptic proteins from the plasma membrane results in a decay in fluorescence, reflecting synaptic vesicle retrieval and subsequent vesicle re-acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At room temperature (~24°C), increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2 mM to 8 mM leads to an increase in the number of fused vesicles (seen as an increase in peak amplitude) and a slight increase in the decay time, suggesting saturation of the endocytic machinery under strong, repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Earlier studies have demonstrated that at physiological temperatures (34–36°C) the time course of bulk synaptic vesicle endocytosis seen after strong stimulation shows accelerated kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>) possibly via activation of ultrafast endocytosis mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with this premise, in our experiments, increasing the temperature from ~24 to 34°C led to a ~ 2.5 fold decrease in the fluorescence decay time constants after 40 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

At the single vesicle level, fluorescence dwell times detected after fusion are representative of the time the pHluorin-tagged protein resides at the presynaptic plasma membrane before being retrieved. For action potential (AP) evoked release the kinetics of this process is negatively regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in a synaptotagmin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). To visualize potential ultrafast retrieval of single synaptic vesicles, we monitored single fusion events at near physiological temperatures. Moreover, we increased the time resolution of our measurements, by a combination of faster image acquisition settings and time-domain de-noising of fluorescence signals based on methods originally developed to de-noise electrophysiological single channel recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>). This non-linear algorithm consists of a series of backward and forward predictors, similar to moving averages, used to calculate the probability of occurrence of fast changes in the signal, i.e. sharp changes in amplitude above the noise, in a Bayesian framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This type of noise reduction preserves the amplitude of the measured signal without major distortion of the edges compared to other classical methods based on the fast Fourier transform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the filtering method we used assumes Gaussian distribution of the noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>), we first validated that our experimental noise shows a Gaussian distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These new settings enabled us to probe the fastest rate at which synaptic vesicle protein retrieval takes place at physiological temperatures. Noise reduction of the fluorescence traces from each region of interest (ROI) allowed us to detect small amplitude fusion events and reliably estimate release probability using failure analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, dwell times of the fluorescent probe at the plasma membrane prior to retrieval could be determined with higher precision, enabling a clear discrimination between dwell times and the subsequent decay in fluorescence due to reacidification. Dwell time was defined as the total time after fusion that maintains maximum (peak) amplitude until the first derivative starts to be negative (due to re-acidification and the consequent decay of the signal). To estimate the accuracy of our event detection algorithm, we generated negative imaging controls with no stimulation in the presence of TTX or in 0 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> following EGTA-AM treatment to buffer intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In these control experiments, we detected events with a probability of ~0.03% or less (likely reflecting false positives along with spontaneous fusion events), well within acceptable boundaries (~5 fold less than typical event detection rate under normal conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). To assess the precision of the dwell time calculation, artificial traces with different release probabilities and dwell time distributions were simulated and similarly de-noised and analyzed. This analysis corroborated the limited contribution of false positives to the dwell time durations obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). In conclusion, all these experimental and simulated controls enabled us to tune the de-noising parameters to analyze the duration of dwell times in the experimental traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36097.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Signal de-noising increases the accuracy of detection and analysis of single synaptic vesicle fusion events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formulas and schematic representation of the Chung – Kennedy non-linear filter (for detailed explanation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, mean release probability at 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is ~0.15, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>). Increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 8 mM leads to a marked increase in release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>), although switching from room temperature (~24°C) to 34°C, did not result in a major change in release probability, consistent with previous electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kushmerick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pyott and Rosenmund, 2002</xref>). Initially, we detected that 40 ± 2% of all fusion events did not return to baseline during the course of imaging (&gt;20 s, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) suggesting an ultraslow pathway for endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining events (~60%) showed dwell times of variable lengths which displayed a non-normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>) with a peak at ~250 ms. Further analysis of the histograms revealed that they are best represented by a double exponential decay function, pointing to the co-existence of two endocytic mechanisms with different mean rates. The fitting of dwell time distributions for the experimental groups revealed an ultrafast endocytic component with an average time course of about 150–250 ms, and a fast process that proceeds with an order of magnitude slower time course of around 5–12 s (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). Increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2 to 8 mM led to only a 10–15% slowdown of ultrafast endocytosis at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). The fast component of endocytosis, on the other hand, showed a steeper temperature dependence. Increasing extracellular calcium concentration from 2 to 8 mM led to a ~ 60% slowdown of fast endocytosis at 24°C, while increasing calcium at 34°C led to only a ~ 10% slowdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). This result indicates that increasing temperature triggers an overall acceleration of vGluT1-pHluorin retrieval mainly through regulation of the fast component of endocytosis, and this form of regulation is more evident at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (compare insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G</xref>). Kolmogorov-Smirnov pair-wise comparison of cumulative distributions, as well as Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variances, further corroborated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and temperature had a significant effect on the shift of the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>, legend). While the mean speed of endocytosis for both fast and ultrafast pathways was regulated by temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the relative contribution of each mode to total protein retrieval did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Overall under all conditions around 40% of fusion events were not followed by endocytosis in the imaging period (&gt;20 s), 13–18% undergo ultrafast endocytosis and 38–48% of vGluT1-pHluorins were retrieved through a slow pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The mean amplitude of fusion events was similar for all types of retrieval (data not shown). In addition, to test whether the two components of retrieval we identified were a consequence of denoising, we averaged non-denoised traces in an unbiased manner and found two phases of fluorescence decay with ultrafast (~250 ms) and fast kinetics (~3–7 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although, this analysis does not distinguish dwell time and re-acidification kinetics, it supports our conclusion that two kinetically distinct processes retrieve vesicle proteins with ultrafast and fast speeds. Interestingly, in neurons where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) was knocked-down (KD) the fast component is greatly reduced and vGluT1-pHluorin is retrieved almost exclusively by ultrafast endocytosis (70–80% of all fusion events, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), suggesting that ultrafast endocytosis is syt1-independent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, ultraslow retrieval (&gt;20 s) is also abolished in syt1 KD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was not the case for synaptotagmin-7 (syt7) KD neurons, where averaged single vesicle traces showed a double exponential decay (τ<sub>1</sub> = 0.31 ± 0.05 s, τ<sub>2</sub> = 8.5 ± 4.8 s) similarly to control synapses. Taken together, these results indicate that the speed of fast single vesicle retrieval is markedly accelerated by temperature and slowed down by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, possibly through syt1, whereas the kinetics of ultrafast events are less sensitive to these factors.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36097.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>vGluT1-pHluorin reveals that endocytosis after single AP stimulation can occur through three kinetically distinct pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces of de-noised single synaptic vesicle fusion events measured with vGluT1-pHluorin, showing different dwell time lengths.

Among these, only in 50% the fluorescence returned back to baseline completely, consistent with full quantal retrieval of vGluT1-pHluorins (fractional retrieval of 1.0 ± 0.2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Approximately, 35% of the fusion events that were followed by a measurable dwell time, showed partial retrieval, indicating that some vGluT1-pHluorin molecules might diffuse away from the site of fusion and are temporarily unavailable for endocytosis. The remaining ~15% of events showed excess retrieval, suggesting that more vGluT1-pHluorin molecules were retrieved compared to the ones that fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), similar to what was described in other systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung and Kavalali, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Hook and Thoreson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Plotting the fraction of retrieval for each fusion event as a function of the duration of its dwell time revealed that the dispersion of retrieval values increased with longer dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). While the dispersion was ±20% for ultrafast events (dwell times of 0.0 to 0.5 s), for fast events dispersion increased from approximately ±40% to around ±80–90% as the values of dwell times increased (see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This increasing variability in the retrieved fraction occurred similarly for all the temperatures and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations tested. This result implies that as endocytosis gets slower, the probability of having partial retrieval of synaptic vesicle proteins or of having retrieval of double amount of protein compared to the amount that fused increases. As mentioned before, for neurons lacking syt1 the majority of fusion events were followed by ultrafast endocytosis, for these events vGluT1-pHluorin is endocytosed very efficiently, with ~80% of vGluT1-pHluorin fusion events showing quantal retrieval (1.0 ± 0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Our results suggest that ultrafast endocytosis is Ca<sup>2+</sup>, syt1 and temperature independent, and it rapidly retrieves approximately the same amount of protein that fused.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ultrafast and fast retrieval of synaptophysin and V0a1 subunit of the v-ATPase</title><p>Distinct synaptic vesicle proteins are typically coupled to diverse endocytic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanaday and Kavalali, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voglmaier and Edwards, 2007</xref>) Therefore, to evaluate the general validity of our results, we tested the trafficking of synaptophysin-1 fused to the red pH sensitive protein pHTomato (Syp1-pHTomato, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Tsien, 2012</xref>) under the same conditions. At 40 Hz stimulation, the increase of temperature from 24 to 34°C caused a ~ 2.5 fold rise in the bulk endocytic rate of Syp1-pHTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) coupled with a faster signal rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with our observations using vGluT1-pHluorin. At the single vesicle level, as before, we did not detect a change in release probability in response to increase in temperature (~0.15 at both tested temperatures) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Sample traces of single synaptic vesicle fusion events detected with Syp1-pHTomato are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Histograms of detectable dwell times (50 ± 2% of events) were best fitted with a double exponential, revealing the presence of two parallel endocytic processes for synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). The mean time courses of these two processes were about 175–300 ms and 5–11 s, comparable to our previous results with vGluT1-pHluorin (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). While the increase in temperature did not produce a significant effect in the overall endocytic rate at 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>, and inset in 5G), it caused an almost two-fold acceleration of retrieval at 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>, and inset in 5I). As observed for vGluT1-pHluorin, even though both ultrafast and fast processes are regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and temperature, the effect of these manipulations are more striking for the fast component and at 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Statistical analysis confirmed this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>, legend). In contrast, the charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> show that there is only a modest effect of temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the proportion of the different modes of endocytosis after single AP stimulation.

As discussed above, it is possible that they are not completely retrieved after fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gimber et al., 2015</xref>); and also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–H</xref>). In our experiments, about 40% of all vGluT1-pHluorin events and 50% of Syp1-pHTomato events do not show protein retrieval during the recording period, probably reflecting fully collapsed vesicles after fusion (ultraslow retrieval events). Taken together, these observations suggest that three modes of vesicle recycling take place; a mode where synaptic vesicle proteins remain at the surface membrane for extended time period albeit in a clustered fashion, an ultrafast mode of retrieval that occurs in the timescale of 150–300 ms, and a fast mode of endocytosis happening in the order of several seconds. To evaluate this premise further, we designed a probe with V0a1 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) responsible for vesicle acidification with pHluorin attached to one of its intraluminal loops (V0a1-pHluorin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). V-ATPase and its subunits show low levels of expression in synapses and they have a low copy number per synaptic vesicle (~1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Co-localization experiments revealed that V0a1-pHluorin is properly trafficked to synapses, with about 10–30% of the probe co-localizing with the presynaptic marker Synapsin-1, also showing a similar subcellular distribution to the endogenous V0a1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>) and similar to what was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagh et al., 2017</xref>). V0a1 over-expression or V0a1-pHluorin expression did not produce significant alterations in synaptic transmission, as indicated by similar to control single AP evoked response amplitudes and charge transfer, as well as similar paired-pulse ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). V0a1-pHluorin expression also had no effect on spontaneous, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes and frequency, and only caused a 2-fold increase in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) frequency, with no changes in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Application of a depolarizing high potassium solution accentuated synaptic localization and demonstrated activity-dependent trafficking of V0a1-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We used acid quenching (pH ~5) to suppress surface fluorescence followed by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl perfusion to alkalinize intracellular compartments and determined the ratio of intracellular and surface V0a1-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>). The subcellular distribution was highly variable among synapses, with ~40% of the probe present in internal organelles and ~60% on the plasma membrane on average, resembling what was described for endogenous V0a1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morel et al., 2003</xref>). Due to the low copy number per synapse, 40 Hz stimulation only led to a small increase in fluorescence, which could be clearly visualized after treatment with folimycin to prevent re-acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nevertheless, we could detect single vesicle fusion events in response to single AP stimulation albeit with a low probability where ~ 50% of the ROIs did not respond to stimulation. Application of v-ATPase inhibitor folimycin (200 μM) converted 80–90% of these events to a non-decaying time course with a monophasic distribution of amplitudes supporting their basis in quantal fusion of single vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). The distribution of V0a1-pHluorin dwell times at 34°C could be fitted with a double exponential decay, again reflecting ultrafast and fast time constants of ~250–300 ms and 3–10 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref>). As observed with the previous indicators, the time scale of the fast component of endocytosis was more sensitive to changes in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, showing more than two-fold decrease in speed compared to a ~ 30% slow down of the ultrafast component.

Nevertheless, to address this potential concern, we repeated the experiments using vGluT1-pHluorin at an imaging speed of 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), taking advantage of the considerable improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity added by signal de-noising (see negative controls and artificial traces test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–I</xref>).

The mean endocytic speed for the ultrafast component of the distribution is ~150–250 ms, 3–5 times higher than the Nyquist limit.

As the retrieval patterns of these three probes largely overlapped, we could draw conclusions not only on the kinetic pathways that govern the retrieval of individual proteins but also on retrieval of associated synaptic vesicles.</p><p>Visualization of vesicle retrieval was aided by rapid image acquisition settings and a time-domain signal de-noising algorithm adapted from earlier work focusing on estimation of ion channel kinetics parameters from single channel recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, in these experiments monitoring endocytosis of single synaptic vesicles following fusion helped us to uncouple regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion by temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the putative effects of these factors on retrieval. Since synaptic vesicle fusion occurs in a binary fashion, once a vesicle is fused its subsequent trajectory can be kinetically isolated from its fusion probability. Therefore, the nature of single vesicle fusion eliminates the requirement to normalize the extent of endocytosis to exocytosis and thus enables isolation of potential direct effects on endocytosis.</p><p>One of the pathways we visualized retrieved synaptic vesicle proteins with a time scale on the order of 200 milliseconds. This time frame is consistent with ultrafast endocytosis as the time course is an order of magnitude faster than earlier estimates of fast endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingauf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</xref>) and in line with the time scales detected in recent EM-based or capacitance-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the ultrafast retrieval of fluorescent probes, we also detected, as in earlier optical experiments, a ‘fast’ mode of endocytosis operating within seconds as well as an ultraslow form of trafficking where we could not reliably determine a decrease in signal after fusion for the duration of our optical recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the parallel operation of the three pathways persisted in response to changes in temperature or Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels as we did not observe major shifts in the relative segregation and composition of the dwell time distributions. However, the intrinsic kinetics of the fast pathway were modulated by temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the intrinsic kinetics of the ultrafast pathway were relatively unperturbed by these manipulations.</p><p>As indicated above, our estimates for the ultrafast endocytosis are in line with previous measurements using EM based methods or capacitance measurements in multiple systems. For instance, experiments using ‘flash-and-freeze’ electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) revealed an ultrafast pathway of endocytosis that takes place at physiological temperature, but is not present or measurable at room temperature. Through this mechanism large invaginations appeared as soon as 50 ms after optogenetic stimulation and fully endocytosed membranes, endosome-like closed structures, peaked at 100–300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequent capacitance measurements in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons corroborated this temperature-dependent ultrafast kinetics, revealing a mean time constant of ~470 ms for single AP evoked endocytic events only at 36°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, previous capacitance measurements in pituitary terminals as well as at the calyx of Held, which were performed at room temperature, reported the presence of fast flickering fusion pores in neurons with a mean open duration of ~300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klyachko and Jackson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2006</xref>). These fast flickering pores constituted around 20% of all exocytic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2006</xref>). In another report, the time constant of endocytosis after vesicle fusion was estimated to be in the order of 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). These earlier findings would imply that ultrafast retrieval could occur at room temperature. In agreement with this premise, our experiments show that endocytosis of distinct synaptic vesicle proteins after single AP stimulation occur through similar kinetically distinguishable mechanisms. The ultrafast endocytosis process we measured has a mean duration of 150–250 ms, consistent with the time course of ultrafast endocytosis reported previously. Importantly, the fastest speed at which synaptic vesicle proteins can be fully retrieved after exocytosis seems to be ~150 ms, since the probability distribution of dwell times shows a dramatic reduction for shorter times. In our measurements, the mean speed of ultrafast endocytosis was only mildly affected either by changes in temperature or Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, suggesting that the underlying molecular mechanism is insensitive to these factors and probably already operating at the limiting speed. The vast majority of ultrafast endocytotic events in our experiments showed quantal retrieval — that is the same number of proteins that fused were retrieved — indicating that synaptic vesicle molecular identity can be conserved through ultrafast endocytosis. One possible mechanism underlying this observation could be the re-closure of the fusion pore (compatible with kiss-and-run) where proteins remain on the synaptic vesicle membrane and are unable to diffuse away to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</xref>). Additionally, the high efficiency in protein retrieval during ultrafast endocytosis could also be explained by a mechanism where synaptic vesicle components, lipids and proteins, remain clustered in the plasma membrane after fusion as was proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Opazo and Rizzoli, 2010</xref>). Subsequently, these clusters could be rapidly retrieved following a mechanism similar to the one found using rapid freeze EM methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results showed that at the level of single vesicle retrieval, Ca<sup>2+</sup> appears to predominantly target fast events that occur in the order of seconds but leave the time course of ultrafast events relatively unperturbed. Recent work from our group showed that synaptotagmins, besides their role in coupling fusion to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, can also regulate the endocytic time course of single vesicle fusion events in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Particularly, in the absence of the main Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for synchronous release, syt1, ~80% of endocytosis occurs only through a rapid retrieval mechanism – less than 1 s – with no detectable delays (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, in the absence of syt1 we detected very limited excess or partial retrieval of synaptic vesicle proteins. This finding suggests that the syt1-dependent delay in vesicle retrieval kinetics also to some extent disrupts the fidelity of vesicle protein retrieval, possibly facilitating the generation of vesicles with diverse protein compositions during retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford and Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raingo et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetics of single vesicle protein retrieval are not altered by syt7 knock down and knocking down syt7 on top of syt1 KD does not further accelerates endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these results raise the possibility that ultrafast endocytosis is relatively syt1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, while fast endocytosis might be regulated by these factors, supporting the notion that different molecular pathways govern the two processes. Previous reports of ultrafast endocytosis showed that it does not involve a clathrin-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>), but it is dependent on actin. In this regard, a recent study implicated formins — actin remodeling proteins that serve several cell biological functions — in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in hippocampal synapses as well as at the calyx of Held terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, GTP and dynamin independent endocytosis have been proposed to coexist in neurons with dynamin-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Hook and Thoreson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together with our results, this indicates that a novel, still molecularly uncharacterized mechanism may operate independently of the classical endocytic machinery and synchronize synaptic vesicle retrieval with fusion in the timescale of milliseconds. As mentioned before, a tempting mechanism that fits this description is kiss-and-run, although further experimental support is needed to validate this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanaday and Kavalali, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Around 40% of the fusion events detected in our experiments were not endocytosed during the imaging period (20 s), indicating that even for single synaptic vesicle exocytosis slow modes of retrieval contribute to synaptic vesicle recycling. Elegant studies showed that synaptic vesicle proteins undergo localized diffusion after exocytosis, followed by re-clustering and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gimber et al., 2015</xref>). The re-clustering and re-capturing of synaptic vesicle proteins is an extremely slow process, requiring more than 60 s, and it was mediated by the clathrin adaptors CALM and AP-180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gimber et al., 2015</xref>). The ultraslow retrieval presented here could be compatible with this mechanism.</p><p>The speed of endocytosis is a limiting step in the maintenance of synaptic transmission under repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kavalali, 2006</xref>). Synaptic vesicle endocytosis can rapidly replenish vesicle pools and prevent vesicle depletion, while removing the potential hindrance of subsequent fusion events by previously fused vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hua et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sara et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, it is plausible to envision the physiological necessity of an ultrafast endocytic mechanism clearing future sites of fusion in preparation for subsequent rounds of neurotransmitter release. We believe the single vesicle imaging approach we present here will facilitate the identification of heretofore poorly understood mechanisms underlying the ultrafast vesicle retrieval process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Catalog # 29565</td><td>dil. 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-V0a1</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Catalog # 109 002</td><td>dil. 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-Synapsin 1</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>Catalog # MABN894</td><td>dil. 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-GDI</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Catalog # 130 011</td><td>dil. 1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt hydrate (CNQX)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Catalog # C239</td><td>10 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>D(−)−2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Catalog # A8054</td><td>50 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>Tetrodotoxin (TTX)</td><td>Enzo Life Sciences</td><td>Catalog # BML-NA120-0001</td><td>1 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>Picrotoxin (PTX)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Catalog # P1675</td><td>50 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>Folimycin from Streptomyces sp.</td><td>Calbiochem/EMD</td><td>Catalog # 344085</td><td>200 nM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>Trypsin from bovine pancreas</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Catalog # T9935</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>DNase</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Catalog # D5025-375KU</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>Matrigel</td><td>Corning</td><td>Catalog # 354234</td><td>dil. 1:25</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>FuGENE 6</td><td>Promega</td><td>Catalog # E2692</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical, compound, drug</td><td>QX-314</td><td>EMD-Millipore</td><td>Catalog # 552233</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line</td><td>Highly transfectable derivative of human embryonic kidney-293 epithelial adherent cells (HEK293T)</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Catalog # CRL-1573</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Organism/Strain</td><td>Sprague-Dawley rat pups (P2-P4)</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombi-nant DNA</td><td>Plasmid: pRSV-REV (lentiviral packaging)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Catalog # 12253</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombi-nant DNA</td><td>Plasmid: pCMV-VSV-G (lentiviral packaging)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Catalog # 8454</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombi-nant DNA</td><td>Plasmid: pMDLg/pRRE (lentiviral packaging)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Catalog # 12251</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombi-nant DNA</td><td>Plasmid: pFUGW-vGlut1-pHGFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voglmaier et al.

The supernatants of the cultures were collected 72 hr after the transfection and clarified by centrifugation (2000 rpm 15 min), and subsequently used for infection of DIV four hippocampal neurons. All experiments were performed on 16–20 DIV cultures when synapses were mature and lentiviral expression of constructs of interest was optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mozhayeva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deák et al., 2006</xref>).

Primary antibody against GFP was used to detect pHluorin-tagged proteins (1:200), antibody against V0a1 subunit of the V-ATPase was used to detect total V0a1 in control and V0a1-pHluorin expressing neurons (1:250), and anti-Synapsin1 antibody was used to detect presynaptic boutons (1:1000; control experiments were performed using Synaptobrevin two antibody to corroborate the results). Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) were used to label the cells and then coverslips were mounted and imaged using an LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a 63X (NA1.4) objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Cultured pyramidal neurons between 14 to 18 DIV were used for whole cell recordings at a clamped voltage of −70 mV by means of Axopatch 200B and Clampex 8.0 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, US), filtering at 2 kHz and sampling at 5 kHz. The cells were visualized using a Nikon DIAPHOT 200 microscope (Nikon, Minato, Tokyo, Japan). The internal pipette solution contained 115 mM CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM CsCl, 5 m M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.6 mM EGTA, 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP and 10 mM QX-314 (lidocaine N-ethyl bromide). The final solution was adjusted to pH 7.3 and 304 mOsM. Final resistance of the electrode tips was ~3–6 MΩ. For all experiments, the extracellular solution was a modified Tyrode’s solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.4 and 310 mOsM. To isolate inhibitory postsynaptic currents, agonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors were added: 10 μM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 50 μM aminophosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5). To isolate excitatory currents (AMPA-mediated) 50 μM AP-5 and 50 μM picrotoxin (PTX, ionotropic GABA receptor inhibitor) were added to the bath solution. To elicit evoked responses, electrical stimulation was delivered through parallel platinum electrodes with a constant current unit (WPI A385; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, US) set at 35 mA. Spontaneous activities (mIPSCs and mEPSCs) were recorded with the addition of 1 μM TTX. Miniature events were identified with a 5 pA detection threshold and analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ, US).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>Cultured hippocampal neurons at 16–20 DIV transfected with either vGluT1-pHluorin, Syp1-pHTomato or V0a1-pHluorin were used for the imaging experiments. The modified Tyrode's buffer from above containing 2 or 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used with 10 μM CNQX and 50 μM AP-5 to prevent recurrent network activity. For experiments performed at ~34°C solutions were heated using a bipolar temperature controller (CL-1000) attached to a multi-line solution heater (SHM-828; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The objective was heated with an objective collar connected to a single channel temperature controller (H401-T-SINGLE-BL; Okolab, Shanghai, China), and the stage and microscope were isolated from the room with a protective case to minimize temperature variances. Fluorescence was recorded using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a 100X Plan Fluor objective (Nikon, Minato, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an Andor iXon + back illuminated EMCCD camera (Model no. DU-897E-CSO-#BV; Andor Technology, Belfast, UK). For illumination, we used a Lambda-DG4 illumination system (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, US) with a FITC or TRITC filter. Images were acquired at 10 or 40 Hz with binning of 4 by four to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Neurons were stimulated using parallel bipolar electrodes (FHC, Bowdoin, ME, US) delivering 35 mA pulses at 20 s intervals, followed by a rest period prior to the delivery of 200 APs at 40 Hz. Boutons were visualized by the addition of Tyrode’s solution with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at the end of each experiment. Circular regions of interests (ROIs) of 2.27 μm diameter were automatically drawn around local fluorescence maximums using a custom-made macro for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and the fluorescent traces obtained were exported to Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, US) for analysis.</p><p>To calculate surface versus intracellular distribution of V0a1-pHluorin, we perfused a modified Tyrode’s solution at pH = 5.5 (buffered by MES instead of HEPES) to quench surface pHluorin and recorded for 30 s. After imaging putative boutons for another 30 s, a modified Tyrode’s solution containing 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was perfused for 30 s, in order to alkalinize all compartments. The difference of the mean fluorescence during acid buffer perfusion and normal Tyrode’s solution correspond to the surface pool of pHluorin, while the difference in mean fluorescence between NH<sub>4</sub>Cl perfusion and normal Tyrode’s solution correspond to the internal pool of pHluorin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence analysis</title><p>Fluorescence intensity traces were analyzed using a custom made Matlab script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chanaday, 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nchanaday/Single-vesicle-fusion-events">https://github.com/nchanaday/Single-vesicle-fusion-events</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Single-vesicle-fusion-events">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Single-vesicle-fusion-events</ext-link>), based on our previous analysis with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). Photobleaching was corrected with a single exponential decay and background was subtracted linearly, both photobleaching and background values were calculated based on fluorescence measurements of background in each imaging experiment and also for each ROI. De-noising was performed using a time-domain forward-backward non-linear filter developed originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy (1991)</xref> and implemented for Matlab by Nigel Reuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reuel et al., 2012</xref>). Minor changes were made to the code in order to improve de-noising of our data, based on the original paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kennedy (1991)</xref>. To find single vesicle fusion events, successful events were defined as those whose fluorescence amplitude was greater than three times the standard deviation of the baseline (average of ~2 s prior to the event). To avoid multivesicular fusion events, the upper limit was set at the mean value of single event amplitude plus half the difference between the mean single vesicle amplitude and the mean of the next amplitude peak in the distribution (corresponding to two quantums). This value was calculated comparing amplitude distributions for experiments performed in different extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration with or without TTX and with or without folymicin. Also, the event time has to be coincident with the time of stimulation. Dwell times were calculated as the time between the initial fluorescence step and the start of fluorescence decay defined as a switch to negative values of the first derivative. For 40 Hz stimulation, amplitude measurement, single exponential decay fitting and rise slope linear fitting were also performed in an automatized way using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, US).</p><p>The authors are open to share the Matlab script developed by our lab for the analysis of single synaptic vesicle fusion and endocytosis events used in the present work, upon request to ETK or NLC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Histograms of single vesicle dwell time distributions were fitted using Matlab and OriginPro 8.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, US), to corroborate the results.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. One of the reviewers, Vitaly Klyachko, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This exciting study addresses a long-standing controversy about the prevalent forms of vesicle retrieval in central synapses. Single vesicle endocytosis at hippocampal synapses is monitored with high time resolution using the vesicular glutamate transporter, synaptophysin, and the V0a1 subunit of the vacuolar ATPase as probes. A computational approach is used to resolve individual endocytic events with a very high temporal resolution. The study reveals different kinetically distinct pathways for retrieval of synaptic vesicles. It goes beyond previous studies since it measures the relative percentages of the various retrieval processes. Ultrafast events (150-250) are in the minority (20%), while 40% of the events proceed on a 5-12 sec timescale, and the remaining 40% on an even slower timescale. Different extracellular calcium concentrations and temperatures primarily influence the fast and slow retrieval processes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 4: The finding that Syt1 KD prefers the ultrafast pathway is remarkable. Please speculate if another calcium sensor (e.g., Syt7) might take over, and if the data are consistent with such a scenario. Or, are the data more consistent with an entirely different calcium sensor or a calcium independent process?</p><p>At high extracellular calcium concentration, the rate of &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; endocytosis is slowed down (but not that of ultrafast endocytosis). Could this be in part also caused by higher synaptic vesicle exocytosis activity, i.e., the balance between fusion events and retrieval is shifted at higher extracellular calcium concentration?</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1. An event-by-event comparison of simulated vs. recovered events in addition to the cumulative distributions could offer a better assessment of the reliability of the computation approach used.</p><p>Figure 3. It would be informative to add a comparison of the event amplitudes for different forms of retrieval.</p><p>Discussion: Re-acidification kinetics at least in synaptosomes can be on the order of 500 ms (Budzinski et al. ACS Chem Neurosci, 2011). Please provide a brief discussion of the implications of the reacidification kinetics to the apparent time course of ultra-fast events.</p><p>Since the different internalization pathways may shuttle pHluorin molecules into different sized structures, possibly with different numbers of H-ATPases, which could be regulated differentially (e.g. due to different phospholipid content), it seems plausible that acidification rates may vary between the different routes of internalization. The approach used here is one of the few ways that one could look at this by looking at the exponential time constant of the decay in fluorescence. It would be interesting to see if there is a difference in these rates depending on dwell time. For example, in Figure 3A, the fast events (0.1s, 0.3s, 2.4s) appear to acidify faster than the slow events.

Based on previous findings from our lab (Li et al., 2017), the kinetics of single vesicle endocytosis events are not altered by knocking down syt7. Moreover, the double knock-down of syt1 and syt7 showed the same fast endocytic phenotype as syt1 KD alone (Figure 6H-I in Li et al., 2017). These published results are also supported by averaged single vesicle traces of syt7 deficient synapses where we detected a double exponential decay (τ<sub>1</sub>= 0.31 ± 0.05 s, τ<sub>2</sub>= 8.5 ± 4.8 s). This result is consistent with two retrieval processes operating in the absence of syt7, similar to controls. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ultrafast mechanism detected by our experiments is syt7 independent and also possibly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, while the fast pathway relies exclusively on syt1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing.</p><p>We added this information about syt7 to the Results (subsection “Monitoring endocytosis with vGluT1-pHluorin”, third paragraph) and the Discussion (6th paragraph) sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At high extracellular calcium concentration, the rate of &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; endocytosis is slowed down (but not that of ultrafast endocytosis).

Therefore, we do not think the slow-down in retrieval is due to a higher exocytotic load but rather to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of the machinery involved in endocytosis (see Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

Previous work has shown that increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration not only slows down endocytosis (longer dwell times) but also slows down reacidification (measured using the exponential time constant of the decay in fluorescence) (see Leitz and Kavalali, 2011 and Li et al., 2017). Strikingly, the duration of dwell time and the speed of reacidification did not show a correlation for the data analyzed in the present work (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C-D</xref>), although we could detect a similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent slow down in dwell and decay times as before (data not shown). This result points to potential differences in the nature and size of the endocytic organelle generated after retrieval. We prefer to address this issue in more depth in future studies with additional methods. Although, in the current manuscript, we focused on endocytosis speed, a preliminary analysis revealed fluorescence decay time constants of ~1.0-1.25 s, in agreement with the values proposed by Budzinski and colleagues (ACS Chem Neurosci, 2011), suggesting endocytic organelles of a size in the order of a synaptic vesicle.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36097.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>a and b <bold>–</bold> Cumulative histograms of single vesicle fusion event amplitudes at room temperature (24 °C) and physiological temperature (34 °C), measured with vGluT1-pHluorin.</title><p>c and d <bold>–</bold> Plot of decay time constant as a function of dwell time duration at room temperature (24 °C) and physiological temperature (34 °C), measured with vGluT1-pHluorin.

Moreover, the total number of events analyzed in figure 6J-L is smaller compared to the other probes. Therefore, as the reviewer pointed out, it is hard to confidently state that “the results in figure 6L differ from those in figure 3”, we decided to remove that sentence from the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
