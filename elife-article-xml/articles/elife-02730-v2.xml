motor outputs remains poorly understood. Here we reconstruct the neuronal connectome of a four-eye visual circuit in the larva of the annelid <italic>Platynereis</italic> using serial-section transmission electron microscopy. In this 71-neuron circuit, photoreceptors connect via three layers of interneurons to motorneurons, which innervate trunk muscles. By combining eye ablations with behavioral experiments, we show that the circuit compares light on either side of the body and stimulates body bending upon left-right light imbalance during visual phototaxis. We also identified an interneuron motif that enhances sensitivity to different light intensity contrasts. The <italic>Platynereis</italic> eye circuit has the hallmarks of a visual system, including spatial light detection and contrast modulation, illustrating how image-forming eyes may have evolved via intermediate stages contrasting only a light and a dark field during a simple visual task.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02730.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02730.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02730.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals show automatic responses to light, from moths, which are attracted to light sources, to cockroaches, which are repelled by them. This phenomenon, known as phototaxis, is thought to help animals navigate through their environment. It is an evolutionarily ancient behavior, as revealed by its widespread presence in the animal kingdom. One animal with a simple visual system for phototactic behavior is the marine worm <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>.</p><p>Platynereis is a segmented worm (annelid) with four eyes on the top of its head, two on the right and two on the left. Exposure to light triggers the contraction of muscles that run along the length of the body, causing the worm to bend and thus change the direction it is swimming in. Now, using a combination of high-resolution microscopy and behavioral experiments in larvae, Randel et al. have mapped the neural circuits underlying the worm's phototactic behavior.</p><p>A 3-day-old Platynereis larva was sectioned to produce almost 1700 slices, each less than 50 nanometers thick, which were then viewed under a transmission electron microscope. By tracing individual neurons from one slice to the next, it was possible to reconstruct the entire visual system and all of its connections. This ‘visual connectome’ consisted of 71 neurons—21 light-sensitive cells, 42 interneurons, and 8 muscle-controlling motorneurons—organized into a circuit with 1106 connections.</p><p>Shining light onto living larvae triggered phototaxis, with some larvae consistently swimming towards the light and others away from it. Using a laser to destroy all four eyes abolished this behavior, as did the removal of both eyes on either side of the head. By contrast, removing one eye from each side had no effect. This was because these larvae were still able to simultaneously compare the amounts of light reaching the left and right sides of their body, and to use any difference in these levels as a directional cue to guide swimming.</p><p>By revealing the circuitry underlying phototaxis in a marine worm, Randel et al. have provided clues to the mechanisms that support this behavior in other species. The data could also provide insights into the processes that contributed to the evolution of more complex visual systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02730.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02730.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Platynereis</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>annelid</kwd><kwd>eye evolution</kwd><kwd>phototaxis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. dumerilii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Randel</surname><given-names>Nadine</given-names></name><name><surname>Asadulina</surname><given-names>Albina</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Conzelmann</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Shahidi</surname><given-names>Réza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezares-Calderón</surname><given-names>Luis A</given-names></name><name><surname>Verasztó</surname><given-names>Csaba</given-names></name><name><surname>Jékely</surname><given-names>Gáspár</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Three-dimensional mapping of the neural circuitry that controls movement of a marine worm in response to light provides insights into the evolution of complex visual systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visually guided behavior is widespread in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ullén et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), yet the underlying neuronal circuits and their evolutionary origins remain poorly understood. Spatial vision requires at least two photoreceptors and a neural circuitry capable of making a comparison between the photoreceptor inputs without body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Land and Nilsson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nilsson, 2009</xref>). The spatial information obtained must then translate to a coordinated motor output.</p><p>A comprehensive description of the sensory-motor visual circuitry, including all neurons and their synaptic connectivity, is required for a plausible explanation of how visual inputs drive motor output during animal behavior. This can only be achieved using electron microscopic imaging to construct connectomes, comprehensive synaptic-level connectivity maps for large blocks of neural tissue containing behaviorally relevant circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bumbarger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite recent advances in the connectomics of visual systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sprecher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takemura et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2013</xref>), a complete synaptic-level connectivity-map of a visual circuit, including sensory-, inter-, and motorneurons, has not yet been described.</p><p>Here we reconstruct the neural connectome of the visual eyes in a larva of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> using serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM)<italic>. Platynereis</italic> larvae develop four visual eyes, the ‘adult eyes’ (henceforth ‘eyes’), that are the precursors of the adult's visual pigment-cup eyes, and are distinct from the more ventrally located ‘eyespots’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>). These eyes consist of only 2–7 photoreceptors, a few shading pigment cells, and a lens, representing the simplest visual eyes described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rhode, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Randel et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval visual connectome consists of 71 neurons and 1106 synapses, and was reconstructed from a tissue block containing the larval head and trunk. Using behavioral experiments combined with eye ablations we demonstrate that the eyes mediate spatial vision, whereby light intensities at the left and right eyes are compared to mediate tail bending during phototactic turns. This combination of connectomics and behavioral analysis provides a circuit-level and mechanistic explanation for the regulation of phototactic behavior by spatial vision. The <italic>Platynereis</italic> visual connectome also provides insights into the origin of visual eyes, and suggests that phototaxis may have been the first visual task in evolution performed by animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Eye-circuit connectome reconstruction</title><p>To reconstruct the full chemical synaptic connectivity map of the visual eyes in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva we used ssTEM.

To further characterize the ultrastructure of synapses we created high-resolution images (0.2 nm/pixel) of 60 randomly chosen synapses belonging to the different neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6 fig1s7 fig1s8 fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 6–9</xref>).

All photoreceptors from the same eye project along the same axon bundle, forming four separate eye nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>The eye nerves from the anterior and posterior eyes from the same side innervate distinct anterior and posterior areas in the primary optic neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Some photoreceptor axons cross the midline and project to the contralateral primary optic neuropil. The primary optic neuropil is surrounded by three giant glia cells. These cells form lamellae that tightly surround the primary and secondary optic neuropils from the dorsal but not the ventral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The main targets of the photoreceptors of the four eyes are four primary interneurons (IN<sup>1</sup>), with photoreceptors from one eye forming several (up to 30) synaptic contacts to one primary interneuron with a contralateral cell body (e.g., PRC<sup>al</sup> to IN<sup>1pr</sup>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The four eyes and the four primary interneurons show a crosswise arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Primary interneurons have mutual synaptic contacts (see below) and also form synapses on two other interneuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). One type of interneuron is intrinsic to the optic neuropil (IN<sup>int</sup>) with both ipsilateral and contralateral cell bodies and axons crossing the midline. Another target of the primary interneurons are interneurons that project out of the primary optic neuropil into a secondary optic neuropil area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The major targets of these trans-optic-neuropil interneurons (IN<sup>ton</sup>) are a group of contralateral interneurons, which we named Schnörkel interneurons (IN<sup>sn</sup>). Schnörkel interneurons project a curved axon to the ipsilateral secondary optic neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Schnörkel interneurons are presynaptic to a bilateral group of ventral motorneurons (MN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two groups of dorsal and ventral interneurons (IN<sup>dc</sup>, IN<sup>vc</sup>) also form synapses on the Schnörkel interneurons and motorneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p>We identified two distinct motorneuron types. The first type sends a contralateral projection to both the ciliary band and the dorsal longitudinal muscle, and branches to send a descending projection to the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The second type only projects posteriorly along the circumesophageal nerve after crossing the midline. Both motorneuron types form neuromuscular and neurociliary synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Due to the lack of further trunk sections we did not trace descending motorneuron axons along their entire length, therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that motorneurons have other synaptic partners in the trunk. Nevertheless, these data represent, to our knowledge, the most complete connectomic reconstruction of a visual circuit to date, from photoreceptors to effector muscles and ciliated cells.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-02730-media5.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02730.019</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Volume reconstruction of a Schnörkel interneuron and motorneurons.</title><p>3D reconstruction of one Schnörkel interneuron and its postsynaptic motorneuron targets.

The mean diameter of synaptic vesicles in interneurons was significantly larger than in photoreceptors and motorneurons. Photoreceptor synaptic vesicles were not significantly different from neuromuscular synaptic vesicles in motorneurons. However, neurociliary synaptic vesicles in motorneurons were significantly smaller than photoreceptor or neuromuscular synaptic vesicles. These observations indicate the use of different neurotransmitters in the eye circuitry and also suggest that the dual-function muscle- and cilio-motor neurons (MN<sup>r2</sup>, MN<sup>l1</sup>) may have mixed neurotransmitter content.</p><p>To identify possible neurotransmitters in the eye circuit we performed whole-mount RNA in situ hybridizations with marker genes for various neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Randel et al., 2014</xref>) and compared the expression domains to cell body positions in the TEM series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The eye circuit is a feed-forward circuit where information flows from the eyes to the muscles and ciliary bands. We also calculated centrality measures to identify strongly connected nodes in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). With three different centrality measures (eigenvector centrality, weighted-degree centrality and authority) the four primary interneurons (IN<sup>1</sup>) ranked among the top five nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). These four cells receive several synapses from the photoreceptors, with the highest number of each IN<sup>1</sup> received from the crosswise eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The four IN<sup>1</sup> cells also have strong mutual connections (see below).</p><p>A search for highly interconnected nodes or communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>) subdivided the eye network into four modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The four IN<sup>1</sup> cells belong to two different modules in the eye circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), which together contain all neurons with projections intrinsic to the primary optic neuropil. Both modules consist of a crosswise pair of eyes and the associated IN<sup>1</sup> cells and trans-optic-neuropil interneurons (IN<sup>ton</sup>). The anatomy of the circuitry in the primary optic neuropil thus displays point symmetry rather than bilateral symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The other two modules, the motor modules, contain all neurons intrinsic to the secondary optic neuropil, including Schnörkel interneurons and motorneurons and associated effector organs. A bilateral pair of IN<sup>ton</sup> cells links the modules of the primary and secondary optic neuropils, reflecting the anatomy where IN<sup>ton</sup> cells receive synapses in the primary and project to the secondary optic neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). One of the motor modules provides innervation to the prototroch and metatroch ciliary band cells. The other module contains motorneurons that connect to three out of four bundles of longitudinal muscles (we could not find neuromuscular synapses on the left dorsal longitudinal muscle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The connectome reveals that all four eyes can provide motor input to both body sides. The neuronal pathways from the eyes cross the midline multiple times throughout the circuit. The strongest synaptic connections are formed between photoreceptor—IN<sup>1</sup>—IN<sup>ton</sup>—Schnörkel interneuron, always to the contralateral side in a feed-forward circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, most Schnörkel interneurons form several synapses on both ipsilateral and contralateral motorneurons in the secondary optic neuropil, representing a bilateral divergence of the connections. Motorneuron axons receive cell-body-proximal synapses from the ipsilateral Schnörkel interneurons, cross the midline, and receive cell-body-distal synapses on the other side of the body from the contralateral Schnörkel interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Stereotypy of synaptic connections</title><p>In order to estimate how stereotypic synaptic connectivity is within the circuit we compared the connectivity matrices of neurons with cell bodies on the left or right side of the body. We used the merged graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) since not all neurons had a contralateral pair (e.g., we identified three IN<sup>ton</sup> cells on the left and two on the right body side). We found a strong correlation between the left and right connectivity matrices (Spearman r = 0.67, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed the stereotypy of the spatial arrangement of pre-and postsynaptic sites among neurons of the same type. The four IN<sup>1</sup> cells always receive photoreceptor input in a cluster at the most distal segment of their axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Synapses onto the IN<sup>1</sup> cells from the contralateral photoreceptors are intermingled with presynaptic sites of IN<sup>1</sup> cells to IN<sup>ton</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>) and are not spatially segregated within the cluster. In contrast, IN<sup>1</sup> cells receive axo-axonal synaptic input from the crosswise IN<sup>1</sup> cell in a cluster positioned more proximal to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). The spatial arrangement of synapses is also similar between the left and right sides for other neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). These observations show that both the number and the spatial arrangement of synapses are stereotypic between the left and right body sides.

Larvae with unilateral ablation of both eyes were not phototactic and swam persistently in circles when illuminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D,F</xref>). The two anterior and two posterior eyes connect to distinct, though partly overlapping, circuits. To test if input to both the anterior and posterior eyes is necessary for directional swimming, we ablated either the anterior or the posterior eye pair. We also performed crosswise eye ablations.

This, together with the shading provided by the pigment cups (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), allows the detection of the spatial distribution of light, without body movement. The visual contrast then leads to the graded contraction of the longitudinal muscles during turns. The modulation of ciliary beating, not investigated here, may also contribute to phototactic turns, as is known for younger larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>). This sensorimotor structure is similar to visual phototaxis described in the lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ullén et al., 1997</xref>), but is very different from the non-visual phototactic responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kane et al., 2013</xref>). Visual phototaxis is also fundamentally different from the helical phototaxis mediated by the eyespots during early <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval stages (1–2 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>A contrast-enhancing circuit motif</title><p>When we analyzed mutual synaptic connections in the eye circuit we found that by far the strongest mutual connections are formed between the crosswise pairs of IN<sup>1</sup> cells (up to 18 synapses one way; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). These mutual, and thus likely inhibitory, connections are formed at the cell-body proximal segment of the IN<sup>1</sup> cells' axons, spatially segregated from the more distal sites of photoreceptor input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This reciprocal wiring may provide mutual inhibition and reinforce small differences in activation between the crosswise eyes, potentially representing a network motif for enhancing contrast-detection. Modularity analysis also revealed that the sub-networks of the crosswise eyes are more strongly connected than those of the pairwise eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that two reciprocally connected crosswise eyes are more efficient in visual information processing than a bilateral pair.</p><p>To test this, we performed various eye ablations and then subjected the larvae to selective eye illumination. We ablated a bilateral pair of eyes, thus eliminating inputs to one side of both crosswise mutual IN<sup>1</sup> motifs. We expect that these larvae would have a reduced bending response at the same level of contrast. We also performed crosswise eye ablations, leaving input to one of the crosswise IN<sup>1</sup> motifs intact. We then exposed larvae to a 488 nm background illumination and measured their tail bending following unilateral eye illumination with 488 nm stimulus light of varying intensity. Larvae with pairwise ablation of the anterior eyes showed significantly reduced bending relative to non-ablated controls with the average maximum tail displacement reduced to approximately half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). In contrast, larvae with crosswise eye ablation showed stronger bending that was not significantly different from non-ablated controls. Although both crosswise and pairwise ablated larvae have only two eyes and are phototactic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), these results show that pairwise ablated larvae have a markedly reduced motor response at the same level of contrast. We conclude that the strong mutual contacts between the crosswise IN<sup>1</sup> cells represent a circuit motif that enhances turning responses during phototaxis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we described the neural connectome of the visual system in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva. The four eyes mediate visual phototaxis, during which larvae are able to detect and contrast spatial differences in the light field. Although it is not yet possible to directly link all neurons and connections in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva to phototactic behavior, the combined analysis of connectivity and behavior yielded fundamental insights into a visually guided behavior.</p><p>We concluded that spatial vision is not due to the presence of more (3–7 in our larva) photoreceptors in the eyes, since all photoreceptors from one eye synapse on the same primary interneuron. Instead, spatial vision relies on at least two eyes, pointing in different directions, and the underlying neural circuit that contrasts simultaneous light inputs at the left and right eyes. Furthermore, connectomics and modularity analysis revealed that the four eyes connect to the downstream visual circuitry in a crosswise manner, showing point symmetry. The crosswise-eye-modules show mutual connections at the level of the primary interneurons. In agreement with this, ablation experiments demonstrated that a bilateral pair of eyes elicits a smaller motor response than a crosswise pair, at the same level of light-intensity contrast. The contrast enhancement takes place in the primary optic neuropil circuitry, and the IN<sup>ton</sup> may relay a contrasted, one-sided signal to the secondary optic neuropil.</p><p>In the secondary optic neuropil this one-sided input could lead to the biased activation of the left or right motorneurons. Our circuit reconstructions partly explain the bimodality of the behavior (either positive or negative phototaxis). Such switching behavior requires neuronal connections between the eyes on one body side and the muscles on both body sides. We found that indeed the circuit diverges bilaterally at the level of the Schnörkel interneurons (IN<sup>sn</sup>), when these cells synapse to motorneurons of both the left and right body side. The Schnörkel interneuron synapses form at axon segments either proximal or distal to the motorneuron cell bodies (Figure 4—figure supplement 6). The spatial organization of synapses may provide an initial bias to the system, favoring bends on one body side. Further modulatory input may influence this bias, inducing a sign switch. There are several sensory neurons, not described here, that feed into the minimal eye circuit at the middle segment of the motorneuron axons (NR, LABC, and GJ, unpublished). Further work will be needed to characterize the possible roles of these neurons in sign switching.</p><p>The sensory-motor strategy of visual phototaxis is similar to that found in the lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ullén et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this vertebrate, unilateral illumination leads to a lateral turn away from the light during negative phototaxis. However, under some circumstances lampreys display positive phototaxis. Lesion experiments demonstrated the involvement of the pretectum and reticulospinal neurons in phototaxis, the latter forming the descending control system. Surgically severing connections between the pretectum and the ipsilateral reticulospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) leads to a sign switch in the phototactic response when the ipsilateral side is illuminated. Transection of the ventral rhombencephalic commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) in turn reduces the turning angle during negative phototaxis. Thus both the <italic>Platynereis</italic> and the lamprey phototactic circuits are characterized by extensive midline crossing at several levels, bilateral divergence to allow context-dependent sign switching, and bilateral, probably inhibitory, interactions to enhance turning magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02730.047</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the <italic>Platynereis, Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate visual circuits.</title><p>Comparison of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> visual circuit with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate visual circuits on the neuronal level (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) and with the lamprey phototactic circuit on the circuit level (<bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>).

The current model of eye evolution defines four steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nilsson, 2009</xref>), from non-directional photoreception through directional scanning photoreception (spiral phototaxis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jékely, 2009</xref>) and low-resolution spatial vision to high-resolution spatial vision. We now extend this scheme with the concept of the two-pixel visual phototactic eye, likely predating the evolution of low-resolution spatial vision.</p><p>Simple eyes, similar to the eyes of <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae, are widespread in the planktonic larval stages of several bilaterians and may often function in visual phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchanan, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blumer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacalli, 2004</xref>).

In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, we identified visual phototaxis as the first function during the development of the eyes.

Five sensory cells, which are both pre- and post-synaptic to the minimal eye circuit were also excluded. 12 postsynaptic targets of the MNs in the ventral nerve cord and five between the secondary optic neuropils as well as 32 postsynaptic targets of interneurons were also excluded because of low connectivity and the occurrence of only individual synapses outside the optic neuropils.</p><p>48 neurite fragments could not be traced completely.

These fragments likely belong to identified neurons. Nine of the non-traceable fragments were longer (up to 44 µm).</p><p>We classified neurons according to their morphology, position, projection pattern and connectivity. Photoreceptors were identified based on the presence of a rhabdom located in the eye pigment cup. Their dominant targets are the four primary interneuron (IN<sup>1</sup>) cells. IN<sup>1</sup> cells are named based on their position (anterior-left etc.). IN<sup>1</sup> cells are defined as a separate group based on their unique connectivity patterns, including strong input from photoreceptors and strong reciprocal contacts between the crosswise cells. The second group of interneurons is classified as IN<sup>int</sup>s, with projections intrinsic to the primary optic neuropil and weak connectivity to photoreceptors and IN<sup>1</sup> cells. A third group is formed by the IN<sup>ton</sup> cells, distinguished by their unique projection pattern from the primary to the secondary optic neuropil. Schnörkel interneurons (IN<sup>sn</sup>) form a distinct class with ventral cell bodies and curved axons (‘Schnörkel’ is German for ‘curlicue’) projecting to the ipsilateral secondary optic neuropil and synapsing on the motorneurons. The dorsal interneurons (IN<sup>dc</sup>) have dorsally located cell bodies and axons that project to the secondary optic neuropil. The ventral interneurons (IN<sup>vc</sup>) have ventrally located cell bodies and axons that project to the secondary optic neuropil. Motorneurons were recognized based on their innervation of dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles as well as multi-ciliated cells (prototroch or metatroch). Motorneurons form two bilateral clusters. For some motorneurons we could not find motor synapses, however, we could classify these cells as motorneurons based on their cell body position and posteriorly projecting axons. Neurons of all types are labeled based on body side (left <sup>[l]</sup> or right <sup>[r]</sup>) and numbered (e.g., IN<sup>tonl1</sup>).</p><p>Network analyses were done in Gephi 0.8.2. Modules were detected with an algorithm described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blondel et al. (2008)</xref> with randomization on, using edge weights and a resolution of 1.2. Force-field-based clustering was performed using the Force Atlas 2 Plugin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuron visualization</title><p>Neurons and their connections reconstructed in TrakEM2 were exported as 3D objects in a wavefront (.obj) format and imported into Blender. Cell bodies were approximated with ellipsoids and axons and dendrites with smooth curves. The approximations were performed either manually or automatically using Python scripting embedded in Blender. Muscles were kept in the original form, pigment cups and ciliated cells were approximated with simplified 3D shapes based on TrakEM2 reconstructions. The model was extended with the connectivity and synapse position information obtained from TrakEM2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Virtual connectome atlas in blender</title><p>The virtual atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Randel et al., 2014</xref>) can be opened with Blender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blender.org/">http://www.blender.org/</ext-link>).

Larvae were immobilized between a slide and a coverslip in NSW containing 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Larvae were imaged with an UPLSAPO 60X NA:1.20 water immersion objective using a 635-nm laser at 2–5% and transmission imaging with DIC optics. A 351-nm pulsed laser (Teem Photonics™, Grenoble, France) at 8–15% power was used, coupled via air to the SIM scanner for controlled ablation in a region of interest. 12% corresponds to a beam power of 168 µwatts as measured with a microscope slide power sensor (S170C; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). During eye ablations we also imaged the eye pigment by reflection imaging of the 635-nm light using a PMT. Ablated larvae were placed into NSW for recovery (1–6 hr) before behavioral experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Selective eye illumination</title><p>Selective eye illumination was performed on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a SIM scanner. Larvae were held by trapping them between a slide and a coverslip in natural seawater using several layers of tape as spacer. Larvae were imaged with an UPLSAPO 40X NA:0.90 air objective using a 635 nm laser at 1% and transmission imaging with DIC optics. The scanning speed was 2 μm/msec and we recorded 256 × 256 pixel images with a time increment of 0.43 s. For measuring the stimulus–response curve we used background illumination with the 488 nm laser at 10% power corresponding to 17.8 μwatts in the main scanner. For stimulations we used the 488 nm laser at 1–65% power via the SIM scanner, corresponding to a beam intensities of 0.53–20.9 μwatts. A circular region of interest of 25-pixel diameter (area of 490 pixels) covering the eyes was used for controlled illumination. The pixel dwell time of the beam was 10 μsec and the eyes were stimulated during 150 frames with the SIM scanner corresponding to a total exposure time of 735 msec during a 9.8 s trial. For the bending <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref> the stimulus laser power was at 10%. The laser power was measured with a microscope slide power sensor (S170C; Thorlabs). To record the spatial and temporal extent of the stimulus the reflected 488-nm light was imaged with a PMT. To prevent the detection of the 488-nm stimulus light by the transmitted light detector, we placed a red long-pass filter in front of the detector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization and image registration</title><p>Whole-mount in situ hybridization and image registration were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asadulina et al., 2012</xref>).

In brief, we identified a median-size larva and registered it to every single image stack used for template generation (40 stacks), computed the average transformation and applied it to the median-size larva. The corrected larva was used as the starting point for the iteratively template generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asadulina et al., 2012</xref>). We registered minimum four individual larval whole-body scans for each gene to create an average expression pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phototaxis assay</title><p>Larval phototaxis was assayed in a horizontal 6 × 15 mm rectangular glass cuvette with 3 mm high walls. The cuvette was illuminated uniformly through a light diffuser with white light from a 150-watt halogen cold light source (Schott KL 2500 LCD, Schott AG, Mainz, Germany). Larval behavior was recorded at 21 frames per second on a Zeiss Stemi 2000-CS stereomicroscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). Phototaxis efficiency was measured using a custom ImageJ macro that calculated larval density at the left and right side of the cuvette before and after the light stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Randel et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Fertilized eggs were injected with capped and polyA-tailed GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) RNA generated from a vector (pUC57-T7-RPP2-GCaMP6) containing the GCaMP6 ORF fused to a 169 base pair 5′ UTR from the <italic>Platynereis</italic> 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2. 3-day-old larvae were held as described above.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Neuronal connectome of a sensory-motor circuit for visual navigation” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript is obviously a unique one, and contains some invaluable work describing the connectome of a larval worm. This uniqueness is one of its most important strengths. Another strength is that it combines behavioral data with the EM data. That said, the manuscript requires considerable editorial revisions and potentially additional statistical analyses before it can be seen as suitable for publication. As seen below, parts of the data are described inadequately; there are missing statistics, and the connectivity diagrams are difficult to follow.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) One of the reviewers was quite concerned about the reproducibility of the connectome as reported. Obviously, we can not expect you to do another complete set of sections and reconstructions. But it would be very instructive to know how variable different animals are. You report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> data from a developmental series. This must come from multiple animals. First of all, please indicate the actual age of the animals at each data point. Secondly, for this one set of measurements, you should be able to look at a single age point and tell us how different the number of synapses are across animals? As it stands, you are not profiting well from these data, and they are impossible to interpret (no n's, no ages).</p><p>2) We understand that you saw no evidence of gap junctions. It is easy to miss these in EM, but have you specifically gone back to your images to look for them? Do you think there are likely to be there, but small, and therefore easily missed, or do you think, for any reason that they aren't there?</p><p>3) Not all synapses are the same. Do you see different classes of synaptic vesicles that might indicate some synapses are excitatory and some inhibitory?</p><p>4) It would also be useful to include figures showing the distribution of the synapses between the PRs and interneurons. For instance, it is not easy to figure out whether these axo-axonal synapses are clustered or distributed in the neuropils, and in particular, how their location correspond to ensheathing by surrounding glial cells. Spatial organization of synapses has important consequences on neuronal computation and it would also be very useful to determine how variable/invariant the synaptic organization is from animal to animal, or even from PR-IN to PR-IN connections within the same animal.</p><p>5) The inadequacy of the circuit diagrams is best expressed by this comment from one reviewer. Please think about creating more useful connectivity diagrams. &quot;This is a difficult paper to assess. On the positive side, it carefully and fully documents a very nice piece of research on the larval visual center and visual response of Platynereis, an interesting and promising model system, using up-to-date methodologies. For the specialist, it provides a thorough summary of the data and, through the Blender software (which I have not tried), I gather there is the option to access the data directly. On the negative side, for a general reader like myself, there is the frustrating sense that the results have not been fully developed into a set of meaningful conclusions, or at least a set of hypotheses, for comparison with results on other types of visual circuits, e.g., in vertebrate retina or Drosophila. The conclusions in a neuroscience paper can typically be summarized in one or more circuit diagrams showing the cell types in a schematic way, with their synaptic and non-synaptic contacts, and indications of likely + or - effects, so the logic of the circuit can be at least provisionally discussed in a concrete way. The current paper instead adopts a connectome approach and language, which is essentially statistical and in many ways more nebulous. This is entirely appropriate for dealing with data from really complex systems, where a circuitry approach is beyond reach.

Obviously, we can not expect you to do another complete set of sections and reconstructions. But it would be very instructive to know how variable different animals are. You report in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>data from a developmental series. This must come from multiple animals. First of all, please indicate the actual age of the animals at each data point. Secondly, for this one set of measurements, you should be able to look at a single age point and tell us how different the number of synapses are across animals? As it stands, you are not profiting well from these data, and they are impossible to interpret (no n's, no ages)</italic>.</p><p>To address this concern we have now included an additional section “Stereotypy of synaptic connections”. Given that all our reconstructions were done from a single individual, we cannot yet address the variability of synaptic connections between individual larvae. However, we have compared the connectivity matrices of the left and right sides of the body in our ssTEM larval sample and found that they are significantly correlated. We also analyzed the distribution of synapses on left and right neurons of the same type. We found that the spatial distribution of synapses is stereotypical for the same neuron types (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4 –figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The data about the development of photoreceptor connections come from the same 3-day old individual. Since photoreceptors are added continuously to the eye during development, we could analyze the connectivity of photoreceptors at different states of cellular differentiation. We explain this more clearly in the revised text.</p><p>2) We understand that you saw no evidence of gap junctions. It is easy to miss these in EM, but have you specifically gone back to your images to look for them? Do you think there are likely to be there, but small, and therefore easily missed, or do you think, for any reason that they aren't there?</p><p>We have now compiled and provided a set of high-resolution images (1.13 nm/pixel resolution) focusing on part of the primary optic neuropil. We performed a comprehensive search of these images for structures with similar to annelid gap junctions as described in the literature, however, no structures reliably identifiable as gap junctions were present. Although transcriptomic studies indicate that Platynereis has several innexin genes, gap junctions may be rare or too small in the larval stage to be identified, even in high resolution scans (not feasible for large-scale connectomics).</p><p><italic>3) Not all synapses are the same. Do you see different classes of synaptic vesicles that might indicate some synapses are excitatory and some inhibitory?</italic></p><p>We have now included an additional section on synapse types “Synapse types in the eye circuitry”. Using high-resolution scans from several synapses from different neuron types we have quantified the diameter of synaptic vesicles and found significantly different mean diameters. To characterize the neurotransmitters of the eye circuit we also included <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data in 3-day-old larvae for markers genes of all major neurotransmitters. Using image registration and double <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we could determine the transmitter type for the photoreceptors (glutamate), interneurons (different monoamines), and motorneurons (acetylcholine/GABA).</p><p><italic>4) It would also be useful to include figures showing the distribution of the synapses between the PRs and interneurons. For instance, it is not easy to figure out whether these axo-axonal synapses are clustered or distributed in the neuropils, and in particular, how their location correspond to ensheathing by surrounding glial cells. Spatial organization of synapses has important consequences on neuronal computation and it would also be very useful to determine how variable/invariant the synaptic organization is from animal to animal, or even from PR-IN to PR-IN connections within the same animal</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4–figure supplement 5</xref>) and a video file (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>) showing the distribution of PRC to interneuron synapses and how these synapses are positioned relative to the synapses between the reciprocally connected crosswise primary interneurons.</p><p><italic>5) The inadequacy of the circuit diagrams is best expressed by this comment from one reviewer.
