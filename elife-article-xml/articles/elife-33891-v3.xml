impairments. However, the relationship between neural and behavioral deficits is uncertain due to a lack of simultaneous measurements during task performance. Therefore, we telemetrically recorded from auditory cortex neurons in gerbils reared with developmental conductive hearing loss as they performed an auditory task in which rapid fluctuations in amplitude are detected. These data were compared to a measure of auditory brainstem temporal processing from each animal. We found that developmental HL diminished behavioral performance, but did not alter brainstem temporal processing. However, the simultaneous assessment of neural and behavioral processing revealed that perceptual deficits were associated with a degraded cortical population code that could be explained by greater trial-to-trial response variability. Our findings suggest that the perceptual limitations that attend early hearing loss are best explained by an encoding deficit in auditory cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gerbil</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd><kwd>temporal processing</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC016508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Justin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 MH019524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Justin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC014656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanes</surname><given-names>Dan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developmental hearing loss causes perceptual deficits that are best explained by degraded auditory cortical encoding that is recorded during task performance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many forms of developmental deprivation, including the loss of hearing or vision, induce lifelong behavioral deficits that are associated with degraded central nervous system (CNS) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kiorpes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Petersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kalinichev and Francis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Sanes and Woolley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>). However, the precise relationship between perception and sensory coding following sensory deprivation is uncertain because measurements are generally obtained from separate groups of animals.

One recent advancement has been to examine perceptual and sensory encoding in the same animals following developmental conductive hearing loss (HL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Keating et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2015</xref>), but the direct relationship between neural dysfunction and perceptual skills can only be inferred without obtaining simultaneous neural and psychophysical measurements from the same animals. A related question concerns the central location(s) of HL-inducedÂ degraded neural processing that might explain perceptual deficits. Since permanent HL induced during early development can impair neural encoding mechanisms throughout the auditory pathway, many candidate mechanisms have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Knudsen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">1984a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mogdans and Knudsen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Mogdans and Knudsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Raggio and Schreiner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Snyder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">DeBello et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Moore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fallon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Razak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Popescu and Polley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Polley et al., 2013</xref>). To address these issues, we recorded from ACx in HL-reared and control (Ctl) animals as they performed an auditory detection task, and compared behavioral sensitivity to ACx encoding and auditory brainstem processing.</p><p>When children are deprived of normal auditory input early in life, they display permanent CNS changes and diminished perceptual sensitivity to the spectral and temporal features that comprise natural sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Ponton and Eggermont, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gilley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Landsberger et al., 2018</xref>).

Despite the importance of these amplitude modulation (AM) cues for aural communication, perceptual sensitivity to these signals displays a relatively prolonged period of developmental maturation, with detection improving into adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hall and Grose, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Sarro and Sanes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banai et al., 2011</xref>). This prolonged maturation suggests that temporal processing could be vulnerable to environmental experience, including HL. In fact, there is clinical and experimental evidence demonstrating that developmental HL impairs AM sensitivity and discriminability, particularly for fast (&gt;100 Hz) modulation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacon and Viemeister, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Grant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that developmental HL, which can occur in children with otitis media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gravel and Wallace, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Whitton and Polley, 2011</xref>), leads to long-lasting cellular deficits in auditory cortex (ACx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Takesian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">2017</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that a HL-induced ACx encoding deficit could explain, in part, degraded behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buran et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caras and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">von Trapp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ihlefeld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Green et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We tested the hypothesis that developmental conductive HL disrupts ACx encoding of fast AM rates, thereby degrading perceptual sensitivity.

Our findings suggest that the neural correlates of HL-induced perceptual deficits do not emerge at the auditory brainstem, but are associated with cortical population-level activity that could be read out by decoding regions downstream of ACx.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developmental conductive hearing loss impairs behavioral sensitivity to AM rate</title><p>To determine whether animals reared with permanent bilateral conductive HL display a reduction in perceptual sensitivity to fast AM rates, all animals were trained to perform a Go-Nogo AM noise detection task at rates of 64, 128, 256, and 512 Hz (âGoâ depths: â15 to 0 dB rel. 100%; âNogoâ depth: unmodulated noise).

Regardless of the whether the FR increased or decreased, neurometric functions were plotted for each unit as FR-based sensitivity (<italic>dâ</italic><sub>FR</sub>) as a function of AM depth (see Materials and methods). Three example neurometric functions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (right), and correspond to the FR functions plotted to the left.

Therefore, we asked whether a pattern classifier could more accurately explain behavioral sensitivity. This neurometric analysis calculates performance for each unit based on the similarity of neural responses to a template (see Materials and methods). From each unitâs classifier output, we plotted classifier <italic>dâ</italic> as a function of AM depth and extracted threshold values (<italic>dâ</italic>=1). This analysis was conducted with four separate metrics: FR, K-means, Rcorr, and van Rossum (see Materials and Methods). We pooled threshold values across Ctl and HL groups and compared each unitâs neural classifier threshold to its corresponding psychometric performance session. The K-means metric (Pearsonâs rÂ =Â 0.46) outperformed the FR (Pearsonâs rÂ =Â 0.38), Rcorr (Pearsonâs rÂ =Â 0.30), and Van Rossum (Pearsonâs rÂ =Â 0.25) metrics, and displayed the strongest correlation with psychometric thresholds.

Specifically, to quantify how well ACx populations could differentiate Go (AM) versus Nogo (unmodulated) signals, we used a linear population readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as described in Materials and methods. We trained each population using a linear readout scheme and tested the representation with ACx responses from the AM detection task. This measure estimates the ability of the ACx population to encode AM depth, and assumes that the representation is decoded by downstream neurons as a thresholded sum of weighted synaptic inputs. The parameters of our linear classifier (i.e., comparing populations of each individual Go signal versus the Nogo signal) were chosen because the animalâs goal was to indicate and report the presence of AM noise. Similar to the unit-by-unit neurometric measure reported in the previous section, we examined whether the population activity from ACx units would be in accordance with the behavior differences between Ctl and HL groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Note that we included only units from which thresholds could be extracted based on FR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The percentages of units included in this analysis were relatively equal between groups at each AM rate (64 Hz: CtlÂ =Â 49/176 (28%), HLÂ =Â 53/138 (38%); 128 Hz: CtlÂ =Â 46/178 (26%), HLÂ =Â 48/189 (25%); 256 Hz: CtlÂ =Â 100/270 (37%), HLÂ =Â 92/247 (37%); 512 Hz: CtlÂ =Â 37/282 (13%), HLÂ =Â 29/234 (12%)). We first assessed population decoding performance as a function of the number of units used in the linear population readout. For this analysis, we applied a resampling procedure to randomly select a subpopulation of units (10â100% of total units) across 250 iterations. Specifically, during each iteration of the resampling procedure, a new subpopulation of units was randomly selected (without replacement) from all units prior to the decoding readout procedure. Average performance and variability (Â±1 standard deviation) were calculated across 250 iterations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> displays the decoding readout performance as a function of the number of units for each AM rate tested from both groups.

To examine this, we calculated a CV metric across the population vectors used in our decoder analysis. Specifically, on each trial, the population-summed spike count was calculated separately for each 1 ms bin.

Our current data is consistent with this literature. Maximum phase-locking capability among our ACx units in response to AM rates of 64â512 Hz was very low, and generally not significant. In contrast, FR carried significant information about AM depth. Regardless of the minimal phase-locking of our ACx units to fast AM rates, our population data indicate that decoding performance increases as we decrease bin size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that the precise temporal structure of the population-averaged response is an important factor to representing fast AM rates.</p><p>A neural population can represent vast amounts of sensory information, but may not all be decoded during perception, which would lead to a discrepancy between the output of a decoding readout versus behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Alternatively, common characteristics of the unit population may inflate the decoding readouts relative to psychophysical sensitivity. For example, we found that a linear classifier readout procedure that consisted of only monotonically decreasing units outperformed one comprised of only monotonically increasing units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). If the optimal decoding of fast AM information occurs among monotonically decreasing units, then this could explain the superior <italic>dâ</italic> values observed for this class of neurons at lower AM depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Thus, we obtained AM depth thresholds from brainstem EFRs, which have been used to assess brainstem temporal processing across a broad range of AM rates in humans and non-human species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boettcher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Leigh-Paffenroth and Fowler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Parthasarathy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Parthasarathy and Bartlett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">2012</xref>). We found that EFR sensitivity did not differ significantly between HL and Ctl animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In fact, EFR thresholds from HL animals were better than psychometric performance at very fast AM rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, right). Since EFRs were not simultaneously measured while animals were performing the task, it is possible that similar measurements under awake-behaving conditions may reveal interesting changes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Slee and David, 2015</xref> have shown that inferior colliculus neurons are modulated by task-engagement, which leaves open the possibility that EFRs obtained during performance of the fast AM detection task could have been differentially modulated in Ctl and HL animals. Another possibility is that a subpopulation of brainstem neurons is impaired following developmental HL, but this impairment is masked with a population level assessment function, such as our ABRs and EFRs. Regardless, our EFR measurements do not reveal a HL-related impairment that could account for behavioral deficits in fast AM rate detection. In this light, our findings point towards degraded neural encoding beyond the auditory brainstem as the neural origin of perceptual deficits following early auditory deprivation.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings from ACx brain slices have revealed that developmental conductive HL disrupts ACx synaptic and membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Takesian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">2012</xref>), even for temporary manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">2016</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that mechanisms intrinsic to gerbil ACx could account, in part, for HL-induced behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buran et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caras and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ihlefeld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">von Trapp et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this conceptual framework, we found that maximum stimulus-driven and spontaneous firing rates were significantly weaker among ACx units recorded from HL versus Ctl animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, trial-to-trial response variability (CV) was greater among ACx units in HL-reared animals. Since ACx synaptic excitation and inhibition are normally in approximate balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Tan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Tan and Wehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), a net reduction of inhibition could diminish stimulus selectivity. This so called âiceberg effectâ implies that inhibition plays a crucial role in accurate sensory-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Rose and Blakemore, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carandini and Ferster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). Thus, the degraded synaptic inhibition observed following developmental HL may explain, in part, some of the observed behavioral impairments.</p><p>Since behavioral performance in HL animals was not explained by brainstem EFR responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) or ACx unit sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6CâD</xref>), we asked whether ACx population activity was degraded by HL. In fact, we found a robust correlate between HL-related behavioral deficits and population-level activity in ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, our observed deficits in HL-related cortical population responses may not necessarily produce behavioral deficits since AM detection thresholds at slower modulation rates of 64 Hz were similar between Ctl versus HL animals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It might be the case that higher levels of the auditory system are able to remediate the deficit for slower modulation rates, but not for faster modulation rates. Future studies that compare ACx versus downstream processing in animals with developmental HL are needed to better assess this issue. Regardless, the finding of superior population-level representation of task-related performance compared to individual unit metrics is consistent with previous studies from visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Pouget et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Graf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Pagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Pagan and Rust, 2014</xref>), somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Safaai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi et al., 2014</xref>), and auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Middlebrooks et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Miller and Recanzone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ince et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Christison-Lagay et al., 2017</xref>). The current results provide an experimental test of these ideas by identifying a cortical population-level contribution to sensory deprived-related perceptual deficits. Developmental plasticity induced by abnormal changes to acoustic signals can also lead to improved sensory encoding and perception than what would have otherwise occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Keating et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that, with additional training, our animals would have eventually learned to perform the AM detection task at control levels.</p><p>Our population analysis utilized a classifier that was based on a linear population readout (support vector machine procedure) that took into account neuronal variability across 1 ms time windows. We found that ACx population activity from animals reared with conductive HL were more variable across trials compared to the unit population from Ctl animals. This signifies the relationship between higher trial-to-trial response variability and impaired psychometric performance in HL animals. Overall, our current results support the notion that psychometric performance on an AM detection task benefits from lower response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">von Trapp et al., 2016</xref>) since HL animals performed worse than Ctl animals and possessed less reliable cortical responses. We conclude that developmental HL detrimentally increased CV of ACx population activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), possibly by reducing cortical inhibition. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that early auditory deprivation diminishes the neural information that could be used to represent fast AM signals. The HL-induced neural encoding deficits are not observed at the brainstem, but reflect changes at higher stages in the auditory CNS network, such as ACx population activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>, NÂ =Â 20, 12 male) were weaned from commercial breeding pairs (Charles River) and housed on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle.

Below, we provide a summary of the procedures.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Electrode implantation</title><p>A subset of gerbils (nÂ =Â 6; Ctl nÂ =Â 3, HL nÂ =Â 3) underwent electrode implantation surgery. After an initial set of psychometric functions was obtained across the four tested AM rates, the animal was anesthetized with isoflurane/O<sub>2</sub>, secured on a stereotaxic device (Kopf), and a 16-channel silicone probe array (four shanks with recording sites arranged in a 600 Ã 600 Âµm grid; Neuronexus A4 Ã 4â4 mm-200-200-1250-H16_21 mm) was implanted in the left core auditory cortex. The array was fixed to a custom-made microdrive to allow for subsequent advancement across recording sessions, and angled at 25-degrees in the mediolateral plane. Typically, we aimed the rostral-most shank of the array to be positioned at 3.9 mm rostral and 4.6â4.8 mm lateral to lambda. Notably, a ground wire was inserted in the contralateral cortical hemisphere. Animals recovered for at least 1 week before being placed on controlled water access for further psychometric testing. At the termination of each experiment, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) and electrolytic lesions were made through one contact site via passing current (7 mA, 5â10 s). Animals were then perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were extracted, post-fixed, sectioned on a vibratome (Leica), and stained for Nissl. Brightfield images were acquired with a high-resolution slide scanner (Olympus) and electrode tracks were reconstructed offline and compared to a gerbil brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Radtke-Schuller et al., 2016</xref>) to verify targeted core auditory cortex recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Extracellular recordings were acquired telemetrically using a wireless headstage and receiver (W16, Triangle Biosystems Inc.) while animals simultaneously performed the AM detection task. The analog signals were preamplified and digitized at a 24.414 kHz sampling rate (TB32; Tucker-Davis Technologies). The converted digital signals were then fed via fiber optic link to the RZ5 base station (TDT, Tucker-Davis Technologies) for filtering and processing. All recording channels but one were averaged together and subtracted from the remaining channel as a common average referencing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ludwig et al., 2009</xref>). Offline, signals were first high-pass filtered (300 Hz). For each individual channel, a representative 16 s recording segment was used to calculate the standard deviation (SD) of background noise (ânoise floorâ) using the algorithm described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Quiroga et al., 2004</xref>). A spike extraction threshold was set to 4 SDsÂ &gt;Â noise floor, and an artifact rejection threshold was set to 20 SDsÂ &gt;Â noise floor. Candidate waveforms were then peak-aligned, hierarchically clustered, and sorted in principal component (PC) space using the MATLAB-based package UltraMegaSort 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hill et al., 2011</xref>). Well-isolated single-units demonstrated a clear separation in PC space, and fewer than 10% of refractory period violations. For the majority of recording sites that did not meet this criterion and contained spikes from several unresolved units, they were considered multi-units. Separate analyses of single- versus multi-unit populations revealed no systematic differences. Thus, we pooled the populations for all group analyses reported.</p><p>To examine cortical sensitivity to fast AM rates, we restricted our recordings to units that were driven by 256 and/or 512 Hz AM noise. To search for driven activity, we initially tested implanted animals on 256 or 512 Hz AM noise detection (Go signal: 0 dB rel. 100%) upon every electrode advancement (~80â100 Âµm). If we judged the electrode channels to be âdrivenâ by the AM stimuli (i.e., change in activity during the stimulus delivery period relative to ongoing spontaneous activity via online visual inspection of the waveform traces to each channel), the animal would proceed with psychometric testing across AM depths. On subsequent sessions, if similar channels were judged to be driven by AM stimuli, we proceeded with psychometric testing at 64 and/or 128 Hz. Neurophysiological analyses were performed on sessions that met the same criteria for conducting psychometric analyses. We found no main effect of pre- versus post-electrode implantation psychometric thresholds (Ctl: two-way mixed model ANOVA; F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 3.09, p&gt;0.05; HL: two-way mixed model ANOVA, F<sub>(1,50)</sub> = 3.65, p&gt;0.05), arguing against the possibility of testing-order effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Neurometric analysis</title><p>Spontaneous firing rate (Hz) was calculated across 200 ms prior to nose poke. This time period was chosen because animals were trained to place their noses in the nose port for 200 ms to initiate a trial. Thus, we chose a time period immediately prior to that action to avoid potential artifacts that might have been evoked with nose port contact.</p><p>Each unitâs driven firing rate (FR) was calculated across a time period of spike trains corresponding to the initial onset of the modulation of the stimulus. A neurometric firing rate-based <italic>dâ</italic> was calculated at each Go value (AM depth) by normalizing the firing rate by a SD pooled across all the stimuli (z-score), and subtracting the Nogo value (unmodulated signal) from each Go stimulus. Thus, <italic>dâ</italic><sub>FR</sub> = z(AM Depth<sub>Go</sub>) - z(Unmodulated<sub>Nogo</sub>). In order to optimize our analyses under such conditions of processing across fast temporal rates, we assumed optimal detection success if the finer temporal structure of the neural responses were taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rossi-Pool et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we computed mean FR for each unit across time windows of different lengths (from 25 to 1000 ms, in steps of 25 ms) for each tested AM rate and depth. The âbest time windowâ was indicated as the time window corresponding to the maximum <italic>dâ</italic> calculated between Go AM depths versus the unmodulated noise Nogo signal. The corresponding FR and <italic>dâ</italic> values from this time window across AM depths were used to fill out the neurometric function.</p><p>The dependence of FR on modulation depth was quantified by computing a âmonotonicity indexâ (MI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">de la Rocha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Sadagopan and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Middlebrooks, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Watkins and Barbour, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the MI is the FR at 100% modulation depth expressed as a percentage of the maximum FR observed across all depths. Indices of 100% indicate units display a monotonic increase in FR with increasing modulation depth, with smaller indices indicating monotonic depth dependence with FR that declined at the maximum modulation depth. Thus, units with MI valuesÂ &gt;Â 50% were classified as âmonotonically increasing,â whereas units with MI valuesÂ â¤Â 50% were classified as âmonotonically decreasingâ.</p><p>The strength of stimulus synchrony for each unit across tested AM rates and depths was represented by vector strength (VS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Goldberg and Brown, 1969</xref>). The VS could range from 0 (no synchrony) to 1 (all spikes at identical phase). The statistical significance of the VS was evaluated by the Rayleigh test of uniformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mardia, 1972</xref>) at the level of p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Neurometric classifiers</title><p>In addition to the standard measure of FR, we adopted a pattern classifier analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Machens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Narayan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billimoria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schneider and Woolley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">von Trapp et al., 2016</xref>) to further assess neural encoding of fast AM rates. Given that there are many potential ways cortical units can encode AM, we incorporated four neurometrics for our classifier analyses. The FR metric used the overall spike firing (spikes/sec) in response to each stimulus to calculate neural discriminability. The van Rossum (VR) metric utilizes Euclidean distance to quantify the dissimilarity between two spike trains in high-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">van Rossum, 2001</xref>). Spike trains that are similar to one another have smaller distances between them than spike trains that are dissimilar. The K-means metric, much like the VR metric, utilizes Euclidean distance as a measure of spike train similarity. However, the K-means utilizes an iterative clustering algorithm that classifies spike trains into <italic>K</italic> clusters based on their proximity to each other in high-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Duda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schneider and Woolley, 2010</xref>). The Rcorr metric used an established correlation-based measure of spike timing reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Schreiber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caras et al., 2015</xref>). Rcorr is a normalized measure with a value that can range between 0 (no relationship) to 1 (perfect correlation) between compared spike trains. Spike trains were convolved with an exponential function with a decay constant (tau) across 2â512 ms that optimized the discriminability of each unit.</p><p>The pattern classifier was implemented as follows: First, for each individual unit, two separate templates were formed by randomly selecting (withoutÂ replacement)Â and averaging 50% of Go and Nogo trials of spike trains. Subsequent Go and Nogo trials from this unit were selected at random without replacement and were compared with each template and classified on the basis of the smallest difference between the neurometric values described above. Go trials were labeled as âHitsâ or âMissesâ if they were classified as Go or Nogo trials, respectively. Likewise, Nogo trials were labeled as âCorrect Rejectionsâ or âFalse Alarmsâ if they were classified as Nogo or Go trials. This procedure was repeated 1,000 times with different Go and Nogo templates on each iteration. Neural sensitivity is quantified with a <italic>dâ</italic> metric by incorporating overall hit and false alarm scores, as described in the psychometric analysis above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Neurometric thresholds</title><p>Neurometric thresholds for individual units were defined as the lowest modulation depth that proved significantly different from the unmodulated noise Nogo signal at a tested AM rate. Thus, to calculate neurometric thresholds, values of FR-based and classifier-based <italic>dâ</italic> were plotted as a function of AM depth such that each unit was compared with its own baseline (i.e., unmodulated noise Nogo). Significant modulation depths possessed neural <italic>dâ</italic><underline>&gt;</underline>1. The criteria for calculating a neurometric threshold consisted of units possessing at least one significant modulation depth. This is similar to previous studies that examine representations of AM in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Rosen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">2012</xref>) and inferior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Nelson and Carney, 2007</xref>). Two <italic>dâ</italic> values and their corresponding AM depths were taken from the function: greatest <italic>dâ</italic> value below 1, and smallest <italic>dâ</italic> value above 1. Threshold was taken as the corresponding interpolated AM depth that crossed <italic>dâ</italic>=1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Population coding</title><p>We used a linear classifier readout procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Rust and DiCarlo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Pagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carruthers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Christison-Lagay et al., 2017</xref>) to assess AM sensitivity across a population of ACx units. Specifically, a linear classifier was trained to decode responses from a proportion of trials to each stimulus set (e.g., âGoâ and âNogoâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Spike firing responses from <italic>N</italic> neurons were counted across 1 ms bins to <italic>T</italic> trials of <italic>S</italic> stimuli (âGoâ and âNogoâ) and formed a population âresponse vectorâ. The number of trials was equal for each hearing status group. 80% of trials were randomly sampled (without replacement) and averaged across <italic>N</italic> neurons, reducing the response vector to length N<sub>bin</sub>, and fitted to a linear hyperplane that was determined by a support vector machine (SVM) procedure (âtraining setâ). Cross-validated classification performance was assessed on the remaining 20% of trials by computing the number of times the test set was correctly classified and misclassified based on the linear hyperplane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom). Performance metrics included the proportion of correctly classified Go trials (âHitsâ) and misclassified Nogo trials (âFalse Alarmsâ). Similar to the psychophysics and pattern classifier analyses, we converted population decoder performance metrics into <italic>dâ</italic> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C and D</xref>). We explored how well our ACx population could differentiate between Go (100% AM Depth) versus Nogo (unmodulated) signals across different bin sizes (e.g., 1â1000 ms) and found the best performance was seen with 1 ms bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In order to construct a homogenous neural population, absolute z-score values were calculated from the responses across each trial. This procedure was conducted across 250 iterations with a new randomly drawn train and test set for each iteration. Error bars were calculated as the SD of performance across all 250 iterations. The SVM procedure was implemented in MATLAB using the âsvmtrainâ and âsvmclassifyâ functions with a linear kernel and cost set to 1 (default value). The C (âcostâ) parameter controls the decision boundary of classifying training points correctly. For a high C value, the SVM optimization will utilize a smaller-margin hyperplane, whereas a low C value will cause the SVM optimization to utilize a larger-margin hyperplane. In general, exceedingly high and low C values could misclassify many training points. We set the cost parameter to the algorithmâs default value of 1, which is ideal for our train and test configuration of two classes (Go versus Nogo).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Choice probability</title><p>To assess the relationship between neural sensitivity in ACx with behavioral choice, we calculated choice probability (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Britten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Christison-Lagay et al., 2017</xref>). CP quantifies trial-to-trial correlation between neural activity and an animalâs behavioral choice via an ROC-based ideal observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>). Specifically, CP is the degree of overlap between two distributions of spike firing for trials where the animals report modulation (âGoâ) versus trials where the animal does not report modulation (âNogoâ). Since animals rarely failed to report modulation at high modulation depths (~0 dB rel. 100% depth), we only included modulation depths around threshold where a substantial number of reported modulation and no modulation trials were made. A CP value of 1 (or 0) indicates firing rate is always higher (or lower) when the animal reports an AM stimulus than when the animal does not. A CP value near 0.5 means no correlation between choice and spike-firing activity is apparent (i.e., chance level).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Auditory brainstem response (ABR) recording</title><p>We recorded ABRs from a majority of our animals (Ctl: nÂ =Â 9; HL: nÂ =Â 8) to compare peripheral status and auditory sensitivity upstream of ACx (e.g., brainstem function) between Ctl and HL groups. ABR procedures are identical to those of previous studies from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caras and Sanes, 2015</xref>). Briefly, once animals accomplished all behavioral training and testing stages, they were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (30 mg/kp; Bioniche Pharma) and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a small sound booth (Industrial Acoustics). Animal internal temperature was maintained at 37Â°C by a digitally controlled heating blanket. Pin electrodes were inserted subcutaneously at the vertex of the skull (positive electrode) and caudal to the right pinna (inverting electrode). A ground pin electrode was inserted into the left leg. A preamplifier (P55; Grass Technologies) amplified (10,000 gain) voltage responses and signals were bandpass filtered between 0.3â3 kHz with an additional gain of 14 dB (Brownless Precision Model 440 amplifier, AutoMate Scientific). Signals were digitized at 24.4 kHz sampling rate (RZ6, Tucker Davis Technologies) and acquired on a personal Microsoft Windows computer.</p><p>Stimulus generation and data acquisition were controlled by custom Python scripts (provided by Brandon Warren and Edwin Rubel, University of Washington, Seattle). We presented two types of acoustic stimuli that were delivered from a calibrated free-field speaker positioned 26 cm above the animalâs head. One type consisted of 100 Âµs clicks that were repeated 23/s at alternating polarity and in 10 dB descending steps until the full ABR disappeared, at which point the intensity was increased by 5 dB SPL until a reliable response was observed (online visually detectable N1 potential). The lowest sound level (dB SPL) at which a reliable response was seen was taken as threshold. Traces were averaged across 250â500 sweeps.</p><p>We also delivered 50â100 ms broadband AM noise (0.1â20 kHz) with a 5 ms cosine ramp at onset and offset across behaviorally tested rates (64, 128, 256, and 512 Hz) and modulation depths (â15 to 0 dB rel. 100% depth). An unmodulated noise signal was also presented. AM and unmodulated noise stimuli were presented 6.6/s and atÂ +30 dB above click threshold (~45â50 dB SPL for Ctl;~85â90 dB for HL). Auditory-evoked potentials to these stimuli were averaged across 1,000 repetitions and referred to as envelope following responses (EFRs) to signify their relationship with the temporal modulation envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Parthasarathy and Bartlett, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Parthasarathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Parthasarathy et al., 2016</xref>). We quantified the degree of phase-locking by performing fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on the waveforms betweenÂ +10 ms stimulus onset to â10 ms stimulus offset. The peak FFT amplitude is labeled the maximum energy at the presented modulation frequency or within 3 Hz above and below it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Parthasarathy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Parthasarathy and Bartlett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Parthasarathy and Bartlett, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Parthasarathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Parthasarathy et al., 2016</xref>). The peak FFT amplitudes evoked across AM depths were fitted with exponential functions. The ânoise floorâ was calculated from the unmodulated noise condition and the threshold for each AM rate was defined as the lowest modulation depth with a peak FFT amplitude that is twice as high as the noise floor.</p><p>In addition to the initial electrode configurations described above (hereafter referred to as âConfiguration 2â), we also utilized a separate configuration where the positive pin electrode was placed horizontally, along the interaural line, above the standard location of the inferior colliculus (hereafter referred to as âConfiguration 1â). 'Configuration 2' emphasizes waves I and III of the ABR with robust EFRs to AM ratesÂ &gt;Â 100 Hz, whereas 'Configuration 1' emphasizes waves IV and V with robust EFRs to AM ratesÂ &lt;Â 100 Hz. It is suggested that waves I to III are generated by portions of the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Sohmer et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchwald and Huang, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Starr and Hamilton, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achor and Starr, 1980</xref>) through the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">MÃ¸ller and Jannetta, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Melcher and Kiang, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>).

With regards to temporal processing across the ascending auditory system, previous studies show that the two distinct pin electrode configurations for recording EFRs can represent discrete neural generators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Parthasarathy and Bartlett, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Parthasarathy et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the more standard electrode setup ('Configuration 2') exhibits more robust EFRs at faster AM rates (&gt;100 Hz), which may emphasize more caudal brainstem structures through the auditory nerve. In addition, the electrode set up described as âConfiguration 1â exhibits more robust responses at slower modulation rates (&lt;100 Hz) and emphasizes more rostral auditory nuclei that include the inferior colliculus, suggesting that utilizing both Configuration 1 and 2 electrode setups is important for comparing multiple levels of temporal processing along the rostral to caudal auditory pathway. Furthermore, two studies have demonstrated that scalp-recorded potentials to fast AM rates (i.e., greater thanÂ ~80 Hz) in unanesthetized animals (cat and rabbit) are produced by neural generators at or below the auditory midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kiren et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kuwada et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we utilized EFR measures as an assay of auditory temporal processing with the assumption that the EFR corresponds to a measure of population temporal fidelity up to the level of the brainstem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical procedures</title><p>Statistical analyses and procedures were implemented in JMP 13.2.0 (SAS) or custom-written MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks) that incorporated the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.

When data were not normally distributed, either the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used when appropriate.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>There was extensive discussion among the reviewers about how conclusive they felt these observations to be, and there were a variety of graded opinions about how to deal with these diverse takes on the manuscript, and whether rewriting would be able to deal with them conclusively. Therefore, at odds with the usual <italic>eLife</italic> practice, we are including all three of the initial reviews in entirety. In your revision, please provide the best and most comprehensive replies to the issues raised in the reviews. Many of the concerns will require more detail, and to some degree our final assessment will depend on how well you are able to deal with the concerns, although all of the reviewers find the work addresses an important set of problems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports, for normal hearing animals and in animals with a developmental conductive hearing loss, that behavioral performance in an amplitude-modulation (AM) detection task is reflected in auditory cortical but not brainstem population activity. A reduction of the detection ability for high AM frequencies following a moderate, conductive threshold shift is documented.</p><p>Overall, this a technically well-executed study with careful controls and sensible analytical approaches. Major assets are that cortical recordings were made while animals performed the task. The observation that behavioral AM performance in Gerbils could be traced to cortical population firing rate changes in normal hearing animals confirms previous reports in this and other species. The fact that this was also true for animals with a substantial conductive hearing loss is certainly novel, even if it only corroborates that a general peripheral threshold shift does not seem to alter how behavior is reflected in sensory cortical activity. The observed reduction of AM-depth detection at high AM frequencies provides behavioral and electrophysiological evidence that parallels observations in humans and supports the hypothesis that chronic conductive loss, likely via reduced inhibition, generates a wider range of temporal response variability, constraining central auditory AM encoding abilities.</p><p>A couple of issues, however, diminish the potential interpretations and impact of this approach.</p><p>The issue with most attempts to compare psychometric and neurometric thresholds is that there seem to be too many free parameters on the physiology side. What if the decoding model is suboptimal, e.g., missing relevant temporal patterns? What if the assumptions about the decoding model are not biologically realizable? What if there are different subpopulations and the relevant population is undersampled? What if irrelevant neurons are oversampled, corrupting the representation?</p><p>The reliance on rate measures is a bit puzzling as work in monkey has shown that primary cortex does utilize temporal response aspects and, in addition, that rate measures may be correlated with performance but not always with a monotonic increase in FR with better performance. How is a population approach, as used here, affected by these different codes and neuronal stimulus dependencies?</p><p>Another aspect, previously addressed by the authors and others, is that top-down influences shape learning as well as neuronal properties during performance. Is it conceivable that the observed effects are more a reflection of the recurrent decision process than the encoding/decoding contributions of AC itself?</p><p>The claim that the behavioral performance reduction is not reflected in brainstem activity is intriguing but perhaps premature. The main question is what the population activity observed with ABRs and EFRs actually tells us about the local activity of several stations. The summated activity is certainly significantly affected by the degree of synchrony within and across those stations, potentially obscuring subpopulation contributions and firing rate modulations which were the key to the observations in AC. Also, the brainstem responses were not obtained while the animals where performing the task. This may not be necessary to make the point that brainstem activity is seemingly not affected by the hearing loss but further dissociates the two main parts of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a great paper, where the authors investigate the effect of a conductive hearing loss on brainstem processing, cortical responses, and perceptual deficits. They focus on two primary results. The first is that conductive hearing loss leads to a reduction in performance on an auditory detection task, with no alteration in brainstem temporal processing. The second is that perceptual deficits were associated with a degraded population code.</p><p>Overall, I think it's a lovely paper, and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I do have some specific comments that I feel will improve the quality of the paper.</p><p>1) There are a number of different factors that could alter sound responses in this kind of task. Could you please provide details as to the size of the behavioral apparatus, and comment on the following issues? Specifically since there is only one speaker, the sound path to the animals ear will change as the animal navigates. What is the natural variability in neural responses that you would expect from roaming in such an environment (compared to what you observed in the group differences)? Locomotion effects might also change both firing rate and response variability. Were there systematic differences in the way in which the different groups moved around the arena?</p><p>2) &quot;ABR thresholds to clicks, which is a general measure of hearing thresholdâ¦&quot;. And all other references to ABR's reflecting hearing. There has been work showing that ABRs do not really measure &quot;hearing&quot;, they measure brainstem function. Chambers et al. (2016) have shown that lesioning &gt;95% of cochlear afferent synapses can virtually eliminate the ABR but leave tone detection behavior completely normal. It would be nice to make this point clear in the paper.</p><p>3) Statistics used should be related to the way the data is presented. As an example, the data in Figure 6D shows median value for the two groups, but the statistical test used does not test for a difference in median. The KS test tests whether the underlying probability distributions differ, and it does this by calculating the KS statistic from the CDF's (so this test is more appropriate when directly comparing CDFs in Figure 6). If the point is to be made that there is a difference in median, then perhaps something like a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test would be a better choice.</p><p>4) Population decoding performance normally scales with the number of neurons in the population. Is this the case in your data? And, if so, can you control for this when comparing decoder accuracy between groups of different sizes?</p><p>5) You've shown an interesting change in variability between groups, but I wonder whether there may also be differences in co-variability between groups. Have you looked at noise correlations at all (between simultaneously recorded units)? If there was a difference between groups, then the importance of noise correlations could also be studied with the population decoder by shuffling the trial order.</p><p>6) With regards to Figure 6A. This figure is showing CDFs of firing rates between groups of animals. I don't think you mention anywhere what the individual animal N is. Could you please provide evidence that this between group difference isn't being driven by a particular (or small group) of animals. This could be achieved (for example) by constructing a bootstrapped statistical test, whereby the same N was drawn repeatedly from each animal. Could you also please show the data that these differences (in FR and CV) holds up for single-units?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the behavioural and neurophysiological consequences of a permanent developmental conductive hearing loss in gerbils. Unlike previous studies of this topic, the authors are able to record from auditory cortical neurons whilst the animals perform a behavioural task. They find that animals reared with hearing loss are less sensitive to amplitude modulation of sounds, but only for faster modulation rates. A population decoder applied to cortical neurons shows a broadly similar deficit. The authors argue that this is because the responses of cortical neurons are more variable across trials in animals reared with hearing loss. Auditory brainstem responses (specifically the envelope following response) do not show a deficit in animals reared with hearing loss. The authors therefore conclude that the behavioural deficit in temporal processing emerges above the level of the brainstem, perhaps even in the cortex itself.</p><p>Overall, the authors should be commended for tackling an important topic using an ambitious and novel methodological approach that produces an interesting set of results. However, there are a couple of areas that could be written more clearly or need additional detail. There are also a number of important differences between the behavioural and neurophysiological data, and it would be helpful to identify these clearly and discuss their implications at greater length.</p><p>The methods used for population decoding need to be explained more clearly and in greater detail.</p><p>Although the population decoder data share certain features with the behavioural data, there are also a number of important differences. These need to be clarified and discussed at greater length. Estimating thresholds from non-monotonic data, or data that do not cross threshold, also poses a considerable problem that needs to be discussed. Without a consideration of these issues, it is difficult to fully assess the degree of similarity between the behavioural and neurophysiological data.</p><p>It would also be helpful to discuss the results in the context of previous anaesthetized work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33891.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was extensive discussion among the reviewers about how conclusive they felt these observations to be, and there were a variety of graded opinions about how to deal with these diverse takes on the manuscript, and whether rewriting would be able to deal with them conclusively.

However, we acknowledge that external validation does not yet exist for decoding models.</p><p>To evaluate whether the decoding model is missing relevant temporal patterns, we calculated how well the ACx population could differentiate between Go (100% AM Depth) versus Nogo (unmodulated) signals across a broad range of bin sizes. Figure 7B (new) shows that the best readout performance (maximum <italic>dâ</italic>) from our decoding analysis peaked at a bin size of 1 ms for all tested AM rates, and in both hearing status groups. In addition, we examined population decoding performance as a function of population size. For this analysis, a resampling procedure was applied to randomly select a subpopulation of units (10-100% of total units) across 250 iterations. During each iteration of the resampling procedure, a new subpopulation of units was randomly selected (without replacement) from all units prior to the decoding readout procedure. Average performance and variability ( Â± 1 SD) were calculated across 250 iterations. Figure 7C displays the decoding readout performance as a function of the number of units for each AM rate tested. In general, the inclusion of all units produced optimal decoding performance.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of an ACx subpopulation, we calculated the performance of neurons that increased their firing rate as a function of AM depth versus those that decreased their FR. In the original manuscript, we reported that FR increased in 51.7% of units and decreased in 48.3% (examples in Figure 6B). We now formalize this distinction by computing a âmonotonicity indexâ (MI; de la Rocha et al., 2008; Sadagopan and Wang, 2008; Middlebrooks, 2008a,b; Watkins and Barbour, 2011). Specifically, the MI is the FR at 100% modulation depth expressed as a percentage of the maximum FR observed across all depths. Indices of 100% indicate units that display a monotonic increase in FR with increasing modulation depth, with smaller indices indicating nonmonotonic responses (distribution shown in Figure 8A). Thus, we compared decoder readout performance between nonmonotonic versus monotonic units, using MI values â¤ 50% as a criterion for nonmonotonicity. A sufficient number of nonmonotonic neurons were available at 128 and 256 Hz conditions (Figure 8B) to perform this analysis. Decoder performance was superior for nonmonotonic units across most AM depths at 128 and 256 Hz, both from Ctl and HL groups. This result suggests that optimal decoding of fast AM information could rely on a subpopulation of ACx neurons. That said, the inclusion of all units more closely resembles psychometric performance as suggested by previous studies (e.g., Shadlen et al., 1998).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reliance on rate measures is a bit puzzling as work in monkey has shown that primary cortex does utilize temporal response aspects and, in addition, that rate measures may be correlated with performance but not always with a monotonic increase in FR with better performance.

This is addressed, in part, with the new analysis of bin size (above).

Many studies demonstrate that engagement in an auditory-guided task modulates ACx response properties (Fritz et al., 2003, 2005; Otazu et al., 2009; Lee and Middlebrooks, 2011; Niwa and Sutter, 2012; Schneider et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Slee and David, 2015; von Trapp et al., 2016). That was actually the primary motivation for the present study, since previous studies of this sort on developmental plasticity have compared separate groups of animals for measures of physiology and behavior.</p><p>The most appropriate paradigm to test for potential top-down influences would be to assess neuronal response properties evoked by the same auditory stimuli across separate conditions of on-task (engaged) versus off-task (disengaged). In fact, we are currently conducting a separate set of experiments where ACx responses from Ctl and HL gerbils are obtained during task engaged and disengaged conditions, using an AM discrimination task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claim that the behavioral performance reduction is not reflected in brainstem activity is intriguing but perhaps premature.

There is precedent for this sort of null finding in the literature: tone detection thresholds that are assessed with ABRs following noise induced hearing loss can appear normal even when some cochlear synapses have been lost (Kujawa and Liberman, 2009). To address this issue, we made two changes to the manuscript: (1) We have backed off from the strong assertion that the brainstem is not impaired by HL and, instead, state throughout the manuscript that our recordings do not reveal an impairment. This is accurate and leaves open the possibility that future awake-behaving studies that record from auditory brainstem structures may reveal interesting changes. (2) We have added text to the Discussion that explicitly acknowledges this possibility. In the same passage, we acknowledge that inferior colliculus neurons are modulated by task-engagement (Slee and David, 2015), leaving open the possibility that EFRs obtained during performance of the AM detection task could have been differentially modulated in Ctl and HL animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] Overall, I think it's a lovely paper, and worthy of publication in eLife.
