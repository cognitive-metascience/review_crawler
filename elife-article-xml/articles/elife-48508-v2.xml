How microorganisms survive the dry daytime on leaves and avoid desiccation is not well understood. There is evidence that microscopic surface wetness in the form of thin films and micrometer-sized droplets, invisible to the naked eye, persists on leaves during daytime due to deliquescence – the absorption of water until dissolution – of hygroscopic aerosols. Here, we study how such microscopic wetness affects cell survival. We show that, on surfaces drying under moderate humidity, stable microdroplets form around bacterial aggregates due to capillary pinning and deliquescence. Notably, droplet-size increases with aggregate-size, and cell survival is higher the larger the droplet. This phenomenon was observed for 13 bacterial species, two of which – <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> – were studied in depth. Microdroplet formation around aggregates is likely key to bacterial survival in a variety of unsaturated microbial habitats, including leaf surfaces.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48508.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A single plant leaf can be home to about 10 million bacteria and other microbes. These microscopic organisms are part of a larger community of microbes – the microbiome – that plays an important role in the life and health of their plant host. Like all other organisms, bacteria need water to survive, but the surfaces of leaves experience daily changes in moisture, tending to be much wetter at night than during the day.</p><p>While the surfaces of leaves often appear dry during the day, previous studies suggest they may actually be covered by thin films or tiny droplets of fluid that are invisible to the naked eye. This microscopic wetness forms because hygroscopic particles such as aerosols, which tend to absorb moisture from the air, are common on the leaf surface. These molecules absorb water until they become dissolved in it, leaving behind a concentrated solution (a process known as deliquescence). However, it is not clear if this microscopic wetness can protect bacteria from drying out.</p><p>Here, Grinberg, Orevi et al. investigated how bacteria, including several species that are commonly found on plants, survived episodes of drying on an artificial surface that produces microscopic wetness. The experiments revealed that as the surfaces dried out, stable microscopic droplets formed around the bacterial cells. The droplets that formed around aggregates of bacterial cells were larger than those that formed around solitary cells. Bacteria inside these droplets can survive longer than 24 hours, and survival rates were much higher in larger droplets.</p><p>Further experiments found that 11 other species of bacteria could also survive an episode of drying for over 24 hours if microscopic droplets formed around them. Together, these findings suggest that by organizing themselves into aggregates, bacteria can improve their chance of surviving on the surface of leaves and other environments that are frequently exposed to drying.</p><p>These results help explain how microbes avoid drying and survive during the daytime on leaf surfaces. Understanding how microscopic leaf wetness protects the plant microbiome is important because it helps explain how it can be disrupted by agricultural practices and human-made aerosols, information that can be used to better protect plants.</p><p>Microscopic surface wetness is likely to occur in many other situations including in the soil, on human and animal skin, and in homes and workplaces. These findings may have broad implications on the way we understand bacterial life on these seemingly dry surfaces, potentially leading to future benefits for human health, agriculture, and nature conservation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant microbiome</kwd><kwd>phyllosphere</kwd><kwd>desiccation</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic></kwd><kwd>deliquescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

These communities, dominated by bacteria, play a major role in the function and health of their host plant, and take part in global biogeochemical cycles. Hydration conditions on plant leaf surfaces vary considerably over the diurnal cycle, typically with wet nights and dry days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beattie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer and Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magarey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klemm et al., 2002</xref>). An open question is how bacteria survive the dry daytime on leaves and avoid desiccation.</p><p>While leaf surfaces may appear to be completely dry during the day, there is increasing evidence that they are frequently covered by thin liquid films or micrometer-sized droplets that are invisible to the naked eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhardt and Hunsche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt and Eiden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This microscopic wetness results, in large part, from the deliquescence of hygroscopic particles that absorb moisture until they dissolve in the absorbed water and form a solution. One ubiquitous source of deliquescent compounds on plant leaf surfaces is aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pöschl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang and Munkelwitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang, 1979</xref>). Notably, during the day, the relative humidity (RH) in the boundary layer close to the leaf surface is typically higher than that in the surrounding air, due to transpiration through open stomata. Thus, in many cases, the RH is above the deliquescent point, leading to the formation of highly concentrated solutions in the form of thin films (&lt;a few µm) and microscopic droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhardt and Hunsche, 2013</xref>). The phenomenon of deliquescence-associated microscopic surface wetness is under-studied, and little is known about its impact on microbial ecology of the phyllosphere and on its contribution to desiccation avoidance and cell survival during the dry daytime.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48508.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microscopic wetness: Experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plant leaf surfaces are usually wet at night with visible macroscopic wetness (e.g. dewdrops).

The hollow part of the sticker is loaded with a medium containing suspended bacteria cells. The well-plate is placed under constant temperature, RH, and air circulation.

Only a few studies have attempted to characterize the microscopic hydration conditions surrounding cells on a drying surface under moderate RH and the involvement of deliquescent substrates in this process. Bacterial survival in deliquescent wetness has mainly been studied in extremely dry deserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davila et al., 2013</xref>) and on Mars analog environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nuding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). Soft liquid-like substances wrapped around cells, whose formation was suggested to be due to deliquescence of solute components, were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Méndez-Vilas et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, the interplay between droplet formation, bacterial surface colonization, and survival, has not been studied systematically.</p><p>Bacterial cells on leaf surfaces are observed in solitary and aggregated forms. The majority of cells are typically found within surface-attached aggregates, that is biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monier and Lindow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 1997</xref>). This is consistent with the reported increased survival rate in aggregates under dry conditions on leaves, and poor survival of solitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monier and Lindow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rigano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 1999</xref>). The conventional explanation for the increased survival in aggregates is the protective role of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), a matrix that acts as a hydrogel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Or et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberson and Firestone, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ophir and Gutnick, 1994</xref>). Here, we ask if aggregation plays additional roles in protection from desiccation. We hypothesize that the resulting microscale hydration conditions around cells on a drying surface depend on cellular organization (i.e. solitary/aggregated cells and aggregate size) and that the microscale hydration conditions (i.e. droplet size) affect cell survival.</p><p>To this end, we designed an experimental system that creates deliquescent microscopic wetness on artificial surfaces. This system conserves some basic important features of natural leaf microscopic wetness while eliminating some of the complexities of studying leaf surfaces directly. The system enabled us to perform a systematic microscopic analysis of the interplay between bacteria’s cellular organization on a surface, microscopic wetness, and cell survival on surfaces drying under moderate humidity.</p><p>We observed that bacterial cells – aggregates in particular – retained a hydrated micro-environment in the form of stable microscopic droplets (of tens of µm in diameter) while the surface was macroscopically dry. We then quantitatively analyzed the distribution of droplet size, its correlation with aggregate size, and the fraction of live and dead cells in each droplet. The significance of our results is discussed in the context of survival strategies on drying surfaces, microbial ecology of the phyllosphere, and possible relevance to other habitats.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drying experiments on bacteria-colonized surfaces</title><p>Studying bacteria in microscopic surface wetness directly on leaves poses a significant technological challenge due to strong auto-fluorescence, surface roughness, and transparency of films and microdroplets. We therefore constructed a simple experimental system, accessible to microscopy, that enables studying the interplay between bacterial surface colonization, cell survival, and microscopic wetness on artificial surfaces. This system enables capturing microscopic leaf wetness central properties, including contribution of deliquescent substrates, droplet persistence, thickness, and patchiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> - see Materials and methods).

Qualitatively similar results were observed for 16 additional strains (13 bacterial species in total - see Materials and methods). Briefly, bacterial cells were inoculated in diluted M9 minimal media onto hollowed stickers applied to the glass substrate of multi-well plates and placed inside an environmental chamber under constant temperature and RH (28°C; 70% or 85% RH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> - Materials and methods).

During this time, for both studied strains, some of the cells attached to the surface and, over time, grew and formed aggregates. Other cells formed cell clusters at the liquid-air interface (pellicles). The rest of the cells remained solitary: either surface-attached, or planktonic. The glass substrate appeared dry to the naked eye after 14 ± 1 hr of incubation. We then examined the surface of the wells under the microscope (see Materials and methods). Remarkably, the surface was covered by stable microscopic droplets, mainly around bacterial aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Notably, while solitary cells were surrounded by miniscule droplets (possibly similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Méndez-Vilas et al., 2011</xref>), larger aggregates (of ~100 cells) were surrounded by large droplets measuring tens of µm in diameter.

We found that droplet size (measured by droplet area) follows a power law distribution with similar exponents for the two studied strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When droplet size was plotted as a function of area covered by cells within each droplet (as a proxy for cell number - see Materials and methods), a clear positive correlation between cell abundance and droplet size emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

First, we repeated the experiments with fluorescent beads (2 µm in diameter) instead of bacteria. Interestingly, we found that microdroplets formed even around beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) with a similar droplet-size distribution, as in experiments with bacteria; and a surprisingly similar correlation between the size of the droplet and the number of beads therein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). In a control experiment without any particulates – bacterial cells or beads – a much smaller number of droplets formed (&lt;1 droplets of &gt;10 µm<sup>2</sup> area per mm<sup>2</sup>, as opposed to &gt;100 droplets of that size in experiments with bacteria). These results indicate that the presence of particles is necessary for droplet formation, whereas biological activity is not. Last, we repeated the beads experiment with pure water instead of M9 medium. This time we did not observe any droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the solutes control droplet formation and retention through their deliquescent properties.</p><p>To observe the surface’s final drying phase, we used time-lapse imaging, enabling us to capture the receding front of the remaining thin liquid layer and the formation of microdroplets. Retention of droplets around aggregates as well as solitary cells, through pinning of the liquid-air interface, is clearly evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). The cause of this pinning is the strong capillary forces acting on the rough surfaces produced by the presence of particulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herminghaus et al., 2008</xref>). This phenomenon supports the notion that aggregate sizes (but possibly also other properties) determine droplet size. We note that under our experimental conditions, the droplets were not formed through the wetting ‘direction’ of a deliquescence process, by which solid salts absorb water until dissolution. Rather, the deliquescent properties of the solutes prevented complete evaporation at RH above the point of deliquescence of the salts mixture. In summary, both particulates and deliquescent solutes are essential for the differential formation and retention of microscopic wetness around cells and aggregates.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48508-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48508.012</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The formation of microdroplets around bacterial cells.</title><p>The thin (a few μm thick) liquid’s receding front clears out from the surface, leaving behind microdroplets whenever it encounters solitary cells, surface-attached aggregates, or floating pellicles.

To overcome that challenge, we added a fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 647) to the initial M9 medium, as a reporter for the solute concentration induced by evaporation. We compared the fluorescent intensity of dye-labeled microdroplets to a calibration curve built by measuring the intensities of known concentrations of the standard M9 supplemented with Alexa 647 (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that the microdroplet solution is highly concentrated – as can be expected from deliquescent wetness – and is estimated to be 23.3 ± 3.5 (mean ± SD) more concentrated than a standard M9 (~50 times more concentrated than the diluted 0.5x M9 used in our experiments) (See Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The high estimated mean osmolarity within the droplets (~6.7 Osm/L, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) likely imposes severe osmotic stress on cells within them.

Thus, live cells emit green-yellow fluorescence, while dead cells exhibit red emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The assay’s validity was further confirmed by the observation that following further incubation at 95% RH, YFP-expressing cells were dividing (some were even motile), while red cells lacked signs of physiological activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

We show that bacterial cell organization on a surface strongly affects the microscopic hydration conditions around cells, and that droplet size strongly affects cell survival. We reveal an additional function of bacterial aggregation: improving hydration by retaining large stable droplets (&gt;tens of µm in diameter) around aggregates. Why survival is enhanced in larger droplets remains an open question. We hypothesize that larger droplets provide favorable conditions due to higher water potential; further research is required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We note that the evaporation dynamics of a drop of a liquid solution – even without bacteria – is a surprisingly rich and complex physical process and a subject of intensive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Gennes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonn et al., 2009</xref>). Our results point to two central mechanisms promoting the formation and stability of microdroplets around bacterial aggregates: The first is pinning of the liquid-air interface due to the large interfacial tension force associated with the rough surfaces of particulate aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herminghaus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonn et al., 2009</xref>), as observed in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>. The second is the deliquescent property of solutes that prohibits complete evaporation of the pinned droplets at RH that is higher than the point of deliquescence of the solutes, such that the droplets are in equilibrium with the surrounding humid air.</p><p>We suggest that bacterial self-organization on surfaces can improve survival in environments with recurrent drying that lead to microscopic wetness. A simple conceptual model that captures the system’s main components and their interactions is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Aggregation is an important feature that can affect self-organization, and in turn, the resulting waterscape, by increasing the fraction of the population that ends up in large droplets.

Some phyllospheric bacteria (mostly plant pathogens) exhibited low survival, soil bacteria exhibited variable survival rates, <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibited a surprising medium survival, and the aquatic strain <italic>P. veronii</italic> exhibited high survival. Survival in microscopic surface wetness is likely a complex trait that combines physiological adaptation of the individual cell and collective protection that results from self-organization and cooperation (i.e. aggregation). In nature, bacteria live in complex communities comprised of many bacterial species and are exposed to various chemical and physical environmental cues. Thus, our single-strain experiments, with M9 medium on glass-bottom wells, may not capture survival strategies that might be triggered by environmental cues and that rely on other members of the community. For example, joining existing aggregates of other species can be a beneficial strategy in environments with recurrent drying events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grinberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinberg et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Obviously, there are more differences between natural leaf surfaces and our simplified experimental system. Firstly, leaf surfaces have heterogeneous 3D topography due to leaf microscale anatomy such as the cavities between epidermal cells, stomata openings, and trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koch et al., 2008</xref>). This microscale topography affects drying and wetting of the leaf surface, and hence can impact droplet formation both by its effect on interfacial forces and pinning as well as imposing stronger flow upon topological sinks. Secondly, leaf surfaces tend to be hydrophobic to a degree that varies among plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koch et al., 2008</xref>). The impact of both microscale topography and surface hydrophobicity on drying and droplet formation can be studied using artificial leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doan and Leveau, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soffe et al., 2019</xref>) or leaf cuticle peels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schönherr and Riederer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Remus-Emsermann et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the chemical composition of leaf surface wetness varies considerably with multiple factors including plant species, soil characteristics (e.g. salinity), geography, and environmental variables that affect atmospheric aerosol composition, deposition, and retention, such as wind and rain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pöschl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang and Munkelwitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang, 1979</xref>). All of these factors are likely to affect the formation and retention of microscopic leaf wetness.</p><p>Our results suggest that microscopic surface wetness, predicted to occur globally on plant leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkhardt and Hunsche, 2013</xref>), can explain how microorganisms survive on leaf surfaces during daytime by avoiding complete desiccation. Yet, they also imply that phyllospheric bacteria have evolved mechanisms to cope with the highly concentrated solutions associated with deliquescent wetness. The ability to tolerate periods of such high salinities could thus be a ubiquitous and necessary trait for phyllospheric bacteria. Better understanding of bacterial survival in microscopic deliquescent surface wetness, and how it is affected by agricultural practices and anthropogenic aerosol emissions, is thus of great importance to microbial ecology of the phyllosphere and to plant pathology.</p><p>Finally, as deliquescent substances are prevalent in many other microbial habitats, it is safe to assume that deliquescent microscopic wetness occurs in many microbial habitats, including soil and rock surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davila et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davila et al., 2013</xref>), the built environment, human and animal skin, and even extraterrestrial systems (e.g. Mars; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nuding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, microscopic surface wetness is likely to have a significant impact not only on survival, but also on additional key aspects of bacterial life, including motility, communication, competition, interactions, and exchange of genetic material, as demonstrated for soil and other porous media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tecon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Or et al., 2007</xref>).

Although some information is lost in the projection, it was deemed a necessary tradeoff for the analysis of the large scanned area and the quantity of data involved. We assume that the relationship between droplet area and volume is monotonous, and that the great majority of cellular aggregates are single layered. To affirm these assumptions, we performed 3D analysis using z-stacking and 3D deconvolution on a small surface area. This analysis verified that our droplet identification and segmentation does not capture flat discolorations as droplets, and that indeed the cells within the droplets are generally arranged in a single layer on the surface, or suspended in the liquid at densities low enough to maintain the validity of 2D projections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses and statistics for experiments with bacterial cells were based on microscopy images of five different surface sections (each of an area of 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) per well. Data analyses and statistics for experiments with beads were based on microscopy images of surface sections of areas of 10 mm<sup>2</sup>. For statistical analysis of mean values and standard errors, droplets and aggregates were binned by their size on a logarithmic scale. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, standard errors are based on the five surface sections (of 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) per strain (n = 5) and nine different surface sections (of 1.1 mm<sup>2</sup>) for the beads experiment (n = 9). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, standard errors are calculated for all droplets within each bin (size range of droplets) of the combined data of the five surface sections for experiments with bacteria.

In order to build concentration calibration curves (i.e., a graph that describes the fluorescence intensity versus known concentration of M9 or NaCl solutions), the stock solutions were diluted (in diH<sub>2</sub>O) by the following factors: 1.11, 1.25, 1.43, 1.6, 2, 2.5, 3.33, 5, 10 and 20. A 5 µl drop was pipetted out of each diluted sample and placed on the glass surface (thickness 0.15 mm) of a 24-well plate that was pre-equilibrated with a reservoir of tap water to maintain humid conditions. Drops were imaged by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Droplets concentration</title><p>Droplets from M9 (0.5x and 0.05x) and NaCl (16 mM, 40 mM) solutions were formed through our standard drying surface experiments with 2 μm beads, as described previously. Droplets were imaged by confocal microscopy 18 hr after the plates were placed in the growth chamber (28°C, 85% RH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Confocal imaging was acquired using a LEICA SP8 (CTR6000) microscope with a Leica HC PL APO CS2 40x (1.10 N.A.) water objective. Lasers line 638 nm was used for excitation of Alexa 647, and emission was collected between 656–684 nm. All images were collected with a PMT detector (laser intensity 0.01 or 0.05 and Gain 680 or 640 for M9 or NaCl calibration curves, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Image processing and data analysis</title><p>The calibration curves were obtained by measuring the mean intensity of the 5 µl drops of known concentrations, for M9 and NaCl separately. For each solute fixed resolution, laser intensity and photomultiplier gain values were used. The intensity of the drops was defined as the mean intensity of 1,000 × 1,000 pixels (109 μm x 109 μm area) within the drop, without overlapping with the drop edges. The series of intensity-concentration pair data points were used to build the calibration curves, by piecewise-linear interpolation. The concentrations of microdroplets from the drying surface experiments were estimated by measuring their intensity and converting this value to concentrations using the calibration curves. Microdroplet intensity was measured by imaging a 520 μm x 520 μm square with the same resolution, laser intensity, and photomultiplier gain values as for the 5 µl drops of the respective solute (M9 or NaCl). The microdroplets were segmented by setting a threshold value higher than that of the background intensity. The intensity value for each microdroplet was calculated by averaging the intensity of the entire microdroplet, excluding a ~ 1 μm-wide boundary, and the area occupied by the beads (determined by BF intensity threshold).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Natural leaf washes</title><p>We employed two different methods for the extraction and drying of leaf washes.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Method I</title><p>A single ivy and orange leaf were submerged in separate sterile petri dishes filled with 10–15 mL autoclaved diH<sub>2</sub>O.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Wenying Shou as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.

Using artificial surfaces and systematic control of evaporation conditions, they demonstrate that bacterial cells and cell aggregates can retain water in the form of microdroplets invisible to the naked eye. The size of droplets positively correlates with the number of trapped cells as well as the probability of cell survival. Results were relatively consistent across a dozen bacterial species and with natural leaf communities, as well as on two types of surfaces and two values of relative humidity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more explicit comparison between their system and the surface of a natural leaf.</p><p>Reviewer 3 suggested: &quot;leaf surface mimicking comes from creating a transition from saturated (wet, dew at night) to unsaturated (microscopic droplets persisting on dry surface but invisible to the naked eye).

As a result of deliquescence, which is likely relevant to many real-world environments including leaf surfaces, tiny droplets form around bacterial cells on surfaces. The study finds that droplet size increases for bacterial aggregates, and that bacteria thrive within these larger droplets. Overall the quality of the work is very high, and the findings are both intriguing and of general interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers. The Introduction does a great job justifying the approach and relevance of the study. For the most part results were clearly presented and carefully interpreted. This was one of the best papers I have read in recent years, I strongly recommend it for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I do have a few suggestions that will help improve the manuscript prior to publication.</p><p>1) The authors state that &quot;Last, we repeated the beads experiment with pure water instead of M9 medium. This time we did not observe any droplets, indicating that the solutes control droplet formation and retention through deliquescence.&quot; I don't believe a picture of this result was included in the supplementary information. A minor point, but it would be helpful to include a picture, perhaps paired with Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>2) It would be of interest to many readers to know the approximate doubling time of cells within the droplets. Granted the growth rate should depend on the droplet size, so there will likely be multiple growth rates, but an estimate would be appreciated for at least some of the larger droplets with the most growth.</p><p>3) The last paragraph of the subsection “Cell survival rate increases with droplet size” is very confusing. I was unsure of the meaning &quot;inoculated the cells at a later stage&quot;. Cells did not have time to form aggregates? Wouldn't some aggregates form by chance upon adding cells to the plate? Some clarification would be helpful.</p><p>4) A few graphs, including Figure 4B, plot &quot;fraction of population&quot;, which seems to mean &quot;fraction of the population residing above a given droplet size&quot;. Could you clarify the meaning or describe how it was calculated? Is the definition of population the same for Figure 4B and the inset of Figure 4B?</p><p>5) The authors state, &quot;also imply that phyllospheric bacteria have evolved mechanisms to cope with the highly concentrated solutions associated with deliquescent wetness&quot;. This seems rather speculative and also points to one weakness of the paper. How do the concentrations of media components in the deliquescent droplets compare with the starting M9 media? Is the concentration of media components 2X, 5X? Is there a way to estimate to measure these concentrations in a droplet? At what concentration of media would cell growth be affected? It might be an helpful addition to the SI to run an additional experiment to measure growth in different concentrations of M9 (not required but would be helpful).</p><p>6) Testing many bacterial strains is an excellent addition to the paper. It would be helpful to clarify the results with other strains. How was aggregation yes or no determined? What does survival at 24h low, medium, or high indicate? These might not be very precisely defined, but some explanation should be given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I am quite enthusiastic about this work, and I think it is an important contribution to our understanding of the role of microhabitats in bacterial activity in natural environments. It is a field of research that is rapidly developing but that has still a lot to reveal, and which is highly complementary to research focusing on omics. Although the authors' focus is phyllosphere microbiology, as they note the research is also relevant for many other unsaturated habitats, especially soil surfaces. The authors have gathered a lot of data, which they have presented in an effective and statistically sound manner (albeit I tend to think that SD is a better descriptor than SE in such a case, but this is a detail). The fact that they tested multiple species, fluorescent beads, and different surfaces makes a good case for the generalization of the findings. Maybe for future research, the authors might consider testing artificial leaf replica (see Soffe et al., 2019; Doan and Leveau, 2015).</p><p>I have no major concerns about the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The authors use model experiments to show that, when wet surfaces containing bacteria are dried, microdroplets form around bacterial aggregates, which is linked to promoting bacterial survival. The work is intriguing. However, several questions (described below) remain unanswered, and it is unclear whether this is truly an important scientific problem. I certainly would not describe this as fitting the goal of <italic>eLife</italic> &quot;to publish work of the highest scientific standards and importance&quot;. The manuscript may instead be suitable after the following comments are addressed.</p><p>1) The drying experiments are performed using M9 minimal media. The authors show that the observed behavior is sensitive to the presence of solutes (by comparison to DI water drying). This casts doubt on the generalizability of the results. What is the salt content of droplets in natural settings? How do the salts in the medium (which presumably precipitate upon drying, potentially leading to e.g. droplet pinning, changes in bacterial survival, etc.) impact drying, droplet properties, and bacterial survival?</p><p>2) The authors present evidence that aggregates cause pinning and limit droplet evaporation. However, they do not provide any detailed explanation for why. What is the underlying physics? What physical forces limit the droplet evaporation? Simply showing a correlation with aggregate size does not provide any deep insight.</p><p>3) Similarly, the authors show that cell survival increases with droplet size. Why? Is this simply not due to the trivial reason that the cells have more access to more nutrients?</p><p>4) Why do aggregates form in the first place? Was this simply a consequence of incomplete mixing or improper culturing in the experiments? Can the authors control this in a way to more clearly demonstrate the influence of aggregation?</p><p>(Reviewing editor note: you can speculate in the Discussion).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48508.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more explicit comparison between their system and the surface of a natural leaf.</p><p>Reviewer 3 suggested: &quot;leaf surface mimicking comes from creating a transition from saturated (wet, dew at night) to unsaturated (microscopic droplets persisting on dry surface but invisible to the naked eye).

In addition, we provide new results with natural leaf washes that show microdroplet formation around indigenous leaf microbiota. We have also included a new additional figure (new Figure 4).</p><p>“Obviously, there are more differences between natural leaf surfaces and our simplified experimental system. […] All of these factors are likely to affect the formation and retention of microscopic leaf wetness.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better characterize salt concentrations in droplets of different sizes and their effects on bacterial growth and survival (including maybe in natural leaf washes).</p></disp-quote><p>We have invested much effort in attempts to quantify the salt concentrations in the formed microdroplets. First, we note that direct measure of salt concentrations in microdroplets of such a small volume, on a surface, is technically very challenging. To try to overcome this challenge, we tried several approaches.</p><p>Our most successful approach aimed at estimating the ‘concentration factor’, or the ratio of the concentration of solutes in microdroplets to those in the initial solution used in our drying experiments (i.e., the loaded medium with which the drying experiments commenced). To do so, we added a soluble fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 647) to the initial medium and compared the fluorescent intensity of the dye in the formed microdroplets to a calibration curve prepared from the fluorescence of drops with known concentration factors of the original medium. We used confocal microscopy to get good, accurate, fluorescent reads from a thin z-section of the calibration drops and microdroplets formed by our experiments.</p><p>We performed new drying experiments, with 2µm-beads as particles, and used two different mediums: M9 medium with similar composition to the one we used in our reported experiments in the paper, and a modified medium composed of just diH<sub>2</sub>O and NaCl. We found that the solution in droplets is 23.3 ± 3.5 (mean ± SD) times the concentration of the standard M9. That is, the final droplet solution is estimated to be ~50 times more concentrated than the original medium used in our drying experiments (an M9 χ2 dilution). We added a new paragraph summarizing these findings to the Results (“Microdroplets are highly concentrated solutions”, see below).</p><p>The details of the experiments, analyses, and results are provided in Materials and methods, and in Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4. The estimated concentration of the various M9 salts, as well as the estimated osmolarity (osmotic concentrations) that reflects a quantitative measurement of the overall osmolarity of the various salts, is now summarized in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>“Microdroplets are highly concentrated solutions. Direct measurements of the solute concentrations within microdroplets constitute a technical challenge. To overcome that challenge, we added a fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 647) to the initial M9 medium, as a reporter for the solute concentration induced by evaporation. […] This result accords with the observation that cell divisions within droplets was rarely seen in our experiments (at 85% RH).”</p><p>In addition to an M9 medium, we performed the experiment with a diH<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl medium and 2µm-beads. NaCl concentrations in the formed microdroplets were estimated at 650 ± 170 mM NaCl (mean ± SD), reflecting a concentrating factor of ~40 ± 10 (mean ± SD). It was interesting to find that, in the above experiments, differing initial dilutions of M9 and differing initial concentrations of NaCl reached comparable absolute concentrations in the formed microdroplets for each medium respectively. This finding accords with the predicted role of deliquescent substrates in microdroplet formation and retention. Note that (i) the point of deliquescence (POD; that is, the RH above which the salt is in liquid form) of a mixture of salts is complicated to predict and in many cases is lower than the POD of each individual salt (Tang, 1997); (ii) the difference between the surrounding RH (e.g., 85% in our experiment) and the POD of the combined salts, affects the equilibrium point and thus droplet volume and the salt concentrations therein (as can be nicely seen in our new Figure 2—figure supplement 3D-F).</p><p>Next, we tried to test whether there is a correlation between microdroplet size and the solution’s concentrations therein. Here, we could not reach a conclusive result. We saw relatively high variability in these correlations between differing fields of view with respect to micro-waterscape variations (e.g., areas that are wetter / less wet, areas dominated by films, and areas dominated by droplets). We also saw possible differences in the concentration &lt; &gt; area correlations between the two media we tested: the M9 and NaCl mediums. In most cases, the M9 medium showed no correlation at all, while the NaCl medium showed positive correlation. We provide these analyses and all raw data (Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4). However, we believe that this question requires a more thorough studythat exceeds the scope of the present paper.</p><p>Last, we performed growth curve analyses of liquid cultures of the two strains (<italic>P. fluorescens</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>) in two different media: (i) Various concentrations of the original M9 medium, up to the concentration range estimated for the microdroplets. (ii) A regular M9 medium with increasing concentrations of NaCl. We added a new figure to that effect: Figure 3—figure supplement 5, presenting these growth curves. We found that growth is inhibited under the estimated range of M9 concentrations within formed microdroplets (20x, 30x M9).. This accords with our observations that growth (i.e., cell division) is hardly seen in our drying surface experiments, post droplet formation. During the 24 hours since droplet formation and our survival assay, we rarely observed cell division within the droplets (at 85% RH). We did see some growth when we elevated the RH to 95%, yet still very slow growth with a division time of 23 ± 2h (mean ± SD).</p><p>An alternative approach that we have taken, to try to estimate salt concentrations in the microdroplets, was based on using bacterial whole-cell bio-reporters for osmolarity (e.g., of the proU operon). This approach has not been very successful, so far, as it appears that the various bio-reporters (including <italic>Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas putida</italic>, and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>) that we tested reached saturation at lower salt concentrations (at around ~0.5M NaCl) than did those of the solutions within microdroplets. We plan to test a bio-reporter with wider responsive range (look for one, or engineer one in our lab), for example by trying a more halophilic bio-reporter strain with reporting range that may be more suitable to our system (e.g., (Burch et al., 2013). These endeavors are still ongoing and will require further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Explain better the physical (hydrological) processes at play in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the relevant paragraph in the Results and added a paragraph to the Discussion that better explains the physics behind the formation and retention of microdroplets:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To observe the surface’s final drying phase, we used time-lapse imaging, enabling us to capture the receding front of the remaining thin liquid layer and the formation of microdroplets. […] In summary, both particulates and deliquescent solutes are essential for the differential formation and retention of microscopic wetness around cells and aggregates.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“We note that the evaporation dynamics of a drop of a liquid solution – even without bacteria – is a surprisingly rich and complex physical process and a subject of intensive research (De Gennes et al., 2013, Bonn et al., 2009). […] The second is the deliquescent property of solutes that prohibits complete evaporation of the pinned droplets at RH that is higher than the point of deliquescence of the solutes, such that the droplets are in equilibrium with the surrounding humid air.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be helpful to more thoroughly report/explain the results with other species reported in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing that out. We added a more thorough summary of the results of our drying experiments with other bacterial species (see Results/Discussion changes below). In addition, we added more details to Table 1’s caption, clarifying how aggregation levels were defined and how survival levels were determined.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Experiments with 16 additional strains, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from a variety of microbial habitats, yielded qualitatively similar results to those described in the preceding paragraphs (Table 1). Although not all the strains formed aggregates under our experimental conditions, the general picture was same for all strains: Larger droplets were observed around aggregates or surface areas more densely populated by cells (for strains that did not form aggregates), and higher survival was observed in larger droplets.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Interestingly, the ecological origin of the strains (Table 1) did not always predict their survival rates. Some phyllospheric bacteria (mostly plant pathogens) exhibited low survival, soil bacteria exhibited variable survival rates, <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibited a surprising medium survival, and the aquatic strain <italic>P. veronii</italic> exhibited high survival. […] For example, joining existing aggregates of other species can be a beneficial strategy in environments with recurrent drying events (Grinberg et al., 2019, Steinberg et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the sake of completeness, the reviewing editor attaches abbreviated individual reviews to help make your paper stronger.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors state that &quot;Last, we repeated the beads experiment with pure water instead of M9 medium.

During the incubation period (hours), there was a gradual development of aggregates formed by clonal growth of either surface-attached cells or at the liquid-air interface (pellicles). When we inoculated the cells ~2h before the complete (macroscopic) evaporation of the medium, the cells didn’t have enough time to aggregate, at least under our experimental conditions, hence most of the cells remained solitary at the time droplets formed.</p><p>We also clarified this in the text:</p><p>“To further study droplet size’s effect on survival, we repeated the drying experiment, but inoculated the cells into the drying medium only at a later stage – closer to the macroscopic drying stage – so that the cells did not have time to grow and form aggregates, and were thus mostly solitary.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A few graphs, including Figure 4B, plot &quot;fraction of population&quot;, which seems to mean &quot;fraction of the population residing above a given droplet size&quot;.

As can be seen, growth of both strains is significantly affected at M9 medium that is 10x to 20x concentrated, which is 20x to 40x times the half strength M9 we used. Neither strain grew in 20x M9 and above. At 10x, long lag phases were observed for both strains, followed by very slow growth for <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> and a higher growth rate for <italic>P. putida</italic>. The growth curves under increasing NaCl concentrations show that the growth of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> is not significantly affected up to 500mM NaCl. <italic>P. putida</italic> seems to be fine at high conc. of NaCl, though it can be seen that it reaches higher OD at 1,000mM NaCl only after a long lag phase.

These results will be the basis for another study we are working on. We are quite confident regarding the generality of the results regarding the formation of microscopic surface wetness and the role of bacterial aggregates in that process (see also our reply to Essential Revision #2), especially as they are based not only on empirical observations but can also be explained by the underlying physics.</p><p>Regarding the relevance to natural systems, we believe that because deliquescent substances are ubiquitous, and moderate-to-high relative humidities – even transient ones – are very common, microscopic deliquescent-associated surface wetness likely occurs in many microbial habitats – some of them of major importance (like soil and plant leaf and root surfaces). In addition, our new results (see below) indicate that the salt concentrations in the formed microdroplets depend only weakly upon the initial salt concentrations. Thus, it is likely that microdroplet properties that matter for survival – including salt concentrations – are relatively similar across a large range of initial salt concentrations.</p><p>In nature, aerosol accumulation on leaf surface is estimated at up to 50 µg per cm^2, and higher in urban areas (Pöschl, 2005, Burkhardt and Hunsche, 2013). For example, consider a large dewdrop of 100 µLs covering a surface area of ~1 cm^2. Assuming only 1µg salt per cm^2, it reaches ~1% salts, which is approximately the percentage of salts in a standard M9 medium. As we now present in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, we found that even at lower initial concentrations of salts (e.g., diluted M9 x20 eq. to ~10mM total salts), microdroplets formed under our experimental conditions. Thus, we are quite convinced that our results are relevant to microscopic surface wetness on natural leaves.</p><p>Burkhardt and Hunsche estimated that a realistic aerosol particle load of ammonium sulfate of 5 µgs per cm^2, at 92% RH, is predicted to lead to a hypothetical ~0.5µm homogeneous water film thickness on a leaf surface (Burkhardt and Hunsche, 2013). This value is very similar to the mean thickness of the microscopic surface wetness in our experiments, considering that we typically observe that ~20% of the surface is covered by droplets of ~3µms average thickness.</p><p>To further test the relevance of our results to natural leaf surface chemistry, we conducted more experiments with natural leaf washes and natural leaf microbiota. We added to the manuscript new results with natural leaf washes (of orange and ivy plants) wherein we observed formation of stable microdroplets around natural microbiota aggregates and cells (new Figure 4).</p><p>Note that in the experiments that we conducted with M9 at 85% RH, we observed no salt precipitation. As can be clearly seen in Videos 1-3, droplet formation by pinning is tightly linked to particulates in the form of cells or beads. The resulting droplets reached an equilibrium at 85% ambient RH and did not dry out throughout the duration of the experiment. Only when exposed to a much lower RH did the droplets evaporate and the salts precipitated. To clarify this result, we added the following sentences to the relevant section of the Results:</p><p>“We note that under our experimental conditions, the droplets were not formed through the wetting ‘direction’ of a deliquescence process, by which solid salts absorb water until dissolution. […] In summary, both particulates and deliquescent solutes are essential for the differential formation and retention of microscopic wetness around cells and aggregates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors present evidence that aggregates cause pinning and limit droplet evaporation. However, they do not provide any detailed explanation for why. What is the underlying physics? What physical forces limit the droplet evaporation? Simply showing a correlation with aggregate size does not provide any deep insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we extended the relevant Results section (subsection “The underlying mechanisms of droplet formation”) and added a paragraph on the underlying physics to the Discussion (second paragraph), as described in Essential revision #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similarly, the authors show that cell survival increases with droplet size. Why? Is this simply not due to the trivial reason that the cells have more access to more nutrients?</p></disp-quote><p>This is one of the key questions arising from our results. We currently do not know the answer as to why cells in larger droplets have higher survival rates. Further research is required (which we are working on). We do not believe that access to more nutrients is the factor that grants the cells higher survival. Under the experimental conditions that we tested, at 85% RH, once the droplets are formed, cells do not appear to divide at all; they appear to simply survive. We tracked cells for 40h post drying and hardly observed cell division within droplets of area &lt; 10^4 µm<sup>2</sup> for both studied strains. We therefore believe that the observed increased survival in larger droplets is related to salinity, osmotic stress, or other stresses related to water access and/or small-volume effects. pH may also vary between droplets of varying sizes, and may thus impact survival. Such significant pH differences and gradients were shown to exist even within aerosol droplets tens of microns in diameter (Wei et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why do aggregates form in the first place? Was this simply a consequence of incomplete mixing or improper culturing in the experiments? Can the authors control this in a way to more clearly demonstrate the influence of aggregation?</p></disp-quote><p>Aggregation of cells was minimal at the time of adding the cells to the plate (under our experimental conditions). Flocculation was also minimal. Time-lapse imaging of the drying process, prior to macroscopic drying and droplet formation, showed that aggregates of both strains (<italic>P. fluorescens</italic> A506 and <italic>P. putida</italic> KT2440) formed mostly by clonal growth of founder surface-attached cells, and this occurred only after the addition of cells to the plate. We now clarified this in the second paragraph of the Results:</p><p>“At 85% RH, it took about 14 ± 1h for the bulk water to evaporate. During this time, for both studied strains, some of the cells attached to the surface and, over time, grew and formed aggregates. […] We then examined the surface of the wells under the microscope (see Materials and methods).”</p><p>We are also very interested in better understanding of the role of aggregation in bacterial life in microbial habitats that are characterized by microscopic surface wetness and wet-dry cycles. Indeed, we plan to study mutants that affect the cells’ tendency, or ability, to aggregate. We aim to be able to quantitatively estimate the impact of aggregation on the microscopic waterscape and in turn on fitness (e.g., survival).</p></body></sub-article></article>
