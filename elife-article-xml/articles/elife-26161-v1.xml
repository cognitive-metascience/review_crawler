While the mechanical properties of the microenvironment have been shown to contribute to formation of tissue-specific architecture, how transient external force influences this behavior remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that brief transient compression applied to single malignant breast cells in lrECM stimulated them to form acinar-like structures, a phenomenon we term ‘mechanical reversion.’ This is analogous to previously described phenotypic ‘reversion’ using biochemical inhibitors of oncogenic pathways. Compression stimulated nitric oxide production by malignant cells. Inhibition of nitric oxide production blocked mechanical reversion. Compression also restored coherent rotation in malignant cells, a behavior that is essential for acinus formation. We propose that external forces applied to single malignant cells restore cell-lrECM engagement and signaling lost in malignancy, allowing them to reestablish normal-like tissue architecture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>breast epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>malignancy</kwd><kwd>phenotypic reversion</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM101911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ricca</surname><given-names>Benjamin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI-1235569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PS-OC 60467763-112063-E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bissell</surname><given-names>Mina J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a 3D culture model of breast epithelium, application of a short-timescale compression to single malignant cells promotes the long-timescale development of polarized, growth-arrested structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acinar morphogenesis involves integration of both biochemical and biophysical cues, the disruption of which can lead to malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello-DeOcampo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bissell and Hines, 2011</xref>). Acinar formation can be modeled in three dimensions by embedding mammary epithelial cells in laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989</xref>). Under these conditions, primary or non-malignant cells form polarized, growth-arrested acini after 7 to 10 days in culture, whereas breast cancer cells grow continuously to form large disorganized colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petersen et al., 1992</xref>). This developmental process can be influenced by the passive mechanical properties of the culture microenvironment. Normal or non-malignant breast epithelial cells grown on very stiff substrata form phenotypically malignant, non-polarized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>). The importance of the mechanics of the ECM microenvironment can be seen dramatically when cells are switched from stiff pure collagen gels where they cannot produce milk to soft substrata, including lrECM, where milk proteins can be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcaraz et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>However, active mechanical inputs such as mechanical compression can elicit responses distinct from passive mechanical properties. Compression has been shown to serve as an external signal that regulates the structure and behavior of other tissue types. Step compression of whole cartilage tissue increases interleukin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murata et al., 2003</xref>), whereas dynamic compression of bone enhances bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamay and Tschantz, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolff, 1892</xref>). How such active mechanical inputs influence acinar morphogenesis is yet to be explored, and we hypothesized that active compression could alter the growth and development of breast epithelium.</p><p>To explore this hypothesis, we used the HMT3522 progression series developed by Briand and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briand et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briand et al., 1996</xref>). We applied a short-timescale compression to single malignant T4-2 cells and non-malignant S1 cells embedded in lrECM. Our cell culture system provides a model for malignant vs. non-malignant behavior that has been widely used, although it does not encompass the full spectrum of cellular behaviors observed in malignancy in vivo. Following compression, cells were cultured for up to 10 days. Surprisingly, we found that this transient compression can phenotypically revert malignant cells, a phenomenon we term ‘mechanical reversion.’ We also show that this mechanically induced shift in phenotype is mediated by nitric oxide signaling. Our findings suggest that well-timed mechanical stimuli may have some beneficial effect in the inhibition of cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transient compression phenotypically reverts malignant breast epithelial cells</title><p>To directly test the effects of externally applied forces on acinar morphogenesis, we grew epithelial cells in deformable silicone wells to apply defined strains.

Confocal immunofluorescence images were scored in a blinded fashion. Colonies were categorized as having a ‘small, organized’ phenotype (characteristic of normal development or reversion) if they contained at least three of the following four features: (1) a small size, (2) a round shape, (3) the absence of Ki67, and (4) well-organized E-cadherin cell-cell junctions (appearing as a star pattern in cross section) or a cleared lumen. Colonies with one or none of these four features were categorized as ‘large, disorganized’ (characteristic of malignant behavior). The increase in the proportion of colonies with an organized phenotype and the decrease in proportion of a disorganized phenotype in demonstrate that a fraction of the population of malignant T4-2 cells were phenotypically reverted with compression. This difference is statistically significant (*) between the T4-2 uncompressed and compressed (p&lt;0.05, two-sample t-test, N = 3, 3 experiments).

Although T4-2 cells express the proteins in the complex, NO production is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muschler et al., 2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furuta et al., 2018</xref>). In T4-2 cells, the glycosylation of the extracellular domain of dystroglycan is aberrant. We hypothesize that transient compression promotes engagement of laminin and dystroglycan despite aberrant glycosylation. In this way, the cell-ECM receptor dystroglycan itself would serve as a mechanosensor that drives downstream polarity. A conceptually similar mechanism has been observed in C. elegans where hemidesmosomes serve as mechanosensors that promote polarized epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that there are other mechanisms by which compression promotes the development of ‘normal,’ polarized acini from malignant cells. Compressive force could alter secretion and degradation of matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Erler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2012</xref>) or directly induce integrin engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katsumi et al., 2005</xref>). Regulation of cell-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Es et al., 2005</xref>) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>), however, are not likely to be directly affected by compression in our assay because the timing of the compression, timescales of mechanical dissipation, and nitric oxide decay are much shorter than these processes. Long timescale behaviors are indeed altered by transient compression, so a mechanism by which some record of the compression event is stored must exist. One possibility is that NO alters cell-cell or cell-ECM interactions via direct NO-mediated post-translation modifications such as nitrosylation or directly activates or inactivates an intracellular signaling protein outside of the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Marletta, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it has been previously observed that the invasive behavior of a sheet of epithelial cells increases under constant compression perpendicular to the primary plane of the sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tse et al., 2012</xref>), highlighting the importance of considering the direction, timescale, and biological context of a mechanical perturbation when observing a cell or tissue’s response behavior.</p><p>In endothelial cells, nitric oxide production is mechanically activated on millisecond timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gloe and Pohl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gloe et al., 1999</xref>), relaxing actomyosin contraction in nearby smooth muscle cells on sub-second timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lincoln et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palmer et al., 1987</xref>). This response proceeds via nitrosylation of the heme group of soluble guanylate cyclase by an NO radical and is rapidly reversible when NO is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Derbyshire and Marletta, 2012</xref>). Epithelial cells exhibit increased contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saez et al., 2005</xref>) and malignant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>) in stiff microenvironments by activating Rac1 and PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, Rac1 activity is regulated by NO via nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raines et al., 2007</xref>). We speculate that a critical balance between NO signaling and contractility may be necessary for normal acinar development, and that mechanical reversion restores this balance in malignant cells. This speculation grows more intriguing when considering the protective effect of breastfeeding against cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Veral et al., 2002</xref>) and the short timescale contractions of myoepithelial cells that surround the luminal epithelial cells during milk letdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriance et al., 2005</xref>). Could a mechanically activated NO signal from the luminal epithelial cells serve as an ‘off’ signal for contractility of the myoepithelial cells during milk letdown? Could this mechanical activity be contributing to the protective effect of breastfeeding? Future exploration of the broad parameter space of timescales, magnitudes, and geometries for mechanical stimuli are needed to pursue these intriguing questions.</p><p>In summary, we find that a transient compression applied to single malignant cells embedded in a laminin-rich gel can lead to phenotypic reversion of malignant breast cells. Compressed malignant cells show an increase in nitric oxide production relative to uncompressed malignant cells, and blocking NO production also blocks mechanical reversion. Compressed malignant cells undergo coherent rotation at the two-cell stage and require E-cadherin function to achieve mechanical reversion. We propose that the transient forces are sensed through activation of NO signaling in the single cell, allowing activation of p53 and engagement of the normal morphogenetic program. Detailed study of how NO is produced in response to compressive strain and how it feeds into downstream signaling pathways will help uncover how transient mechanical cues can translate into long-term phenotypic change.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cell lines of the HMT3522 breast cancer progression series were provided by O.W.

Wells were made of Sylgaard 184 (Dow Corning) polymerized at a 9.5:1 ratio of base to curing agent. This mixture was poured into custom-made laser-cut acrylic molds and polymerized at 60°C overnight (laser cutter: ULS2.0 Engraver, clear cast acrylic: McMaster-Carr). Silicone wells were cleaned under ultraviolet light for seven minutes, washed in distilled, deionized water for at least four days under gentle vacuum, and then washed with the cell culture media (without additives) at 37°C for another 2 days or more before use.</p><p>Immediately prior to use, wells were stretched using custom-made laser-cut acrylic frames and stainless steel dowel pins (McMaster-Carr). For 3D embedded culture geometry, cells were resuspended in ~100% lrECM and poured into the stretched well (200 μL) and polymerized at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide. After 30 min of polymerization, the stainless steel dowel rods were removed with pliers to apply a step compression to the matrix. Media was added, and the wells were returned to the incubator. Media was changed every other day during growth (or every day for L-NAME treatment experiments). Each compressed gel had a matched uncompressed control gel made with the same cell-matrix mixture and the same silicone well preparation. For 3D-on-top culture geometry, cell-free lrECM (100 μL) was poured into the pre-stretched well and polymerized at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide for 30 min, cells were plated on the lrECM and allowed to attach for 30 min, and then coated with a layer of 5% lrECM in media. The 5% lrECM top layer was left undisturbed for 30 min at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide to allow polymerization of an insoluble layer of lrECM on top of the cells. After 30 min, compression was applied and media added as for the 3D-embedded cultures.</p><p>Applied strain was varied by changing the amount of initial stretch applied to the well before compression by varying the dimensions of the custom acrylic frames.

For initial compression experiments, statistical significance was measured by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test against the null hypothesis that the mean areas are equal. Due to variability in mean colony area measurements from preparation-to-preparation (for uncompressed T4-2 cells, colony area 9200 ± 3200 μm<sup>2</sup>, mean ± SD, 25 gels), we compared mean colony size for compressed gels directly to their matched uncompressed controls when possible, testing against the null hypothesis that the difference between members of each pair is equal to zero. For dose-dependent experiments, statistical significance at each strain dosage was measured by paired t-test between compressed samples and matched controls.

The lower compression platen was pre-heated to 37°C using feedback-controlled thermistors and resistive heating elements (Warner Instruments TC-324B, 64–0106, 64–0274 RH-2). The distance between the upper and lower compression platen was calibrated after pre-heating for 30 min. A droplet of lrECM (100 μL) was placed on the pre-heated lower platen, and the upper platen was immediately brought down to contact the lrECM droplet. Space between the platens was held at 0.4 mm, and the gel was allowed to polymerize for 30 min. This led to formation of a 0.4 mm tall gel with cross-sectional area of 250 mm<sup>2</sup>. Compression was applied at a rate of 0.05 mm/s for deformation of 0.04 mm (10% strain). Strain rates were chosen to approximately mimic strain rates in the stretchable wells (10%–20% s-1). Load was measured for 40 min, by which time a residual load could not be measured. Relaxation time constants were measured by measuring the amount of time to reach five time constants worth of decay from peak stress (99.4% decay). Our measurements showed that the stress generated by the compressive strain relaxes within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), demonstrating the viscoelastic nature of the lrECM gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>) and the transient nature of the applied compression.</p><p>In order to evaluate the strain above which the lrECM strain stiffened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pryse et al., 2003</xref>), storage and loss moduli were measured by taking shear amplitude sweeps on a parallel plate rheometer (Anton Paar MCR302). The testing environment consisted of a quartz lower plate and an 8 mm diameter stainless steel upper plate. Plates were pre-heated to 37°C and humidified using a water jacket-heated environmental chamber. lrECM was polymerized in similar fashion to stress relaxation tests, except that gels were 0.4 mm tall and 200 mm<sup>2</sup>. Storage and loss moduli were measured from 0.01% to 1000% shear strain. This strain regime was chosen to ensure that material breakdown occurred and was measurable. Within this strain regime, we measured an elastic modulus (~200–300 Pa), which compares well with previously reported values for lrECM (~600 Pa) obtained using both a novel, local interferometry technique (µm scale) and bulk rheology measurements, though considerable heterogeneity was found in local measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reed et al., 2009</xref>). Moduli at 0.01% and 21.5% strain were compared using a two-sided t-test to determine if material properties changed in the regime of interest.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transient external force induces phenotypic reversion of malignant epithelial structures via nitric oxide signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this consolidated review to help define the key issues we believe must be addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that a transient application (timescale of 10s seconds) of mechanical compression to single mammary epithelial cells significantly decreases their propensity to display malignant growth phenotypes in organoid cultures (timescale of days), and instead promotes the formation of growth-arrested acini. Compression activates NO signaling, and transient NO signaling is required and sufficient for growth arrest and malignant reversion. These observations are intriguing and potentially of significant interest, however a number of questions remain regarding the underlying mechanisms. The major concerns of the reviewers were: 1) the lack of identity of the upstream input/s (sensor) to the NO pathway that are deficient in T4-2 cells in Matrigel-only, but can be mechanically activated and the 2) lack of insights into the mechanism of transient NO signaling that leads to long-term phenotypic reversion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since S1 cells exhibit transient NO signaling during Matrigel culture initiation, however this is lacking in T4-2 cells, this suggests that either conserved environmental sensors (e.g. cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal structures) are lacking in T4-2 cells, or their activation is below a threshold, which compression is required to reach. Identifying potential mechanosensors would give insight into the mechanism of the compression response. In this regard, the attempts to uncover mechanism (e.g. blocking E-cadherin) are insufficient, and further are unlikely to be specific to compression-induced malignant reversion, since E-cadherin blockade induced malignant behavior in non-malignant cells.</p><p>2) The most intriguing aspect of the work, but also the most lacking in investigation, is how a mechanical signal on the 'seconds' timescale is remembered over the 'days' timescale. miRNAs induced by LM-1 in S1 cells discovered in Furuta et al. should be explored – are these miRNAs induced after compression? If so, what is the kinetics? How long do they act on their target genes?</p><p>3) A number of questions arise from their protocol of force application to cells:a) Why was an axial anisotropic stress chosen for the mechanical stimulus? Does the same phenomena occur in the case of equibiaxial (radially-symmetric) compression? Does tensile stress (isotropic or anisotropic) yield similar results with regard to malignant conversion?</p><p>b) Force is applied in compression to cell constructs, however measurements of material modulus are done in shear. Do the authors have data (or can point to existing literature) to demonstrate that the modulus measured in shear (under equivalent strains applied in the study) is similar to the modulus measured in tension/compression, which is the nature of their experimental setup?</p><p>c) One major puzzle is how the cell response could occur when they are plated &quot;3D-on-top&quot;, on top of solid Matrigel in medium containing only 5% Matrigel – surely under these circumstances the cells would not experience any compression at all. A 5% Matrigel solution is liquid and would not transmit a compressive force. Attachment to the solid layer beneath was only for 30 minutes, unlikely to provide meaningful connections, especially as the cells do not spread. Yet the observed phenotype is the same as for embedded cells. This suggests that perhaps there is another event causing the change, not just compression.</p><p>4) What are potential physiological origins of a step-application (timescale of seconds) of ~15% compressive strain to cells within tissue? Does this exist? A threshold strain is required to induce the phenotype; does this threshold inform potential underlying molecular mechanisms? Is the magnitude and rate of myoepithelial cell contractions during lactation consistent with their experimental model and results? Significantly more detail, either via literature or through vivo characterization, is needed to support a biological significance.</p><p>5) The finding that compression induced coherent rotation in T4-2 cells, similar to S1 cells without compression, is intriguing. What is the kinetics of compression-induced coherent rotation? Does compression directly (mechanically) induce coherent rotation? Does rotation direction and magnitude depend on force orientation, magnitude, rate, etc.?

Identifying potential mechanosensors would give insight into the mechanism of the compression response. In this regard, the attempts to uncover mechanism (e.g. blocking E-cadherin) are insufficient, and further are unlikely to be specific to compression-induced malignant reversion, since E-cadherin blockade induced malignant behavior in non-malignant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the full mechanism has yet to be demonstrated, but a strong hypothesis can be formulated based on our results together with the work of Furuta et al. (co-submitted manuscript). Our results demonstrate that a transient compression induces NO production in tumorigenic T4-2 cells and promotes formation of organized structures with apicobasal polarity, which is otherwise defective in these cells.</p><p>We have revised our manuscript to clearly state the hypothesis that the mechanosensory element in the fascinating behavior of mechanical reversion is the interaction between dystroglycan and laminin, framing the discussion of our findings in the context of the related literature, with the addition of the following paragraph:</p><p>“With a role for NO signaling in ECM-to-nucleus communication, we hypothesize that a cell-ECM receptor is the key mechanosensory element in mechanical reversion. […] A conceptually similar mechanism has been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where hemidesmosomes serve as mechanosensors that promote polarized epithelial morphogenesis (Zhang et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The most intriguing aspect of the work, but also the most lacking in investigation, is how a mechanical signal on the 'seconds' timescale is remembered over the 'days' timescale.</p></disp-quote><p>Our work and the work of others have demonstrated that reversion in this breast epithelium model system is only possible in a narrow time window, during the first ~24–36 hours after cells receive initial extracellular cues (Bissell and Hines 2011; Fournier et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2004; Tanner et al., 2012; Wang et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 1997). Consistent with these results, we did not observe mechanical reversion when transient compression was applied 24 hours after seeding T4-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>This critical window exists because epithelial cell polarity is established (or not established) once cells undergo their first division (Tanner et al., 2012; Ragkousi et al., 2014). Hence, we hypothesize that in our experiments the mechanical signal is ‘remembered’ over days because the mechanical stimulus promotes a response to laminin and subsequent coherent rotation that is essential for organizing the basement membrane that guides development over longer timescales.</p><p>Acinus-forming S1 cells produce NO in response to laminin in the ECM; NO levels spike within an hour of exposure to laminin and decline thereafter (Furuta et al., 2018 co-submitted). Consistent with this early signaling event, our experiments show that inhibition of NO production by a 2-hour pulse treatment with L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) completely abrogates acinus formation by T4-2 cells in response to transient compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, the transient force application acting on a time scale of seconds initiated NO signaling to promote the formation of proper cell-cell junctions; this stimulus was sufficient to irreversibly alter the phenotype of T4-2 cells on time scales of days.</p><p>We have revised the Discussion in our manuscript to highlight how the timing of the initial signal (in our experiments, transient compression stimulating NO production) is critical to the development of epithelial polarity. We also explain more clearly how our findings relate to the earlier work of Tanner et al., 2012 showing the importance of coherent rotation at early time points for long-term acinar development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>miRNAs induced by LM-1 in S1 cells discovered in Furuta et al. should be explored – are these miRNAs induced after compression? If so, what is the kinetics? How long do they act on their target genes?</p></disp-quote><p>Our work and the co-submitted work of Furuta et al. are distinct but complementary studies in that both converge on the role of NO in the morphogenesis of polarized breast epithelium, hence our decision to co-submit them to <italic>eLife</italic>. Our study discovered that phenotypic reversion could result from transient mechanical stimulus. The work of Furuta et al. focused on elucidating biochemical signaling involved in mammary morphogenesis and tumor reversion. Although it would be interesting to test the involvement of the miRNAs identified by Furuta et al. in our system in a future set of experiments, this is beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p>We believe there is great value in publishing the novel finding that mechanical compression can signal through the same pathway – NO – as normal mammary morphogenesis to drive phenotypically normal development. The point of co-submitting this work was to offer a more complete picture of mammary development and tumorigenesis together – biochemical and biophysical – without unnecessary duplication. Future work will address the many points of connection between the studies as we work to map out the complete mechanistic connection between force, signaling, and phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A number of questions arise from their protocol of force application to cells:a) Why was an axial anisotropic stress chosen for the mechanical stimulus? Does the same phenomena occur in the case of equibiaxial (radially-symmetric) compression? Does tensile stress (isotropic or anisotropic) yield similar results with regard to malignant conversion?</p></disp-quote><p>Axial strain application was chosen as a starting point due to the effects previously observed in our strain application chambers on branching morphogenesis in mammary organoids (Brownfield et al., 2013). Whether the same phenomena occurs in the case of alternative geometries of strain application is an interesting question that merits exploration in future work. In our experiments, transient compression is applied at the single-cell stage, and we observed no correlation between the direction of compression and the direction of rotation. Therefore, we hypothesize that radially-symmetric compression of the appropriate magnitude would yield similar results in stimulating NO production and promoting normal growth and polarity development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Force is applied in compression to cell constructs, however measurements of material modulus are done in shear. Do the authors have data (or can point to existing literature) to demonstrate that the modulus measured in shear (under equivalent strains applied in the study) is similar to the modulus measured in tension/compression, which is the nature of their experimental setup?</p></disp-quote><p>Reed et al. reported a median elastic modulus for lrECM of ~600 Pa when measured either locally using a novel interferometry technique or when measured using bulk rheology measurements, though the authors note there is considerable heterogeneity in local measurements (Reed et al., 2009). We have revised our manuscript to cite these findings, which are on the same order as our measurements, in the description of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) One major puzzle is how the cell response could occur when they are plated &quot;3D-on-top&quot;, on top of solid Matrigel in medium containing only 5% Matrigel – surely under these circumstances the cells would not experience any compression at all. A 5% Matrigel solution is liquid and would not transmit a compressive force. Attachment to the solid layer beneath was only for 30 minutes, unlikely to provide meaningful connections, especially as the cells do not spread. Yet the observed phenotype is the same as for embedded cells. This suggests that perhaps there is another event causing the change, not just compression.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion arising from our description in the methods. For the description of 3D-on-top culture, we have revised the manuscript to clarify that cells were plated on the lrECM and allowed to settle for 30 minutes. Then, the growth medium containing 5% lrECM was applied on the top of cells and left for 30 min to allow for the insoluble layer of lrECM to precipitate over cells (per methods described in Lee et al., 2007). The phenotype of epithelial cells in 3D-on-top culture is very similar to that in embedded culture. Moreover, the 3D-on-top culture has the advantage over embedded culture in that it requires only 4–6 days to observe differences in the colony phenotypes whereas embedded culture requires 8–10 days. Therefore, we have utilized both on-top and embedded cultures almost interchangeably.</p><p>We also found that the phenotypic effect of transient compression was similar between the 3D-on-top and embedded culture geometries. As the reviewer suspects, the force would not be transmitted through the layer of 5% lrECM efficiently. On the other hand, 100% lrECM, on which single cells are sitting, would efficiently transmit the compressive force, and we found this was sufficient to alter the phenotype of malignant cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What are potential physiological origins of a step-application (timescale of seconds) of ~15% compressive strain to cells within tissue? Does this exist? A threshold strain is required to induce the phenotype; does this threshold inform potential underlying molecular mechanisms? Is the magnitude and rate of myoepithelial cell contractions during lactation consistent with their experimental model and results? Significantly more detail, either via literature or through vivo characterization, is needed to support a biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Our system was designed to probe acini with a defined mechanical input rather than to mimic a specific physiological behavior or state, allowing us to address the fundamental question of whether direct mechanical compression affects tumor reversion. Further exploration of the physiological role of mechanical reversion will entail designing experiments that more closely mimic the natural environment in which breast epithelium experiences forces within the organism, such as breastfeeding. We certainly do not intend to claim we have discovered a novel mechanism by which breastfeeding protects against cancer. Instead, we simply aimed to point out that our findings point to an intriguing line of inquiry that could connect a well-documented medical phenomenon with our new observations. We have clarified the language in our Discussion to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The finding that compression induced coherent rotation in T4-2 cells, similar to S1 cells without compression, is intriguing. What is the kinetics of compression-induced coherent rotation? Does compression directly (mechanically) induce coherent rotation? Does rotation direction and magnitude depend on force orientation, magnitude, rate, etc.? These parameters should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, and we are interested in exploring the parameter space of force orientation, magnitude, rate, etc. on coherent rotation in future work. As described in Tanner et al.’s work, coherent axial rotation is a hallmark of mammary epithelial cells undergoing acinar morphogenesis in lrECM (Tanner et al., 2012). The paper demonstrated that coherent rotation depends on the cell’s ability to undergo asymmetric cell division and formation of cell-cell junctions during the development of structures with apicobasal polarities from single cells. Despite the consistent occurrence of coherent rotation, the direction and rate of coherent rotation in the whole population is random (Tanner et al., 2012). The phenomenon of coherent rotation is absent in malignant cells. However, when malignant cells undergo phenotypic reversion, where they restore such morphogenetic program, they resume coherent rotation like normal cells (Tanner et al., 2012). This phenomenon appears to be observed under all reverting conditions, including transient compressive force application (our current work), addition of NO, and chemical inhibition of oncogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; Tanner et al., 2012; Furuta et al., 2018 co-submitted). Taken together, these observations suggest that coherent rotation is not caused by the actions of certain reverting agents but rather is the consequence of the restoration of morphogenetic program. For the purposes of this manuscript, we have reported the first observation that compression induces coherent rotation in T4-2 cells and the connection with other methods of reversion, leaving an exploration of the compression parameter space for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One puzzle is how the effect could be maintained through multiple cell divisions. I think that the authors need to ask if it continues after acini are retrieved from the Matrigel (e.g. from the 3D-on-top cultures, trypsinized into single cells, and re-embedded. Would this treatment re-establish &quot;malignancy&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our second answer to comment 2, cellular signaling in response to the transient compression takes place within a brief period of time and quickly attenuates. We hypothesize that once the initial scaffold of proper cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts are established, the colony’s phenotype has been determined. Consistent with previous studies, this must occur within the first ~24 to 36 hours. Proper organization is established at or before the first cell division event and reinforced during coherent rotation. The phenotypic effect is irreversible and sustained throughout multiple cell divisions, leading to formation of polarized acini by malignant T4-2 cells (i.e., ‘malignant reversion’). The reverted and quiescent phenotype of malignant cells is sustained when the intact colonies are re-plated into another Matrigel (unpublished data, Bissell Laboratory.). However, tumor reversion depends on the restoration of basement membrane-hemidesmosome complexes around each colony and proper cell-cell junctions (Weaver et al., 1997). Once the basement membrane and cell junctions are disrupted (e.g., by trypsinization), formerly reverted cells again exhibit malignant phenotype (unpublished data, Bissell Laboratory).</p></body></sub-article></article>
