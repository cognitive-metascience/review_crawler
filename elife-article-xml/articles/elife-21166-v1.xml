Molecular genetic analysis of the switch-like regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair reveals a hierarchy of regulation among multiple inputs—sex, age, nutritional status, and microbial environment—which function in the modulation of behavior.

Little is known about how these sex-specific differences are generated or, for example, how different the nervous system of a male is to that of a female. Moreover, it is also poorly understood how these underlying differences based on the biological sex of an animal are integrated with and influenced by its experiences and environment.</p><p>The roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has two sexes, hermaphrodites and males. The male worms behave differently to the hermaphrodites in a number of situations. This means that these animals offer the opportunity to explore and understand sex-specific differences in behavior. It is also possible to analyze the underlying factors that contribute to behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, because it has a relatively simple and well-defined nervous system.</p><p>Now, Hilbert and Kim show that a signal that influences how <italic>C. elegans</italic> explores in response to chemicals in its environment is expressed differently in male and hermaphrodite worms. The signal in question is molecule called DAF-7, which is released by several sensory neurons—nerve cells that are used for detecting cues from the environment. The sensory neurons that release DAF-7 are found in both sexes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> but the specific way that the male worms express this signal encourages them to search for mates. Hermaphrodites, on the other hand, do not need to search for mates because they can fertilize their own eggs.</p><p>Hilbert and Kim showed that the biological sex in combination with multiple other inputs – including the animal’s past diet and age – regulate how the DAF-7 signal is expressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These inputs all converge onto a single pair of sensory neurons, which integrate the inputs and enable the worm to assess its current and past experiences and alter its behavior accordingly.</p><p>Moving forward the next challenge is to understand how information about both external environment and internal states, such as hunger, are communicated to and integrated by these sensory neurons. Decoding the signals behind this process may illuminate how biological sex and internal states influence behavior in other species of animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21166.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21166.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>daf-7</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Dennis H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A sexually dimorphic transcriptional switch in sensory neurons integrates information about microbial environment and nutritional state to regulate exploratory behavior in <italic>C. elegans.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to effectively adapt to an environment, organisms need to be able to analyze both their internal state and external surroundings to make behavioral decisions that will maximize their chances of survival. It has been hypothesized that decision making in animals is controlled primarily at the level of command interneurons or decision centers in the central nervous system, which receive input from an array of sensory neurons and integrate the information conveyed to inform behavioral decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kristan, 2008</xref>). However, recent work in a number of animal species has demonstrated that modulation of gene expression and neuronal activity by both environmental cues and internal state can occur at the level of sensory neurons, suggesting that aspects of behavioral decision making may also occur in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farhadian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Two pervasive internally derived modifiers of decision making in animals are the nutritional state of the animal and biological sex. Feeding status and satiety levels have long been known to have dramatic effects on the behaviors and decisions of species across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sengupta, 2013</xref>). In many cases, the nutritional state of the animal will serve as a source of regulation directly on feeding and other food-related behaviors. For instance, in the medicinal leech, periods of food deprivation can lead to a heightened response to appetitive stimuli in its environment, a response that has been shown to be carried out via a correlation between serotonin production and time of last meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaudry and Kristan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groome et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lent et al., 1991</xref>). Starvation or nutritional deprivation can also have less direct effects on feeding behaviors as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where periods of starvation have been demonstrated to both enhance odor sensitivity and attraction as well as abrogate avoidance responses to normally aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the biological sex of an animal is a potent modifier of decision-making. Not only does the sex of the animal lead to differences in mating behaviors and pheromone attraction, but studies in several systems have suggested that biological sex can also alter olfactory and gustatory preferences, perhaps to guide decision-making in the context of mating and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Portman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meunier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowers and Logan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The roundworm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and its well-defined nervous system provide a simple experimental system well suited to investigate how internal states and environmental cues can be integrated to modulate animal behavior. <italic>C. elegans</italic> exist as one of two sexes: hermaphrodite or male. Hermaphrodites produce a limited amount of sperm during larval development making them capable of self-fertilization in addition to cross-fertilization. In contrast, males are only cross-fertile and must find mating partners for reproduction. As such, the male displays a large behavioral repertoire primarily aimed at facilitating mate finding and successful mating encounters. These behaviors include complex mating rituals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</xref>), differential sensitivity to hermaphrodite pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srinivasan et al., 2008</xref>), and a mate-searching behavior in adult male animals that is driven by the prioritization of mating over feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>). Mate-searching behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has thus emerged as an interesting case study of decision making in a simple animal, which is subject to regulation by multiple features of internal state—sex, age, and nutritional status—as well as by external sensory experiences such as the presence of food or hermaphrodites in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrios et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus on the DAF-7/TGF-β signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> physiology and behavior including the dauer developmental decision, reproductive egg laying, feeding and foraging, fat storage, satiety quiescence, longevity, aggregation, aerotaxis and avoidance of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White and Jorgensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">You et al., 2008</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>daf-7</italic> was originally identified as being restricted to a single bilaterally symmetric pair of neurons in the head of the worm, the ASI chemosensory neurons, but it is also expressed in the ADE and OLQ neurons under normal laboratory growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schackwitz et al., 1996</xref>). We recently defined an altered expression pattern for <italic>daf-7</italic> in hermaphrodites in response to exposure to bacterial metabolites produced by the pathogenic bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). Within minutes of being exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression is induced in an additional pair of chemosensory neurons, the ASJ neurons, which in turn promotes behavioral avoidance of the pathogenic bacterial lawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that in male <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is not only induced in response to environmental cues such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, but can be switched ‘on’ or ‘off’ depending on multiple internal states such as sex, age, and experience. The differential effects of internal states and environmental experience on the DAF-7 transcriptional switch in the two ASJ sensory neurons reveal a hierarchy among different inputs that can function to modulate behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><bold>Male-specific expression of <italic>daf-7</italic>/TGF-</bold>β <bold>in the ASJ neurons</bold></title><p>While expression of the DAF-7/TGF-β ligand was long thought to be confined to the ASI chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schackwitz et al., 1996</xref>), we recently reported that a change in the microbial environment of the worm—namely, the introduction of the pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa—</italic>can alter the neuronal expression pattern of <italic>daf-7</italic>, inducing expression in the ASJ neuron pair of hermaphrodite animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>).

This predicts that a number of additional unidentified changes may occur in the anatomy, connectivity and gene expression profiles of the male nervous system as the animal transitions from larva to adult. Given this, we asked if <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in males was correlated with the developmental stage of the animal. We observed that in populations of early larval animals carrying the <italic>pdaf-7::gfp</italic> transcriptional reporter, males and hermaphrodites were indistinguishable, with fluorescence observed only in the ASI neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To determine the onset of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in males, we imaged animals carrying the fluorescent reporter at multiple time points during development beginning in the L4 larval stage and extending into reproductive maturity. We found that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression remains off in the ASJ of males through the end of the last (L4) larval stage, but is switched on during young adulthood as the animals reach reproductive maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we examined expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASI neuron pair at several matched timepoints during development and observed a significant drop in the expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASI neurons from L4 to young adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1E and F</xref>, 52 hr and 64.5 hr timepoints). At subsequent timepoints during adulthood, however, expression levels in the ASI neurons remained constant as expression in the ASJ neurons increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1E</xref>,3F 64.5 hr and 71.5 hr timepoints).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic sex of the nervous system modulates <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in adult males</title><p>We asked what the role of the genetic sex of the animal is in regulating <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> sex determination pathway terminates on the master regulator GLI-family transcription factor, TRA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zarkower and Hodgkin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarkower, 2006</xref>). TRA-1 activity functions to promote hermaphrodite cell fates and inhibit male development. We first looked at <italic>tra-1(e1099)</italic> mutants which are karyotypically XX, but develop as fertile pseudomales due to the lack of active TRA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgkin and Brenner, 1977</xref>). In these mutant XX males, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression could be seen in both the ASI and ASJ neurons, suggesting that <italic>daf-7</italic> is regulated by the genetic sex determination pathway either directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We next looked at the role of genetic sex specifically in the nervous system using transgenic sexual mosaics. TRA-1 is negatively regulated by the FEM proteins—FEM-1, FEM-2, and FEM-3—and it has been demonstrated by many groups that overexpression of FEM-3 cDNA is sufficient to lead to ‘masculinization’ in otherwise hermaphrodite animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mehra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 2007</xref>). We expressed the FEM-3 cDNA under the control of the pan-neural promoter, <italic>rab-3,</italic> and found that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression was up-regulated in the ASJ neurons of adult hermaphrodites, suggesting that a genetically ‘male’ nervous system is sufficient for <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C and E</xref>). Although we observed an increase in <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in these genetically masculinized animals, the overall expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ of masculinized hermaphrodites was still notably lower than what we observe in wild-type males (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This could possibly be explained by the lack of male-specific neurons in these transgenic animals. While genetic masculinization is effective in sexualizing neurons of the sex-shared nervous system, this technique fails to reliably retain the male-specific CEM neurons and produces hermaphrodites which also lack other male-specific neurons found in the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 2007</xref>).

While hermaphrodite animals prefer to remain in a patch of bacterial food indefinitely and exhibit limited exploratory behavior, males will wander away from a food source at a predictable and constant rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>). This can be examined in an assay in which the movement of the animal is tracked over time to determine the leaving probability of any given genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>).

We first looked at <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in animals that had experienced starvation during the L4-to-adulthood period before being returned to an <italic>E. coli</italic> food source as adults. In these animals, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression could be detected both by the GFP reporter as well as by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, condition iii, and 4B). We asked whether fully mature adult animals would turn off <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in response to starvation after having already induced expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ neuron pair. For these experiments, we utilized FISH of the endogenous <italic>daf-7</italic> mRNA because perdurance of the GFP reporter might complicate analysis. When males were allowed to develop into adulthood unperturbed and then subjected to a period of food deprivation, we observed a complete loss of <italic>daf-7</italic> mRNA in the ASJ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, condition iv). Together this data demonstrates that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons is subject to dynamic regulation by periods of starvation and re-feeding.</p><p>These data suggest two distinct possibilities for how bacterial food levels in the environment modulate <italic>daf-7</italic> transcriptional regulation in the ASJ neuron pair of males. First, <italic>daf-7</italic> transcription could be regulated by the internal nutritional state of the animal (starved or fed). Alternatively, <italic>daf-7</italic> transcription could be activated by the chemosensation (smell or taste) of bacterial food. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the kinetics of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in response to re-feeding in starved animals. We observed that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is not significantly increased compared to starved controls until 9 hr after the re-introduction of an <italic>E. coli</italic> food source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although some animals could be observed expressing <italic>daf-7</italic> weakly in the ASJ neuron pair at 4 hr of re-feeding, the majority of animals still exhibited no <italic>pdaf-7::gfp</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair until later time points. The extended period of time required to restore <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair suggests that internal nutritional state, not the chemosensation of bacterial food, exerts control over <italic>daf-7</italic> transcription in the ASJ neuron pair. Moreover, we observed that the onset of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons of males following the re-introduction of food are consistent with the previously noted kinetics of resumption of mate-searching behavior after males have been starved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differential regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons establishes a hierarchy of behaviors in male <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We recently showed that the microbial environment is an important regulator of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons in hermaphrodite animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). Given that males induce expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the same ASJ neuron pair independently of the bacterial food source, we sought to determine if they would be capable of responding to exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the same way as their hermaphrodite siblings—namely, through additional up-regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons. We observe that, when transferred to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, males carrying the <italic>pdaf-7::gfp</italic> transcriptional reporter exhibited an increase in <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons compared to <italic>E. coli</italic>-fed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We tested this by challenging starved animals with <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to see how <italic>daf-7</italic> expression would be affected and to observe any behavioral differences. Looking at animals carrying the <italic>pdaf-7::gfp</italic> reporter during post-starvation re-feeding, we observed a rapid up-regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons of starved males returned to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as a food source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Normally, following a period of starvation, a male prefers feeding over leaving a lawn of bacteria in search of a mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>), but we reasoned that these priorities might be re-set if the only available food is pathogenic to the starved animal. Indeed, whereas starved males will remain on the <italic>E. coli</italic> lawn for several hours, starved males who are instead returned to a lawn of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> will readily leave the bacterial lawn at a rate similar to non-starved animals on the normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). This lawn-leaving behavior is not male-specific, as both fed and starved hermaphrodites will also readily leave a lawn of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and starved hermaphrodites are also capable of responding to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> through an upregulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–1D</xref>). In this regard, one might consider that lawn-leaving under these conditions is driven by the presence of pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and not mate-searching. Our data suggest that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons is one way through which animals are both able to interpret internal and external cues and prioritize their behaviors accordingly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have presented a set of experiments that suggest that behavioral prioritization and decision-making may be effected through the transcriptional control of a key neuroendocrine regulator, the TGF-β ligand, DAF-7, in a pair of chemosensory neurons, the ASJ neurons. Our data suggest that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair is utilized to promote exploratory behaviors in different physiological and ecological contexts. In hermaphrodites, expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> is induced by the detection of secondary metabolites and functions to allow animals to discriminate between microbial species and promote avoidance of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). In essence, pathogen avoidance represents the behavioral choice an animal makes when confronted with two competing needs—the need to eat and remain well fed and the need to avoid danger and infection. Mate searching presents a paralagous but sex-specific behavior, where the decision instead is between food and mating. Our data suggest that modulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression provides a striking example of how a neuroendocrine signaling pathway may be coopted to guide behavioral decisions in entirely different contexts.</p><p>Our study suggests that internal states and environmental cues that converge on the transcriptional control of DAF-7 in the ASJ neuron pair are processed in a hierarchical manner that, in turn, serves to modulate the exploratory mate-searching behavior in the male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The work presented here suggests that the transcriptional regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ neurons functions as an ON/OFF switch, where each input holds the switch—and thus, <italic>daf-7</italic> expression—in one of two states. However, the various regulatory inputs into this switch exert differential control, with environmental cues being prioritized over all others. This differential control of the transcriptional switch, in turn allows for re-adjustments of behavioral priorities in the worm based on its current and past experience.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21166.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A hierarchy of inputs regulates <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons to modulate exploratory behaviors.</title><p>We show that the information from many different sources both internal and external is integrated hierarchically in the regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron pair. This hierarchical regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> in turn leads to a distinct prioritization of exploratory behaviors in the male worm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21166.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21166.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21166-fig6-v1"/></fig></p><p>Interestingly, dynamic transcriptional regulation has previously been implicated in the regulation of sex-specific decision-making behavior in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Expression of the chemoreceptor, ODR-10, in the sex-shared sensory AWA neurons has also been shown to be dependent on both internal and external cues to regulate food-related decision making in male <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>). Given the similarities in the regulation of these two genes by both sex and satiety, it is possible that DAF-7 and ODR-10 function in a single pathway to regulate decision-making behaviors in the male. Previous studies of <italic>daf-7</italic> have suggested that it is involved in regulating the expression of numerous chemoreceptors in many different neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nolan et al., 2002</xref>). While no interaction has been identified between <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>odr-10</italic> in the hermaphrodite nervous system, there has been no examination as yet of the effects of <italic>daf-7</italic> mutation on <italic>odr-10</italic> in the relevant cell types, sex, or under different food conditions, which may be an interesting line of future research.</p><p>DAF-7/TGF-β has previously been found to be involved in the regulation of other satiety-regulated behaviors such as quiescence and foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">You et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants show marked defects in the ability to respond to fasting through an increase in quiescence, suggesting that DAF-7 may serve as a critical signal of food availability in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">You et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, DAF-7 signaling has also been implicated in promoting food-leaving (or foraging) in the context of a rapidly depleting food source, further underscoring the importance of this pathway for communicating nutritional availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milward et al., 2011</xref>). While DAF-7 from the ASI neurons, and not the ASJ neurons, contributes to these other possibly related phenotypes, similar mechanisms may be involved in regulating <italic>daf-7</italic> expression and release in these three distinct food/satiety-dependent assay contexts. Taken together with our data, the important role of <italic>daf-7</italic> in these different behavioral paradigms suggests that the <italic>daf-7</italic> pathway may act as a more global food signal that is critical for allowing the animal to sense food and satiety and modulate its behaviors accordingly.</p><p>Finally, our results support a model where integration of internal and external sensory information can occur at the level of the sensory neuron itself to regulate behavioral prioritization. Our data on the role of the ASJ sensory neurons in male mate-searching behavior are consistent with emerging evidence from studies in several species to suggest that the regulatory control of sensory neurons contributes to information processing and decision making behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peckol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were grown on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 as a food source as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Briefly, animals were placed individually onto a 1 cm lawn (~20 µL of culture) of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 in the center of a 10 cm plate. Movement of each animal was tracked at hourly time points. When an animal’s tracks extended a distance of 3 cm away from the starting lawn, the animal was scored as a ‘leaver’. It has been previously demonstrated that male leaving behavior can be modeled by the single exponential decay function N(t)/N(0)=exp(-λt), where N(t) refers to the number of non-leavers at a given time and the hazard value (λ) gives an estimate for the probability of leaving, which remains constant over the course of an assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipton et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Oliver Hobert, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Arantza Barrios (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers appreciated the overall importance of this work. Dynamic regulation of sensory neuron functions by external conditions and internal state is now appreciated as a major mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity. The ability to monitor the expression of single genes with defined functions in individual identified neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, together with the ability to precisely manipulate external and internal conditions, has made this organism an excellent choice for exploring sensory neuron contributions to behavioral changes.</p><p>In this paper, the authors have followed up on their previous finding that the spatial expression pattern of the <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-β ligand is dynamically regulated by perception of specific bacterial metabolites. You demonstrate that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ sensory neurons is also regulated by genetic sex, and that this sexually dimorphic expression contributes to male mate-searching behavior. Further regulation of expression by nutritional state allows reprioritization of feeding over mate-searching, a behavioral change previously reported by others. Overall, the experiments are nicely done, and the observation is novel. However, a number of concerns need to be addressed before this manuscript becomes acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>– One major concern is that this work is not well integrated with previously reported related work (Young-Jai You, Birgitte Olofsson) that implicated DAF-7 in regulating foraging behaviors in response to satiety state. Such integration would provide a more nuanced view that would make this work appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Several experiments are possible to integrate previous results on the roles of DAF-7 and ODR-10 in exploratory vs feeding behaviors. We suggest some specific ones here although other approaches may also be appropriate: (a) Compare time course of changes in <italic>daf-7</italic> vs <italic>odr-10</italic> expression upon starvation; (b) test if the changes in <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>odr-10</italic> are interdependent or independent of each other (i.e. analyze reporters in respective mutant backgrounds); (c) test if NPR-5 is involved in regulation of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASJ in males as a function of satiety; (d) Do males raised on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also exhibit increased food leaving?</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, starved males are shown to leave a lawn of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at a higher rate than <italic>E. coli</italic>, and this is interpreted as mate-searching behavior. However, the leaving assay does not discriminate mate-searching behavior from what could be pathogen avoidance in this context. Either this assay needs to be performed on hermaphrodites to distinguish it as a male-specific behavior, or an additional assay (i.e. retention assay, as in Barrios et al. 2008) performed to distinguish between these two possibilities.</p><p>– Exploratory behaviors rely on the ability of worms to locomote properly. The authors need to show that ASJ-ablated and <italic>daf-7</italic> mutant males have no general defects in locomotion before they can conclude that these manipulations specifically affect the decision to explore within or away from the patch of food. One way by which this could be addressed is by measuring and comparing the rate at which wild-type and experimental males reach the scoring distance in a leaving-assay plate when the area is completely covered with food (as in Barrios et al. 2012, Nat. Neurosc. for example).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21166.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>– One major concern is that this work is not well integrated with previously reported related work (Young-Jai You, Birgitte Olofsson) that implicated DAF-7 in regulating foraging behaviors in response to satiety state.

In addition, we have investigated how genes previously implicated by the work of You and Olofsson in satiety-influenced behaviors affect the expression of DAF-7 in the ASJ neurons of males that promotes mate-searching behavior. Our studies in the development of the revised manuscript suggest that there is not a straightforward correlation that can be applied in the genetic analysis of the three distinct DAF-7-involved behavioral phenotypes of quiescence, foraging, and male mate-searching behavior.</p><p><italic>Several experiments are possible to integrate previous results on the roles of DAF-7 and ODR-10 in exploratory vs feeding behaviors.

Because the reported changes in <italic>odr-10</italic> expression show a variable qualitative increase during starvation compared with the switch-like behavior of changes in <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neuron, we anticipate that DAF-7 may function upstream of the regulation of <italic>odr-10</italic> expression. We provide further discussion of possible connections between DAF-7 and the prior work of Ryan et al. on ODR-10 in the Discussion of our revised manuscript.</p><p>We tested whether <italic>npr-5</italic> mutants exhibited altered expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ neurons of males but did not observe any appreciable change under fed or starved conditions.</p><p>The reviewers suggest an experiment involving raising males on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but unfortunately, the pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> precludes such an analysis, as male and hermaphrodite animals raised in such a manner are sick and dying.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, starved males are shown to leave a lawn of P. aeruginosa at a higher rate than E. coli, and this is interpreted as mate-searching behavior. However, the leaving assay does not discriminate mate-searching behavior from what could be pathogen avoidance in this context.

Given our observation that starvation could abrogate the expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons in males that would promote mate-searching under fed conditions, we sought to test whether starvation could also override our previously described induction of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons in animals exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. We observe that males that have been starved maintain expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in the ASJ neuron pair on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and correspondingly exhibit food-leaving behavior—indeed, as the reviewer suggests, we interpret this as primarily driven by pathogen avoidance. We provide several additional panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>), which show that this <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> leaving behavior is executed by both males and hermaphrodites, fed and starved. Additionally, we did perform a retention assay, and saw that while hermaphrodites suppressed the leaving behavior of starved males on <italic>E. coli</italic>, their presence was not sufficient to suppress <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> leaving behaviors. We have provided further clarification and discussion in the text to clarify the rationale and interpretation of this important experiment.</p><p><italic>– Exploratory behaviors rely on the ability of worms to locomote properly.
