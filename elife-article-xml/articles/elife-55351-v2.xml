of actin filaments termed lamellipodia and microspikes or filopodia, respectively, as well as focal adhesions, all of which recruit Ena/VASP family members hitherto thought to antagonize efficient cell motility. However, we find these proteins to act as positive regulators of migration in different murine cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of Ena/VASP proteins reduced lamellipodial actin assembly and perturbed lamellipodial architecture, as evidenced by changed network geometry as well as reduction of filament length and number that was accompanied by abnormal Arp2/3 complex and heterodimeric capping protein accumulation. Loss of Ena/VASP function also abolished the formation of microspikes normally embedded in lamellipodia, but not of filopodia capable of emanating without lamellipodia. Ena/VASP-deficiency also impaired integrin-mediated adhesion accompanied by reduced traction forces exerted through these structures. Our data thus uncover novel Ena/VASP functions of these actin polymerases that are fully consistent with their promotion of cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>Ena/VASP proteins</kwd><kwd>lamellipodia</kwd><kwd>microspikes</kwd><kwd>filopodia</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA 330/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faix</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AAA 741773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchoin</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoG 724373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO2414/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rottner</surname><given-names>Klemens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004871</institution-id><institution>Technische Universität Braunschweig</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2223/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rottner</surname><given-names>Klemens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sixt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ena/VASP proteins act as positive regulators of cell motility and are required for the formation of microspikes, as opposed to filopodia that can arise from distinct molecular mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adhesion and migration are invariably driven by continuous and dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>). The major protrusive structure of migrating cells on flat and rigid substrata is the sheet-like lamellipodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Letort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rottner et al., 2017</xref>). The extension of dense and branched actin filaments in the lamellipodium drives its growth and pushes the membrane forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koestler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vinzenz et al., 2012</xref>). Branching by Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex is activated by the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) downstream of Rac subfamily GTPase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ismail et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molinie and Gautreau, 2018</xref>). Consistently, knockdown or knockout of essential Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suraneni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) or WRC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Innocenti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steffen et al., 2004</xref>) or Rac GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steffen et al., 2013</xref>) all abrogated lamellipodium formation. The lateral flow of actin filaments and bundles embedded in the lamellipodium, called microspikes, is driven by actin assembly at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oldenbourg et al., 2000</xref>). When microspikes transform and protrude beyond the lamellipodium edge, they are called filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Small, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, in spite of both being built of parallel actin filament bundles and sharing constituents, filopodia and microspikes display important differences. As opposed to microspikes as integral parts of lamellipodial networks, filopodia can kink and bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nemethova et al., 2008</xref>), arising independently and even in excess in the absence of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koestler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Steffen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, filopodia can form around the entire cell periphery and at the dorsal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Block et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pellegrin and Mellor, 2005</xref>). Moreover, rates of actin polymerization in microspikes and lamellipodia are indistinguishable from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oldenbourg et al., 2000</xref>), whereas those in filopodia appear to be regulated independently.</p><p>Filament elongation is driven by formins and Ena/VASP proteins. Formins are dimeric multi domain proteins that remain tightly associated with growing filament barbed ends while accelerating their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kovar et al., 2006</xref>). Several formins such as mDia2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Block et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) and the formin-like family members 2 (FMNL2) and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Block et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Young et al., 2018</xref>) localize at lamellipodia and filopodia tips, and have been implicated in driving these protrusions and cell migration.</p><p>Ena/VASP family proteins localize to sites of active actin assembly including focal adhesions (FA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gertler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reinhard et al., 1995</xref>), stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gateva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rottner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tojkander et al., 2015</xref>), and lamellipodial or filopodial tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>). Vertebrates harbor Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), mammalian Protein Enabled Homolog (Mena), and Ena-VASP-like protein (Evl). All family members are tetramers encompassing domains allowing for interactions with FPPPP-containing proteins, actin monomers, profilin-actin complexes and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bear and Gertler, 2009</xref>). Single Ena/VASP tetramers are poorly processive actin polymerases, but processivity and resistance against heterodimeric capping protein that stops barbed end growth, increases markedly upon oligomerization or clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breitsprecher et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brühmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with their accumulation at filopodia tips, genetic removal of all three Ena/VASP proteins was previously shown to abrogate filopodia formation in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwiatkowski et al., 2007</xref>). The functions of Ena/VASP proteins in cell motility have remained more controversial. Elimination of the single family member VASP in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells diminishes random motility and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Litschko et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting a stimulatory role VASP on cells migration. Consistently, VASP accumulation at lamellipodia tips was shown to positively correlate with protrusion rates in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>) and fish keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacayo et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, genetic inactivation of VASP and Mena or mitochondrial Ena/VASP sequestration in fibroblasts was reported to increase cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bear et al., 2000</xref>). This phenotype was explained by lamellipodia protruding more persistently after interference with Ena/VASP function, and containing shorter and more branched filaments. Excess of Ena/VASP, in contrast, generated lamellipodia with longer, less branched filaments, prone to lifting rearwards during membrane ruffling, therefore driving migration less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 2002</xref>). However, a similar approach yielded opposite results on the migratory behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> haemocytes with slower migration upon Ena sequestration and faster migration rates upon Ena overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tucker et al., 2011</xref>). The latter observations again resemble the increased motility described for breast cancer cells overexpressing Mena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Philippar et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, we are in need of a more generalizable view on Ena/VASP function in cell migration. Despite described controversies concerning motility, the proposed positive regulatory function of Ena/VASP on lamellipodial filaments was consistent with their clear relevance in the movement through the host cell cytosol of <italic>Listeria</italic> harboring the Ena/VASP ligand ActA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geese et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Skoble et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Finally, although Ena/VASP proteins are prominent FA components, their roles in cell substrate adhesion and FA formation have also remained controversial. Both inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galler et al., 2006</xref>) and stimulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Puleo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Young and Higgs, 2018</xref>) on adhesion were reported, whereas one study did not detect any effect in fibroblasts lacking Mena and VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bear et al., 2000</xref>). To shed more light on these questions and ease interpretation of all these conflicting observations, we generated somatic gene disruptions of individual, two or all three Ena/VASP family members in distinct, mesenchymal cell types, and explored the impact of individual and collective Ena/VASP member removal on formation of different protrusion types, efficiency of 2D and 3D migration and adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Ena/VASP impairs adhesive, 2D cell migration in B16-F1 cells</title><p>To evaluate the function of Ena/VASP proteins in cell migration in a comparably fast mesenchymal cell type, we sequentially inactivated the three Ena/VASP paralogues Evl, VASP and Mena using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Respective protein loss in independent clonal cell lines was confirmed by immunoblotting and verified by sequencing of genomic target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Migration rates of B16-F1 wild-type and two independent lines of each genotype were then analyzed on laminin by phase-contrast, time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, consecutive Ena/VASP member removal caused an increasing phenotype in 2D migration rate, ranging from a modest reduction of 1.25 ± 0.37 µm/min and 1.19 ± 0.47 µm/min for single Evl KO mutants (E-KO) as compared to control (1.44 ± 0.4 µm/min), to 0.62 ± 0.25 µm/min and 0.57 ± 0.27 µm/min in Evl and VASP double-KOs (EV-KO), and 0.47 ± 0.19 µm/min and 0.43 ± 0.22 µm/min in triple-KOs (EVM-KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). This was accompanied by a gradual increase in directionality culminating in EVM-KO cells that were 46% more directional as compared to wild-type B16-F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the turning angles revealed an incrementally increased frequency at 0° from 10.2% in wild-type to 12.3% in single KO, 16.1% in double KO and 16.9% in triple KO cells, in support of the higher directionality in mutant cells that coincided with their reduced motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since independently generated Ena/VASP mutant cell lines behaved highly similar in distinct assays, data derived from one triple-KO clone (#23.7.66) are shown below. To ensure that observed phenotypes were Ena/VASP-specific, the same parameters were analyzed in reconstituted EVM-KO mutant cells ectopically expressing EGFP-tagged VASP, Evl or Mena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Re-expression of VASP, which was found to contribute most efficiently to motility, largely rescued cell speed, directionality and frequency of turning angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The rescue experiments with EGFP-tagged Evl or Mena yielded similar results, but these proteins were slightly less effective in restoring cell speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Finally, we calculated the mean square displacement (MSD) in wild-type and the entire collection of mutant cells to assess their effective directional movement. Despite their higher directionality, presumably owing to their considerably slower motility, all Ena/VASP mutant cells displayed incrementally decreasing and lower MSD values as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Notably, in EVM-KO cells rescued with EGFP-tagged VASP, Evl or Mena, the MSD values were again markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Since Ena/VASP proteins have previously also been implicated in cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Philippar et al., 2008</xref>), we additionally analyzed migration performance of confined EVM-KO and B16-F1 control cells in 3D Matrigel invasion assays. Surprisingly, however, at least with the assay conditions employed, we did not find any significant differences in invasion rates between these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Future work will have to clarify how this result compares to migration in additional 3D settings, such as through extracellular matrices with variable geometries or pore sizes. However, although the mechanistic details of this result remain to be established, it suggests, at least, that the robust, Ena/VASP-driven promotion of actin-based protrusion is less important for migration in confinement, which particularly relies on actomyosin contractility, as previously reported for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poincloux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramalingam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Ena/VASP-proteins impairs 2D cell migration in B16-F1 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To obtain independent triple-knockout mutant cell lines, the two independent Evl single knockout mutants (E-KO #23 and #27) derived from B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells, were separately used to the generate independent Evl/VASP double mutants (E/V-KO #23.7 and #27.9) followed by generation of two individual triple-KO mutants additionally lacking Mena (E/V/M-KO #23.7.66 and #27.9.12).

This cell line was described previously to derive from Mena/VASP-deficient mice and selected to lack detectable Evl expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bear et al., 2000</xref>) or concluded to contain at best trace amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbuch et al., 2003</xref>). We did confirm the absence of Mena and VASP in these cells by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, however, our newly generated antibodies raised against and affinity-purified with Evl (see Materials and methods) now identified the protein at low, but clearly detectable levels in this cell line. Thus, to obtain fibroblasts devoid of all three Ena/VASP proteins, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to eliminate Evl in MV<sup>D7</sup> cells, with Evl disruption confirmed by immunoblotting and sequencing as described for B16-F1 cells above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Since distinct triple-KO cell lines behaved again in a highly comparable fashion, only data from clone #31 referred to as MVE-KO are shown.

Remarkably, in spite of their higher cell speed, MV<sup>D7</sup> exhibited even lower MSD values than MVE-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), apparently caused by the lower directionality of the former, and as evidenced by their trajectories in radar plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Migration rates of NIH 3T3 wild-type and two independent lines of each genotype were then again analyzed on fibronectin by phase-contrast time-lapse imaging. Comparable to the findings in B16-F1 cells, consecutive removal of Mena and VASP in NIH 3T3 cells also caused a stepwise increase in migration phenotype, ranging from a rather modest average reduction of about 10.6% for single Mena KO mutants (M-KO) to 31.6% in Mena and VASP double-KO (MV-KO) mutants as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Consistently, these Ena/VASP mutant cells also exhibited incrementally decreasing and lower MSD values as compared to NIH 3T3 wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). All these findings combined, strongly suggest, quite strikingly, that Ena/VASP proteins execute conserved and prominent, positive regulatory functions in adhesive, 2D cell migration, in a fashion irrespective of cell type (melanoma cells and fibroblast alike) and thus type of mesenchymal migration and/or signaling condition, as induced by extracellular matrices (laminin <italic>versus</italic> fibronectin).</p><p>To relate the specific contributions of individual Ena/VASP family members to cell migration, we finally determined the cellular concentrations of expressed orthologues in B16-F1, NIH 3T3 and MV<sup>D7</sup> cells. For this, we titrated defined amounts of recombinant proteins with total cell lysates from a given number of cells in immunoblots, and calculated resulting absolute levels of each protein in the different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Interestingly, in spite of considerably higher expression of Mena in B16-F1 and NIH 3T3 cells as compared to VASP, and in particular relative to Evl, loss of Mena affected migration much less strongly than, for instance, removal of VASP. This suggests a certain differentiation of Ena/VASP family member function despite clearly overlapping functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of Ena/VASP reduces lamellipodium width and abrogates microspike formation</title><p>Since 2D migration on flat surfaces is mainly driven by actin assembly in the lamellipodium, we then analyzed actin filament (F-actin) distribution in B16-F1 and EVM-KO cells after phalloidin staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Quantification of F-actin contents in lamellipodia revealed about 45% reduction in the triple mutant, and the average width of lamellipodia was diminished by about 65% to 0.8 ± 0.2 µm when compared to wild-type with 2.3 ± 0.7 µm. In mutant cells reconstituted with EGFP-VASP, F-actin intensity increased even 40% above wild-type levels, and lamellipodium width was readily restored to 2.7 ± 0.8 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>).

Analyses of phalloidin-stained cells revealed that albeit reduced in formation frequency per cell, filopodia formation was still possible in EVM-KO cells (66% compared to B16-F1 control on low laminin).

Lamellipodial actin network translocation was also reduced by about 22% in EVM-KO as compared to B16-F1 controls, suggesting that the effects on protrusion described above can be explained, at least in part, by reduced actin network polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loss of Ena/VASP deteriorates lamellipodium architecture</title><p>To gain quantitative insights into the ultrastructural details of lamellipodial architecture at the single filament level, we employed three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy of negatively stained B16-F1 wild-type and EVM-KO samples, allowing computer-assisted tracing of single filaments in 3D space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with actin assembly in lamellipodia tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2008</xref>), filaments are oriented with their barbed ends facing the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narita et al., 2012</xref>). In analogy to recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>), barbed ends were scored in digitalized tomograms as the ends of filaments proximal to the leading edge and pointed ends as those distal to the leading edge. Barbed ends either represent actively growing or capped filaments, whereas pointed ends designate Arp2/3 complex-generated branch sites, severed or debranched filaments. In contrast to lamellipodia of wild-type cells, EVM-deficient lamellipodia contained much sparser and less organized filament networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>), which is consistent with the F-actin stainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>. Consistently, assessment of actin filaments in the front region (within a ~ 1 µm broad zone behind the edge) revealed considerably shorter filaments in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Moreover, toward the interior of the lamellipodium, filament density in the EVM-mutant decreased noticeably faster as compared to control, while at the edge, barbed ends occurred in excess in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

Finally, although both control and mutant lamellipodia exhibited a wide array of filament angles abutting the protruding front, with a clear maximum around 90° relative to the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), the distribution of filament angles in EVM-deficient lamellipodia was distinct, with the 90° peak being clearly less prominent (17% lower than in control). Conversely, filament fractions with diagonal angles were about doubled compared to controls. These data suggest that reduced filament mass and disordered filament network geometry in the mutant are causative for reduced protrusion and network assembly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Electron tomography of ultrastructural changes in lamellipodial actin networks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron micrographs of representative wild-type (B16–F1) and EVM-KO cells showing distinct actin filament networks at the leading edge (left), and 2D projections of digital 3D tomograms showing either actin filament trajectories in green (middle), or barbed ends on grey filaments in red, and pointed ends in blue (right).

To explore the more dominant role of Evl as for instance compared to VASP in adhesion in further detail, we performed FRAP experiments in EVM-KO cells of either EGFP-tagged Evl or VASP in focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref>). Notably, Evl showed a moderate, but statistically significant increase in the amount of immobile fraction in focal adhesions as compared to VASP, potentially explaining its more robust accumulation in these structures as compared to EGFP-tagged VASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref>).

Together, despite clearly overlapping functions of Ena/VASP proteins in various actin-dependent processes, Evl appeared more critical in the regulation of cell-substrate adhesions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inactivation of Evl in MV<sup>D7</sup> cells impairs FA formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spreading of MV<sup>D7</sup>, EVM-KO and reconstituted cells on fibronectin.

This finding is not entirely surprising, given that Ena/VASP proteins localize to the leading edge and act as potent actin polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breitsprecher et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brühmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>), which are expected to generate actin polymer that drives motility by pushing against the membrane. Thus, despite increased directionality, the reduced net cell translocation rates observed in EVM-KOs as compared to wild-type occur because of reduced lamellipodial actin assembly and protrusion rates. Diminished migration was also observed in MV<sup>D7</sup> fibroblasts after genetic removal of Evl as well as in NIH 3T3 fibroblast after consecutive disruption of Mena and VASP, supporting the view that Ena/VASP operate in a mechanistically conserved fashion at least in adhesive, 2D migration, reconciling previous controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbuch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geese et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacayo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In line with markedly diminished 2D migration, EVM-KO cells display aberrant, narrow lamellipodia with reduced F-actin densities, shorter filaments and perturbed network geometry. But what are the precise consequences of loss of Ena/VASP activity in those lamellipodia still formed in their absence? Interestingly, lamellipodial accumulation of Arp2/3 complex, CP and cortactin is markedly enhanced upon Ena/VASP removal, but how can these changes be explained? During filament elongation, Ena/VASP proteins are thought to compete with CP for growing filament barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breitsprecher et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>). One possibility therefore is that the absence of Ena/VASP may allow for an increased fraction of CP localizing to filament barbed ends in the lamellipodium tip. This effect might even be enhanced by the increase of barbed ends deduced from electron tomography data. An increased amount of CP might then be sufficient to increase the activity of Arp2/3 complex, as CP has also been reported to operate as co-factor of Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>). In line with this view, overexpression of VASP in B16-F1 cells was previously found to increase F-actin, but decrease Arp2/3 complex intensities in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimchev et al., 2017</xref>). However, the latter finding could also speak for an alternative explanation of our observations: In fact, VASP-mediated suppression of Arp2/3 complex incorporation into lamellipodial networks would also be consistent with the previously observed increase of branch spacing of filaments in Arp2/3-dependent actin tails, as effected by Ena/VASP family members in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pernier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Samarin et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, upon loss of Ena/VASP, filaments may not only become shorter, but Arp2/3 complex intensities simply increase due to enhanced branching activity relative to growing actin networks, which would also be consistent with the shorter and more highly branched filaments previously observed by platinum replica EM upon mitochondrial Ena/VASP sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 2002</xref>). In this alternative possibility, increased Arp2/3 densities might in turn indirectly contribute to the increase of its co-regulator CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>). The latter view is supported by the observation that acute, experimental sequestration of Arp2/3 complex, achieved by microinjection of recombinant WCA, coincides with removal of both Arp2/3 complex and CP from lamellipodia, suggesting that capping protein accumulation in the lamellipodium does indeed depend on the presence of Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koestler et al., 2013</xref>). The increased accumulation of cortactin in mutant lamellipodia is consistent with the general coincidence of its subcellular positioning with Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schnoor et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies perhaps involving cryo-EM tomography will have to define which one of these possibilities – if not both - will actually hold true.</p><p>This notwithstanding, EVM-KO cells are still capable of lamellipodia formation and migration, albeit in a significantly compromised fashion, raising the question of alternative actin polymerases partly taking over. Previous studies have implicated formins in lamellipodia protrusion in B16-F1, including mDia2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) and FMNL 2 and −3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kage et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, FMNL2/3 removal caused defects partly reminiscent of what’s seen here, at least concerning impact on lamellipodial protrusion, actin filament densities or microspike formation (see below), although phenotypes seen upon Ena/VASP deficiency were more severe. Thus, the extent of potential redundancy between all these factors will only be revealed by systematic, combinatorial loss of function studies and side-by-side, phenotypic comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Derived conclusions will also have to consider the exciting, recently discovered ‘distributive polymerase’ activity ascribed to WAVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bieling et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As yet, authors of even highly relevant literature have decided not to clearly distinguish between filopodia and microspikes to facilitate analyses of finger-like protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vignjevic et al., 2006</xref>). However, the virtual absence of microspikes, but not of filopodia, in EVM-KO cells combined with the inability of established filopodia inducers such as mDia2, FMNL3, myosin X and Rif to rescue microspikes clearly establishes, perhaps for the first time, fundamental differences between these molecular entities. The mechanisms underlying filopodia assembly are still under debate: In the convergent elongation model, filopodia form by coalescence of lamellipodial filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the de novo nucleation model proposes filopodia to arise independently of lamellipodial actin networks, as effected by formin-mediated filament nucleation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faix et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mellor, 2010</xref>). The findings provided here strongly suggest that in contrast to filopodia, microspikes form exclusively by convergent elongation, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>), whereas filopodia may emerge by multiple, distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Young et al., 2015</xref>), opening a door for resolving a long-standing controversy in the field.</p><p>Ena/VASP proteins are well established to accumulate in FAs of adherent cells, and known to reside together with vinculin in the force-transduction layer in-between talin and ends of stress fiber filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>). The binding of vinculin to F-actin is critical to its role in cell-matrix adhesion since disruptions of the vinculin-F-actin interaction affect cell morphology, cell motility and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ezzell et al., 1997</xref>). The underlying cause of these defects is apparently the impaired ability to generate and transduce forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mierke et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, besides their actin polymerase activities, Ena/VASP proteins are ideally suited for the capture and tethering of dynamic filament barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breitsprecher et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, since vinculin and VASP interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brindle et al., 1996</xref>), vinculin-Ena/VASP complexes might synergize in the capture of filament barbed ends, to regulate force generation and transduction in FAs. However, the presence of multiple Ena/VASP orthologues and analyses of only partially-depleted cells hitherto prevented careful functional assessment of their precise contributions to integrin-dependent adhesion. Here, we show that lack of Ena/VASP proteins consistently impairs integrin-dependent spreading and changes in FA patterns, and that from the three Ena/VASP family members, the rescue with Evl is most effective concerning relevant adhesion parameters. The particularly important role of Evl in adhesion is strengthened by diminished traction forces upon its disruption, and further supported by our FRAP data, implying that Evl is more stably associated with other focal adhesion components as compared to VASP. All this clearly illustrates the positive regulatory function of Ena/VASP family members in adhesion. The specialized role of Evl in integrin-dependent adhesion is consistent with very recent work showing its specific requirement for FA maturation, cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Puleo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we have not only sought to interpret all our phenotypes in the context of various combinations of gene deletions employing up to three distinct mesenchymal cell types, but also assessed their expression levels in different cell types relative to each other, which certainly adds an additional layer of complexity. Two major points being more systematically followed in the future are worth mentioning here. First, Mena is by far the most abundant protein present in both melanoma and fibroblast cell lines, but in particular considering this fact, phenotypes generated by its elimination are comparably modest. In spite of its abundance, we are tempted to speculate therefore that it simply does not sufficiently find its relevant, specific interactors that might promote its impact in other structures such as cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2006</xref>) or tissues like the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwiatkowski et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, given their comparably lower abundance, VASP and Evl are instead displaying a surprisingly significant relevance in lamellipodia protrusion and adhesion formation, respectively. Notwithstanding this, VASP is still expressed at much higher levels compared to Evl, which by itself could explain its more prominent role in cell migration. Clearly, much remains to be learned concerning both redundancies and specific functions that can be assigned to individual Ena/VASP family members, in particular in various cell types and tissues throughout the mammalian body, but the experimental approaches and tools developed here constitute first steps in this direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Key resources table for details of resources used and created for this study.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>Constructs cDNAs of <italic>Vasp</italic> encoding murine VASP (isoform 1), <italic>Enah</italic> encoding Mena (isoform 2), and <italic>Evl</italic> encoding Evl (isoform 2), respectively, were amplified by PCR from a NIH 3T3 cDNA library and ligated into suitable sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). <italic>Vasp</italic> cDNA was additionally inserted into the BglII and SalI sites of pmCherry (Addgene ID: 632524).

For random motility assays, B16-F1cells were seeded at low density onto the dishes and allowed to adhere for 3 hr. Subsequently, the medium was exchanged with imaging medium, the chamber mounted into a heating system, and cells recorded by time-lapse phase-contrast imaging at 60 s intervals for 3 hr using an Uplan FL N 4x/0.13NA objective (Olympus). NIH 3T3, MV<sup>D7</sup> and derived cells were allowed to settle for 6 hr after seeding and imaged at 10 min intervals for 10 hr using an UPlan FL N 10x/0.30NA objective (Olympus). Single cell tracking was performed in ImageJ by MTrackJ. Analyses of cell speed and cell trajectories, turning angles, and mean square displacements were performed in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) using a customized macro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Litschko et al., 2018</xref>). Cells that contacted each other or divided were excluded from analyses. Directionality index ratio was determined by dividing the shortest distance between starting and end points (d) by the actual trajectories (D).

cell migration, morphogenesis and adhesion have remained somewhat controversial. By generating and analyzing single, double, and triple Ena/Mena/VASP knockout cells, Damiano-Guercio et al. revealed here that Ena/VASP family proteins are positive regulators of migration in different cell-lines. Moreover, they demonstrate that Ena/VASP family proteins are critical for the formation of microspikes, but not for the formation of filopodia, thus providing evidence that microspikes arise exclusively through convergent elongation of lamellipodial actin filaments, whereas filopodia can be generated by different mechanisms. Finally, they provide evidence that Ena/VASP family proteins contribute to cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Collectively, this study provides important new insights into the cellular functions of Ena/VASP family proteins.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of Ena/VASP interferes with lamellipodium architecture, motility and integrin-dependent adhesion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Pekka Lappalainen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Giorgio Scita (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Ena/VASP family proteins promote actin polymerization at lamellipodia, filopodia, focal adhesions, and stress fibers in animal cells. However, whether Ena/VASP family proteins function as positive or negative regulators of cell migration has remained controversial. Moreover, the precise role of Ena/VASP family proteins in the formation of filopodia and microspikes, and the possible differences between the assembly-mechanisms of these two types of actin filament bundles, were elusive.</p><p>Damiano-Guercio et al. provide a careful and comprehensive analysis of the role of Ena, Mena and VASP in the motility of melanoma cells and fibroblasts through CRISPR/Cas-mediated loss-of-function experiments. They provide compelling evidence for the role of Ena/VASP family proteins in promoting cell migration, at variance with what was reported in some earlier publications. They further demonstrate that Ena/VASP family proteins are critical for the formation of microspikes within the lamellipodium, while filopodia can assemble also in the absence of Ena/VASPs. At the ultrastructural level, actin network was shown to be severely affected following removal of Eva/VASP family proteins. Finally, using the same controlled systems the authors show that focal adhesions are impaired in Evl/Mena/VASP-deficient cells. This manuscript therefore clarifies and extends some earlier and partially conflicting literature.</p><p>The experiments presented in the manuscript are of very good technical quality, and the study provides interesting new information on the roles of Ena/VASP family proteins in cell migration and microspike/filopodia formation. However, the reviewers felt that the novel conceptual insight of this study is, at least in its present form, somewhat limited. Therefore, additional experiments and better discussion of the data are required to increase the impact and novelty of the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differential effects of Evl, Mena and VASP on cell migration and focal adhesions are interesting, and should be examined in more detail. Thus, the authors should carefully compare the localizations these proteins in lamellipodia and focal adhesions. This could be done either by antibody stainings of non-transfected cells, or by expressing Evl and VASP with different epitope tags in the same cells. Moreover, the authors should perform FRAP or photoactivation experiments to reveal whether Evl and VASP display differences in their dynamics at lamellipodia and/or focal adhesions. Finally, it is important to quantify the ectopic expression levels of these proteins in rescue cells. Knowing how &quot;rescue&quot; expression levels compare to endogenous control cells would very helpful to interpret these data.</p><p>2) The altered structural organization of the actin network in EVM-KO cells suggests that these cells might have a hard time to move particularly under conditions where the actin network has to oppose strong micro-environmental forces. Thus, it would be informative to test the migration of EVM-KO in 3D setting or against a flow, as these experiments might provide novel insights and broaden the relevance of Ena/VASP family proteins in cell migration to levels not previously tested.</p><p>3) Some important questions concerning the mechanism by which the loss of Ena/VASP leads to altered lamellipodial architecture and dynamics remain unanswered. Specifically, the increase of Arp2/3 and CP densities in lamellipodia assembling in the absence of Ena/VASP is difficult to comprehend. Any data the authors can provide in explaining this observation would strengthen the study. Alternatively, this issue could be better discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>4) The authors should rewrite the Introduction and Discussion to place their study in a better context with the previous work. For example, positive correlation of VASP accumulation at the leading edge with the protrusion rate of lamellipodia has been already observed at least in some cell types (e.g. Rottner et al., 1999, Lacayo et al., 2007). In addition, some Ena/VASP family members have been shown to promote cell motility and invasion in certain scenarios (e.g. Philippar et al., 2008). Finally, a wealth of biochemical work has convincingly established that Ena/VASP proteins possess actin polymerase and anti-capping activity (see Breitsprecher, 2008 and 2011, Mullins and Hansen, 2010). The authors' statement that Ena/VASP proteins &quot;are mainly known as negative regulators of cell motility&quot; appears to mainly rest on two high profile papers from the Bear/Gertler labs. By fixating on selected aspects of these early studies, the authors have created an unnecessary straw man argument.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55351.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differential effects of Evl, Mena and VASP on cell migration and focal adhesions are interesting, and should be examined in more detail.

This can may explained by potential hetero‐oligomerization of ectopically expressed and tagged Ena/VASP proteins previously reported (Riquelme et al., 2015), likely interfering with the outcome in this specific experimental situation. However, as suggested, we have now also performed FRAP experiments of EGFP‐tagged VASP <italic>versus</italic> ‐Evl in focal adhesions and lamellipodia using rescued EVM‐KO cells. Notably, Evl shows a moderate, but statistically significant increase in the amount of immobile fraction in focal adhesions as compared to VASP, potentially explaining its more robust accumulation in these structures as compared to EGFP‐tagged VASP. No differences, however, between these proteins were observed for their turnover rates, neither in focal adhesions nor in lamellipodia, suggesting that the observed, functional relevance of Evl in focal adhesions may indeed derive from its increased stable association with specific focal adhesion components. This notwithstanding, VASP is also expressed at much higher levels as compared to Evl (Figure 2J), which by itself could explain its more prominent role in cell migration (these data are also now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p>The last comment in this chapter refers to the unknown quantity of Ena/VASP family proteins in reconstituted EVM‐KO cells as compared to endogenous protein levels. We therefore quantified the average abundance of all three Ena/VASP members from immunoblots by densitometry in the entire cell population of rescued EVK‐KO cells. As now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, in rescued cells, Evl was on average overexpressed 2.5‐fold, VASP 1.5‐fold and Mena 1.1‐fold as compared to B16‐F1 control. Nevertheless, since we usually use low or at best moderately expressing cells for our microscopy analyses and keeping in mind the high variability of expression levels of EGFP‐tagged proteins in our transfected cell populations, we assume amounts of respective Ena/VASP members in cells analyzed by microscopy to even be considerably lower than these values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The altered structural organization of the actin network in EVM-KO cells suggests that these cells might have a hard time to move particularly under conditions where the actin network has to oppose strong micro-environmental forces.

Thus, as suggested, we analyzed migration of EVM‐KO and B16‐F1 control cells in Matrigel invasion assays. However, and to our surprise, as now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we did not find any significant differences in invasion rates between both cell lines. Although we cannot currently explain the mechanistic details of this result, which have to be unraveled in future studies, this result suggests that the robust, Ena/VASP‐driven promotion of actin‐based protrusion is of little importance for migration in confinement, which particularly relies on actomyosin contractility, as previously reported for other cell types (Poincloux et al., 2011; Ramalingam et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some important questions concerning the mechanism by which the loss of Ena/VASP leads to altered lamellipodial architecture and dynamics remain unanswered. Specifically, the increase of Arp2/3 and CP densities in lamellipodia assembling in the absence of Ena/VASP is difficult to comprehend. Any data the authors can provide in explaining this observation would strengthen the study. Alternatively, this issue could be better discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We think we can reasonably well explain the increase of Arp2/3 and CP densities in lamellipodia assembling after loss of Ena/VASP, but we apologize if our description was not sufficiently comprehensive for our readers. Ena/VASP proteins are actin polymerases thought to compete with CP for growing filament barbed ends (Bear et al., 2002; Breitsprecher et al., 2008, 2011; Hansen and Mullins, 2010). One possibility therefore is that the absence of Ena/VASP may allow for an increased proportion of CP localizing to filament barbed ends in the lamellipodium tip. An increased presence of CP might then be sufficient to increase the activity of Arp2/3 complex, as CP has also been reported to operate as co‐factor of Arp2/3‐dependent actin assembly (Akin and Mullins, 2008). Consistent with this, overexpression of VASP in B16‐F1 cells was previously found to decrease Arp2/3 complex intensities in lamellipodia (Dimchev et al., 2017). However, the latter finding could also speak for an alternative explanation for our observations. In fact, VASP‐mediated suppression of Arp2/3 complex incorporation into lamellipodia would also be consistent with Ena/VASP family members increasing the branch spacing of filaments in Arp2/3‐dependent actin tails, as previously observed in vitro (Pernier et al., 2016; Samarin et al., 2003). Thus, upon loss of Ena/VASP, filaments may not only become shorter, but Arp2/3 complex intensities simply increase due to enhanced branching activity. In this alternative possibility, increased Arp2/3 densities might in turn indirectly contribute to increased CP densities. The latter view is supported by the observation that acute, experimental sequestration of Arp2/3 complex (by microinjection of WCA) coincides with removal of both Arp2/3 complex and CP from lamellipodia, suggesting that capping protein accumulation in the lamellipodium does indeed depend on the presence of Arp2/3 complex (Koestler et al., 2013). Future experiments will have to define which one of these possibilities will actually hold true, or whether it might even be a combination of both. All these aspects will now be discussed in more detail in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should rewrite the Introduction and Discussion to place their study in a better context with the previous work. For example, positive correlation of VASP accumulation at the leading edge with the protrusion rate of lamellipodia has been already observed at least in some cell types (e.g. Rottner et al., 1999, Lacayo et al., 2007).

However, one should keep in mind that these papers, which are still highly cited, were outstandingly influential for the interpretation of Ena/VASP activity in cells, and not only that, they also served as benchmarks for the motility field in general, and this for two decades now. It is therefore not appropriate to accuse us of having generated something that the reviewer terms strawman argument, this is simply not fair. We should also emphasize that as scientists, we believe it must be legitimate and necessary to critically re‐evaluate even classic, high‐ranking scientific publications, in particular in modern times having access now to exciting, novel experimental tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. The reviewer will certainly agree that these approaches now allow us to confirm or to correct previous concepts and models that have been using on technology available at the time. Having said this, however, we do apologize if other relevant publications have fallen too short in this particular context! Indeed, we have now extended our text in this direction, as requested, and significantly rewritten both Introduction and Discussion to place our study in better context with previous work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
