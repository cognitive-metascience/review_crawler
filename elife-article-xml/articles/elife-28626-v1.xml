Currently available functional and structural data suggest that TRPV1 channels have two gates within their permeation pathway: one formed by a ′bundle-crossing′ at the intracellular entrance and a second constriction at the selectivity filter. To describe conformational changes associated with channel gating, the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid coumarin-tyrosine was genetically encoded at Y671, a residue proximal to the selectivity filter. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was performed to image the conformational dynamics of the channels in live cells. Photon counts and optical fluctuations from coumarin encoded within TRPV1 tetramers correlates with channel activation by capsaicin, providing an optical marker of conformational dynamics at the selectivity filter. In agreement with the fluorescence data, molecular dynamics simulations display alternating solvent exposure of Y671 in the closed and open states. Overall, the data point to a dynamic selectivity filter that may serve as a gate for permeation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28626.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use proteins on their surface as sensors to help them to assess and explore their environments and adapt to external conditions. The transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels form one such family of proteins. Sodium, potassium and calcium ions can move through TRP channels to enter and exit cells, and by doing so trigger changes in the cell that help it respond to an external stimulus. The channels have physical “gates” that can open and close to control the flow of the ions. When the TRP channel detects a stimulus – which could take the form of specific chemicals, or a change in temperature, pressure or voltage – it changes shape, causing the gate to open.</p><p>Researchers have a number of unanswered questions about how TRP channels work. Where in the channels are gates located? How do the channels control the flow of ions, and how do they communicate with each other? And which regions of the protein sense environmental cues? As a result, new technologies are being developed to make it easier to study the types of rearrangements that TRP channels experience when they activate.</p><p>Steinberg, Kasimova et al. have used total internal reflection microscopy – a method that images fluorescent molecules – to measure the conformational change of a single TRP channel in a living cell. This channel, called TRPV1, senses external heat and plays an important role in pain perception. Its gate can also be opened by the pungent compound of chili pepper, capsaicin.</p><p>The results of the experiments suggest that a selectivity filter region in TRPV1 channels changes its shape when the channel opens in response to capsaicin. Then, this selectivity filter appears to do double duty – it controls which types of ions pass through the channels as well as controlling their flow rate.</p><p>Because of its role in pain perception, having a better understanding of how TRPV1 works will be valuable for researchers who are trying to develop new pain relief treatments. The so-called ‘seeing is believing’ method used by Steinberg, Kasimova et al. could also be used to study other membrane proteins, both to guide drug development and to improve our understanding of how cells interact with their environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>non-canonical amino

tetramers with a central pore domain that is shaped by TM5 and TM6 transmembrane segments from each of the four subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As in <italic>Shaker</italic>-related tetrameric ion channels, the pore domain houses the ion selectivity filter and an intracellular ‘bundle crossing’ formed by the α-helical S6 segments. Functional and structural data suggest that the selectivity filter and inner bundle crossing have the potential to control the flux of ions according to the electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salazar et al., 2009</xref>). The lower constriction is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Palovcak et al., 2015</xref>) and associated to the canonical gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Steinberg et al., 2014</xref>), but less is known about the putative role of the upper constriction at the ionic selectivity filter, possibly due to the functionally sensitive nature of this region to side-chain mutagenesis. Nevertheless, high-resolution structures of TRPV1 suggest that the upper constriction undergoes structural changes in the presence of DkTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), a spider toxin that increases the open probability of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Siemens et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of the unitary conductance of TRPV1 channels by protons suggests that the selectivity filter region is flexible and is capable of adopting multiple, functionally distinct conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wen et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is not known if such conformational dynamics at the selectivity filter might be coupled to channel activation by agonists, such as capsaicin, and if filter gating is sufficient or acts in concert with the lower bundle crossing to control the ionic conductance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28626.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional expression of coumarin-containing TRPV1 channels at the membrane of HEK-293T cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top-down and lateral view of the pore region of rTRPV1 tetramers.

The voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) approach relies on the covalent attachment of such fluorophores, usually via introduced cysteine residues, and allows for the simultaneous recording of fluorescence signals and voltage-clamped ionic currents from expressed ion channels, often in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>). This technique has proven to be useful for the real-time description of subtle, and in some cases electrophysiologically silent, conformational changes in voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Islas and Zagotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pless and Lynch, 2009</xref>). However, excessive background labeling of intracellular sites, at endogenous cysteine residues for instance, and the prerequisite for solvent accessibility of the labeling site serve to limit the utility of the technique substantially for the study of intracellular or solvent-restricted residues. A possible solution to these limitations is the use of genetically encoded fluorophores in the form of non-canonical amino acids (f-ncAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drabkin et al., 1996</xref>). Such strategies employ an orthogonal suppressor tRNA and an evolved tRNA synthetase (RS), which can be used to encode the ncAA at any site in the reading frame of the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drabkin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakamoto et al., 2002</xref>). This approach has been used for site-specific incorporation of fluorescent ncAAs on soluble proteins in prokaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Summerer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), membrane proteins expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>;), and proteins expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steinberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>). The f-ncAA coumarin has potential for the study of expressed protein conformational dynamics because of its small size and its exquisite sensitivity to environmental polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). This sensitivity can be exploited to report on variations (i.e. dielectric changes) in the surroundings of the incorporated f-ncAA and, in turn, it can be interpreted as a signature of a protein conformational change. Notable examples include the use of coumarin and the amber codon suppression technique to report on peptide binding to viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ugwumba et al., 2011</xref>), on the photoregulation of firefly luciferase and on the subcellular localization of proteins in living mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2014</xref>), as well as onstructural rearrangements in isolated NaK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, the spectral dynamics of an encoded hydroxy-coumarin were determined in individual live cells with total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy and rapid imaging of single emitters to study the conformational changes occurring within the pore of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 during activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of Tyr-coumarin at genetically encoded positions</title><p>Previous cysteine accessibility experiments showed that Y671C residues define the boundary for both silver (Ag<sup>+</sup>) state-dependent accessibility and disulphide bond formation in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salazar et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that a genetically encoded coumarin residue at position Y671 (Y671<sup>Coum</sup>) would be functionally tolerated and if so, could potentially be well positioned to report on local structural rearrangements occurring within the pore during gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As expected for cells containing an encoded fluorescent probe, HEK-293T cells heterologously expressing both TRPV1-YFP and amber codon-containing TRPV1 mutants (TRPV1<sup>YFP</sup>/TRPV1<sup>TAG</sup>) exhibit coumarin–YFP colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) consistent with the presence of coumarin and YFP co-fluorescence.

The later condition was chosen to simplify the imaging of single emitters (i.e. one coumarin molecule per channel tetramer or cluster of tetramers). Both macroscopic channel kinetics and the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship were similar between wild type (WT) and coumarin-containing channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The G-V relationship from wild type and coumarin channels were well fit by a Boltzmann function with a half-maximal activation voltage (V<sub>0.5</sub>) near +100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Specifically, photon counts of the emission signal were examined to determine the effect of capsaicin, the canonical agonist of the TRPV1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The photon count distribution showed clear differences between pixels representing background and pixels from fluorescent spots, which presumably arise from fluorescent channel subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Further, when the cell is exposed to a maximal concentration of capsaicin (3 μM), the photon counting rate further shifted to higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The modes observed for these populations showed significant differences (n = 4; p&lt;0.05). One interpretation of the capsaicin-induced increase in photon emission counts is that it stems from local changes in the immediate environment of the dye. To simplify the analysis and interpretation of the optical data, we set out to measure the fluctuations of the fluorescence signal emitted from a single diffraction-limited emitter directly. Given the large pixel size and the low fill-factor of the SPAD array used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bronzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michalet et al., 2013</xref>), the precise localization of a diffraction-limited signal is not possible under the condition of overexpression of membrane proteins in living cells.

Stationary noise analysis was performed on the basis of the autocorrelation (C<sub>(∆t)</sub>) of the fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The autocovariance function can be used to calculate the correlation between values of a noisy signal taken at increasing time intervals, ∆t. In this regard, C<sub>(∆t)</sub> will be higher for small values of ∆t (i.e. for data points close to each other) and this function rapidly decays as ∆t become larger. In the present example, this analysis allows for the identification of a characteristic time constant (τ) of the exponential decay, which describes the autocorrelation of the fluorescent signal originating from single emitters. The obtained τ has an inverse relationship to the rates defining the equilibrium of the reaction between open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zingsheim and Neher, 1974</xref>). The calculated autocorrelation function discriminates well between the three conditions tested (i.e background, no capsaicin, and capsaicin present in the media). The background signal is obtained from cells that have the coumarin amino acid but lack the expressed TRPV1<sup>TAG</sup> cDNA. This condition generated noise with a single, fast time constant (τ = 8.5 ms) that was easily separated from the double exponential decay time constants observed in the signal originating from the encoded coumarin conditions. In the absence of capsaicin, the coumarin signal autocorrelation had two time constants with corresponding values of 12 ± 6 ms and 78 ± 22 ms. Incubations with saturating capsaicin concentrations (3 µM) changed these time constants to 13 ± 4 ms and 148 ± 38 ms (n = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), consistent with the possibility that the encoded coumarin is reporting on an agonist-induced increase in τ. Such a result can be interpreted as an stabilization of the bright state after ligand binding (i.e. longer bursts of activity) either alone or in combination with the destabilization of the dark or non-emitting state, a possibility consistent with the previously determined distribution of closed and open states in TRPV1 channels when activated by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hui et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28626.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Optical studies of ion channel gating.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stationary noise of single spots, with each curve corresponding to the averaged fitted curves for the indicated conditions (n = 7, paired).

To do so, we inferred that the signal minima (i.e. L<sub>0</sub>) would correspond to the magnitude of background signal and would corroborate that fluorescence transitions drop from a given maxima (L<sub>1</sub>) to the observed minima (L<sub>0</sub>) as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, inset). We analyzed the signal in the presence of capsaicin using a threshold-crossing criterion, where the threshold was chosen as 2.5 times the standard deviation of the mean amplitude of background fluctuations (see Materials and methods). This strategy produced an idealized recording, similar to the analysis of single ion channel current idealization trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). An analysis of this record shows that the agonist does not affect the amplitude of the fluorescence fluctuations, but rather it promotes a shortening of the mean dwell-time of the bright state, which we defined as L<sub>1</sub>, going from 398 ± 133 ms to 156 ± 52 ms (n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). On the other hand, capsaicin increases the probability of being in the bright state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, these two observations support the notion that capsaicin increases the burst length of transitions to the bright state. This is in agreement with the autocorrelation data, which show that capsaicin increases the time constant, and consistent with an increased burst length of bright events. The data from single emitters also supports previous data showing that the main gating effect of capsaicin is increasing the burst-length of openings by shortening the closed state, instead of prolonging the duration of the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hui et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the fluorescence data is consistent with the possibility that coumarin at position Y671 reports on the transition between open and closed states of the channel. Further, given the physicochemical properties of coumarin (i.e. that it is quenched in an aqueous environment), the data suggest that position Y671 is more water-exposed and thus has decreased in fluorescent output, in the closed state compared to the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner, 2009</xref>). By comparison, the available TRPV1 structural data place W426 in an apparently invariant solvent-exposed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), thus, the open-closed transition would not be expected to induce evident changes in local solvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). In order to investigate the specificity of the spectral effects measured at Y671 with coumarin, a second site, W426, was examined in parallel. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed that W426<sup>coum</sup> is a functional channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>), and the photon-count analysis suggests that the fluorescence signal from this position is insensitive to capsaicin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>). Further, the fluctuations of coumarin fluorescence at 426<sup>coum</sup> are unresponsive to capsaicin treatment, as determined by the calculated bright state probability, P<sub>L1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>). Conversely, the P<sub>L1</sub> of position 671<sup>coum</sup> reported capsaicin dose-dependent fluorescent changes which are well fitted by the capsaicin dose-response curve obtained from capsaicin-activated currents at −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Lastly, when the fluorescence data from Y671<sup>coum</sup> was normalized and compared with the electrophysiological data taken from whole-cell macroscopic recordings, we observed a close match between the calculated Ec<sub>50</sub> for optical and electrophysiological data, 0.33 µM versus 0.43 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

To describe hydration of Y671 quantitatively, we calculated the corresponding solvent accessible surface area (SASA) in the open and closed conformations. The evolution of the Y671 SASA reveals that the two MD trajectories start to diverge quite early: in particular, in both conformations, the Y671 SASA drops down from ~35% to ~20% at the beginning of the equilibration; then, after ~30 ns, in the closed and open states, respectively, the SASA either increases up to ~30% or continues to decrease until it reaches an equilibrium value of ~15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Further, it can be observed that although the open state displays the side chains of Y671 residues engaged in mutual hydrogen bonding interactions, they establish vdW interactions with nearby residues F640 and M644, whose side chains are in between the selectivity filter backbone groups of two adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In the closed state, F640 and M644 residues still interact with Y671 as in the open state; however, the different orientation of the side chain phenyl groups allows for a rigid displacement of the pore helix toward the extracellular side of the pore, narrowing the diameter of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>).</p><p>To explore the plausibility of this hypothetical gating mechanism, we performed additional simulations in whichfour coumarin moieties were modeled in the place of the side chains of Y671. The rationale for these additional calculations was to ascertain whether the bulkier coumarin moiety (as compared to tyrosine phenyl group) can accommodate configurations similar to those accomodated by the wild type. In particular, would the ‘ring configuration’ in the open state allow ion permeation in the case of coumarin? Is coumarin in the ‘vertical configuration’ able to establish H-bonds with and thus promote the displacement of the pore helix in the closed state? Although the length of the simulations performed on the coumarin mutant would need to be extended in order to establish a more quantitative comparison with the experimental data, these cursory calculations suggest that the proposed gating mechanism is not incompatible with the molecular size of the coumarin moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ion channel gating occurs in the range of hundreds of µs and it is one of the fastest protein-dependent processes occurring within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hille, 2001</xref>). This rapid time-frame imposes intrinsic technical barriers in the detection of a limited number of photons coming from few emitting molecules and a consequent low signal-to-noise ratio under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ha, 2014</xref>). Given the design of our imaging setups and our experimental conditions (i.e. transient overexpression), we are bound to either the low (64 × 32 pixel) spatial resolution of the ns-time-scale sampling of the SPAD imager (which does not allow us to discriminate single emitters) or to a low signal-to-noise ratio restricting us to image at a maximum of 500 Hz (ms-time scale) for the individual diffraction-limited spots observed by an EM-CCD camera. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blunck et al., 2008</xref>), we observed that the latter approach is useful for conformational transitions in the order of 2–5 ms, thus barring optical access to the fast intra-burst channel activity that occurs in tens of µs. Therefore, the unitary transition analysis presented here was limited to the description of each burst as a single opening at the expense of missing activity during short openings. None the less, such an analysis, although lacking detail on unitary transitions, is a valid approach for estimating the duration of the mean open and closed state for a ligand-gated channel such as TRPV1, which has an open transition lasting for several hundreds of ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hui et al., 2003</xref>). The ideal experimental system would allow for sparse distribution (every ~1 micrometer) of the emitter-expressing receptors at the plasma membrane, so that the photon-count profile of individual molecules can be obtained with the SPAD imager with nanosecond resolution. However, in the absence of such technical advances, standard biophysical approaches are in place to provide insights on unitary gating events from an expressed population of channels. Interestingly, the similar rate constants obtained by noise analysis of the optical signal and from the subsequent modeling of the unitary transitions, suggest a strong internal consistency of data. Another limitation to consider in the analysis is the intrinsic blinking of the dye. In the present case, this represents roughly 12% of the P<sub>L1</sub> transitions and therefore obfuscates efforts to obtain absolute values for the open probability. Our solution to bypass this issue was to linearly subtract this ‘background open probability’ post-hoc and to normalize the data to its maximal theoretical response. Still, even with this coarse approximation, the optical data is in surprising agreement with whole-cell electrophysiological recording of channel gating. Further, this approach allowed for the direct measurement of the steady-state activity of membrane receptors undergoing fast molecular rearrangements. Specifically, from our fluorescence recordings, we reasoned that Y671<sup>coum</sup> experiences a change of environment as part of the process of pore rearrangement associated to channel’s opening. This possibility is supported by the dynamic range for the optical measurements presented here, and closely overlaps with the dynamic range of burst activity observed in single-channel recordings of TRPV1 in response to capsaicin (i.e. 0.1 to 1 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hui et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulations showed that Y671 could undergo three significant conformational changes during the channel’s transition from the conducting to the non-conducting conformation: (i) a side chain re-orientation with respect to the pore and pore helix, (ii) increased water exposure, and (iii) a reshaping of the H-bond interaction network. The spectral properties of coumarin are highly sensitive to changes in solvation and/or to changes in the coordination of the hydroxyl group of the dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner, 2009</xref>). Therefore, any of the modifications detected on MD simulations performed for the wild-type channel can potentially explain the observed changes in fluorescence. As a consequence, a detailed structural interpretation at the level of side-chain dynamics for the fluorescence fluctuations remains out of reach. Moreover, the data presented here do not prove a causal relationship between the motion of the aromatic side chain and the state of the pore helix.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link>) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco Inc.) supplied with 10% FBS (Gibco Inc.). Plasmocin (Sigma) was used following the provider’s instructions to maintain the cell culture free of mycoplasma contamination. Cells were tested for mycoplasma by standard PCR. Cells were prepared at (60–70)% confluence and transfected with lipofectamine 2000, (Life technologies). The target gene was transfected 2–3 hr after the initial transfection of the pair tRNAtag/CoumRS. The ncAA was added to the cell culture to produce a final concentration of between 0.5 and 1 μM at the time of the second transfection procedure. Under these transfection conditions, the efficiency of incorporation of non-natural amino acid was as low as 12%, with readthrough calculated to be about 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steinberg et al., 2016</xref>). Imaging: to simplify the analysis of the optical data, we transfected a mixture of TRPV1<sup>YFP</sup>/TRPV1<sup>TAG</sup> in a 7:1 ratio in an attempt to drive the system to incorporate as few coumarin molecules per tetramer as possible. The ratio of expression was not controlled as we concentrated efforts on single emitters identified ex-post. 24 hr after transfection of the target gene, cells were disaggregated and plated on poly-L-lysine treated glass covers. The f-ncAA-containing media was removed at least 12 hr prior to the experiment, allowing cells to clear the soluble ncAA. Generally, the cells were recorded 36–48 hr after the second transfection. Electrophysiology: cells were plated 2–3 hr before patching, and incubated with normal media lacking the supplemented coumarin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Synthesis of TyrCoum</title><p>L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine was obtained as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Solutions</title><p>Ringer solution for imaging experiments contained: 140 mM NaCl, 8 mM KCl, 8 mM HEPES, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.4.

These trajectories were generated starting from the cryo-EM structure of the TRPV1 capsaicin-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). In one simulation, we initialized the system by inserting several water molecules (from 4 to 6) inside the channel peripheral cavities (located between the S4–S5 linker and the S6 C-terminus); in the second simulation, we left these cavities empty. During the equilibration (about 750 ns), the molecular structures converged, respectively, to the closed and open states. To estimate water density along the central pore, we implemented the following strategy. First, using HOLE software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smart et al., 1996</xref>), we calculated the pore radius profile for each instantaneous configuration along the trajectory with a stride of 1 ns. Then, for the same set of frames, we calculated the three-dimensional histograms of water occupancy using the Volmap tool of VMD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001820">SCR_001820</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). Finally, we integrated the water occupancy in the XY plane (perpendicular to the channel central pore) using the pore radius profile as a boundary of the integration domain. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of Y671 in the closed and open states was estimated using the following procedure. From the MD trajectories, we extracted a set of sub-trajectories, each containing 10 frames taken with a stride of 0.2 ns. For each sub-trajectory, we computed the three-dimensional histogram of atomic occupancy (for all the atoms except water) using the Volmap tool of VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). We then used this map to define a molecular surface. To this end, we first discretized the map by assigning a value of 1 or 0, depending on whether or not the local occupancy is larger than a preset threshold. We considered all the bins with a value of 1 and located 1.5 Å away from a bin with a value of 0. Finally, the Y671 SASA was calculated as the overlap between the solvent-accessible surface and the Y671 residue. Note that the SASA was normalized to the Y671 maximal surface area. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed in the open and closed states of the TRPV1 coumarin mutant. The force-field parameters for coumarin were obtained from the CHARMM general force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vanommeslaeghe and MacKerell, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2012b</xref>).

For the vdW interactions, we used a cutoff of 11 Å with a switching function between 8 Å and 11 Å. The long-range component of electrostatic interactions was calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald approach using a cutoff for the short-range component of 11 Å. The equations of motion were integrated using a multiple time-step algorithm, with a time step of 2 fs and long-range interactions calculated every other step.

Both 405 nm and 473 nm solid-state lasers (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) were used to excite coumarin and YFP, respectively. Laser beams were focused to the backplane of a high-numerical aperture objective (Olympus 60X, N.A. 1.49, oil) by a combination of focusing lens. Fluorescence emission was collected by an Andor iXon<sup>EM</sup> + 860 EM-CCD camera (Andor/Oxford Instruments, Belfast, UK), after passing through an emission filter for each acquisition wavelength band of interest (coumarin: 450/70 nm; YFP:540/40 nm; Semrock, US). The light coming to the sample was controlled by a 12 mm mechanical shutter (Vincent associates, Rochester, NY), all measurements were performed under continuous light.

The fluorescence of the single emitter bleaches in less than 1 min of continuous illumination at 75% laser power.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Conformational dynamics in TRPV1 channels reported by an encoded coumarin amino acid&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, László Csanády (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a highly ambitious study pioneering in two techniques: exploiting engineered unnatural aminoacids as a means for targeted introduction of a small fluorescent probe into a protein, and using single-molecule imaging to track in real time conformational changes of a membrane protein in a living cell. The authors apply these techniques to address potential gating-associated motions of a residue (Y671) in the vicinity of the selectivity filter of the TRPV1 cation channel. By incorporating hydroxyl-coumarin into position 671 the authors show that this residue is exposed to a different local environment in the presence of the activating ligand capsaicin and interpret this to indicate that Y671 is more water exposed (dimmer) in the closed state. They conclude that channel opening is accompanied by a conformational change of the Y671 side chain, which decreases its solvent exposure. The results suggest that the TRPV1 selectivity filter plays a role in gating, and illustrate the power of optical recordings for studying protein conformational dynamics at a single-molecule level.</p><p>The experiments are carefully designed and carried out, and seem to mostly support the conclusions. However, there are a number of conceptually important points in the manuscript that are unclear to the reviewers. These will need to be clarified before the manuscript can be published. Specific guidelines are provided below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Autocorrelation time constant:</p><p>&quot;changed the slow time constant from 1360+/-287 ms to 580+/-182 ms […] reporting on an agonist-induced increase in tau. Such a result can be interpreted in multiple ways: i) the stabilization of the open state after ligand binding (i.e. longer bursts of activity)…&quot;</p><p>There is double confusion here. First, tau decreases, rather than increases, upon agonist addition. Second, the autocorrelation time constant is the inverse of the sum of the opening and closing rate (for a two-state channel tau=1/(kco+koc)). Therefore, a lengthening of open times (i.e., a decrease in koc) would prolong, rather than shorten this time constant. Also, please comment on how the autocorrelation time constant in the presence of capsaicin (&gt;500 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) agrees with the current activation time constant seen in electrophysiological measurements (t<sub>1/2</sub> of capsaicin activation is on the order of 100 ms according to Yao, Liu and Qin, BJ, 2010). Is the component (1364ms) at 0 cap due to spontaneous openings? If so, how does this value correlate with the spontaneous gating kinetics of TRPV1.</p><p>2) Dwell-time analysis:</p><p>Please comment on the reliability of the threshold analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The choice of a threshold at 2.5 SD of the background signal seems arbitrary. It appears that if the threshold had been chosen at e.g., 2.3 SD, then many additional &quot;openings&quot; would have been identified (although for a Gaussian-distributed background noise the area under the tail beyond 2.3 SD would still be expected only ~1%). Is there anything to be said about an optimal choice of the threshold, and about the specificity vs. sensitivity of the threshold approach?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>:</p><p>Please clarify what the difference is between the plot shown with black symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and the plot shown with gray symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (both fitted with orange lines), apart from normalization? The plot in 3E reports a less-than-2-fold, that in 3F an ~3-fold, stimulation by saturating capsaicin concentrations.</p><p>How can the only 2x (3x?) increase in PL1 upon exposure to saturating capsaicin, suggested by the analysis of the optical recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>, plots fitted with orange lines), be reconciled with the ~10x increase in Po measured in electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, plot fitted with blue line)? Is the PL1 of ~0.2 in the absence of capsaicin related to the &quot;intrinsic blinking&quot; of the dye (Discussion, third paragraph)? But there it is said that this &quot;background open probability&quot; was subtracted from the data. Do the plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E-F</xref> represent such corrected, or uncorrected data? – This should be clearly indicated in the figure legend.</p><p>4) Electrophysiology:</p><p>Why was the capsaicin concentration dependence of TRPV1 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) obtained at +140 mV, whereas the optical measurements on intact cells clearly reflect behaviour at negative (physiological) membrane potentials? Given the voltage dependence of TRPV1 gating, the EC50 for capsaicin activation is expected to be dramatically different at +140 mV vs. Vm&lt;0.</p><p>5) The fluorescence data traces for the control W426 control position are not shown. Please make these control traces and photon counts a prominent part of the main paper so the reader can compare the behavior of control positions with both types of imaging.</p><p>6) The molecular simulation was done with wild-type, not coumarin-carrying channels. Y671 is a critical residue (e.g., cysteine replacement severely disrupts channel function), so it is hard to predict how the local pore structure might be perturbed by the coumarin -&gt; Tyr substitution. For that reason, it is uncertain to what extent the simulation results can be extrapolated to mutant channels. Thus, this part might be better positioned in the Discussion section.</p><p>7) It should be pointed out that the proposed hydration model is not conclusive: the data support a change in the local environment around Y671, but many other factors could be involved that may contribute to these changes by perturbing local polarity, including movement of the pore helix with associated changes in the direction of its dipole moment. A more thorough discussion of this issue would improve the paper.</p><p>8) The methodology (coumarin incorporation and optical measurement) should be described in more detail. For example, what is the efficiency of incorporation of non-natural amino acid? How about the specificity (i.e., off-target incorporation)? How bright is the fluorescence (relative to conventional dyes or FPs)? How is the 7/1 expression ratio controlled? How long does the dye last for recording before it is bleached in the single-molecule recording mode?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28626.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Autocorrelation time constant:</p><p>&quot;changed the slow time constant from 1360+/-287 ms to 580+/-182 ms […] reporting on an agonist-induced increase in tau.

After making a closer (re)inspection of the data based on this comment we detected two relevant numerical errors on our part that were overlooked during preparation of the data:</p><p>a) When moving information from acquisition to analysis, the time base of the correlated data was copied with a 10-fold error.</p><p>b) When plotting the data, columns were labeled incorrectly as the reported time constants were inverted and didn’t make sense – as correctly pointed out by the reviewers.</p><p>In response, the data were re-analyzed from scratch and although the newly calculated values obtained are not exactly coincident with the values obtained for the dwell times (calculated from unitary transitions), they are in the same order of magnitude and retain the same relation (2-fold difference) of those observed in the originally submitted manuscript. Moreover, the data is now in close agreement to F. Qin previous report (cited in the text). The differences are commented now in the text (subsection “Activation kinetics obtained from the optical signal”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Dwell-time analysis:</p><p>Please comment on the reliability of the threshold analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.

Moreover, we aimed at steady state analysis for the case of fluctuations of fluorescence, and the match between electrophysiology and imaging was compelling enough not to explore further on the thresholds used for detection. We reasoned that lowering the threshold would just affect the base line of the imaging curve; therefore lower probabilities are the least sensitive part of our measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>:</p><p>Please clarify what the difference is between the plot shown with black symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and the plot shown with gray symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (both fitted with orange lines), apart from normalization?

Additional experiments and methods will be needed to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Electrophysiology:</p><p>Why was the capsaicin concentration dependence of TRPV1 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) obtained at +140 mV, whereas the optical measurements on intact cells clearly reflect behaviour at negative (physiological) membrane potentials?

This typo is now corrected in the text. TRPV1 is an allosteric channel; we should expect an effect when the EC50 is measured at negative or positive holding potentials. However, in our hands just a modest left shift on the EC50 (0.3 to 0.7 μm, +140 versus -60 mV) is accompanied by a ~15% increase of basal Po at high positive potentials (+140 mV). This was previously reported in (Jendryke et al. 2015; DOI: 10.1038/srep22007).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fluorescence data traces for the control W426 control position are not shown. Please make these control traces and photon counts a prominent part of the main paper so the reader can compare the behavior of control positions with both types of imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now prepared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> with examples of crude traces of photon counts over time corresponding to 671 data. Together with this new figure, we have also improved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> to now contain unprocessed recordings of photon counts over time, and the corresponding fluorescence fluctuations for 671 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. Our goal with this exercise, consistent with the <italic>eLife</italic> ethos, is to enable readers to compare and evaluate all raw critical data (i.e. photon counts and fluorescence fluctuations) for 671 and 426 control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The molecular simulation was done with wild-type, not coumarin-carrying channels. Y671 is a critical residue (e.g., cysteine replacement severely disrupts channel function), so it is hard to predict how the local pore structure might be perturbed by the coumarin -&gt; Tyr substitution. For that reason, it is uncertain to what extent the simulation results can be extrapolated to mutant channels. Thus, this part might be better positioned in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment that has provided motivation to engage in additional molecular modelling experiments. Specifically, we concur entirely with the reviewers’ assessment that the previous version of the manuscript could have misleadingly suggested a direct comparison between simulations and experiments. Therefore, we extensively edited the manuscript to clarify that the goal of our computational analysis was to show how molecular simulations independently highlighted Y671 as a residue crucially involved in the close to open transition and undergoing significant conformational changes that affect its hydration and H-bonding properties. We believe that these observations lend some confidence to the hypothesis that the structural changes reported by coumarin are physiological and informative about the gating process. Importantly, to make the connection with experiments more direct, we now include the results from two new simulations (open and closed states) performed on a mutated channel bearing a coumarin side chain at position 671. Thus, we included an additional Figure (5) which lays out the salient features of the open and close states, for the wild type and the mutant, together with their proposed mechanistic consequences.</p><p>Because of the additional data and figure, moving the computational results to the “Discussion” section would now make the latter considerably longer and, in our opinion, more difficult to read. We hope, though, that the reviewers will agree that these clarified Results and Discussion sections provide an overall improvement of the description of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It should be pointed out that the proposed hydration model is not conclusive: the data support a change in the local environment around Y671, but many other factors could be involved that may contribute to these changes by perturbing local polarity, including movement of the pore helix with associated changes in the direction of its dipole moment. A more thorough discussion of this issue would improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct, although the interpretations of the results are helped by the fact that capsaicin agonist activity on TRV1 channels is well documented, there is no reason to just comment on one of the possible factors that affects coumarin’s spectroscopic properties. These factors are now commented in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The methodology (coumarin incorporation and optical measurement) should be described in more detail. For example, what is the efficiency of incorporation of non-natural amino acid? How about the specificity (i.e., off-target incorporation)? How bright is the fluorescence (relative to conventional dyes or FPs)? How is the 7/1 expression ratio controlled? How long does the dye last for recording before it is bleached in the single-molecule recording mode?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these details and illumination conditions in detail within the Materials and methods. For the efficiency of the non-natural amino acid incorporation we provide details in the Materials and methods section and a reference containing the data supporting the text included (Steinberg et al., BioRxIv, 2016). Briefly stated, the incorporation efficiency is comparatively low to other evolved synthetases. This is likely due to the fact that the synthetase used here was rationally evolved through iterative rounds of molecular docking and mutagenesis, as described in the BioRxiv paper and the Materials and methods sections. However, for its application here, the relatively low incorporation efficiency and resulting sparse labeling is an advantage for the purpose of imaging single emitters.</p></body></sub-article></article>
