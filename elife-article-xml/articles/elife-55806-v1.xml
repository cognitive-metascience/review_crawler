In so doing, Vpr enhances HIV-1 gene expression and induces (G2/M) cell cycle arrest. However, the identities of Vpr target proteins through which these biological effects are exerted are unknown. We show that a chromosome periphery protein, CCDC137/cPERP-B, is targeted for depletion by HIV-1 Vpr, in a cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 dependent manner. CCDC137 depletion caused G2/M cellcycle arrest, while Vpr-resistant CCDC137 mutants conferred resistance to Vpr-induced G2/M arrest. CCDC137 depletion also recapitulated the ability of Vpr to enhance HIV-1 gene expression, particularly in macrophages. Our findings indicate that Vpr promotes cell-cycle arrest and HIV-1 gene expression through depletion of CCDC137.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like all viruses, the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) cannot replicate on its own; to multiply, it needs to exploit the molecular machinery of a cell. A set of HIV-1 proteins is vital in this hijacking process, and they are required for the virus to make more of itself. However, HIV-1 also carries accessory proteins that are not absolutely necessary for the replication process, but which boost the growth of the virus by deactivating the defences of the infected cells. Amongst these proteins, the role of Viral Protein R (Vpr for short) has been particularly enigmatic.</p><p>Previous experiments have shown that, in infected cells, Vpr is linked to several biological processes: it tags for destruction a large number of proteins, it causes the cells to stop dividing, and it encourages them to express the genetic information of the virus. How these different processes are connected and triggered by Vpr is still unknown. It particular, it remains unclear which protein is responsible for these changes when it is destroyed by Vpr.</p><p>To investigate, Zhang and Bieniasz conducted a series of experiments to spot the proteins that interact with Vpr in human cells. This screening process highlighted a protein known as CCDC137, which is depleted in cells infected by HIV-1.</p><p>To investigate the role of CCDC137, Zhang and Bieniasz decreased the levels of the protein in human cells. This stopped the cells from dividing, just like during HIV-1 infection. Destroying CCDC137 also mimicked the effects of Vpr on HIV-1 gene expression, increasing the levels of virus proteins in infected cells. Finally, Zhang and Bieniasz made a mutant version of CCDC137 that Vpr could not destroy. When infected cells carried this mutant protein, they kept on dividing as normal. Taken together, these results suggest that Vpr works by triggering the destruction of the CCDC137 protein. Overall, this work represents the first step to understand the role of CCDC137 in both infected and healthy cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>Vpr</kwd><kwd>CCDC137</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>cd4+ t-ell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AIR3764003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key target of the HIV-1 Vpr accessory protein is identified, whose depletion causes increased HIV-1gene expression and cell cycle arrest.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVs) encode several accessory proteins; Vpr, Vpx, Vif, Nef, and Vpu. While accessory proteins are often dispensable for replication in immortalized cell lines, they are important in a physiological context and typically act by removing or displacing molecules that are deleterious to virus replication. Among the HIV-1 accessory proteins, the function of ~14 kDa Viral Protein R (Vpr) remains the most enigmatic. Replication deficits of inconsistent magnitude are evident in HIV-1 mutants lacking Vpr, particularly in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balliet et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fouchier et al., 1998</xref>), while deletion of Vpr from SIVmac modestly attenuates pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibbs et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Vpr shares a common ancestor with an HIV-2/SIV accessory protein, Vpx. Both proteins bind to VprBP (DCAF1) and in so doing recruit the cullin 4A-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Srivastava et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeHart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hrecka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Rouzic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schröfelbauer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2007</xref>). Both Vpr and Vpx proteins are incorporated into virions through an interaction with the virion structural protein Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kondo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kewalramani et al., 1996</xref>).

However, HIV-1, HIV-2 and many SIV Vpr proteins do not exhibit SAMHD1-depleting activity. Rather, HIV-1 Vpr mediated CRL4 recruitment has different biological effects, including G2/M cell-cycle arrest of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeHart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hrecka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Rouzic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schröfelbauer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jowett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rogel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belzile et al., 2007</xref>) and activation of the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related)-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roshal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fregoso and Emerman, 2016</xref>). HIV-1 gene expression is also enhanced by Vpr in some contexts, and similarly enhanced in cells arrested in G2/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gummuluru and Emerman, 1999</xref>). Numerous cellular proteins including UNG2, the SLX4 complex, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), survival of motor neuron-1 (SMN1), cell division cycle associated 2 (CDCA2), and zinc finger protein 267 (ZNF267) have been reported to be depleted by Vpr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laguette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hrecka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lahouassa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>), However, while depletion of some of these proteins has been reported to have modest effects on cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>), none of the previously identified Vpr target proteins have been demonstrated to be solely responsible for the G2/M-arrest and gene-expression enhancement effects of HIV-1 Vpr. Indeed, the identity of the host proteins whose Vpr-induced depletion induces cell cycle arrest, or otherwise facilitates viral propagation, remains controversial. Here, we identify a Vpr target protein, cPERP-B, also known as coiled-coil domain-containing-137 (CCDC137), whose depletion causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and enhances HIV-1 gene expression, thus recapitulating the salient biological effects of HIV-1 Vpr.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CCDC137 as a Vpr target protein</title><p>To identify HIV-1 Vpr target proteins, we used a proximity-dependent method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) in which a biotin-ligase, BirA(R118G) fused an HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Vpr bait was expressed in proteasome inhibitor treated cells. Biotinylated proteins were enriched using streptavidin magnetic beads, identified using mass spectroscopy and the biotinylated proteome in BirA(R118G)-Vpr, and BirA(R118G) expressing cells was compared. Multiple nuclear proteins were biotinylated in BirA(R118G)-Vpr, but not BirA(R118G) expressing, cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, Ki-67, a proliferating cell marker, was the top ‘hit’, with &gt;90 Ki-67 peptides detected in replicate experiments.</p><p>However, Vpr did not induce Ki-67 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) and shRNA-induced Ki-67 depletion did not induce G2/M arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), strongly suggesting that it is not a Vpr target protein. Based on the fact that Ki-67 was the top hit in our proximity biotinylation experiments but did not itself appear to be responsible for the Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest, we hypothesized that a Ki-67-proximal or interacting protein might represent the genuine target of Vpr. Ki-67 recruits a group of proteins termed ‘chromosome periphery proteins’ (cPERPs), that localize within the nucleus, primarily the nucleolus, during interphase but are relocalized to chromosome peripheries during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we next conducted a focused screen of candidate target proteins that were either prominent hits in the BirA(R118G)-Vpr screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), were nucleolar or nuclear proteins, members of the cPERP group, and/or were reported to bind Ki-67. Of numerous candidates tested in transient co-transfection/western blot assays, Vpr only induced the depletion of cPERP-B, also termed CCDC137 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). To assess the potency with which Vpr could induce depletion of CCDC137, we cotransfected 293 T cells with various amounts of CCDC137 and HIV-1 Vpr expression plasmids. Both CCDC137 and Vpr proteins were tagged with the same epitope, a single copy of an HA tag, to assess their relative steady-state levels. This analysis revealed that co-expression of a barely detectable amount of Vpr resulted in the removal of much larger quantities of CCDC137, underscoring the potency with which Vpr induced CCDC137 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Treatment of cells with MG132 abolished the ability of Vpr to induce CCDC137 depletion, suggesting that Vpr triggered proteasome-dependent CCDC137 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, when DCAF1, an essential component of the CRL4 complex, was depleted by lentiviral vector-mediated RNA interference, the depletion of CCDC137 was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Depletion of CCDC137 by HIV-1 Vpr.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of 293 T cell lysates 28 hr after transfection (100 ng ng/well) with an HA-CCDC137 expression plasmid and (0 ng, 25 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, or 200 ng/well) of an HA tagged Vpr expression plasmid.

Presumably therefore, Vpr is deleterious to HIV-1 replication in these contexts, despite its positive effects on HIV-1 gene expression. This effect seems likely to be explained the interplay of infected cell life span and burst size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goh et al., 1998</xref>). In cell culture, the longevity of an infected cell plays a crucial role in determining burst size, and thus the effect of Vpr in curtailing the lifespan of an infected cell is expected to confer a competitive disadvantage. Conversely, the life span of infected T-cells in vivo is likely limited by factors other than Vpr and even a modest Vpr-induced enhancement in viral gene expression should confer advantage. Macrophages are not cycling cells, and lack ATR, Rad17 and Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerman et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, G2/M arrest and DDR induction by Vpr are likely not relevant therein. We confirmed herein that the Vpr-induced enhancement of HIV-1 gene expression is particularly evident in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connor et al., 1995</xref>). We surmise that the key consequence of Vpr-induced CCDC137 depletion is enhancement of HIV-1 gene expression, with G2/M arrest and DDR in cycling cells perhaps representing an epiphenomenon.</p><p>While this work was in progress, Greenwood et al reported the effects of HIV-1 infection on the cellular proteome and found that many proteins were depleted from HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cells, in a Vpr-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with our findings, CCDC137 was among the proteins found to be depleted in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cells. While CCDC137 was not investigated further, Greenwood et al reported that depletion of other apparent Vpr targets, (SMN1, CDCA2 and ZNF267) caused a degree of G2/M arrest. While we cannot exclude the possibility that additional target proteins contribute to the G2/M arrest properties of Vpr, the data presented herein suggests that CCDC137 represents the dominant mediator of the G2/M arrest and HIV-1 gene expression effects of HIV-1 Vpr. Further work, including a detailed analysis of Vpr mutants with distinct target protein specificities should help delineate the relative contributions of various target proteins to Vpr-associated phenotypes. Of note, other viral genes, in particular Vif, are able to affect the cellular environment, including cell cycle perturbation. To exclude the influence of other viral genes, and to facilitate shRNA experiments in primary cells, we employed a minimal version of HIV-1 in most experiments to study the effects of Vpr on cell cycle and gene expression in the target cells. However, we note that the effects of Vpr on gene expression in macrophages were recapitulated with a near full length viral construct, and are consistent with data obtained using a different near full length viral reporter construct reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connor et al., 1995</xref>.</p><p>That Vpr associates with a cPERP protein is consistent with prior findings that Vpr binds to chromatin and, with VprBP, forms chromatin-associated nuclear foci, a property that is associated with G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2010</xref>). CCDC137 is a poorly characterized protein - little is known about its function. CCDC137 has been reported to sequester retinoic acid receptor (RAR) to the nucleolus and thus is dubbed RaRF (Retinoic acid Resistance Factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Youn et al., 2018</xref>) but whether this property is relevant to HIV-1 gene expression is unknown. Further work will be required to discern the mechanistic details of how CCDC137 affects G2/M transition and inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. Nevertheless, the findings reported herein reveal an important aspect of how HIV-1 manipulates host cells to facilitate its replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CCDC137</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">NCBI Gene ID: 339230</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-3216</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">HTB-96</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-FLAG</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat# F3165</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000) <break/>Monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2 antibody produced in mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat# 901515</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000) <break/>Anti-HA.11 Epitope Tag Antibody</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Ki67</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab16667</td><td valign="top">IF (1:500);

The main phenotypes attributed to Vpr are the ability to delay or arrest dividing cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and to enhance viral replication in macrophages (which are non-dividing cells) and to a lesser extent in T cells. Vpr is recognized as a substrate adapter for a cullin-based ubiquitin ligase, and several cellular targets of Vpr have been reported previously, but their association with Vpr function has generally been uncertain, although Vpr-induced activation of the SLX4-complex has been connected with G2-arrest, and Vpr induced degradation of HTLF has been associated with stimulation of viral growth rate in primary T cells.</p><p>Zhang and Bieniasz now identify CCDC137 as the cellular protein whose Vpr-induced degradation is responsible for G2/M arrest. Specifically, the authors used a variation of the BioID system to identify proximal proteins and find Ki67 as the top hit, although Ki67 is not degraded. They then hypothesize that a Ki67-interacing protein could be the direct target of Vpr. More than a dozen candidate Ki67-interacting proteins were tested, and CCDC137 was the only one that reproducibly showed Vpr-induced degradation. CCDC137 degradation could be abolished with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) or by mutating residue Q65 in Vpr, which is required for interaction with DCAF1, a substrate receptor of Cullin 4. They also showed that shRNAs against DCAF1 abrogate degradation of CCDC137. The bulk of the evidence presented is consistent what we know about Vpr, including that Vpr stimulates viral LTR transcription modestly (3-5 fold) and that shRNA-mediated degradation of CCDC137 phenocopies Vpr activity in both inducing G2 arrest. Mutants of CCDC137 that cannot bind Vpr inhibited Vpr-induced cell-cycle arrest, further establishing a causal relationship. The effects are more pronounced in macrophages, in agreement with an early report from the Landau lab. Based on the fact that differentiated macrophages are not cycling and do not express ATR and other relevant cell cycle signaling molecules nor exhibit the hallmarks of Vpr-induced DNA damage, the authors logically speculate that cell cycle and genotoxic effects may be epiphenomena.</p><p>Overall, the main findings are well supported by the data, the core results are convincing, and this work represents a significant advance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although additional experiments are unnecessary, the authors should comment on the following issues:</p><p>1) The authors do not discuss their results fully in the context of published data about other Vpr targets, which should be done more completely in the Discussion, and in a more nuanced form. For example, in the Introduction, the statement that none of the other a potential Vpr targets has an effect on the G2 arrest is an over-statement. The Greenwood et al. paper (2020, Cell Rep.) showed that knockdown of several of the proteins that they identified as direct binders of Vpr including SMN1, CDCA2, and ZNF267 increased cells in G2. Were any of these among the candidates tested and found not to be reproducible?</p><p>2) A related point is that in first section of the Results: CCDC137 was already identified in the Greenwood et al. paper as a direct binder of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vpr. This paper was published in April 2019 and was online in bioRxiv since July 2018. This does not detract from the fine work in the present paper that validates this hit, but the authors should acknowledge up front that their screen found the same protein as another extensive one, and now they follow-up on one that was in common. Were there any other hits that were in common between the two screens?</p><p>3) Was the Vpr R80A mutation tested for interaction with and degradation of CCDC137? This mutant Vpr does not cause cell cycle arrest, and it acts as a dominant negative in a manner that is rescued by the mutation Q65R, which blocks binding to DCAF1. In other words, Vpr-80A should not bind the key cellular protein involved in cell cycle arrest. If this was not tested, please explain in the text any potential caveats to the present analysis.</p><p>4) Subsection “Endogenous CCDC137 depletion in HIV-1 infected cells”: Did SIVmac Vpr cause G2 arrest in these cells? Did HIV-2 Vpr cause a reduced G2 arrest? It's important to link the phenotype with the effects of each Vpr on CCDC137 levels.</p><p>5) Figure 6: The experiment showing that a Vpr-resistant version of CCDC137 attenuates the Vpr-mediated G2 arrest is nice. However, for this data to be convincing, it needs quantitation and some statistics (especially since the WT CCDC137 ectopic expression seems to have an effect relative to the &quot;none&quot;).</p><p>6) The use of primary cells in the presented studies is commendable, but wild type virus is not used. The HIV-1 gene expression assays all use a minimal HIV construct that is not replication competent and is introduced after packaging and pseudotyping much as a lentiviral vector. Please address this potential shortcoming in the text.</p><p>7) Figure 5—video 1: It is very difficult to appreciate the reported effects, even if the main text tells you what to look for. Please comment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55806.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>Although additional experiments are unnecessary, the authors should comment on the following issues:</p><p>1) The authors do not discuss their results fully in the context of published data about other Vpr targets, which should be done more completely in the Discussion, and in a more nuanced form.

This has been addressed in the revised manuscript, in the Introduction and in the Discussion.</p><p>To address the specific question, SMN1, CDCA2, and ZNF267 whose depletion was reported have modest effects on cell cycle by Greenwood et al., we cotransfected fixed amount of plasmids expressing V5-tagged ZNF267, SMN or CCDC137 with various amounts of a Vpr expression plasmid (0, 25, 50 ng) in 293T cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Based on the findings of Greenwood et al., SMN was the most interesting candidate as its depletion was reported to cause about 19-30% cells to become arrested in G2/M. However, as shown in the attached western blot, neither the canonical SMN isoform (294aa) nor a shorter isoform (282aa) was depleted by Vpr, under conditions where CCDC137 (289aa) was profoundly depleted. The expression level of ZNF267 in transfected cells was below the WB detection limit and therefore it is hard to reach a conclusion as to whether Vpr controls its stability. However the effects of ZNF267 depletion reported in the Greenwood et al. paper are extremely modest. We did not test CDCA2 (Repo-Man) as it is enriched in NK cells and Treg cells, but not in macrophages and therefore it is unlikely to be depleted by Vpr to enhance viral gene expression in macrophages. Notably, Trinkle-Mulcahy L et al., 2006, showed that depletion of Repo-Man (CDCA2) using RNA interference induces apoptosis with little G2/M accumulation (see Figure 5 of that paper). Moreover, the G2M accumulation reported by Greenwood et al. following ZNF267 depletion was also very modest.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55806-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As reported by many authors and by Greenwood et al., and others, many proteins can be depleted by Vpr, reflecting the fact that Vpr hijacks CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex that governs the stability of hundreds of proteins. However, CCDC137 is the only protein thus far demonstrated to be depleted by extremely low levels of Vpr. The depletion of a number of proteins might contribute to cell cycle arrest to varying degrees, particularly under conditions of Vpr overexpression. However, we emphasize that the potency with which Vpr induces CCDC137 depletion and the profound effects of CCDC137 depletion on cell cycle and HIV-1 gene expression, particularly in macrophages, make this Vpr target unique.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related point is that in first section of the Results: CCDC137 was already identified in the Greenwood et al. paper as a direct binder of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vpr.

This has been addressed in the Discussion of revised manuscript. The Greenwood et al. paper did not identify CCDC137 as a Vpr binding protein, rather it reported that the levels of many proteins (one of which was CCDC137) were decreased in HIV-1 or HIV-2 infected cells. No follow up experiments on CCDC137 were reported by Greenwood et al. and it could not be discerned whether the reduced CCDC137 levels was a cause or consequence of G2/M arrest.</p><p>Proteins that were found in both in our BirA screen and in the Greenwood et al. paper (2019) include GNL2 (high score), CCNT1 (cyclin T1, high score), UTP14A (low score), DNTTIP2(low score), and PINX1(low score). We tested the high scoring hits (GNL2 and CCNT1) but these proteins were not validated as bona fide Vpr targets in our follow up experiments. UTP14A knockdown has been reported to induce G1 arrest, no information of which we are aware exisits for DNTTIP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Was the Vpr R80A mutation tested for interaction with and degradation of CCDC137?

Consistent with that finding, Vpr R80A failed to enhance viral gene expression in macrophages. An extensive analysis of Vpr mutants is underway (but cannot be completed at present) and will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>We cannot formally rule out the possibility that additional proteins whose level is reduced under high level Vpr expression might contribute to the G2/M arrest phenotype in transfected cells. We have modified the Discussion to concede this caveat. We note though, that our findings strongly suggest that the advantage conferred by Vpr is via the enhancement of viral gene expression rather than cell cycle arrest in G2/M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Endogenous CCDC137 depletion in HIV-1 infected cells”: Did SIVmac Vpr cause G2 arrest in these cells? Did HIV-2 Vpr cause a reduced G2 arrest? It's important to link the phenotype with the effects of each Vpr on CCDC137 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make a fair point. SIVmac Vpr has a minimal impact on cell cycle in infected human U2OS cells. HIV-2 Vpr caused G2 arrest to some degree. This data is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript and is consistent with previous observations. Importantly, the effects of SIVmac and HIV-2 Vpr proteins on CCDC137 levels do indeed correlate with their abilities to induce cell cycle in human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6: The experiment showing that a Vpr-resistant version of CCDC137 attenuates the Vpr-mediated G2 arrest is nice. However, for this data to be convincing, it needs quantitation and some statistics (especially since the WT CCDC137 ectopic expression seems to have an effect relative to the &quot;none&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Conceded. Quantitation and statistical evaluation of the effects of WT and Vpr-resistant mutant CCDC137 overexpression on Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest are shown in Figure 6C of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The use of primary cells in the presented studies is commendable, but wild type virus is not used. The HIV-1 gene expression assays all use a minimal HIV construct that is not replication competent and is introduced after packaging and pseudotyping much as a lentiviral vector. Please address this potential shortcoming in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Discussion to address this caveat. However, we would point out that some experiments (Figure 8—figure supplement 2) were done with a near full-length proviral constructs (carrying GFP in place of Nef) that was (we concede) introduced into macrophages by infection using VSV-G pseudotyping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5—video 1. It is very difficult to appreciate the reported effects, even if the main text tells you what to look for. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by this comment. To us it is very clear that a higher proportion of the cells in the lower panels (transduced with CCDC137-depleting shRNA vector) have a higher number of cells with visible mClover geminin, indicating that they are in G2 (a frame from the video is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>)</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55806-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
