We identified a mouse mutant with accelerated aging in the retina as well as pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal diseases, suggesting that the responsible gene regulates retinal aging, and its impairment results in age-dependent disease. We determined that a mutation in the transmembrane 135 (<italic>Tmem135</italic>) is responsible for these phenotypes. We observed localization of TMEM135 on mitochondria, and imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in mutant <italic>Tmem135</italic> as well as <italic>Tmem135</italic> overexpressing cells, indicating that TMEM135 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Additionally, mutant retina showed higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. These results suggest that the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through TMEM135 is critical for protection from environmental stress and controlling the progression of retinal aging. Our study identified TMEM135 as a critical link between aging and age-dependent diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19264.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19264.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19264.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Older people have an increased risk of developing many diseases, such as diabetes and age-related macular degeneration (which is often shortened to AMD).

To investigate the link between aging and age-dependent diseases, Lee et al. used mutant mice whose retina of the eye ages more quickly than normal mice and are prone to developing an eye condition that is similar to AMD. The experiments show that these mice have a mutation in a gene called <italic>Tmem135</italic> that is responsible for these visual problems. <italic>Tmem135</italic> regulates the size of cell compartments called mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell. This affects the ability of the mitochondria to work properly and makes the cells more sensitive to environmental stress, which in turn makes the retina age more quickly.</p><p>The findings of Lee et al. show that <italic>Tmem135</italic> is a critical link between aging and an AMD-like condition in mice. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that defects in mitochondria may accelerate the normal pace of aging and lead to AMD and other age-dependent diseases.

The common phenomena observed in both aging and age-dependent diseases may provide clues to this interaction. For example, one of the major age-dependent changes that generally occur in the tissue is accumulation of damages caused by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harman, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1972b</xref>). As by-products of normal cellular respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated in cells mainly in the mitochondria. When cellular production of ROS overwhelms its antioxidant capacity (state referred to as 'oxidative stress'), ROS damages cellular macromolecules such as lipids, protein, and DNA/RNA. In the course of aging, such damages caused by ROS are thought to accumulate and contribute to the development of age-dependent tissue dysfunctions. Increase in oxidative damage has been observed in a number of age-dependent diseases as well, and its involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases has been widely suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies, 1995</xref>). Related to the oxidative damage, another phenomenon that is observed in both aging and age-dependent diseases is the decline in mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenaz, 1998</xref>). Mitochondria are the organelle that consumes over 90% of cellular oxygen and generates ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy, 2009</xref>). Due to its proximity to the site of ROS generation, mitochondrial components are particularly susceptible to ROS-mediated oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cadenas and Davies, 2000</xref>). Prolonged exposure to ROS during aging is thought to result in mitochondrial dysfunctions and significantly contribute to the development of pathologies associated with aging. There is also strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in the pathogenesis of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Beal, 2006</xref>). While these phenomena indicate some of the common aspects between aging and age-dependent diseases, the mechanisms linking these two processes have not been elucidated at the molecular level.</p><p>Given the complexity in both the aging process and age-dependent diseases, as well as countless variables (including genetic an environmental variables) that exist among human population, it is extremely challenging to study the mechanisms underlying the aging process and how they relate to the disease-causing mechanism in humans. An animal model that shows accelerated aging as well as age-dependent disease symptoms could provide a useful experimental system for this purpose. Furthermore, a forward genetics approach starting with an animal model with these symptoms offers a potential of identifying a responsible gene that is not previously known to be associated with the aging process nor age-dependent diseases. We isolated an N-ethy-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant mouse line, <italic>FUN025</italic>, that exhibits age-dependent retinal abnormalities with a trajectory similar to that found with retinal aging observed in wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>) but with an early onset and faster progression. In addition, we found that the <italic>FUN025</italic> mutation leads to pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These phenotypes in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice suggest that the responsible gene is involved in regulating the rate of aging in the retina, and that its impairment leads to development of age-dependent disease. In this study, we identify a gene mutation that is responsible for retinal abnormalities in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice and characterize the novel molecular functions of this gene/protein associated with regulation of mitochondria as well as sensitivity to oxidative stress. Our findings reveal a molecular link between the aging process and age-dependent diseases, and a molecular mechanisms leading to age-dependent disease pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early-onset and accelerated progression of aging-associated changes in the <italic>FUN025</italic> retina</title><p><italic>FUN025</italic> mice were isolated through fundus examination in an ENU mouse mutagenesis project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vitaterna et al., 2006</xref>), and were found to exhibit retinal abnormalities similar to those observed in aged WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that, in the WT retina, age-dependent abnormalities including retinal degeneration, increased number of ectopic synapses and increased retinal stress all start from the peripheral retina by 8 months of age on an aging-susceptible A/J background but later on a less susceptible B6 background, which progress to the central retina with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>). Histological analysis of homozygous <italic>FUN025</italic> mutant and C57BL/6J (B6) WT retina at two and seven months of age revealed that a decrease in the ONLT Index [the thickness of outer nuclear layer (ONL) normalized by the thickness of inner nuclear layer (INL)] in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice compared to WT mice is observed by two months of age and becomes more pronounced by seven months of age, indicating progressive loss of photoreceptor cells in the <italic>FUN025</italic> retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that, while most of the presynaptic photoreceptor terminals (PSD95, green) line up in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in close opposition to the bipolar cell postsynaptic structures (PKC, red) in the WT retina, ectopic localization of presynaptic terminals and abnormal extension of bipolar cell dendrites into the ONL were observed in the <italic>FUN025</italic> retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Quantification of ectopic synapses indicated that a significantly increased number of ectopic synapses are observed in the peripheral retina of <italic>FUN025</italic> mice by two months of age, and in the central retina by seven months of age, indicating that this phenotype progresses from the peripheral to the central retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also observed that the sign of retinal stress, up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis and Fisher, 2003</xref>), was significantly increased in the peripheral retina of <italic>FUN025</italic> mice compared to the WT mice by two months of age, which later progresses toward the central retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, <italic>FUN025</italic> retina exhibits age-dependent retinal abnormalities with a trajectory similar to that found with retinal aging observed in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>) but with an early onset and faster progression.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19264.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Age-dependent retinal abnormalities in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) A significant decrease of the ONLT index occurred by two months of age in <italic>FUN025</italic> retina.

In order to elucidate the mechanistic role of TMEM135, we characterized the localization of the TMEM135 protein in cultured cells and mouse retina in vivo. Primary WT mouse fibroblast cells (MFs) were co-transfected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged vector containing <italic>Tmem135</italic> and DsRed2-tagged mitochondria vector (pDsRed2-Mito Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Immunofluorescence data showed that the GFP-TMEM135 protein displays an intracellular vesicular expression pattern in the cytoplasm, and a proportion is found in punctate structures on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Colocalization of TMEM135 to mitochondria was further confirmed in WT MFs using an anti-TMEM135 antibody and an AcGFP1-tagged mitochondria vector (pAcGFP1-Mito Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) as well as in WT MFs with anti-TMEM135 antibody and a red-fluorescent dye that stains mitochondria (MitoTracker Red CMXRos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper panel). Notably, the proportion of TMEM135 signals tend to distribute to small foci along the surface of mitochondria, at mitochondrial constriction sites, and at the tips of individual mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), and there appears to be less colocolization of TMEM135 on mitochondria in <italic>FUN025</italic> MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that transfected GFP-TMEM135 localizes on the surface of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, colocalization of TMEM135 to mitochondria was observed in monkey kidney fibroblast-like cells (Cos-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and mouse primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

One possible mechanism is that TMEM135 may be involved in inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. We tested this hypothesis by promoting mitochondrial fusion through overexpression of mitochondrial fusion factor, mitofusin 2 (<italic>MFN2</italic>) in WT and Tg-Tmem135 MFs. If TMEM135 inhibits mitochondrial fusion, we would see less elongated mitochondria in Tg-Tmem135 cells compared to WT cells upon MFN2 overexpression. However, we observed similar number of elongated (with lower MFN2 expression) and aggregated (with higher MFN2 expression) mitochondria in WT and Tg-Tmem135 MFs transfected with p<italic>MFN2-YFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The results indicate that overexpression of <italic>Tmem135</italic> in Tg-Tmem135 MFs does not inhibit the mitochondrial morphological changes caused by overexpression of <italic>Mfn2</italic>, suggesting that TMEM135 does not inhibit fusion. While it is also possible that downregulation of mitochondrial fusion proteins is responsible for over-fragmented mitochondria in Tg-TMEM135 MFs, which can be overcome by MFN2 overexpression, we found that this is not the case. The protein levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), MFN1 and MFN2 were not changed in Tg-TMEM135 MFs compared with WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). Additionally, the levels of these proteins are either unchanged (OPA1 and MFN2) or decreased (MFN1) in <italic>FUN025</italic> MFs compared with WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), indicating that the overly fused mitochondrial network observed in <italic>FUN025</italic> MFs was not caused by up-regulation of these mitochondrial fusion proteins. Another possible mechanism is that TMEM135 may promote mitochondrial fission. Dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1; also known as dynamin 1-like or DNM1L) is a mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase that is essential for mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mears et al., 2011</xref>). During mitochondrial fission, DRP1 is recruited from the cytosol onto the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is assembled into puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mears et al., 2011</xref>). These puncta consist of oligomeric DRP1 complexes that wrap around and constrict the mitochondrial tubule to mediate fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mears et al., 2011</xref>). We found that some of the punctate DRP1 signals colocalize with TMEM135 puncta on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that TMEM135 may be involved in DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission. We first tested if DRP1 binding to mitochondria is affected in the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs using immunofluorescence to visualize DRP1 puncta on mitochondria. In MFs, much of the DRP1 staining was diffused in the cytosol, but a proportion could be found in punctate structures on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). We used image analysis to quantify the density (number of puncta/mitochondrial area) of DRP1 puncta on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). The density of DRP1 puncta detected on mitochondria in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs was not different from what was detected in WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), indicating that DRP1 translocation to the mitochondria was not affected in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs compared to WT MFs. The average total fluorescence per puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>) was even increased in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs while the mitochondria stayed fused. These results indicate that DRP1 is translocated to mitochondria normally and assembled into higher order structures but appears to stay inactive in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs. DRP1 has been shown to be activated or inactivated through various post-translational modifications at different amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2008</xref>). These results support the notion that TMEM135 may be required for DRP1 activation. To further characterize the role of TMEM135 in morphological changes of mitochondria, we monitored their dynamics in relation to mitochondria in living WT MFs and HT22 cells expressing GFP-TMEM135. We observed that a proportion of TMEM135 localized at mitochondrial constriction sites where mitochondria later divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that TMEM135 is more likely involved in mitochondrial fission rather than fusion.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-19264-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19264.013</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of HT22 cells expressing TMEM135-GFP.</title><p>Live imaging of a HT22 cell expressing TMEM135-GFP and labeled with MitoTracker Red.

While it can be postulated that disease-causing mechanisms interact with molecular/cellular changes that occur with aging, molecules and pathways linking the aging process and age-dependent diseases have not been identified. By using a forward genetics approach, we identified a novel mouse mutation that leads to accelerated aging as well as pathologies observed in age-dependent retinal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since this 'phenotype-driven' approach is unbiased and requires no prior knowledge of the gene functions, it allows the discovery of unsuspected mechanisms underlying biological phenomena and diseases. The mutation was discovered in transmembrane protein 135 (TMEM135), which has been associated with fat storage and longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but has no defined molecular functions. Our results suggest that TMEM135 is critical for the regulation of the onset and progression of the aging process, a defect in which leads to age-dependent diseases. Thus, TMEM135 presents a novel molecular link between the aging process and age-dependent diseases.</p><p>As stated above, the unique characteristics of <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice is that it displays phenotypic features associated with normal retinal aging at much younger ages as well as age-dependent disease pathologies. The normal aging phenotypes in the mouse retina includes photoreceptor cell degeneration, ectopic synapse formation, and increased retinal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>). While these age-dependent abnormalities are observed at 8 months on an aging-susceptible A/J background and later in a less susceptible B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice on the B6 background have an early onset (as early as 2 months of age) and more rapid advancement of the retinal aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We previously found that these retinal aging phenotypes all start from the peripheral retina and progress toward the central retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2015</xref>). This spatial pattern of progression is unique to the retinal aging phenotypes in mice, and is maintained in the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>retina albeit with earlier onset and faster progression, indicating that the retinal aging process is accelerated in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice. On the other hand, these mice also display pathologies observed in an age-dependent retinal disease, AMD, including autofluorescent aggregates, increased inflammation and thickened RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fact that a single gene mutation leads to both accelerated aging and age-dependent disease pathologies in this mouse model provides a confirmation that these processes are closely associated with each other at the molecular level, and supports the idea that accelerating the aging process may lead to age-dependent diseases. Consistent with this idea, pathologies similar to those in the aging human retina including drusen formation, ectopic synapse formation and photoreceptor cell degeneration are observed in AMD patients with earlier onset and/or increased severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eliasieh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hageman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liets et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Terzibasi et al., 2009</xref>). Based on our finding, TMEM135 may be a key molecule that could tip the normal aging process toward age-dependent diseases.</p><p>Our observations associated with the RPE in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice indicate that this cell layer may be the primary site affected by the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025</sup></italic>mutation. We observed subretinal autofluorescent cells in the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>retina that are positive for microglia and macrophage markers. Microglia have been reported to sense and react to different stimuli, and move toward the origin of stress or the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mcglade-Mcculloh et al., 1989</xref>) while going through multiple morphological stages of microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonas et al., 2012</xref>). Upon evaluating the morphology and orientation of microglia in the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>retina, we found that the microglia located closer to the RPE (and thus farther from the IPL) showed increased body size and decreased cell processes compared to those located closer to the IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar morphological changes of microglia were documented in the injured rat olfactory bulb, and were classified as stages of microglial activation response to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonas et al., 2012</xref>). The Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells near the apical surface of the RPE also show immunoreactivity to F4/80, indicating that they have transformed from microglia to macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data suggest that the RPE layer is the origin of stress, toward which the microglia migrate. In addition, in the <italic>Tmem135</italic> mutant retina, RPE abnormalities were observed earlier than the onset of photoreceptor cell degeneration. Since the RPE is located between the choriocapillaris/Bruch's membrane and the photoreceptors, and maintains the health of photoreceptor cells by delivering oxygen and metabolites and phagocytizing the shed photoreceptor outer segment discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sparrow et al., 2010</xref>), primary RPE defects could result in secondary loss of photoreceptor. Interestingly, this is consistent with the current hypothesis for pathogenesis of AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonilha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roth et al., 2004</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the RPE and the subretinal space are likely affected first and become the origin of stress followed by photoreceptor cell loss in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice.</p><p>In the cell culture study, we revealed that the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mutant cells exhibit over-fused mitochondrial networks whereas Tg-Tmem135 cells (transgenic cells overexpressing WT <italic>Tmem135</italic>) show over-fragmented mitochondrial networks. Since mitochondrial networks are the net product of fusion and fission events that occur within cells, there are two possible mechanisms TMEM135 can be involved in: inhibition of mitochondrial fusion or promotion of mitochondrial fission. Following observations in our study strongly indicated that TMEM135 in involved in promotion of mitochondrial fission rather than inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. First, experimentally promoting mitochondrial fusion through overexpression of mitochondrial fusion factor MFN2 in WT and Tg-Tmem135 cells resulted in similarly over-fused mitochondrial networks in WT and Tg-Tmem135 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) indicating that TMEM135 does not inhibit mitochondrial fusion. Second, we observed that some of the TMEM135 signals are colocalized with punctate signals of the mitochondrial fission factor, DRP1, on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, we found that DRP1 is normally translocated onto mitochondria which stay fused in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mutant cells, indicating that DRP1 is not properly activated to promote fission. It has been shown that DRP1 activity is regulated delicately by a number of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Blackstone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zunino et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, our results suggest an important role for TMEM135 to promote DRP1-dependent fission possibly by activating DRP1 through post-transcriptional modification.</p><p>Another possible cause for over-fragmented mitochondrial networks observed in Tg-Tmem135 cells is increased oxidative stress, which has been shown to induce mitochondrial fragmentation in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iqbal and Hood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, it is unlikely that oxidative stress is the major cause of mitochondrial fragmentation in Tg-TMEM135 cells. While ROS is increased in both <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> mutant cells and Tg-TMEM135 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>), mitochondrial networks are over-fused in mutant cells and over-fragmented in Tg-TMEM135 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>), suggesting the TMEM135 function rather than oxidative stress as the primary factor affecting the mitochondrial networks in these cells. In addition, our live imaging of GFP-TMEM135 in WT MFs and HT22 cells captured the direct interaction of TMEM135 with mitochondria at fission sites, providing additional evidence that the TMEM135 function in mitochondrial fission rather than oxidative stress is the cause of altered mitochondrial networks.</p><p>We report here that defects in a novel regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, TMEM135, lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration. We found that adult mouse fibroblasts with either over-fused (<italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> mutant) or over-fragmented (Tg-TMEM135) mitochondria show impairment of respiration, indicating that the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion is important for proper respiratory functions. In addition to lower basal respiration and ATP production, <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> mutant fibroblasts also showed decreased SRC. SRC or ‘spare respiratory capacity’ refers to the difference between basal and maximal respiration, which reflects the extra mitochondrial capacity available in a cell to produce energy under conditions of increased work or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicholls, 2009</xref>). Exhaustion of the SRC has been associated with heart diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and smooth muscle death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicholls, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sansbury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yadava and Nicholls, 2007</xref>). It has been also hypothesized that mitochondria contributes to aging and age-dependent pathologies through a life-long continued decrease of the SRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desler et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mutation that leads to decreased SRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and accelerated retinal aging phenotypes provides new evidence to support this hypothesis. In addition, both <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>and Tg-Tmem135 MFs have increased total ROS and superoxide compared to WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating increased oxidative stress and damage. Based on the decreased SRC and increased ROS in <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>MFs, we hypothesized that the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>retina may be more vulnerable to the increase of environmental stress. Our animal study showed that <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mice under the hyperoxic condition had more severe retinal degeneration, apoptosis in the retina and retinal stress compared to WT mice under the hyperoxic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). These results suggest that while WT mice can tolerate certain amount of oxidative stress, <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mutant mice with a decline in mitochondrial functions have lower tolerance to such stress. Thus, <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup> </italic>mutant mice are more susceptible to damages caused by environmental stressors, accumulation of which leads to accelerated aging and age-dependent diseases with early onset. In conclusion, both our cell and animal studies suggest a role for TMEM135 in protecting cells from increased environmental stress.</p><p>In summary, through genetic analysis of an ENU-induced mutant mouse strain, we have identified that TMEM135 plays a critical role in maintaining the health of the retina by keeping the balance of mitochondrial dynamics, defects in which result in accelerated retinal aging and development of age-dependent disease pathologies. In particular, our data suggest that TMEM135 may promote DRP1-dependent fission through activation of DRP1. Our study suggests that TMEM135 or consequences of its defect such as unbalanced mitochondria dynamics and increased oxidative stress could be potential therapeutic targets for retinal aging and age-dependent diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Northwestern University. <italic>FUN025</italic> mice were generated by ENU mutagenesis in the Northwestern University Center for Functional Genomics as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vitaterna et al., 2006</xref>) and isolated from a screen designed to detect recessive mutants with vision phenotypes.

Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, together with my own, form the basis of this letter. As you will see, we all thought that the manuscript reports interesting observations that (1) reveal the phenotype of TMEM135 mutation using state-of-the-art mouse genetics and (2) relate mitochondrial dynamics to retinal health.</p><p>Regarding revisions, we think that the combination of (1) mutation discovery (forward genetics and recreation with CRISPR of the point mutation), (2) a thorough description of the retinal stress and degeneration phenotype, and (3) a rigorous analysis of the role of TMEM135 in mitochondrial dynamics constitutes a full body of work. The first two categories are quite complete, but reviewer #2 has a number of excellent suggestions for strengthening the third category. Also, the emphasis on aging and AMD is quite speculative at present. These themes should be relegated to roughly 1-2 paragraphs in the Discussion. I would strongly suggest removing &quot;AMD&quot; from the title.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work in this manuscript identifies a point mutation in the gene of <italic>Tmem135</italic>, (a previously characterized mitochondrial-associated membrane protein) as the causative agent of pathologies observed in an ENU-induced mutant mouse line (<italic>FUN025</italic>). After advancing the mitochondrial localization, the authors perform a series of experiments to test the function of TMEM135, and report evidence from cultured cells that mitochondrial fission is relatively diminished and that cells with mitochondria having the mutant protein generate elevated reactive oxygen species and superoxides.</p><p>Focusing on retinal pathology, and report several phenotypic observations interpreted as a diminished ability to cope with mitochondrial stress.</p><p>As the retinal phenotypes of the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> resemble ones that occur in some strains of aging mice, and further have resemblance to cellular phenotypes (loss of photoreceptor cells, ectopic OPL synapses, GFAP upregulation, reduced ERGs, increased fundus autofluorescence in microglia-like cells) associated with human AMD, the authors propose the mouse as a potentially useful model of AMD.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>The experimental work in the paper appears carefully done, with adequate documentation and statistics. The characterization of the mitochondrial localization, fission defect, increased ROS and superoxides appear to be genuine advances in the understanding the location and function(s) of TMEM135 in mitochondria. Nonetheless, these results are descriptive in character, and do not establish the biochemical mechanism of TMEM135 function.</p><p>The relatively weak nature of the conclusions is seen in such statements:</p><p>&quot;Taken together, these results indicate TMEM135 is involved in the regulation of balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion&quot;</p><p>&quot;These results suggest the notion that TMEM135 may be required for DRP1 activation&quot;</p><p>While the retinal pathologies are not uninteresting, it is highly premature to propose the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> mouse as a model for AMD. (If mutations in the gene were associated with say, early AMD, or if the function of the TMEM135 were established to be diminished during aging in the human eye, the reviewer would offer a more positive evaluation of this mouse as a model of AMD.)</p><p>Overall, the paper doesn't hold together very well. The core problem is that it is very difficult to obtain definitive mechanistic insight into the function of an orphan gene from a single spontaneous (and somewhat complicated) mutation. The authors make the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that the <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025</sup></italic> mutation creates a protein lacking two transmembrane segments and which flips the C-terminus of the alternatively spliced gene product to the opposite side of the membrane. Consequences would not only include loss of function, but also loss of proper expression level, mistrafficking and mislocalization, and gain of function by the mutant protein product. None of these complications are probed in any depth.</p><p>The characterized defects (defective mitochondrial fission, increased ROS and superoxides) simply don't tell one what the protein normally does, and one is stuck with inferences like &quot;it's important for […]&quot;</p><p>Bottom line: the work advances understanding of the phenotypic consequences of the specific <italic>Tmem135<sup>FUN025/FUN025</sup></italic> mutation, both at the level of mitochondrial function and retinal health in mice. However, I don't think novel any definitive insight into the normal role of the TMEM135 has been achieved (because of the complications listed above), and it is certainly premature to argue that this mouse is a good model for AMD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This interesting study characterized a mutant mouse line, <italic>FUN025</italic>, which was created by ENU mutagenesis. These mutant mice have retinal abnormalities, including progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Using genetic mapping and DNA sequencing, the authors found a mutation in <italic>Tmem135</italic> of <italic>FUN025</italic> mice. This mutation caused exon 12 to be skipped and a frame-shift occurred. When the authors introduced the same mutation into wildtype mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and crossed this newly created TMEM135 mutant mouse to <italic>FUN025</italic> mice, no complementation for the retinal phenotypes occurred. This suggested that the mutation was responsible for the eye phenotypes.</p><p>TMEM135 is predicted to be a polytopic membrane protein. Although a significant portion of TMEM135 was not associated with mitochondria, a portion of TMEM135 formed foci on mitochondria. Fibroblasts isolated from <italic>FUN025</italic> mice showed elongated mitochondria and mitochondria were fragmented when TMEM135 was overexpressed. Live cell imaging showed that TMEM135 was located at the site of mitochondrial fission. However, the majority of mitochondrial TMEM135 foci do not co-localize with Drp1, a protein that mediates mitochondrial fission. Overall, this work is exciting and the identification of mutated <italic>Tmem135</italic> in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice appears to be solid. Although the exact function of TMEM135 is currently unclear, this study discovered a potential new regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and will likely lead to future mechanistic studies. My specific comments are described below.</p><p>1) The role of TMEM135 in mitochondrial structure and dynamics was only analyzed in fibroblasts. In order to support the authors' main conclusion that elongation of mitochondria caused retinal degeneration in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice, retinal mitochondrial morphology should be analyzed.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors should show the specificity of the anti-TMEM135 antibody using fibroblasts or neurons isolated from <italic>FUN025</italic> mice as negative controls. Similarly, retinal sections of <italic>FUN025</italic> mice should be included. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, Tom20 is used as a mitochondrial marker, but the staining pattern does not look like mitochondria. Do the authors have evidence that the anti-Tom20 antibody stains mitochondria in their tissue sections?</p><p>3) The authors showed that the mitochondrial fractions contained TMEM135 by Western blotting as evidence of its mitochondrial localization. However, the method was not described and it was unclear if proteins from other organelles were present in this fraction. Proteins specifically localized to other organelles should be tested as controls.</p><p>4) The authors described that TMEM135 was associated with lysosome-like organelles solely based on an electron micrograph. This was not convincing. Immunofluorescence micrographs of fibroblasts stained with antibodies that recognize TMEM135 and lysosomal proteins would address this issue.</p><p>5) Because elongated mitochondria can be caused by increased mitochondrial fusion or decreased fission, the authors tested whether the overexpression of a mitochondrial fusion protein, Mfn2, could reverse the mitochondrial morphology. They found that Mfn2 overexpression resulted in elongated mitochondria in the TMEM135-overexpressing cells and concluded that mitochondrial fusion was not impaired in these cells. However, it was equally possible that Mfn2 was downregulated and its overexpression overcame such defects in the TMEM135-overexpressing cells. The levels of Mfn2 and other mitochondrial fusion proteins, such as Mfn1 and Opa1, should be measured.</p><p>6) The authors stated that <italic>FUN025</italic> mice expressed a C-terminally truncated TMEM135 protein with a reversed topology using a prediction program. However, the mutant protein may be degraded due to compromised folding. Because the anti-TMEM135 antibody recognizes the N-terminus, the authors should test the prediction by Western blotting. Also please confirm the overexpression of TMEM135 by Western blotting.</p><p>7) Scale bars are missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors describe the discovery of an ENU mutant mouse with early onset of retinal abnormalities that appear in older WT mice. These changes are associated with abnormal mitochondrial function and higher levels of oxidative stress. The mouse work is thorough and involves the generation of a point mutant used to cement the complementation assay as well as a transgenic overexpressing the protein involved (<italic>Tmem135</italic>). These in vivo assays are supported by in vitro analysis of mitochondrial function and localization of WT and mutant <italic>Tmem135</italic>.</p><p>The mouse phenotype is unlike AMD. Although the authors note that the <italic>FUN025</italic> RPE is thicker than normal and has elevated autofluorescence, these are not uniquely associated with AMD. In addition, there are several important distinctions. (1) Dry AMD is characterized by geographic atrophy – that does not seem to pertain here. (2) This mouse model is characterized by panretinal photoreceptor degeneration at levels that are not typical of AMD. (3) One of the early abnormalities noted in <italic>FUN025</italic> is the presence of ectopic neurites. It is not clear that these are encountered in typical AMD. While it would be appropriate to include a paragraph at the end of the Discussion noting that this mouse model possesses some characteristics of the AMD retina, having AMD be front and center from start to finish seems unwarranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19264.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Regarding revisions, we think that the combination of (1) mutation discovery (forward genetics and recreation with CRISPR of the point mutation), (2) a thorough description of the retinal stress and degeneration phenotype, and (3) a rigorous analysis of the role of TMEM135 in mitochondrial dynamics constitutes a full body of work.

We have pointed this out in the first paragraph of the Discussion.

In order to support the authors' main conclusion that elongation of mitochondria caused retinal degeneration in FUN025 mice, retinal mitochondrial morphology should be analyzed.</italic> </p><p>We have analyzed the mitochondrial morphology by electron microscopic analysis of the <italic>FUN025</italic> retina. By this analysis, we observed enlarged mitochondria in <italic>FUN025</italic> mice compared to wild-type mice, which has been added to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors should show the specificity of the anti-TMEM135 antibody using fibroblasts or neurons isolated from FUN025 mice as negative controls. Similarly, retinal sections of FUN025 mice should be included. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, Tom20 is used as a mitochondrial marker, but the staining pattern does not look like mitochondria. Do the authors have evidence that the anti-Tom20 antibody stains mitochondria in their tissue sections?</italic> </p><p>The antigen for the anti-TMEM135 antibody is in the N-terminus of TMEM135, and therefore, TMEM135 with the <italic>FUN025</italic> mutation (with the C-terminus affected) is still recognized by this antibody. For this reason, cells isolated from <italic>FUN025</italic> mice do not serve as negative controls. Nonetheless, we felt it would be informative to include tissues from <italic>FUN025</italic> mice to this analysis and revised the manuscript with those data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and G</xref>).</p><p>Although the staining with the anti-TOMM20 antibody looks rather diffused, the strong signals are in the outer part of the inner segments of photoreceptor cells where mitochondria are preferentially localized (Stone J et al. Brain Res. 2008 Jan 16;1189:58-69.). Additionally, the same anti TOMM20 antibody has been used in the retina in other publications (e.g. Kim HT et al. Cell Rep. 2015.13(5):990-1002.), which show similar staining patterns as ours. In order to confirm the staining pattern, we have also used other mitochondrial markers on the retinal sections, which produced similar staining patterns as anti-TOMM20. Since the TOMM20 staining in the retina does not clearly show mitochondrial shapes, we have also cultured RPE cells from the mouse retina and stained them with the mitochondrial marker and the TMEM135 antibody. We have added the data which show localization of TMEM135 on mitochondria in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors showed that the mitochondrial fractions contained TMEM135 by Western blotting as evidence of its mitochondrial localization. However, the method was not described and it was unclear if proteins from other organelles were present in this fraction. Proteins specifically localized to other organelles should be tested as controls.</italic> </p><p>We have added the description for mitochondrial fractionation in the Methods and also added data for proteins specifically localized to the lysosomes, nuclei, and endoplasmic reticulum as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors described that TMEM135 was associated with lysosome-like organelles solely based on an electron micrograph. This was not convincing. Immunofluorescence micrographs of fibroblasts stained with antibodies that recognize TMEM135 and lysosomal proteins would address this issue.</italic> </p><p>While we have observed localization of TMEM135 on lysosomes by immunofluorescence as suggested by the reviewer, this still does not really prove whether the organelle with TMEM135 that we observed in the EM analysis was the lysosome. We feel that the original statement was not convincing nor appropriate, and have decided to remove it from the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Because elongated mitochondria can be caused by increased mitochondrial fusion or decreased fission, the authors tested whether the overexpression of a mitochondrial fusion protein, Mfn2, could reverse the mitochondrial morphology. They found that Mfn2 overexpression resulted in elongated mitochondria in the TMEM135-overexpressing cells and concluded that mitochondrial fusion was not impaired in these cells. However, it was equally possible that Mfn2 was downregulated and its overexpression overcame such defects in the TMEM135-overexpressing cells. The levels of Mfn2 and other mitochondrial fusion proteins, such as Mfn1 and Opa1, should be measured.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the scenario described by the reviewer is possible. We have performed Western blotting analysis for OPA1, MFN1, and MFN2 in Tg-Tmem135 fibroblasts. The protein levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins, OPA1, MFN1 and MFN2 were not changed in Tg-TMEM135 MFs compared with WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), indicating that over-fragmented mitochondria was not due to downregulation of these mitochondrial fusion factors. Additionally, the levels of these proteins are either unchanged (OPA1 and MFN2) or decreased (MFN1) in <italic>FUN025</italic> MFs compared with WT MFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), indicating that the overly fused mitochondrial network observed in <italic>FUN025</italic> MFs was not caused by up-regulation of these mitochondrial fusion proteins.</p><p><italic>6) The authors stated that FUN025 mice expressed a C-terminally truncated TMEM135 protein with a reversed topology using a prediction program. However, the mutant protein may be degraded due to compromised folding. Because the anti-TMEM135 antibody recognizes the N-terminus, the authors should test the prediction by Western blotting. Also please confirm the overexpression of TMEM135 by Western blotting.</italic> </p><p>We have performed Western blotting for TMEM135 on brain lysates from <italic>FUN025</italic> mutant, wild- type, and Tg-Tmem135 mice. The data show that TMEM135 is not degraded in <italic>FUN025</italic> mutants, and that the protein expression level is rather higher compared to wild-type mice, which may indicate the existence of a feedback loop from the loss-of-function mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We have also shown that the TMEM135 protein expression level is higher in Tg-Tmem135 mice compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Scale bars are missing.</italic> </p><p>We have added scale bars in the figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The mouse phenotype is unlike AMD.
