Fluctuations in arousal and neural desynchronization likely pose perceptually relevant states. However, their relationship and their relative impact on perception is unclear. We here show that, at the single-trial level in humans, local desynchronization in sensory cortex (expressed as time-series entropy) versus pupil-linked arousal differentially impact perceptual processing. While we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry data, stimuli of a demanding auditory discrimination task were presented into states of high or low desynchronization of auditory cortex via a real-time closed-loop setup. Desynchronization and arousal distinctly influenced stimulus-evoked activity and shaped behaviour displaying an inverted u-shaped relationship: States of intermediate desynchronization elicited minimal response bias and fastest responses, while states of intermediate arousal gave rise to highest response sensitivity.

Pupil-linked arousal, which captures locus coeruleus-norepinephrine activity (LC–NE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>) has been shown to influence sensory evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>) and the processing of task-relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Despite evidence for an inverted u-shaped relation of tonic LC–NE activity to performance long suspected from the Yerkes-Dodson law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yerkes and Dodson, 1908</xref>), the precise associations between arousal, sensory processing, and behaviour are underspecified: Although optimal performance at intermediate levels of arousal has reliably been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Brink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faller et al., 2019</xref>), reports of linear effects on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>) or evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neske and McCormick, 2018</xref>) in different tasks and species complicate this picture.</p><p>In a separate line of experimental work in non-human animals, relatively high neural desynchronization yielded improved encoding and representation of visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goard and Dan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>) as well as auditory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marguet and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakata, 2016</xref>). Such periods of desynchronization are characterized by reduced noise correlations in population activity, and these patterns are commonly referred to as desynchronized cortical states. They likely result from subtle changes in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Renart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haider et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, behaviourally relevant changes in cortical desynchronization have been suggested to trace back to attention-related changes in thalamo-cortical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>). Thus, such desynchronization states can be expected to be of local nature and be limited to sensory cortical areas of the currently attended sensory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>). Although local desynchronization and perceptual performance are positively linked in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Speed et al., 2019</xref>), the exact shape of their relationship (e.g., linear vs. quadratic) is unclear. Most notably, evidence for a similar mechanism in humans has remained elusive.</p><p>On the one hand, a tight link of pupil size and desynchronization has been claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCormick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCormick et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, both measures have also been found to be locally unrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okun et al., 2019</xref>). As of now, pupil-linked arousal and local cortical desynchronization may or may not be distinct signatures of the same underlying process: Varying noradrenergic and cholinergic activity could influence both, local cortical activity and the more global measure of pupil size via afferent projections from brain-stem nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>). In sum, it is, first, unclear how pupil-linked arousal and local cortical desynchronization precisely shape sensory processing and perceptual performance in humans. Second, the interrelation of both measures and their potentially shared underlying formative process lacks specification.</p><p>Here, we set out to test the relationship of local desynchronization states and pupil-linked arousal, and to specify their relative impact on sensory processing and perception in healthy human participants. We recorded EEG and pupillometry while participants performed a challenging auditory discrimination task. We modelled ongoing neural activity, sensory processing, and perceptual performance based on both local cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal. This way we were able to test the interrelations of both measures but also to directly inspect their shared as well as exclusive influence on sensory processing and behaviour. Specifically, the effects of local cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal on perceptual sensitivity as well as response criterion were analysed.</p><p>A closed-loop real-time algorithm calculated on-line an information theoretic proxy of auditory cortical desynchronization (weighted permutation entropy, WPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fadlallah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>) based on EEG signal arising predominantly from auditory cortices. Of note, WPE as a proxy of desynchronization is tailored to the analysis of electrophysiological time series: It captures oscillatory as well as non-oscillatory contributions as a time-resolved estimate of desynchronization (see Materials and methods for details). Importantly, EEG entropy calculated for a previously published data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sarasso et al., 2015</xref>) aptly tracks changes in excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) cortical activity that occur under different anaesthetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, EEG entropy as measured in the present data aligns closely with the spectral exponent, a previously suggested measure of E/I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>). Entropy of EEG signals thus is not only sensitive to the basic features of desynchronization (e.g. reduced oscillatory power) but also captures changes in a central underlying mechanism (E/I balance).</p><p>We used this measure of ongoing desynchronization to trigger stimulus presentation during relatively synchronized and desynchronized states, respectively. A continuously adapting criterion enabled us to effectively sample the whole desynchronization state space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017</xref>). Such a closed-loop set up allows for selective stimulation during specific states of brain activity while accounting for changes in the appearance of those states and hence represents a powerful tool with a multitude of potential applications in research but also therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ezzyat et al., 2018</xref>). To evaluate the interrelation of pre-stimulus desynchronization with simultaneously acquired pupil-linked arousal as well as their influence on stimulus-related activity we employed linear mixed-effect models. Furthermore, psychophysical models were used to evaluate the impact of desynchronization and arousal on perceptual sensitivity, response criterion, and response speed.</p><p>Although local cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal were weakly positively correlated, both did not only shape the ongoing EEG activity into distinct states, but also differentially influenced sensory processing at the level of single trials: On the one hand, phase-locked activity in low frequencies as well as stimulus-related gamma power over auditory cortices was highest following intermediate levels of pre-stimulus desynchronization. On the other hand, low-frequency power during and after a stimulus increased linearly with pre-stimulus arousal. Response criterion and speed exhibited an inverted u-shaped relationship with local cortical desynchronization, where intermediate desynchronization corresponded to minimal response bias and fastest responses. An analogous relationship was found for arousal and sensitivity, revealing highest sensitivity at intermediate arousal levels.</p><p>Our results speak to a model in which global arousal states and local desynchronization states jointly influence sensory processing and performance. While fluctuations in arousal are likely realized by afferent cholinergic and noradrenergic projections into sensory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2010</xref>), desynchronization states might result from efferent feedback connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded EEG and pupillometry while participants (N = 25; 19–31 years old) performed an auditory pitch discrimination task. On each trial participants were presented with one tone, taken from a set of seven pure tones (increasing pitch from tone 1 through tone 7), and had to decide whether that tone was rather high or low in pitch with regard to the overall set of tones. Participants thus compared each tone to an implicit standard, the median (=mean) pitch of the set. This yielded in all participants a valid psychometric function mapping stimulus pitch to perceptual decisions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Critically, by means of a real-time closed-loop algorithm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), tones were presented during states of relatively high or low entropy of auditory cortical EEG, a proxy of local cortical desynchronization. By collapsing offline across the whole experiment, we obtained data that covered the whole range of desynchronization states occurring in a given participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017</xref>). We then combined (generalized) linear mixed-effects models and psychophysical modelling to test the effects of local cortical desynchronization as well as pupil-linked arousal on (1) ongoing as well as sensory-related EEG activity, and on (2) perceptual performance.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the real-time closed-loop setup to track states of desynchronization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Setup: EEG signal was spatially filtered before entropy calculation. Pupil size was recorded and monitored consistently.

Second, the continuously updated criterion allowed us to, effectively, sample the whole state space of local desynchronization states: Depending on the current distribution, the same absolute entropy value could be classified as a high state, for example in the beginning of the experiment, and as a low state half an hour later. This focus on local, short-lived states resulted in widely overlapping pre-stimulus entropy distributions of high and low states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) which were then used as continuous predictor alongside the equally continuous pupil-size in all subsequent analyses.</p><p>Demonstrating the performance of the real-time algorithm, average entropy time-courses were elevated for all classified-high compared to all classified-low states in a 200 ms pre-stimulus window (all p&lt;0.001, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Note that this result is non-trivial. Since we continuously updated the criterion for state detection, in theory, states classified online as high and low could have yielded the same average entropy across the entire experiment.</p><p>In contrast, pupil diameter time-courses did not differ between high and low entropy states at any point in time (all p&gt;0.1) nor did the distributions of pre-stimulus pupil diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), pupil size and entropy in the pre-stimulus time window were positively related (β = 0.02, SE = 0.01, p=0.02). Pupil size explained less than 1% of the variance in EEG entropy.</p><p>Furthermore, auditory cortical desynchronization and pupil linked arousal, as approximated by EEG entropy and pupil size, displayed different autocorrelation functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). While EEG entropy states were self-similar on an approximate ~500 ms scale, states of pupil size extended over several seconds.</p><p>Most relevant to all further analyses, we conclude that states of local cortical desynchronization in auditory cortex and pupil-linked arousal predominantly occurred independently of each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Local cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal pose distinct states of ongoing activity</title><p>To dissociate the corollaries of local cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal on ongoing EEG activity, we modelled single trial pre-stimulus oscillatory power over auditory cortical areas as a function of pre-stimulus entropy and pupil diameter by jointly including them as predictors in linear mixed-effects models. Of note, non-baselined values of EEG entropy and pupil size were used as predictors but baseline values of EEG entropy were included as covariates to control for the influence of slow temporal drifts. This approach has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Senn, 2006</xref>), is widely used in functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kay et al., 2008</xref>), and is more reliable than conventional baseline subtraction methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alday, 2019</xref>). All analyses of ongoing or stimulus-related EEG activity were carried out on the spatially filtered EEG signal, allowing us to concentrate on brain activity dominated by auditory cortical regions.</p><p>As expected based on the definition of entropy and earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>), these analyses revealed a negative relationship of entropy and oscillatory power within the pre-stimulus time window (−200–0 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). With increasing pre-stimulus entropy, low-frequency pre-stimulus power decreased (1–8 Hz, linear: β = −0.18, SE = 0.01, p&lt;0.001; quadratic: β = 0.03, SE = 0.009, p&lt;.005; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Gamma power was lowest at intermediate entropy levels (quadratic effect; β = 0.06, SE = 0.009, p&lt;0.001).

In brief, this statistical approach describes binary choice behaviour across the set of used tones and thus also yields a psychometric function, but the generalized linear framework allows us to include the neural predictors of interest. Two parameters of the resulting functions were of interest to the current study: (1) the threshold of the psychometric function represents the response criterion; (2) the slope of the psychometric function expresses perceptual sensitivity. Additionally, we tested the influence of local desynchronization and arousal on response speed (i.e., the inverse of response time, in s<sup>–1</sup>).

Desynchronization in auditory cortex and pupil-linked arousal differentially affected ongoing EEG activity and had distinct effects on stimulus-related responses. Furthermore, at the level of single trials, we found unbiased performance and highest response speed to coincide with intermediate levels of pre-stimulus desynchronization and highest sensitivity following intermediate levels of arousal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tracking of auditory cortical desynchronization in real-time</title><p>As revealed by the average spatial filter and source projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the signal central to the present analyses mainly originated from auditory cortical areas. The state-detection algorithm we employed was based on entropy of the spatially filtered EEG signal and performed the desired state-dependent presentation with sufficient precision in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Of note, the distribution used to classify desynchronization states in real-time was updated constantly, which ensured two central prerequisites: First, slow drifts in desynchronization over time were prevented from biasing the state classification. Second, we were able to sample, throughout the experiment, the whole desynchronization state space within each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017</xref>). In contrast to an algorithm that sets the criterion for state classification only once per participant and leaves it unchanged thereafter (‘open-loop’), the current approach can be referred to as a closed-loop. Technical advances have promoted the use of such closed-loop paradigms to various areas of neuroscientific research, where the main application lies in neurofeedback. Neurofeedback tries to modify behaviour by providing participants with sensory information that is directly proportional to their current brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faller et al., 2019</xref>).

Although pupil size and EEG entropy were positively correlated as has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), a major part of the variance in EEG entropy was not accounted for by pupil size. We take this as a first piece of evidence that two distinct mechanisms are involved in the generation of perceptually relevant brain states.</p><p>The dissociation of both processes is further corroborated by the difference in their respective autocorrelations. Auditory cortical desynchronization displayed a narrower autocorrelation function than pupil size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting two different time scales of operation. Such a finding aligns with a recent study that suggests at least two different time scales that together shape neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okun et al., 2019</xref>). On the one hand, fast fluctuations have been suggested to depict synaptic activity and potentially trace back to thalamo- or cortico-cortical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haider and McCormick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, slow fluctuations potentially depict the influence of arousal or neuromodulatory activity in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okun et al., 2019</xref>). While states of local desynchronization likely operate on short time scales in the range of several hundred milliseconds, pupil-linked arousal states rather stretch across several seconds.</p><p>Furthermore, changing degrees of desynchronization and arousal manifested in diverse ways in the ongoing EEG: On the one hand, desynchronization in the pre-stimulus time window was negatively related to concurrently measured oscillatory power over a wide range of frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The strong negative relationship with low-frequency power replicates previous findings and is tightly linked to the concept of entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, pupil-linked arousal in the same time window was negatively linked to low-frequency power, an association frequently observed in invasive recordings of non-human animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, arousal was positively related to oscillatory power in the beta band but not in the gamma band. This link of arousal and beta power in EEG differs from reports of a positive relationship between gamma power of local field potentials (LFP) and pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vinck et al. (2015)</xref> correlated pupil diameter and LFP gamma power over time within an event-locked time period. In contrast, we related the average pupil diameter in a pre-stimulus time window to spontaneous EEG gamma power across trials. Upon further experimentation, differing methods thus pose the most parsimonious reason for this seeming disparity.</p><p>Taken together, the distinct relationships that desynchronization and arousal entertain with key, frequency-domain metrics of instantaneous EEG activity emphasize their independence.

An imperfect direct arousal–desynchronization link in the present data becomes more plausible if we take into account the important distinction between global and local brain states: While the overall level of arousal should have widespread but modality- and context-specific impact on sensory processing and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>), the desynchronization of local sensory neural populations could be largely unrelated to, and take place on top of, those global changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Such rather local and modality-specific changes in desynchronization have been assumed to arise from both thalamo- and cortico-cortical feedback connections that represent the allocation of selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zagha and McCormick, 2014</xref>). More precisely, glutamatergic projections between thalamus, prefrontal, and sensory cortical areas might shape the local net degree of inhibition in populations of sensory neurons via AMPA and NMDA receptors and hence influence time-varying local desynchronization. In fact, contingent on the specific task structure, selective attention increases desynchronization in neurons with stimulus-related receptive fields but also across a broader range of task-relevant neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen and Maunsell, 2011</xref>). In keeping with this, desynchronization over auditory but not visual cortical areas predicted sensory processing and performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A next step would thus be to combine the present setup for desynchronization–dependent stimulation with manipulations of selective attention. Additionally, future studies might combine single-cell and macroscopic recordings of brain activity with either the monitoring of neurotransmitter release or targeted pharmacological interventions. In the present design we were unable to directly test an involvement of specific neuromodulators in variations of E/I balance and the generation of desynchronization states. Noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation however, have been suggested as a candidate mechanism underlying such dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Froemke, 2015</xref>).</p><p>All things considered, the involvement of two partially related mechanisms in the concomitant generation of desynchronization and arousal states appears likely. On the one hand, desynchronization states presumably are shaped by feedback connections that could result from fluctuations in selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, pupil-linked arousal states at least partially hinge on varying levels of LC–NE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>) which are propagated via vast projections towards most regions of cortex and which might be related to overall changes in the availability of cognitive resources.</p><p>If local cortical desynchronization and arousal indeed originate from two distinct processes that both entail functional and behavioural relevance, they should not only have differential effects on the processing of sensory information but also on perceptual performance — which is what we observed here, as discussed next.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sensory processing is distinctly affected by desynchronization and arousal states</title><p>Desynchronized cortical states have previously been associated in the rodent with enhanced encoding of auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marguet and Harris, 2011</xref>), more reliable neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>), and improved perceptual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaman et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, when optogenetically inducing synchronization, perception is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nandy et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, arousal been linked to increased sensory processing of visual stimuli in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neske and McCormick, 2018</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>). However, perceptual performance was found to be highest at either intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neske and McCormick, 2018</xref>) or maximum arousal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, desynchronization and arousal had clearly dissociable effects on sensory processing and behaviour at the single-trial level. First, phase-locked responses were strongest following intermediate levels of pre-stimulus desynchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Strikingly, this relationship of desynchronization and sensory processing was mimicked by perceptual performance: Intermediate desynchronization led to optimal response criterion and response speed, hence yielding minimally biased and fastest performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, sensory-evoked gamma power increased with pre-stimulus auditory cortical desynchronization and showed a trend to saturate at intermediate levels. Second, pre-stimulus levels of pupil-linked arousal did only substantially affect sensory-evoked activity in the alpha band but not in low frequencies and were linked to perceptual sensitivity.</p><p>Of note, the described tri-fold association of desynchronization, stimulus-evoked activity, and response criterion is generally in accordance with a number of recent studies researching the influence of pre-stimulus oscillatory power on perceptual decisions. Generally, pre-stimulus power in the EEG has been found to bias choice behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kayser et al., 2016</xref>). More specifically, however, alpha power (8–12 Hz) prior to stimulus onset has been tightly linked to changes in response criterion and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iemi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samaha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wöstmann et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-stimulus alpha power is hypothesized to represent changes in baseline excitability, linking it to response criterion following an inverted u-shaped relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajagovindan and Ding, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kloosterman et al., 2019</xref>). These previous findings and the here reported connection of desynchronization and response criterion might at least partially trace back to the same underlying mechanism: that is, task- and attention-specific input to sensory cortical regions via efferent projections leading to a change in net inhibition.</p><p>However, only EEG entropy but not oscillatory power was linked to perceptual performance. One reason behind this pattern of results potentially lies in the different contributions both measures receive from time-domain EEG recordings. While alpha power is commonly approximated using a Fourier transform that quantifies the energy of periodic signal fluctuations, EEG entropy receives contributions from periodic as well as aperiodic signal parts. Thus, EEG entropy potentially poses a more sensitive proxy of underlying neural processes than oscillatory power and explains more behavioural variance. Additionally, the task employed in the present study asked participants to integrate sensory evidence presented on a given trial into a reference frame of several tones. This approach differs from commonly used paradigms in the context of pre-stimulus alpha power which typically present stimuli close to the perceptual threshold in simple detection paradigms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iemi et al., 2017</xref>). This difference in experimental tasks could further explain the irrelevance of oscillatory power to behaviour in the present dataset.</p><p>Furthermore, although both our present measures of brain state, EEG entropy and pupil size, were positively associated with stimulus-related EEG activity, they affected phase-locked and non-phase-locked brain responses as well as behaviour in distinct ways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Be reminded, however, that all effects on behaviour and stimulus-related activity were not obtainable when replacing auditory entropy with measures of auditory oscillatory power or with visuo–occipital entropy instead, which underlines their specificity.</p><p>Effectively, desynchronization and arousal might interact separately with the two, long-debated building blocks of sensory evoked responses: phase resetting of low-frequency oscillations and additive low-frequency activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shah, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sauseng et al., 2007</xref>). The positive link between phase-locked responses and desynchronization replicates previous findings from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>) and, combined with the observation of maximum phase coherence following intermediate desynchronization, indicates enhanced early processing of auditory information. Tones presented into states of intermediate desynchronization thus led to a stronger phase-reset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Auditory cortical desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal differentially impact performance</title><p>Importantly, the dissociation in neural sensory processing parallels a dissociation in behaviour. First, and analogous to the precision of sensory encoding which was highest at intermediate desynchronization levels, responses were least biased following intermediate desynchronization states. This striking parallel in neural and behavioural results cautiously suggests a change in the precision of representations that depends on the current desynchronization state. Second, the impact of arousal on post-stimulus alpha power and perceptual sensitivity, in the light of earlier interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voigt et al., 2018</xref>) proposes a similar mechanism: in addition to a clearer early representation of sensory information, intermediate arousal might optimize the integration of such a representation into an existing reference frame. This integration likely involves cortico-cortical feedback connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tallon-Baudry, 1999</xref>) and is essential to allow sensitive perceptual decisions. A different experimental design that allows the direct investigation of the proposed mechanisms represents a crucial next step to understanding the specific functioning of perceptually relevant brain states on the level of sensory neurons.</p><p>However, the relationship of arousal and perceptual performance takes a different shape than the respective link to sensory evoked activity might have suggested. While arousal covaried monotonically with post-stimulus activity in the alpha band (and in a statistically non-significant way also in low frequencies, 1–8 Hz), sensitivity was highest at intermediate levels of arousal, testimony to the classic Yerkes–Dodson law. A possible concern might be that we did not sample the state space of pupil-linked arousal in its entirety and hence ended up with a distribution that only captures the lower half of an underlying inverted u (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faller et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in a positive linear relationship between pupil-linked arousal and post-stimulus low-frequency power. The effect of arousal on sensitivity however did follow an inverted u-shape, suggesting that we indeed sampled a whole range of arousal states.</p><p>Additionally, a number of previous observations do in fact match this seeming disarray of stimulus-related activity (increasing monotonically with arousal) and ideal performance (depending quadratically on arousal). First, relatively highest levels of responsiveness in auditory cortical neurons overall can entail the loss of response specificity crucial for precise encoding and perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>). Second, and in line with this rationale, over-amplified responses to auditory stimuli have been linked to age-related decreases of cortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 2018</xref>). States of high arousal could thus in principle lead to a similar process of over-amplification and hence prove detrimental to sensory encoding and perception. Third, a recent experiment researching the impact of arousal on visual processing in mice yielded a highly similar pattern of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neske and McCormick, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neske and McCormick (2018)</xref> highlight the role of noradrenergic projections which might transmit task-related activity most efficiently at intermediate arousal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Two interrelated systems of local and global brain state jointly shape perception</title><p>We here have presented evidence for a joint role of local cortical desynchronization and arousal in the formation of brain states optimal for perceptual performance. The data are commensurate with a model where, on the one hand, arousal shapes global brain states via afferent noradrenergic projections and predominantly influences sensitivity. Conversely, we see local cortical desynchronization in task-related sensory areas to generate local states via attention-dependent feedback connections and to impact response criterion and speed.</p><p>To facilitate future research and offer testable hypotheses we intend to leave the reader with some speculations: How could those two mechanisms find an implementation in populations of task-involved sensory neurons? It has been suggested that the shared variability of neuronal populations and its impact on the responses of single neurons are shaped by an additive and a multiplicative source of variation in neural gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scholvinck et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas a multiplicative gain factor would lead to an overall change in tuning width, an additive factor could create an offset which is believed to differ between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Instantaneous fluctuations of cortical activity, or local cortical desynchronization, are believed to have an additive effect on evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, arousal-related LC–NE activity exerts a multiplicative influence on the tuning of sensory neurons, which has been suggested to entail relatively sharper tuning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mather et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent findings challenge this view by showing pupil-linked arousal-related broadening of sensory neural tuning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, it is unlikely that either additive or multiplicative factors alone are the sole source of variability in stimulus-related activity and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the present data allow the testable prediction that selective attention and desynchronization primarily exert an additive influence on neural gain, while LC–NE activity and arousal impact neural gain in a multiplicative fashion.</p><p>In sum, the present data provide evidence that, at the single-trial level in humans, desynchronization in sensory cortex (expressed as EEG entropy) and pupil-linked arousal differentially impact sensory and perceptual processes, but jointly optimise sensory processing and performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>25 participants (19–31 years, mean age 24.6 years,±3.5 years SD; 10 male) with self-reported normal hearing took part in the experiment.

To ensure approximation acuity but to retain a high time-resolution, a 200-samples window was moved along the EEG signal in steps of 10 samples, resulting in an entropy sampling rate of 100 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Real-time brain-state classification and stimulus triggering</title><p>Neural desynchronization in auditory cortical regions was estimated by buffering the EEG signal into Matlab, re-referencing to the average of all channels, applying the individual spatial filter and calculating a time-resolved version of WPE (for details see above).</p><p>The resulting entropy time-series was used to generate online a distribution of entropy values. Importantly, this distribution was updated constantly such that it never depended on values older than 30 s. This way, changes in neural desynchronization on longer time-scales were excluded and, instead of a strictly bimodal distribution, the whole desynchronization state space was sampled. Accordingly, trials with stimuli presented at essentially all levels of absolute desynchronization were obtained (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Desynchronization states were defined as a minimum of 10 consecutive entropy samples (100 ms) higher or lower than 90% of the current distribution. Elsewhere in the paper, we will refer to these as high and low states, respectively.</p><p>Organized activity in the EEG signal such as evoked responses or eye blinks results in neural synchronization and thus in a drastic reduction in entropy. Although the contribution of eye blinks to the online-analysed EEG signal was minimized by the spatial filter approach, we ensured that no periods containing eye blinks distorted the classification of desynchronization states. To this end, pupil data was read out in real-time and whenever a blink was detected by the eye tracker or pupil size was close to zero, a ‘mute’ window of 1 s was initiated where incoming EEG data were not considered further. EEG signals immediately following a blink thus were excluded from both, entering the desynchronization distribution and from being classified as a high or low state.</p><p>Whenever a high or low state was detected, a new trial started with the presentation of a pure tone after which the response screen was shown and participants gave their response. Note that each tone was presented equally often during high and low states (30 times, yielding 210 trials per state, or 420 trials in total).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Pre-processing of pupil data</title><p>First, the inbuilt detection algorithm was used to locate blinks and saccades before pupil data were aligned with EEG recordings. Second, signal around blinks was interpolated using a cubic spline before low-pass filtering below 20 Hz and down-sampling to 50 Hz. Third, data were split up into trials (−2.5–3 s peristimulus). Finally, single trial time-courses of pupil size were visually inspected and noisy trials (1.3 ± 1.6%) were removed. For visualization purposes, pupil signals were expressed in percentage of the pre-stimulus maximum within a participant (−0.5–0 s peristimulus). Z-scored pupil data was used as a predictor in brain–brain as well as brain–behaviour models. Due to technical difficulties, data from one subject had to be excluded from further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>EEG offline pre-processing</title><p>EEG pre-processing and analyses were carried out using the Fieldtrip and EEGLAB toolboxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) as well as custom code in Matlab 2017a. First, and as a preparation for independent component analysis (ICA) only, data were re-referenced to the average of all channels, bandpass filtered between 1 and 100 Hz, subsequently down-sampled to 300 Hz, and split up into 2 s long epochs. Rare events like breaks between experimental blocks and noisy channels were excluded based on visual inspection. Second, data were decomposed into independent components using EEGLAB’s runica algorithm. Visual inspection of topographies, time-courses, power spectra, and fitted dipoles (dipfit extension) was used to reject artefactual components representing eye blinks, lateral eye movements, heart rate, muscle and electrode noise. Third, raw, un-processed data were loaded, previously detected noisy channels were removed and data were re-referenced to the average of all channels. ICA weights of non-artefactual components were applied to those data before excluded channels were interpolated. Finally, ICA-cleaned data were band-pass filtered between. 5 and 100 Hz using a zero-phase finite impulse response filter and subsequently epoched between −2.5 and 3 s peristimulus. Single trials were visually inspected and rejected in case of excessive noise. On average one channel (±1 channel, M ± SD), 68.9% (±7%) of all components, and 1.4% (±1.6%) of all trials were rejected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>EEG time–frequency domain analyses</title><p>Single trial complex-valued Fourier representations of the data were obtained through the convolution of cleaned and spatially filtered time-courses with frequency adaptive Hann-tapers (four cycles) with a time-resolution of 100 Hz. Power from 1 to 40 Hz (in. 5 Hz steps) and from 40 to 70 Hz (14 exponentially increasing steps) was calculated by squaring the modulus of the Fourier spectrum and was expressed as change in Decibel (dB) relative to average power in the whole trial (−1 to 1.5 s peristimulus).</p><p>Additionally, we calculated inter-trial phase coherence (ITC; 0 ≤ ITC ≥ 1) and thus divided Fourier representations by their magnitude and averaged across trials before computing the magnitude of the average complex value. Importantly, since, ITC is only defined for a set of multiple trials but not for single trials, we computed the single-trial measure of jackknife-ITC (jITC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wöstmann et al., 2019</xref>). In short, jITC of one trial is defined as the ITC of all trials but the one in question. Note that a trial highly phase-coherent with all others will result in a relatively low value of jITC, reversing the intuitive interpretation of ITC. In the remainder of this paper, we will thus use the term <italic>single-trial phase coherence</italic> when referring to 1–jITC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Control analyses</title><p>To test the topographical specificity of EEG entropy, we averaged the re-referenced but otherwise raw EEG signal over seven visuo-occipital channels (PO3, PO4, PO7, PO8, POz, O1, O2). Note that this average of a channel selection (all seven visuo-occipital channels receiving equal weight in the average, while other channels effectively received weight 0) is conceptually not different from the way the more sophisticated, pilot–experiment-based auditory spatial filter was calculated. Subsequently, we calculated EEG entropy of this occipital cluster in the exact same way outlined above for auditory cortical areas. The resulting entropy signal was used to repeat all analyses of stimulus-related activity and behaviour. Precisely, mixed models of ITC, stimulus-related power and behaviour were re-run with visuo-cortical entropy. The performance of those models was evaluated by comparing them to the models based on auditory cortical entropy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>General approach</title><p>Trial-wise brain–behaviour and brain–brain relationships were analysed using (generalized) linear mixed-effects models (see below). We used single trial estimates of pre- and post-stimulus brain activity as well as binary decisions (‘high vs. ‘low’) as dependent variables. Pre-stimulus entropy and pupil size served as predictors. To allow for an illustrative presentation of single subject data, dependent variables were binned based on predictor variables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Note that both EEG signals and behaviour were modelled based on single trial measures of entropy and pupil size, without dichotomizing them into high and low states. Importantly, a contrast between high and low states (for entropy and pupil size) as well as binning was used for visualization only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and was not part of any statistical analyses reported here. However, single subject fits across bins (of varying number; varying the number of bins between 3 and 7) qualitatively replicated effects of single-trial models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Brain–behaviour relationships</title><p>As the main interest of this study lay in the influence of pre-stimulus desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal on perceptual sensitivity and response criterion, we combined a generalized linear-mixed-effects model approach with psychophysical modelling: single trial responses (high vs. low) of all participants were modelled as a logistic regression in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) and a logit link function. The main predictors used in the model were (1) the normalized pitch of presented tones (with respect to the median frequency, seven levels), (2) pre-stimulus entropy (averaged between −0.2 and 0 s peristimulus) and (3) pre-stimulus pupil size (averaged between −0.5 and 0 s peristimulus). Pre-stimulus entropy and pupil size entered the model as both linear and quadratic predictors allowing us to test for non-linear relationships. We additionally included baseline entropy of each trial (3 s pre-stimulus) as a covariate to account for slow fluctuations in average entropy across the duration of the experiment. Note that such an approach is not only in line with current recommendations in statistical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Senn, 2006</xref>) but also comparable to the common inclusion of polynomials in models of functional imaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kay et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, a recent study highlighted the superiority of such an approach compared to traditional baseline subtraction in the context of EEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alday, 2019</xref>). To control for the influence of task duration, trial number was added as a regressor of no interest.</p><p>Note that, in the resulting model, a main effect of pitch corresponds to the presence of psychometric response behaviour itself (probability of ‘high’ responses across pitch levels), a main effect of another predictor (e.g. pupil size) represents a shift in response criterion, and an interaction of pitch and another predictor depicts a change in the slope of the psychometric function, that is a change in sensitivity. Of note, we refrain from interpreting the effects of covariates such as trial number or baseline entropy, as is good practice. For a similar approach and argument see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alday (2019)</xref>.</p><p>Response times were measured relative to the offset of the presented tone and analysed irrespective of response outcome (correct vs. incorrect). To eliminate the impact of outliers, response times below. 2 and above 2 s were excluded from further analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratcliff, 1993</xref>). Effects of pre-stimulus desynchronization and arousal on response speed (the inverse of response time, measured in 1/s) were analysed within a linear mixed-effect model framework. Hence, single-trial measures of response speed across all participants were considered as the dependent variable. This analysis approach allowed us to control for a number of other variables including trial number and task ease by adding them as regressors to the model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-3"><title>Brain–brain relationships</title><p>To test the relationships between neural desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal with ongoing brain activity as well as auditory evoked responses we followed an analogous approach. Namely, different linear mixed-effects models with pre-stimulus entropy and pupil size as predictors were fitted for (i) pre-stimulus low (1–8 Hz) and (i) high (40–70 Hz) frequency power as proxies of ongoing activity. Similarly, different models were fitted for (i) post-stimulus (0–250 ms) single-trial phase coherence (1–8 Hz), as well as (ii) low and (iii) high frequency total power as measures of auditory evoked activity and stimulus processing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Of note no other covariates than baseline entropy used to model brain–behaviour relationships were included since none explained any additional variance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-4"><title>Model fitting</title><p>We employed an iterative model fitting procedure, starting with an intercept-only model, to arrive at the best fitting model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tune et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Fixed effects were added to the model one at a time and the change in model fit was assessed using maximum likelihood estimation. An analogous procedure was adopted for random effects after the best fitting fixed-effect-only model had been determined. We re-coded single trial pitch by first subtracting the median pitch and subsequently dividing by the new maximum, resulting in –1 and 1 for lowest and highest pitch, respectively, and 0 as the midpoint. We z-scored all continuous variables within participants. In the case of binary response behaviour we used generalized linear mixed-effects models with a logit link function. For all other models we employed linear mixed-effects as distributions of dependent variables were not found to be significantly different from a normal distribution (all Shapiro–Wilk <italic>P</italic> values &gt; 0.1). <italic>P</italic> values for individual model terms were derived using the Wald z-as-t procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luke, 2017</xref>).</p><p>As measures of effect size we report log odds ratio (log OR) for models of binary response behaviour end regression coefficients β for all other models alongside their respective standard errors (SE). A log OR of 0 indicates no effect for the regressor under consideration. Bayes factors (BF) were calculated for the comparison of two models with an equal number of terms that differed only in one predictor.</p><p>To additionally offer an intuitive comparison of predictors’ effects on behavior we directly tested some important differences of model estimates using a Wald test. In short, the Wald statistic puts the difference between two estimates from the same model in relation to the standard error of that difference. The resulting test statistic Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolker et al., 2009</xref>) can be used to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the two estimates in a respective linear model. Z-values above and below ± 1.96, respectively, were considered statistically significant.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the real-time desynchronization detection algorithm described above, we re-calculated entropy (WPE) in the spatially filtered, un-cleaned EEG signal to then compute subject-wise averages of entropy time-courses for high state and low state trials, respectively. A series of paired t-test was used to examine state differences across time. We adjusted p-values to control for the false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC Consolidator grant 646696 to JO) and a GA.

We extended Figure 2 (see panel B) with autocorrelation functions of neural desynchronization (EEG entropy) and arousal (pupil size). In addition to the average autocorrelation of single trial time-courses, we computed across trial autocorrelations of the respective average pre-stimulus values. As is evident from these figures, arousal indeed shows a broader autocorrelation than neural desynchronization. We interpret this as additional evidence for both measures tracking distinct brain states at different time scales. In the updated version of the manuscript the two timescales of neural desynchronization and arousal are additionally discussed in Results and Discussion section. The corresponding text passages are pasted below for convenience.</p><p>“Furthermore, auditory cortical desynchronization and pupil linked arousal, as approximated by EEG entropy and pupil size, displayed different autocorrelation functions (Figure 2B). While EEG entropy states were self-similar on an approximate ~500 ms scale, states of pupil size extended over several seconds.”</p><p>“The dissociation of both processes is further corroborated by the difference in their respective autocorrelations. […] While states of local desynchronization likely operate on short time scales in the range of several hundred milliseconds, pupil-linked arousal states rather stretch across several seconds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To further characterize the relationship between pre-trial neural desynchronization and pupil-linked arousal by searching the complete time-frequency-electrode space. A large number of studies showed that LC activity (and pupil dilation) is/are linked to low frequency desynchronization and an increase in high frequency power (Marzo et al., 2014; McGinley et al., 2015; Neves et al., 2018; Stitt et al., 2018), conflicting with the here observed findings (Figure 3 and 4).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important concern and we agree with the reviewers that the absence of the described relationship between pupil-linked arousal and oscillatory remained somewhat puzzling.</p><p>One reason for the absence of this effect in the original version of the manuscript potentially lay in our choice of baseline correction parameters for oscillatory power. We had used average oscillatory power in a 500 ms long pre-stimulus window as the baseline, a standard procedure in electrophysiological research. However, subtracting the average pre-stimulus activity might have obscured effects of interest in that very time-window. To investigate such a potential confound, we repeated all analyses using oscillatory power averaged across the whole trial period (–1 to 1.5 s) as the baseline. Note that this approach can come close to using no baseline at all but still allows to express oscillatory power in a meaningful unit (dB).</p><p>Corroborating the reviewers’ notion, when a whole-trial baseline is used (as in this revised version), pre-stimulus pupil size displays a negative link with low-frequency power in the pre-stimulus time-window. Furthermore, and prompted by the additional analyses requested in major query 3, pre-stimulus pupil size is positively linked to pre-stimulus beta power.</p><p>All other results of models predicting ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity remained qualitatively unchanged. We updated all figures, tables and statistics reported in the main text and supplements accordingly.</p><p>The results presented in the updated version of the manuscript are in line with previous studies that report a negative association between pupil-linked arousal and the power of low-frequency oscillations. Although our finding of a positive link between pupil size and beta but not gamma power does not align perfectly with earlier results, we deem it possible that the difficulties of recording high quality signals at high frequencies in the EEG might represent one reason for the absence of a positive link between pupil size and broad band high frequency power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We would like to see a control analysis which searches for an association between pupil dilation and de/synchronization over the complete time-frequency-electrode space (i.e., not restricted to the (for pupil analyses quite short) pre-stimulus time window and auditory electrodes).</p></disp-quote><p>To follow up on the reviewers’ question regarding a time-frequency-electrode resolved analysis of the relationship between oscillatory power and pupil size, we chose the following approach:</p><p>First, at the level of single subjects, we performed a multiple regression with single trial oscillatory power as dependent variable and pre-stimulus entropy, baseline entropy and pre-stimulus pupil size as predictors. Notably, one regression was calculated for each time, frequency, and channel bin. At the second level, the resulting regression coefficients of pupil size were tested against zero using a cluster-based permutation approach (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007).</p><p>Indeed, one negative cluster that was limited to low frequencies but extended over a wide pre-stimulus time-window emerged (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In convergence with our results outlined above, the topography of this effect included central electrodes but was strongest at occipital sites. Hence, pre-stimulus pupil size was negatively linked with low-frequency power and this relationship was strongest over but not limited to visual cortical areas.</p><p>Notably, the pattern of results did not change qualitatively when average pupil size in earlier time-windows was use as a regressor (e.g., -1 to -.5 s). This speaks to the extended duration of pupil-linked arousal states suggested by the autocorrelation functions of pupil size.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of pre-stimulus pupil size on oscillatory power.</title><p>Time-frequency resolved t-values from a cluster test on regression coefficients expressing the relationship between pre-stimulus pupil size (averaged between –.5 and 0 s) oscillatory power (left).

Thus, we additionally tested the relationship of pre-stimulus EEG entropy and pupil size with alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta power (14–30 Hz) both for pre- and post-stimulus time-windows. Power was modelled analogously to the approach used for low and high frequency power (cf. Figures 3 and 4).</p><p>As can be discerned from Figure 4—figure supplement 1, both pre-stimulus alpha and beta power displayed a negative relationship with pre-stimulus EEG entropy (alpha power: β = -.291, SE = .01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; beta power: β = -.316, SE = .01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Pupil size on the other hand, while not significantly linked to alpha power (β = .009, SE = .01, <italic>P</italic> = .35) showed a positive relationship with beta power (β = .04, SE = .01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p><p>These results demonstrate a broad negative relationship of EEG entropy and oscillatory power. Although the strength of this link varies over frequencies, pre-stimulus power overall is negatively related to EEG entropy.</p><p>On the other hand, sensory-evoked power in the alpha band was positively linked to pre-stimulus pupil size but not EEG entropy (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2 in the updated version of the manuscript). In line with the trend-level positive relationship of pre-stimulus pupil size and post-stimulus low-frequency power, this suggests that pupil-linked arousal affects the amplitude of sensory-evoked responses. In contrast, auditory cortical desynchronization as measured by EEG entropy increases low-frequency phase-locked responses (see Figure 4) but is negatively related to their amplitude. Hence, these findings are in support of the dissociable influences neural desynchronization and arousal exert on early sensory processing suggested in the original version of the manuscript. While neural desynchronization affects low-frequency phase-coherence, pupil-linked arousal influences post-stimulus low-frequency power.</p><p>Finally, sensory-evoked power in the beta band was neither substantially related to EEG entropy nor to pupil size. Thus, the desynchronization-dependent gain of post-stimulus high-frequency power reported in the original version of the manuscript is specific to frequencies above 40 Hz.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistics: It would be useful to show whether quadratic models explain significantly more variance than linear models.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue, and we would like to use this opportunity to outline and motivate our general approach. Although we acknowledge the theoretical relevance of a comparison between linear and quadratic models, our approach did not include a direct comparison of both due to several reasons. However, note that a model that includes both terms (as did essentially all our models) takes an unbiased approach statistically nevertheless, and in fact does allow for a direct comparison, as we will elaborate on below.</p><p>First, it is unclear based on previous research whether the interplay between desynchronization and behaviour is best characterized by a linear or a quadratic relationship. Similar things are true for the impact of arousal on performance. In order to test both shapes of relationships in every model, we always included linear as well as quadratic terms based on previous research.</p><p>Second, in order to directly compare purely linear and purely quadratic models, one would have to assume a complete dissociation of linear and quadratic terms. In other words, one would assume that a quadratic trend describes a perfectly symmetric parabola or that the linear term in a second-degree polynomial is zero. To avoid such strong and unrealistic assumptions, we always included linear and quadratic terms. Hence, data were fit by second degree polynomials without fixing any coefficients a priori. Note that in such a model linear terms do not change depending on quadratic terms.</p><p>Third, we aimed for consistency rather than data-driven variations. Instead of separately deciding for each brain-brain model whether to include a quadratic term or not based on variance explained, we decided to include it in all models in order to keep them comparable. Since significant quadratic effects were apparent for several dependent variables (e.g. phase coherence, response speed or sensitivity) we also modelled them for all others.</p><p>In this context we would like to point out that in a model that includes both a linear and a quadratic term, a significant quadratic term is equivalent to the quadratic effect explaining variance above and beyond the linear one. In contrast, this is not the case in a model with a non-significant quadratic term.</p><p>Thus, in the light of previous research that suggested linear as well as quadratic influences of neural desynchronization or arousal on perceptual performance we included linear and quadratic trends in all models. Removing them in the case of non-significant terms and reporting the purely linear model instead would, in our opinion, complicate things for the reader.</p><p>The way we report model results in the revised version of the manuscript makes it straightforward to assess the impact of linear and quadratic terms, respectively. In sum, the inclusion of quadratic terms in all models is not only essential in order to test previously suggested hypotheses but also entails a high degree of transparency in the reporting of results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And a global comment: Sometimes models are compared reporting p-values (subsection “Pre-stimulus oscillatory power in auditory cortex does not predict behavioural outcome in the auditory discrimination task”), using likelihood ratio tests and sometimes using Bayes factors (subsection “Visuo-occipital entropy does not predict behavioural outcome in the auditory discrimination task”, third paragraph). Please be consistent in your approach (e.g., report the Bayes factor instead of the &quot;all P &gt;.15&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this inconsistency. We report Bayes factors for all model comparisons in the updated version of the manuscript. Nevertheless, we want to highlight that we use P-values only in order to express the significance of model terms such as the effects of oscillatory power on behaviour referred to by the reviewers. Of note, these P-values derive from a Satterthwaite approximation and not from a model comparison based on log-likelihood tests. For transparency, we of course also report the estimated β values for linear models and Odds ratios (OR) for generalized linear models alongside their standard errors.</p><p>Although one could want to aim for even more consistency by reporting P-values for both, model comparisons and model terms, this endeavour is complicated by the requirements of log-likelihood tests. In order to compare two models using a log likelihood test, models must be nested and thus must differ in complexity by at least one term, resulting in one degree of freedom. Since this is not the case for most model comparisons performed as part of the current manuscript, we settled on Bayes factors as a stable, transitive, and interpretable metric.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Based on the outcome of the above analyses, and based on the additional points reviewers raised regarding the presentation/interpretation of the results (and the way these are currently embedded in the existing literature), portions of the paper will have to be rewritten to accommodate updated results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written parts of the Introduction, Results and Discussion in order to account for the reviewers’ suggestion and updated results. Additionally, all figures but Figure 1 were updated. To account for recent scientific findings, we have furthermore re-written parts of the Discussion section.
