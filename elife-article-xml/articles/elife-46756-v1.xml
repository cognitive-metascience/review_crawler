orchestrated by coordinated signals from adjacent epithelial and mesenchymal cells. In humans this process only occurs during embryogenesis and viable strategies to induce new HFs in adult skin are lacking. Here, we reveal that activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in adjacent epithelial and stromal cells induces new HFs in adult, unwounded dorsal mouse skin. Formation of de novo HFs recapitulated embryonic HF development, and mature follicles produced hair co-occurring with epithelial tumors. In contrast, Hh-pathway activation in epithelial or stromal cells alone resulted in tumor formation or stromal cell condensation respectively, without induction of new HFs. Provocatively, adjacent epithelial-stromal Hh-pathway activation induced de novo HFs also in hairless paw skin, divorced from confounding effects of pre-existing niche signals in haired skin. Altogether, cell-type-specific modulation of a single pathway is sufficient to reactivate embryonic programs in adult tissues, thereby inducing complex epithelial structures even without wounding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>We are born with all the hair follicles that we will ever have in our life. These structures are maintained by different types of cells (such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts) that work together to create hair. Follicles form in the embryo thanks to complex molecular signals, which include a molecular cascade known as the Hedgehog signaling pathway.</p><p>After birth however, these molecular signals are shut down to avoid conflicting messages – inappropriate activation of Hedgehog signaling in adult skin, for instance, leads to tumors. This means that our skin loses the ability to make new hair follicles, and if skin is severely damaged it cannot regrow hair or produce the associated sebaceous glands that keep skin moisturized.</p><p>Being able to create new hair follicles in adult skin would be both functionally and aesthetically beneficial for patients in need, for example, burn victims. Overall, it would also help to understand if and how it is possible to reactivate developmental programs after birth.</p><p>To investigate this question, Sun, Are et al. triggered Hedgehog signaling in the skin cells of genetically modified mice; this was done either in keratinocytes, in fibroblasts, or in both types of cells. The experiments showed that Hedgehog signaling could produce new hair follicles, but only when activated in keratinocytes and fibroblasts together. The process took several weeks, mirrored normal hair follicle development and resulted in new hair shafts. The follicles grew on both the back of mice, where hair normally occurs, and even in paw areas that are usually hairless.</p><p>Not unexpectedly the new hair follicles were accompanied with skin tumors. But, promisingly, treatment with Hedgehog-pathway inhibitor Vismodegib restricted tumor growth while keeping the new follicles intact. This suggests that future work on improving “when and where” Hedgehog signaling is activated may allow the formation of new follicles in adult skin with fewer adverse effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The number and pattern of hair follicles (HFs) are specified before birth in humans. In the mouse this is true for most body areas such as back skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Rosenfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Millar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paus and Cotsarelis, 1999</xref>). HF morphogenesis requires Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and becomes first morphologically visible at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo Celso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>). At this stage, the embryonic hair germ has formed, consisting of an epithelial placode and a dermal condensate, whose epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk is essential for further HF development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005</xref>).</p><p>De novo HF formation in adult skin has been observed in combination with wounding in rabbits, mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breedis, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kligman and Strauss, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), and in unwounded skin as a response to forced epithelial Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo Celso et al., 2004</xref>). Two decades after the initial discovery that Wnt/β-catenin-pathway activation results in ectopic HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 1998</xref>), it is still the only known approach to induce de novo HFs in adult unwounded skin. Accordingly, it remains a major clinical challenge to generate replacement skin with hair, urging the search for new ways to achieve HF formation in adult skin.</p><p>In Sonic hedgehog knock out (Shh-/-) mice, HF morphogenesis does not progress beyond the hair germ stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>). Notably, compared to wild type skin, Shh-/- hair germs have normal levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling but reduced Hh-target activation in both the placode and the dermal condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>). Despite the well-known importance of Hh signaling for HF morphogenesis during embryonic skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botchkarev and Paus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>) and in wound-induced HF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), little is known about its potential for de novo HF induction in adult unwounded skin.</p><p>Interestingly, already decades ago it has been observed that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) morphologically mimics HF development until the hair germ stage. BCC develops upon supra-physiological Hh-pathway activation in epithelial cells, with the most prevalent mutations in the inhibitory Hh-receptor gene <italic>Ptch1</italic>. Like HF formation, Hh-driven BCC is characterized by active Wnt/b-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), and early epithelial BCC buds express typical HF-lineage markers even if they don't originate from HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kasper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Youssef et al., 2012</xref>). Morphologically and molecularly, these early BCC buds are thus very similar to embryonic hair germs with one major difference: BCC buds lack a dermal condensate which serves as a focal point for dermal Hh signaling and is required for HF morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that HF development past the hair germ stage in BCC requires Hh signaling at increased levels in both epithelial and stromal cells. To address this hypothesis, we used mouse models to induce supra-physiological Hh signaling via <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion in the epithelium and stroma, which indeed led to the induction of new HFs in adult unwounded skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activated Hh signaling in <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing cells induced HF-like structures in touch domes</title><p>To test whether activation of epithelial and stromal Hedgehog signaling would result in HF formation, we focused on the touch domes (TDs), which are touch-receptive structures located within the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We reasoned that in adult unwounded skin, TDs were the most likely places to achieve experimentally induced de novo HFs because TDs are hotspots for BCC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>), which resembles HF development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Formation of hair follicle (HF)-like structures in touch domes (TDs) of the Gli1 mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Illustrative cartoon of HF and TD structures in wild type skin.

TD areas were identified by the presence of K8+ Merkel cells, and their palisading epithelial cell morphology. Tamoxifen was administered at 8 weeks of age, resulting in the constitutive activation of Hh signaling via homozygous inactivation of <italic>Ptch1</italic> and simultaneous Tomato-tracing of <italic>Lgr6-</italic> or <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Next, we analyzed the phenotypes of both Lgr6 and Gli1 mouse models 5 weeks post tamoxifen, a sufficiently long time to allow possible de novo HFs to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rendl et al., 2005</xref>). Homozygous <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation in <italic>Lgr6</italic>-expressing cells resulted as expected in BCC-like lesions in HFs, IFE and TDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, however, homozygous <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation in <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing cells resulted in addition to BCC-like lesions in HFs and TDs, in the formation of structures in TDs that resembled de novo HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These structures had the appearance of typical concentric anagen HF layers and a pigmented hair bulb or mature hair shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Importantly, by 9 weeks post tamoxifen, these HF-like structures occurred in every single Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> TD examined (27/27) but extremely rarely in TDs of Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (2/25; please also see Discussion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

A non-traced infundibulum, leaving a tracing gap between the HF and the IFE/TD, is thus characteristic for pre-existing HFs. In contrast, all de novo HFs displayed continuous Tomato-tracing from the de novo HF to its originating TD, including the infundibulum and all anagen HF lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We analyzed Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and control skin, tamoxifen treated at 8 weeks of age, and collected samples 10, 17, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35 and 36 days after tamoxifen treatment. These sampling time points enabled us to map the entire stereotypical time course of de novo HF formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In some TDs, the HF-placode stage could be already detected 10 days post tamoxifen administration, and was accompanied by the appearance of a dermal condensate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The dermal condensate and dermal papillae were delineated by denser Tomato-tracing of stromal cells compared to adjacent traced K5+ epithelial cells. Note the lack of continuous pre-existing HF-to-TD tracing at this early developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>), again supporting that the fully traced HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B–D</xref>) were newly formed and induced from traced TD cells.

As BCC growth merely depends on epithelial Hh-pathway activation, it was tempting to test whether homozygous inactivation of <italic>Ptch1</italic> exclusively in stromal cells would be sufficient to induce de novo HFs without tumor development. To that end, we generated the Col1a2 mouse model (Col1a2-Cre<sup>ER</sup>;R26<sup>tdTomato</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>, hereafter: Col1a2<sup>creER</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), which drives supra-physiological Hh signaling in the stromal compartment only, via the collagen type I alpha two chain promoter. Non-tamoxifen controls (Col1a2<sup>creER</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) showed some tracing in the skin stroma, which however did not result in an adverse skin phenotype except for earlier anagen entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Administration of tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age resulted in substantial Tomato-tracing that was restricted to the stromal skin compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), and importantly, the stromal cells of the TD were also traced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Homozygous <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation in <italic>Col1a2</italic>-expressing cells resulted in increased stromal cell density in TDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), but did not result in de novo HF formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>), nor did stromal cells stain positive for SDC1 even 9 weeks after tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

A recent study found that it is possible to induce HFs even in small wounds upon supra-physiological Hh-pathway activation in the wound stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2018</xref>). This report and our present study recognize modulation of Hh signaling as a new approach to induce de novo HFs in adult skin, and define activation in the stromal skin compartment as critical. As wounding of skin initiates a major reorganization of the epithelial and mesenchymal tissue including the activation and differentiation of a large number of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arwert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joost et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schäfer and Werner, 2008</xref>), and may even provide an embryonic-like environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), the precise (e.g. minimal) molecular signals that are required for HF induction in adult skin remain elusive. Here we revealed that in unwounded skin, experimentally elevated Hh signaling in epithelial and adjacent stromal cells was sufficient to induce de novo HFs, extending our understanding of how Hh signaling can be modulated to induce HFs in adult skin.</p><p>To achieve efficient de novo HF induction in unwounded skin, supra-physiological Hh signaling in both compartments, the epithelium and stroma, was necessary. Normal TD maintenance also requires active and balanced Hh signaling in adjacent epithelial and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Increased Hh-signaling levels in TD epithelial cells result in BCC-like tumors, even though stromal cells have active (albeit physiological) Hh signaling. Only in extremely rare cases (twice) did we detect a de novo HF-like structure in TDs of Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice based on morphology (as lineage tracing in these mice cannot provide information on de novo HF formation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly therefore, to effectively induce de novo HFs in TDs, high levels of Hh/Gli signaling in both compartments were necessary (Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>). This requirement of Hh-signal activation at precise levels and in the right compartments is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that β-catenin-induced de novo HF formation was not only dependent on stromal Hh signaling, but also required two intact <italic>Smo</italic> alleles (for a maximal Hh-pathway activation) to enable efficient de novo HF induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lichtenberger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown more than twenty years ago that the activation of epithelial β-catenin in mouse skin can induce new HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo Celso et al., 2004</xref>), and more recently that activation of epithelial Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases de novo HF formation within wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2007</xref>). However, Wnt signaling has to be blocked in dermal fibroblasts to allow de novo HF induction during wound regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>). It is known that early stage BCCs resemble early stages of HF development and both are dependent on Wnt- and Hh-pathway activation, with the major morphological difference that BCC lacks a dermal condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Learning from abrogated embryonic HF development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>) led us to hypothesize that simultaneously activating supra-physiological Hh signaling in the stroma underneath developing BCC may enable de novo HFs. Indeed, by coordinating the activation of Hh/Gli signaling (cell type specific and high levels) we were able to induce de novo HFs by ‘redirecting’ some of the BCC buds to HF formation without the need of wounding. Nevertheless, this induction occurred in the presence of oncogenic signal activation (i.e. presence of a tumor environment or tumor-like cellular status of Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> HF-inducing epithelial cells) which may to some extent mimic a wounding situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dvorak, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The molecular and cellular similarities of tumorigenesis and wound healing are still unfolding, yet whenever de novo HFs were to be found, either oncogenic signaling or a wound environment was involved. This supports the long-standing recognition of the similarity between tumor and wound healing signaling (tumors as ‘wounds that do not heal’) – and raises the key question of what exactly is the relationship between tumorigenesis and signals inducing de novo HF formation? It may indeed be the case that in order to overcome inhibitory signals, de novo HF morphogenesis in adult skin requires such major activating signals provided by oncogenesis or wounding. Interestingly however, previous literature suggests that only initial HF placode and/or dermal condensate formation may require such strong signals whereas progression to a mature HF does not require continued tumorigenic or wound signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo Celso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silva-Vargas et al., 2005</xref>). For example, HF tumors require continuous Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas transient activation of this pathway is sufficient to induce de novo HFs in adult mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo Celso et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, intra vital imaging from Wnt/β-catenin induced tumor outgrowths demonstrated that non-mutant cells, remaining from regressed outgrowths, could develop into new functional HFs. Most interestingly, tumor outgrowth depended on the presence of mutated cells, however the new appendages were formed from wild type cells facilitated by their (altered) niche environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these are promising examples that de novo HF induction without accompanied tumor growth in unwounded adult skin may in principle be possible, if the right signals at the right time and restricted period, and in the right compartments were provided. Here, we spatiotemporally defined such productive and specific molecular signals.</p><p>Lastly, and importantly, we exploited the hairless paw plantar skin to examine de novo HF morphogenesis in the absence of confounding signals from pre-existing HFs or TDs. Strikingly, we observed numerous de novo HFs throughout this nominally hairless skin in Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Crucially, nearly all these de novo HFs developed without attendant BCC-like lesions suggesting that de novo HF morphogenesis may indeed be successfully initiated without a tumor microenvironment; while the vismodegib experiment suggests persistence of such structures when the tumor microenvironment regresses in dorsal skin. Examining these two divergent tissues in molecular detail, one permissive (dorsal) and one suppressive (paw) to dual BCC and HF induction, could therefore be a next step of unraveling the complexity of how these heterogeneous signals interact.</p><p>In sum, molecular strategies for the induction of complex epithelial structures in the adult remain a major challenge in regenerative medicine. Our study demonstrates that cell-type specific modulation of a single pathway was sufficient to induce complex epithelial structures in the adult body, a discovery aiding our understanding of adult tissue biology and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Lgr6-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snippert et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs stock no: 016934 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:016934">IMSR_JAX:016934</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Received from H Clevers</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Gli1-LacZ</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs stock no: 008211 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008211">IMSR_JAX:008211</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Received from F Aberger</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Gli1-CreERT2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Joyner, 2004</xref></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs stock no: 007913 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007913">IMSR_JAX:007913</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Received from F Aberger</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Col1a2-CreER</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs stock no: 029567 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:029567">IMSR_JAX:029567</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Received from B Crombrugghe</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">R26-tdTomato</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madisen et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs stock no: 007908 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007908">IMSR_JAX:007908</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Obtained from Jackson Laboratory</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ptch1neo(fl)Ex2(fl)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kasper et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Received from S.

Used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>Imaging was performed using a Leica (color bright-field images), LSM710-NLO confocal microscope (Zeiss) or Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Image analysis was performed using NIS-Elements software (Nikon), Zen 2009 software (Zeiss), or ImageJ, and images were occasionally optimized for brightness, contrast, and color balance. RNA-FISH images are presented as maximum intensity projections covering 6 μm of depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurements and quantitative image analysis of de novo hair follicles</title><p>Measurements of de novo and pre-existing Zig-zag HFs were performed in samples from Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice taken 9 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Image J was used to analyze the images.</p><p>(1) Quantification of de novo HFs in touch domes. Touch domes were identified via Tomato-tracing and the presence of Merkel cells (K8+). Subsequently, all HFs and hair shafts were visualized with bright field images. Only telogen stage hairs that were fully visible from the bulge to the IFE opening were selected and used to measure their length (i.e. the distance from the bottom/hair club of the telogen hair shaft to the opening of the follicle in the IFE), and width (which was measured where the hair shaft meets the IFE); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. In total, de novo HFs were observed in all of the 27 analyzed touch domes (on average 2.6 de novo HFs per touch dome) in three different mice, and 34 hair shafts from 20 touch domes qualified for measurements. As controls, pre-existing Zig-zag hairs of Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> (i.e. the same samples as for de novo HF measurements; n = 3 mice; 314 hairs in total) and Zig-zag hairs of Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> control mice lacking BCC and de novo HFs (n = 3 mice; 437 hairs in total) were analyzed in the same way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To statistically estimate whether the putative de novo HFs could merely represent small Zig-zag hairs, a bootstrapping approach was used: a random sample corresponding to the number of observed de novo HFs (n = 34) was taken from the distribution of observed Zig-zag hairs (n = 751) for 10.000.000 times, and the probability that this random sample is equal to or smaller in length and width than the de novo HFs was subsequently calculated.</p><p>(2) Quantification of de novo hairs in isthmus areas of pre-existing HFs. Quantification of de novo hairs in the isthmus area of HFs (note that we were not able to tell Zig-zag/Awl/Au HFs apart and collectively call them Zig-zag) was performed in samples from Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>, Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup>, Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice (n = 3 for each genotype) taken 9 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. De novo hairs were identified by their relatively smaller size, growing pattern and/or there being more than three hairs in a pre-existing HF. De novo hairs growing from the isthmus area were only observed in the Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with a total of 16 identified de novo hairs in 668 Zig-zag HFs. Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> (335 HFs), Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> (207 HFs) and Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;R26<sup>Tom</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> (83 HFs) mice showed no de novo hairs from the isthmus area.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Beate Lichtenberger and Rune Toftgård for valuable discussions and feedback on the manuscript, Sunny Wong and Scott Atwood for sharing important scientific insights, Maryam Saghafian for her help with mouse work, Mayumi Ito and Chae Ho Lim for their advice to perform the alkaline phosphatase assay, Maria Hölzl for embryonic mouse skin sections, Alexandra Joyner for sharing the Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup> and Gli1<sup>LacZ</sup> mice, Hans Clevers for sharing the Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup> mice, and Benoit de Crombrugghe for sharing the Col1a2<sup>creER</sup> mice.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sun et al. use inducible reporter mice to show that localized Hedgehog signaling can induce de novo hair follicle formation in adult mice. They show that diffuse Hedgehog activation via loss of Ptch1 in the epidermis (Lgr6-CreERT2) or the dermis (Col1a2-CreER) does not induce de novo hair follicle formation, but a localized source of Hedgehog activation via loss of Ptch1 at the touch dome (Gli1-CreERT2) does. The hair follicles show at least some of the necessary layers of a fully formed structure such as the inner root sheath (Krt71) and outer root sheath (Krt6), and seem to be fully functional as they produce hair.

The experiments and respective outcomes are described in detail here below and in response to comments 4 and 5.</p><p>1) To directly address point 3, we crossed Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> female with Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> male mice (with a breeding probability of 1:8; Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> males crossed with Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> females did not result in viable litters), which gave in total four quadruple transgenic mice (Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/ Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>). We treated these four mice and littermate controls at postnatal week 8 (P8w) topically with 4-OH tamoxifen (TAM), and collected samples at time points post TAM treatment where we certainly would find small de novo HF buds or de novo HFs in the touch domes of Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. I.e. we collected dorsal skin (biopsies or entire back skin) 17 days and 31-49 days post TAM. At 17 days post TAM we observed many epithelial buds, predominantly located in the upper part of the infundibulum connecting to the IFE and occasionally in the IFE (n = 4 mice; biopsies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These epithelial buds were most often surrounded with dermal cells that expressed SDC1, similar to the dermal condensate cells in de novo HF-forming Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Based on this observation we expected to find plenty of de novo HFs from the IFE/infundibulum area in 31-49 post TAM skin of the same mice, which however was not the case. Either not at all (n = 2 mice) or very rarely (n = 2 mice; 1 and 2 hair shafts, respectively), we observed a small hair shaft in the IFE/infundibulum area that was likely formed de novo based on its morphology, size and thickness. However, based on HF/bulge cell morphology these hair shafts seemed not properly anchored or even soon to be shed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). In the touch domes of Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, such HFs “without proper bulge anchoring” were never observed. As a control for de novo HF formation, we also analyzed the touch domes of the Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and indeed found in every mouse a low number of touch domes that contained de novo HFs or hair shafts (based on morphology, size and thickness) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1D</xref>). I.e. in touch domes de novo HFs likely formed but with much lower efficiency than in Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</p><p>In this regard, it is important to note that <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation in the skin stroma (i.e. in Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) leads shortly after TAM injection (i.p.) to an overall bad body condition of malnutrition due to an intestinal phenotype, which is less severe but still present with topical treatment (described in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript). Unfortunately, the quadruple transgenic Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> developed a more severe phenotype of malnutrition than Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>, which could of course negatively impact de novo HF development.</p><p>In sum, Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> had numerous de novo HF-like buds at the initial time point, however the occurrence of de novo HF/hair shafts at later time points was very low or not present. As Lgr6<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice did not contain a Tomato lineage tracing allele, an unequivocal confirmation that these extremely rare HFs/hair shafts were indeed newly formed was not possible, thus these experiments are not included in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Formation of HF-like structures in touch domes of the Lgr6/Col1a2 mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>;Col1a2<sup>creER</sup>;Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were treated with Tamoxifen (TAM) at 8 weeks of age and dorsal skin was analyzed post TAM as indicated in the figure panels.

Thus we probed for <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in the plantar skin using Gli1-LacZ reporter mice. We consistently found small <italic>Gli1</italic>-ΒGAL expressing clusters of epithelial and adjacent stromal cells in the plantar skin (Figure 9B, Figure 9—figure supplement 1A), which we confirmed with short-term lineage tracing in Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup> mice (TAM at P8w; sample collection 7 days later) (Figure 9C, Figure 9—figure supplement 1B). Testing for de novo HF induction, we analyzed the hindpaws of Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and control littermates (Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup>) using the same treatment scheme and sample collection times as for dorsal skin (TAM at P8w; sample collection 5 and 9 weeks post TAM). Indeed, we found numerous de novo HFs with hair shafts in the normally hairless region. These HFs were fully Tomato-lineage traced and showed normal inner-layer differentiation based on morphology and K6 staining (Figures 9D-E, Figure 9—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Taken together, these experiments in paw skin demonstrate that combined epithelial and stromal Hh-pathway activation can induce de novo HFs from epidermis of hairless skin, i.e. outside of touch dome niches.

Although we observed de novo HFs in every touch dome (i.e. 100%), we also observed at very low frequency in the HF isthmus area early HF buds and de novo HFs. As shown in point 5 below, we have now added representative images and quantification of de novo HFs in the HF isthmus area, which support that de novo HFs can also form outside touch dome areas in dorsal skin.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in mice with Hh-pathway activation in the stroma (Col1a2<sup>CreER</sup>/ R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>), dermal cell condensations can emerge next to the HF infundibulum as well as under the normal IFE (Figure 6G, Figure 6—figure supplement 2B), which is in support of dermal condensate formation not being restricted to the touch dome areas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1D, Gli1 is positive in follicular epithelium and surrounding stromal cells of guard hairs.

Unfortunately, it was not possible (as it was for de novo HFs in the touch dome) to unequivocally determine de novo HFs through lineage tracing of the infundibulum because these isthmus-associated de novo HFs seem to directly merge into the isthmus area of pre-existing HFs. However, we observed HFs in the isthmus areas with hair shafts that were thinner and often had a bent shape, which is very similar to touch dome derived de novo HFs (e.g. Figure 1I). In addition, dorsal mouse skin that is harvested at postnatal week 17 usually contains HFs with 3 hair shafts (3 rounds of anagen); however, HFs containing one of these thinner hair shafts often had in total four hair shafts (dependent on the tissue cut of 60 micrometer thickness, not all club hairs/hair shafts are present in the same section) which is an additional indication for the presence of a newly formed HF. Importantly, neither HFs with four hair shafts nor HFs with morphological de novo appearance have been observed in phenotypically normal control skin (Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup>) or in skin with HF tumors (Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>).</p><p>We quantified the frequency of de novo HFs in large skin panoramas from Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>, Gli1<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup>, Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/wt</sup> and Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (Figure 8D) and found that approx. 2% of HFs formed isthmus-associated de novo HFs. de novo HF formation was not associated with one specific hair type (e.g. guard), which is in line with the occurrence of adjacent epithelial and stromal GLI1+ cells also in the isthmus of zig-zag HFs (Figure 8A-B). Reassuringly, and as expected, we did not observe de novo HFs in skin of Lgr6<sup>creERT2</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, which lack stromal cells with high Hh signaling in the HF isthmus (<italic>Lgr6</italic> is not expressed in stromal cells of the HF isthmus; Füllgrabe et al., 2015).</p><p>Taken together, these results support that cells in the isthmus area (i.e. outside of touch dome niches) are competent to induce de novo HFs when high levels of Hh signaling (via Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) co-occur in the epithelium and adjacent stroma.

We administered tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. Ten days post tamoxifen we observe first de novo HF buds, 5 weeks post tamoxifen de novo HFs are in anagen (Figure 1I, Figure 2A), and 9 weeks post tamoxifen almost all de novo HFs are in telogen (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These de novo HFs have one hair shaft as this is their first telogen after morphogenesis. In the revised manuscript, we have now added additional text to better clarify this point (subsection “Characterization of de novo hair follicles in touch domes”) and added Figure 2—figure supplement 2better depicting de novo HFs in telogen 9 weeks post tamoxifen.</p><p>That de novo HFs can enter catagen/telogen despite constitutive Hh-pathway activation is not unexpected.

With <italic>Gli1</italic> expression being among the most reliable direct target genes for active Hh signaling, Brownell et al. show that Hh signaling is active during catagen as well as in the telogen HF. Moreover, and most relevant for our study, HFs with continuous Hh-pathway activation via <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation can precede into catagen and telogen, which was shown in Lgr5<sup>creERT2</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice where HFs entered catagen and proceeded into telogen (Kasper et al., 2011; Figure 4B, C and Supplementary Figure 6). In the follow up experiments, where Lgr5<sup>creERT2</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were tamoxifen treated at P20 and taken 13 weeks later, dorsal skin contained HFs with 3 hair shafts (instead of 1 hair shaft at P20), signifying that HFs underwent several hair growth cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>H&amp;E stained dorsal skin of Lgr5<sup>creERT2</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, treated with tamoxifen at P20.</title><p>Samples were taken at P16w, when HFs normally have produced 3 hair shafts (i.e. morphogenesis and 2 times anagen).

Importantly, this Wnt/β-catenin-pathway induced ectopic HF development is dependent on an active Hh-signaling pathway. Lichtenberger et al. induced ectopic HF formation using K14DNb-cateninER mice. Deletion of a single <italic>Smo</italic> allele in K14DNb-cateninER mice via <italic>Dermo1Cre</italic> (K14DNb-cateninER/Dermo<sup>Cre</sup>/Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup>) significantly reduced ectopic HF formation, and homozygous <italic>Smo</italic> deletion via Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup> (K14DNb-cateninER/Pdgfra<sup>CreER</sup>/Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup>) inhibited ectopic HF formation (Lichtenberger et al., 2016).</p><p>In wild type mice,de novo HF formation occurs in the center of large wounds (Ito et al., 2007). This wound-induced HF neogenesis (WIHN) is accompanied by activation of Hh/Gli signaling in the epidermal placodes and dermal condensates (Lim et al., 2018). Lim et al. furthermore demonstrated that both epithelial SHH and dermal SMO expression are necessary for WIHN as K14<sup>creER</sup>/Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Pdgfra<sup>creER</sup>/Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, respectively, do not develop WIHN.</p><p>In the canonical Hh-pathway signaling cascade, SHH is upstream of PTCH (PTCH is the receptor for SHH) and SMO is downstream of PTCH (SMO is activated upon PTCH inhibition). Thus, the experiments of Lim et al. and Lichtenberger et al. convincingly demonstrate that for de novo HF formation active Hh/Gli-signaling is necessary. I.e. activation of the Hh-pathway via SHH/PTCH, without it’s downstream signaling component SMO that mediates Hh-pathway activation via GLI1/2 transcription factors, would not be sufficient for de novo HF formation.</p><p>In our manuscript, we have now added RNA-FISH staining for <italic>Gli1</italic>, which is a reliable readout for active Hh-signaling. These stainings demonstrate that de novo HF buds and established HFs within the TD express high levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA (i.e. have active Hh/Gli-signaling). Moreover, <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA-FISH combined with antibody staining for Tomato-lineage tracing also shows that Tomato-tracing (cells with <italic>Ptch1</italic> deletion) and <italic>Gli1</italic> expression are highly correlated (Figure 4F-G, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D).</p><p>Taken together, in the revised manuscript we added <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA-FISH staining of de novo HFs, as well as wild-type touch domes and wild-type-embryonic HF placodes/hair germs (Figure 4D-G, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The results are described on in the subsection “De novo HF formation recapitulates embryonic HF development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can the hair follicles persist without Hedgehog signaling?</p><p>Use of Smo inhibitors such as vismodegib can be helpful to answer these questions by administering the drug after tamoxifen injection or after the hair follicle has already formed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the light of the reviewers comment, we administered vismodegib after the de novo HFs in touch domes had already formed. I.e. the aim of this experiment was to reveal if established de novo HFs would persist or would diminish as the BCC-tumor area does. It has been shown previously that BCC-like lesions in dorsal skin of Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> shrink dramatically upon vismodegib treatment within 7 days (Eberl et al., 2018).</p><p>We treated Gli1<sup>creER</sup>/R26<sup>Tom</sup>/Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with tamoxifen at 8 weeks. Five to seven weeks after tamoxifen treatment when de novo HFs are clearly established in the touch domes, we took a dorsal biopsy prior vismodegib treatment (i.e. untreated biopsy), and then treated the mice with vismodegib for seven days for second sample collection (i.e. 7 days Vismodegib sample). Using the optimized treatment scheme from Eberl et al., 2018 we administered 50mg/kg vismodegib i.p. once a day, for seven days (n = 4 mice) (see experimental scheme in Figure 5A).</p><p>Reassuringly, in pre-existing HFs we found considerable reduction of tumor growth as well as complete absence of Ki67 staining when comparing the untreated biopsies with 7-day vismodegib treated samples of the same mice. This reduction in tumor size demonstrated that vismodegib treatment worked well (Figure 5B-C). In touch domes, the tumor areas also dramatically diminished, however the de novo HFs persisted (Figure 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These experiments confirmed that de novo HFs indeed represent hair follicles that are independent of tumor structures as they persist upon vismodegib treatment when the surrounding BCC-growth areas are nearly gone.</p><p>Taken together, we added these new experiments to the revised manuscript (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and updated the manuscript text accordingly (subsection “De novo HFs persist while BCC-like tumors diminish upon vismodegib treatment”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
