tethering the plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although Kv2.1 clustering at neuronal ER-PM junctions (EPJs) is tightly regulated and highly conserved, its function remains unclear. By identifying and evaluating proteins in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1-containing EPJs, we discovered that a significant role of Kv2.1 at EPJs is to promote the clustering and functional coupling of PM L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) to ryanodine receptor (RyR) ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels. Kv2.1 clustering also unexpectedly enhanced LTCC opening at polarized membrane potentials. This enabled Kv2.1-LTCC-RyR triads to generate localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks) independently of action potentials. Together, these findings uncover a novel mode of LTCC regulation and establish a unique mechanism whereby Kv2.1-associated EPJs provide a molecular platform for localized somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in mammalian brain neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane contact sites</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS101648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL144071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>L Fernando</given-names></name><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirmiz</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS108519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierra</surname><given-names>Nicholas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS099714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A potassium channel, as a nonconducting function, organizes compartmentalized neuronal calcium signaling microdomains via structural and functional coupling of plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The members of the Kv2 family of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, are among the most abundant and widely expressed K<sup>+</sup> channels in mammalian brain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Trimmer, 2015</xref>). Kv2 channels are present in high-density clusters localized to neuronal somata, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Trimmer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Du et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>). In hippocampal and cortical neurons, Kv2 channels conduct most of the delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murakoshi and Trimmer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Du et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guan et al., 2007</xref>). Detailed studies have revealed the significant influence of neuronal Kv2.1-mediated currents on action potential duration and repetitive firing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Du et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>, etc.). In addition to its important role in modulating intrinsic electrical activity, Kv2.1 serves a non-canonical structural (<italic>i.e.</italic>, nonconducting) function in tethering the plasma membrane (PM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form ER-PM junctions (EPJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirmiz et al., 2018b</xref>). Although Kv2.1 clustering at EPJs is tightly regulated and independent of K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirmiz et al., 2018b</xref>), the physiological impact of concentrating this Kv channel at an EPJ is not known.</p><p>In brain neurons, EPJs occupy approximately 10% of the PM surface area, predominantly within the soma and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). By electron microscopy, the ER at many neuronal EPJs appears as a micron-diameter, flattened vesicle less than 10 nm from the PM, a structure also called a âsubsurface cisternâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosenbluth, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tao-Cheng, 2018</xref>). While the specific functions of neuronal subsurface cisterns remain unclear, in most eukaryotic cells, EPJs represent domains specialized for maintenance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, lipid, and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) are prominently expressed in neurons throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catterall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>). Their important role in brain is underscored by studies showing genetic variation in the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene encoding Cav1.2, the major voltage-sensing and pore forming Î±1 subunit expressed in brain, is associated with neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ferreira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozarth et al., 2018</xref>). Given their diverse and crucial roles in neuronal function, LTCCs are subjected to multimodal regulation to ensure their activity is coupled to overall cellular state, especially as related to intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lipscombe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hofmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Neely and Hidalgo, 2014</xref>). In both neurons and non-neuronal cells, Cav1.2-containing LTCCs are clustered at specific sites on the PM where they participate in supramolecular protein complexes that couple LTCC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rougier and Abriel, 2016</xref>). In neurons, LTCCs in dendritic spines participate in a complex whose output contributes to short- and long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Da Silva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Stanika et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Wiera et al., 2017</xref>). Neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells also have substantial LTCC populations in the soma and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Westenbroek et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tippens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrout and Isokawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kramer et al., 2012</xref>) representing the âaspinyâ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Spruston and McBain, 2007</xref>) of these neurons. Many current models of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of transcription factors posit that somatic LTCCs uniquely contribute to transcription factor activation by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx within specialized and compartmentalized signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matamales, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wheeler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wild et al., 2019</xref>). However, relatively little research has focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatial and functional compartmentalization of the prominent somatic population of LTCCs compared to those on dendrites and at synapses.</p><p>Neuronal somata lack PM compartments analogous to dendritic spines, and fundamental questions remain as to how discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events can occur in the absence of such compartmentalization. In many non-neuronal cells, LTCCs are clustered at EPJs that represent specialized microdomains for LTCC-dependent and -independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Helle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lam and Galione, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Henne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dickson, 2017</xref>). For example, Cav1.2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is spatially and functionally coupled to ER ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels at EPJs constituting the cardiomyocyte junctional dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shuja and Colecraft, 2018</xref>). Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events (spreadingÂ &lt;2 Âµm from the point of origin) called Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks arise from clusters of RyRs located in the ER of EPJs and are triggered <italic>via</italic> local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR), a feed-forward phenomenon in which cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to RyRs triggers their opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Lederer, 2008</xref>). As indicated above, EPJs are abundant on neuronal somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), and neuronal somata have prominent LTCC- and RyR-mediated CICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Friel and Tsien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Isokawa and Alger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrout and Isokawa, 2009</xref>). Localized RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events occur in the somata and proximal dendrites of cultured and acute slice preparations of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Koizumi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrout and Isokawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Manita and Ross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>), but a specific molecular structure underlying these events has not been described.</p><p>Given the well-characterized spatial and functional coupling of LTCCs and RyRs at EPJs in myocytes and previous observations of somatodendritic clustering of the LTCC Cav1.2 in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Westenbroek et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hell et al., 1993</xref>), our finding that Kv2.1 clusters are often juxtaposed to RyRs previously led us to hypothesize that Kv2.1 channels cluster with LTCCs to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>âmicro-signaling domainsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonucci et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Misonou et al., 2005a</xref>). More recently, heterologously expressed Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 were found to colocalize in dissociated cultured hippocampal neurons (CHNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fox et al., 2015</xref>). However, the spatial association of Kv2.1 with endogenous LTCCs and RyRs in brain neurons has not been determined. Here, we examined the subcellular distribution of Kv2.1, LTCCs, and RyRs in hippocampal neurons and used an unbiased proteomic analysis of brain tissue to identify LTCCs and RyRs as proteins in close spatial proximity to clustered Kv2.1. Using heterologous cells and CHNs, we investigated the impact of Kv2.1 clustering on the spatial coupling and functional properties of LTCCs and RyRs. We also defined how the localization and function of LTCCs and RyRs are affected by the loss of Kv2.1 in mouse CHNs lacking Kv2.1. Together, our findings establish a functional interaction between Kv2.1, LTCCs, and RyRs, reveal a significant influence of Kv2.1 in shaping neuronal LTCC activity, and support a critical role for Kv2.1 in the generation of somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kv2.1 channels spatially associate with LTCCs and RyRs in brain neurons</title><p>In mature CHNs, endogenous Cav1.2 channels are distributed to PM-localized clusters on the soma and proximal dendrites, distinct from their punctate localization in the more distal postsynaptic compartments that also contain the scaffolding protein PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Biase et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the spatial relationship between somatic Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 channels, we examined rat CHNs immunolabeled for Kv2.1 and Cav1.2, and also for Kv4.2 channels, which exhibit more uniform PM localization in CHNs than either Kv2.1 or Cav1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shibata et al., 2003</xref>). In CHNs expressing detectable levels of all three immunolabeling signals, presumed to be pyramidal neurons based on their morphological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonucci et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Obermair et al., 2003</xref>), we observed clusters of Kv2.1 that were spatially associated with smaller Cav1.2 clusters but not Kv4.2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Triple immunolabeling for Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs demonstrated that many of the clusters of spatially associated Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 channels were colocalized with RyRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also observed more prominent spatial overlap of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyR immunolabeling in a subset of CHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Analysis of Pearsonâs Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of Cav1.2 and either Kv2.1 or Kv4.2 pixel intensity demonstrated a greater spatial correlation between Cav1.2 and Kv2.1 immunolabeling than that of Cav1.2 and Kv4.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While the absolute PCC values indicate that the majority of somatic Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 immunolabeling did not co-occur within the same pixels, our data suggested that a subset Cav1.2 channels could be found in close proximity (if not overlapping) with Kv2.1. In support of a spatial association between Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs, we determined that there was a positive correlation between the PCC of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2, and the PCC of Cav1.2 and RyRs within the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that increased association between Cav1.2 and Kv2.1 was also associated with greater spatial coupling ofÂ Cav1.2Â to RyRs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49953.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kv2.1 reversibly associates with Cav1.2 and RyRs in cultured hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single optical section image of a rat CHN immunolabeled for PSD-95, Cav1.2, and MAP2 (scale bar: 20 Î¼m).

These images revealed that Kv2.1 clusters often encompassed smaller clusters of Cav1.2 as well Cav1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâH</xref>). For these super-resolution images, we performed an object-based analysis (rather than a pixel intensity correlation-based measurement such as PCC) to determine whether the localization of somatic Kv2.1 and LTCCs were co-dependent. The approach we used relied on evaluation of the nearest-neighbor distances (NND) of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 or Cav1.3 cluster centroids and a comparison of these values to the predicted NNDs if Kv2.1 and LTCCs were randomly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shivanandan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Helmuth et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the spatial distributions of somatic Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 puncta significantly correlated (p&lt;0.001 versus the null hypothesis that the spatial distributions of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 puncta were independent) and could not be recapitulated in images in which their relative positions had been iteratively randomized in silico. We also observed similar expression patterns of endogenous Cav1.3 and RyRs in CHNs, with Cav1.3 clusters spatially associated with RyR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), in agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sahu et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these data suggested a spatial correlation between Kv2.1 and LTCCs.</p><p>We next evaluated how phosphorylation-dependent bidirectional changes in Kv2.1 clustering influenced the localization of somatic Cav1.2 and RyRs in rat CHNs. One stimulus that results in dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 and dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters in CHNs is acute elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to treatment with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Misonou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Misonou et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, suppression of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) causes an increase in Kv2.1 phosphorylation and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cerda and Trimmer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Romer et al., 2019</xref>). We found that glutamate stimulation of CHNs not only reduced Kv2.1 clustering, but also significantly decreased the colocalization between Cav1.2 and RyRs, decreased the size of somatic RyR clusters, and increased the distance between somatic Cav1.2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1JâN</xref>). Conversely, suppression of neuronal excitability with TTX produced an effect opposite of glutamate treatment, producing increased spatial coupling between RyRs and Cav1.2, and increasing the size of individual RyR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1JâN</xref>). We also found that glutamate stimulation reduced the number of Cav1.2 clusters present on the PM, consistent with previous observations that acute Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx results in endocytosis of Cav1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these data show that bidirectional changes in Kv2.1 clustering are coupled to corresponding changes in the spatial distributions of Cav1.2 and RyRs on CHN somata.</p><p>We next assessed the localization of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs in brain sections. Previous immunohistochemical analyses showed that in hippocampal neurons, Cav1.2 localizes to distinct clusters on somata and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Westenbroek et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hell et al., 1993</xref>), a spatial pattern similar to that of Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Trimmer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Scannevin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kirizs et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to previous observations, in low magnification images of mouse and rat hippocampus, we observed Cav1.2 immunolabeling concentrated in CA1 neuron somata, with increasing labeling in area CA2/CA3 neurons, and greatest labeling in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâE</xref>). In higher magnification confocal images of DG granule cell bodies in rat hippocampus, we found that Kv2.1 clusters tended to colocalize with Cav1.2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We performed cell surface immunolabeling of intact cells coexpressing Kv2.1 and a Cav1.2 construct possessing an extracellular hemagglutinin epitope tag [Cav1.2-HA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Obermair et al., 2004</xref>). Following cell surface immunolabeling of Cav1.2-HA channels, cells were permeabilized and immunolabeled for total Cav1.2-HA, then imaged by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar to cells expressing fluorescently tagged channels, we found that cell surface Cav1.2-HA also co-clustered with Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We also determined that cell surface Cav1.2-HA immunolabeling corresponded to approximately 70% of the total Cav1.2 visible in the TIRF field regardless of Kv2.1 coexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that Kv2.1 did not alter the steady-state partitioning of Cav1.2 between PM and intracellular pools. Importantly, similar to results obtained evaluating total Cav1.2, cell surface Cav1.2-HA cluster size was also larger in the presence of Kv2.1, indicating recruitment of cell surface Cav1.2 into larger clusters induced by Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We also found that coexpression with the related but distinct Kv1.5 channel did not impact the clustering of cell surface Cav1.2 channels as did coexpression with Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As another measure of the impact of Kv2.1 expression on the organization of PM Cav1.2, we assessed the coefficient of variation (CV: SD/mean) of Cav1.2-HA immunolabeling intensity. The CV is used as a measure of non-uniformity of subcellular distribution, with clustered distributions having high CV values and uniform or diffuse signals having low CV values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirmiz et al., 2018b</xref>).

We also found that Kv2.2 channels similarly recruited Cav1.2 into large clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). We also determined that the localization of GFP-tagged Cav1.3 was similarly altered upon coexpression with Kv2.1 or Kv2.2, implying a common mechanism for co-clustering of these two neuronal LTCCs with Kv2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>).

This observation suggests that the Kv2.1-mediated spatial reorganization of LTCCs is specific and related to their association with Kv2.1 suggested by our Kv2.1 IP experiments, a notion also supported by the absence of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels inÂ these IPÂ experiments.

By using these Kv2.1 isoforms, we determined that there was an interplay between both Kv2.1 K<sup>+</sup> conductance and clustering on Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks reconstituted in HEK293T cells. Expression of Kv2.1 channels capable of clustered EPJ formation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Kv2.1<sub>WT</sub> and Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub>) increased spark frequency, whereas non-clustering Kv2.1<sub>S586A</sub> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

We hypothesize that the high input resistance of HEK293T cells relative to CHNs, the latter of which possess numerous endogenous ionic conductances (including native Kv2.1 channels), enabled K<sup>+</sup> conductance through Kv2.1<sub>WT</sub> and Kv2.1<sub>S586A</sub> to promote <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization in HEK293T cells, maintaining a greater electrochemical driving force for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and also promoting recovery of Cav1.2 channels from voltage-dependent inactivation.

As physical interactions between adjacent LTCCs promote enhanced LTCC activity (reducing the membrane voltage threshold for channel opening and elevating channel open probability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that this functional property of Cav1.2 might be enhanced by Kv2.1-induced clustering. To test this possibility, we obtained whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from HEK293T cells transfected with Cav1.2 and the clustered but non-K<sup>+</sup> conducting Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub> point mutant, which allowed us to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) in the absence of the very large outward K<sup>+</sup> currents produced by Kv2.1<sub>WT</sub>.

However, we did observe a greater reduction in the fraction of peak current remaining after 250 ms of depolarization (<italic>r</italic><sub>250</sub>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Cav1.2 in the presence of Kv2.1.

Thus, the enhancement of Cav1.2 activity observed in the presence of Kv2.1 could be caused by an effect on any one or more of these parameters. To better understand the underlying mechanism, we acquired gating and ionic tail currents from the same cell. Depolarization-induced voltage sensor movement in activating voltage-gated channels produces a gating current (Q<sub>on</sub>) that is proportional to the number of channels present in the PM (<italic>n</italic>). Repolarization-induced ionic tail currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub>) reveal overall channel activity (<italic>I</italic>). Changes in one or both can be used to infer whether it is â<italic>n</italic>â versus some combination of â<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>â and/or â<italic>iâ</italic> that yield changes in total channel activity. We used nitrendipine, a DHP LTCC gating inhibitor, to pharmacologically isolate Cav1.2 Q<sub>on</sub> when the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was stepped to the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> reversal potential, and to measure <italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub> elicited by returning to the â70 mV holding potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Nitrendipine-sensitive Q<sub>on</sub> values produced by Cav1.2 alone were comparable to those measured in the presence of Kv2.1, indicating that the increased <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> in cells coexpressing Kv2.1 was not associated with an increase in the number of PM Cav1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). However, the nitrendipine-sensitive <italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub> was significantly greater in the presence of Kv2.1, demonstrating that the open probability and/or conductance of Cav1.2 was increased when coexpressed with Kv2.1. As comparable Q<sub>on</sub> values (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Cav1.2 voltage sensor movement) produced a larger <italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub> in the presence of Kv2.1, these data taken together with the altered <italic>G-V</italic> curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> suggest that the Kv2.1-dependent increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> apparently came from enhanced Cav1.2 voltage sensor coupling to channel opening.</p><p>We next tested how Kv2.1 impacted the spontaneous opening of Cav1.2 at hyperpolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values. We used an optical approach to measure single Cav1.2 channel activity by recording Cav1.2-mediatedÂ Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets, local elevations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced by the opening of a single or small cluster of Cav1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Lederer, 2008</xref>). In addition to providing the single-channel activity of all active Cav1.2 channels present in the TIRF footprint, this approach had the additional benefit of revealing where in the PM the active channels were localized. We recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets at a holding potential of â70 mV in the presence of 20 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> to increase the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In control cells expressing Cav1.2 alone, we observed occasional sparkletsÂ whoseÂ activity was enhanced by the application of the LTCC agonist Bay K8644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâB,HâI</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). In contrast, control cells coexpressing Cav1.2 and DsRed-Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub> displayed significantly more sparklets than control cells expressing Cav1.2 alone and a higher level of basal activity as measured by <italic>n</italic>P<sub>s</sub>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of quantal levels of Cav1.2 opening and P<sub>s</sub> is the probability of sparklet occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8CâE,I,J,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). This observation is consistent with our ionic tail current data indicating that Cav1.2 open probability was enhanced in the presence of Kv2.1.

Many sparklets occurred near clusters of Kv2.1 channels, and we found that the nearest-neighbor distance (NND) of individual sparklet sites was significantly reduced in the presence of Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Kv2.1 enhanced the open probability of Cav1.2 channels and increased the proximity of spontaneously active Cav1.2 channels to each other.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49953.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub> increases Cav1.2 single channel activity.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Maximum <italic>z</italic>-projections of TIRF images of Cav1.2-mediatedÂ Ca<sup>2+</sup>Â sparklets in a representative HEK293T cell transfected with Cav1.2 and auxiliary subunits and loaded with Fluo-5F <italic>via</italic> the patch pipette, before (<bold>A</bold>) and after (<bold>B</bold>) treatment with 500 nM Bay K8644 (scale bar: 5 Âµm).

For these experiments, we chose to record from CHNs as opposed to acutely dissociated neurons. Although the absence of extensive processes in acutely dissociated neurons enables much better control of the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> than in arborized neurons, we reasoned based on the loss of Kv2.1 clustering upon dissociation in other cell types expressing clustered Kv2.1 (PC12, MDCK, and HEK293 cells; J.S. Trimmer, unpublished observations), and that endogenous Kv2.1 clusters in CHNs are sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Misonou et al., 2005b</xref>), that acute dissociation would disrupt the clustered localization of Kv2.1, potentially concealing LTCC regulation by Kv2.1 clustering. To improve somatic voltage clamp, we used recording solutions lacking Na<sup>+</sup> and containing Cs<sup>+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> (which block K<sup>+</sup> channels; Ba<sup>2+</sup> also permeates voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) to increase membrane impedance. We focused our analyses of electrophysiological recordings on repolarization-induced tail currents after activation of channels by a depolarizing prepulse, rather than measurement of currents induced by depolarizing voltage steps that can be distorted due to space clamp limitations (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Milescu et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to the impact of Kv2.1 on LTCCs in HEK293T cells, whole-cell Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ba</sub>) at +10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), as well as LTCC tail currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>) were larger in CHNs from WT mice than those measured in Kv2.1 KO CHNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9AâC</xref>).

In this model, neuronal EPJs are Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling microdomains in which Cav1.2 and RyRs are brought into close proximity by Kv2.1-mediated clustering, forming a specialized somatic complex for the generation of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11I</xref>). We propose that a nonconducting function of PM Kv2.1 channels is to not only anchor the ER to the PM <italic>via</italic> a direct interaction with ER VAP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>), but also to promote the organization of Cav1.2 channels into clusters in direct apposition to nearby ER-localized RyRs. Our data indicate that Kv2.1-mediated clustering also increases the activity of Cav1.2. The enhanced spontaneous openings of Cav1.2 channels at negative potentials is evidenced by the increased frequency of sparklets, which allow a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell at EPJs, activating nearby RyRs by the mechanism of CICR. The resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks occur independently of action potentials. Thus, our model proposes the molecular architecture of a protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11I</xref>) underlying the localized somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals previously observed in brain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrout and Isokawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Manita and Ross, 2009</xref>), and suggests a mechanism whereby Kv2.1 modulates these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by simultaneously promoting the spatial association of Cav1.2 channels with RyRs and increasing their activity to trigger CICR.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kv2 channels dynamically cluster LTCCs</title><p>A key finding in this study is that endogenous LTCCs colocalize with clustered Kv2.1 in brain neurons, a finding supported by our crosslinking-based proteomic analyses showing that they exist in close spatial proximity. Moreover, colocalization of LTCCs with Kv2.1 could be reconstituted in heterologous cells, a property that required Kv2.1âs ability to cluster at EPJs but was separable from its voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel function. The Kv2.1-mediated association of Cav1.2 with EPJs appears to be dynamically regulated and sensitive to neuronal activity, as acute dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters in CHNs by glutamate stimulation reduced Cav1.2 association with RyRs, whereas suppression of neuronal activity with TTX (which increases Kv2.1 phosphorylation and clustering) enhanced spatial coupling of Cav1.2 and RyRs. In addition, Kv2.1 expression in heterologous cells simultaneously enhanced the size of LTCC clusters and recruited LTCCs to Kv2.1-mediated EPJs where they more functionally coupled to RyRs to generate sparks. Consistent with this, we found that the spatial and functional coupling of somatic Cav1.2 channels to RyRs was reduced in Kv2.1 KO CHNs. Together, these findings indicate that LTCCs are recruited to Kv2.1-associated EPJs, a property we found was not shared by the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cav3.1. Moreover, the co-purification of several CavÎ² auxiliary subunits, which associate with LTCCs but not T-Type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels such as Cav3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fang and Colecraft, 2011</xref>), by IP of Kv2.1 from crosslinked brain samples further suggests a specific spatial interaction of LTCCs with Kv2.1. While like other plasma membrane proteins LTCCs can also exhibit stochastic clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sato et al., 2019</xref>), numerous proteins have been identified that promote clustering of LTCCs in dendritic spines, including AKAP15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>) and PDZ domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The absence of these known LTCC clustering proteins from our proteomic analyses of proteins in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1, and our observation that expression of Kv2.1 increases Cav1.2 clustering in heterologous HEK293T cells, suggests that the proteins mediating Cav1.2 clustering in dendritic spines and at somatic EPJs may be distinct. We note that while our studies support that Kv2.1 coexpression leads to enhanced clustering of PM Cav1.2, our data do not allow us to distinguish whether this occurs through clustering of Cav1.2 channels already in the PM, or through other mechanisms, such as enhanced fusion of Cav1.2-containing endocytic vesicles that support enhanced clustering of Cav1.2 upon its reappearance in the PM, and that also leads to enhanced Cav1.2 clustering and cooperative gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the molecular mechanism of Kv2.1 recruitment to EPJs is now established, and occurs <italic>via</italic> its phosphorylation-dependent interaction with VAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>), the precise molecular mechanism that underlies how LTCCs and RyRs are recruited to these sites is not yet clear. However, our data show that PM Cav1.2 organization was not impacted by coexpression of the clustering- and EPJ formation-deficient Kv2.1<sub>S586A</sub> mutant as it was by Kv2.1<sub>WT</sub> and the nonconducting Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub> point mutant. Additionally, Kv2.1<sub>S586A</sub> was unable to enhance Cav1.2- and RyR-mediated sparks reconstituted in HEK293T cells, unlike these clustering-competent Kv2.1 isoforms. These findings support that Kv2.1 clustering and induction of EPJs is necessary for its spatial association with LTCCs.</p><p>It has been reported that LTCCs can also be recruited to the EPJs formed in HEK293T cells upon heterologous expression of junctophilin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Perni et al., 2017</xref>), an ER-localized protein critical for bridging the PM to the ER in myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with a model whereby tethering of LTCCs at or near Kv2-associated EPJs could be mediated by an intermediary recruited to Kv2.1-mediated EPJs, perhaps even one of the proteins identified in our proteomics analyses (although note a different study did not observe this effect of junctophilin-2 coexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>]). We note that these proteomics analyses have the potential to identify any proteins with lysine residues in close spatial proximity (â12 Ã) to those in Kv2.1, making them amenable to being crosslinked to Kv2.1 by DSP, and do not require their direct association. Moreover, the crosslinking reaction could potentially yield âdaisy-chainedâ protein linkages of spatially adjacent proteins. While any such crosslinked protein chain would need to ultimately connect back to Kv2.1 to be immunopurified, every protein present in the purified sample need not be in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1 itself. Our observation that immunolabeling of endogenous Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels often appeared adjacent to rather than co-occurring with Kv2.1 (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) may also indicate that there is an indirect interaction between Kv2.1 and LTCCs. However, it remains possible that PM Kv2s and LTCCs associate through a direct intermolecular interaction. Any domains on Kv2.1 contributing to the spatial association with LTCCs, whether it occurs <italic>via</italic> direct or indirect interaction, would likely be conserved in Kv2.2, as we found that both Kv2 channel paralogs similarly impacted LTCC cluster size and localization. It is unlikely that RyRs are directly recruited to EPJs by Kv2 channels, as RyR clusters persist in CHNs exposed to treatments that disperse Kv2.1 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Misonou et al., 2005a</xref>) and while reduced in size in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the double Kv2.1/Kv2.2 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>), in general RyR clusters persist in neurons in the brains of mice lacking Kv2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mandikian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>). Further experiments are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms and direct protein-protein interactions that result in the spatial association of these proteins at neuronal EPJs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Kv2.1-dependent potentiation of Cav1.2 currents</title><p>Given their prominent physiological role, the regulation of LTCCs is extensive and multimodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lipscombe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hofmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Neely and Hidalgo, 2014</xref>). The mechanisms involved in the modulation of LTCC function include post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation), as well as changes in the expression of the subunits (principal Î±1, and auxiliary CavÎ² and Î±2Î´) that together comprise the quaternary structure of an LTCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catterall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>). We have recently demonstrated a novel mechanism for regulating Cav1.2- (and Cav1.3-) containing LTCCs, whereby LTCCs function differently when clustered due to their clustering-dependent cooperative gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, LTCC activity is sensitive to its spatial organization in the PM, influenced by its proximity to adjacent LTCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>) and also to its localization to specific neuronal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>). In neurons, such regulation likely acts to ensure that Cav1.2 is most active when properly targeted to specific subcellular domains and less active when outside these regions. Here, we show that the subcellular localization and activity of somatic Cav1.2 channels are influenced by Kv2.1, which increases both Cav1.2 clustering and its opening at polarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values. At least two other proteins, Î±-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hall et al., 2013</xref>) and densin-180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), exert a similar dual regulation on neuronal Cav1.2, by promoting its localization to dendritic spines and enhancing its activity at these sites. Neither of these proteins was identified in our proteomic analyses of proteins in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1, further suggesting that Cav1.2 complexes in dendritic spines and at somatic EPJs may be distinct. The reduced whole-cell LTCC currents and impaired association of somatic Cav1.2 with RyRs in Kv2.1 KO CHNs suggests that Kv2.1 serves this dual targeting/modulation function for LTCCs within the soma and proximal dendrites.</p><p>In both CHNs and HEK293T cells, currents resulting from the opening of endogenous and exogenous Cav1.2 channels, respectively, are increased in the presence of Kv2.1. In HEK293T cells, Cav1.2 channels coexpressed with clustered Kv2.1 are activated at more polarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values relative to those produced by Cav1.2 alone. Moreover, coexpression of Cav1.2 with nonconducting Kv2.1 increases the frequency of spontaneous Cav1.2 channel openings in HEK293T cells as reflected in an increased frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets. The Kv2.1-dependent increase in whole-cell Cav1.2 current amplitude in both HEK293T cells and CHNs occurs without an apparent change in the number of Cav1.2 channels present on the PM, as total Cav1.2 on-gating charges were unaltered by coexpression with Kv2.1. Instead, it appears that coupling of Cav1.2 voltage sensor movement to channel opening is enhanced in the presence of Kv2.1. What is the molecular mechanism underlying this effect on Cav1.2 channel opening? We suggest three possibilities. First, the increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> and leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of activation that we observed upon coexpression of Kv2.1 in HEK293T cells are similar to those observed during optogenetic induction of Cav1.2 channel oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, one possible mechanism is that Kv2.1-induced clustering at EPJs increases the probability of physical interactions between Cav1.2 channels, which promotes their cooperative gating. A second possibility is that Kv2.1 functions as an auxiliary voltage sensor for Cav1.2 channels, perhaps through a direct intermolecular interaction of the two channels. However, the apparent localization of many Cav1.2 clusters adjacent to rather than directly overlapping with Kv2.1 clusters in CHNs (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,H</xref>) suggests that although these proteins associate in close spatial proximity, there may not be a direct interaction between individual Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 channels.</p><p>A third potential explanation for the Kv2.1-mediated increase in Cav1.2 channel activity is that Cav1.2 is modulated by signaling molecules that it encounters when recruited to EPJs by Kv2.1. It is well established that phosphorylation of Cav1.2 is a major mechanism to regulate its activity. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cav1.2, enhancing CICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dittmer et al., 2019</xref>). Another candidate which might impact Cav1.2 at EPJs is Ca<sup>2+/</sup>calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which has also been shown to interact with Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">McCord and Aizenman, 2013</xref>). Enhanced Cav1.2 opening at polarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values and increased open probability are produced by both PKA- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Tsien et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bers and Perez-Reyes, 1999</xref>) and CaMKII- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Erxleben et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaich et al., 2010</xref>) dependent phosphorylation of Cav1.2. Moreover, given the well-established association of RyRs with PKA and CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Zalk et al., 2007</xref>), it is conceivable that RyRs, Cav1.2, and Kv2.1 are substrates of these protein kinases at somatic EPJs. A recent study showed that in dendritic EPJs adjacent to spines, Cav1.2 is inhibited through a direct interaction with the ER-localized protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in a negative feedback response to Cav1.2- and RyR-mediated CICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dittmer et al., 2019</xref>). As such the Kv2.1-mediated localization of Cav1.2 at EPJs may bring it in close proximity to numerous regulatory molecules, at least a subset of which should also be expressed in HEK293T cells as these also exhibit prominent effects of Kv2.1 clustering on Cav1.2 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks at Kv2.1-associated EPJs</title><p>The results presented here indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks occurring at Kv2.1-associated EPJs were triggered primarily by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through LTCCs initiating the opening of juxtaposed RyRs. Accordingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency increased when neurons were exposed to Cav1.2 channel agonists and decreased by blockade of LTCCs. Loss of Kv2.1 expression was also associated with a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency, likely because of decreased spatial association of Cav1.2 and RyRs, decreased RyR cluster size, and decreased LTCC currents.</p><p>As Kv2.1 clusters intrinsically represent EPJs by nature of their formation <italic>via</italic> an interaction with ER-resident VAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirmiz et al., 2018b</xref>), our observation that localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occurred only at a subset of GCaMP3-Kv2.1 clusters suggests that only a subset of Kv2.1-associated EPJs possess the molecular machinery required to generate these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. As identified in electron micrographs, EPJs represent a major class of membrane contact sites in brain neurons, whereÂ &gt;Â 10% of the somatic PM may be engaged in EPJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to those formed by the Kv2.1:VAP association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirmiz et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirmiz et al., 2018b</xref>), EPJs can be organized by a set of ER membrane proteins that bind PM phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Henne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the relationship of the Kv2.1, LTCC and RyR-containing EPJs described here to those formed by these ER tethers in brain neurons and other cells that endogenously express these proteins is not known.</p><p>Our findings indicate that Kv2.1-mediated somatodendritic EPJs provide a molecular platform to elevate local Ca<sup>2+</sup> at individual EPJs without an increase in global Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but that can also contribute to global, action potential-induced increases in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These results reinforce previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrout and Isokawa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Manita and Ross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Miyazaki and Ross, 2013</xref>) that hippocampal neurons possess the molecular machinery to produce spontaneous local elevations in somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> that could potentially impact a wide variety of signaling pathways.

One specific role identified for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals produced by somatic RyR receptors at EPJs is in cartwheel cells (inhibitory interneurons found in the dorsal cochlear nucleus), where they trigger rapid gating of BK Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels to control electrical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Irie and Trussell, 2017</xref>). While this mode of BK channel activation has not been observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ross, 2012</xref>), somatic LTCC- and RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has recently been demonstrated to activate KCa3.1 channels in hippocampal neurons, reducing spike frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sahu et al., 2019</xref>). Sparks at Kv2.1-associated EPJs might also influence electrical activity in pyramidal cells through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive enzymes that modify ion channel function, such as protein kinases and phosphatases that influence their phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Misonou et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, a role for somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks has been identified in DRG neurons, where they promote non-synaptic exocytosis of ATP-loaded secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ouyang et al., 2005</xref>). Whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by LTCCs and RyRs at Kv2.1-associated EPJs impacts secretory vesicle exocytosis in brain neurons or other cell types will need to be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential impact on downstream signaling pathways</title><p>Somatodendritic LTCCs are preferentially coupled to activation of signaling pathways resulting in changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wheeler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wild et al., 2019</xref>). In sympathetic neurons, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through LTCCs rather than bulk elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> efficiently activates the transcription factor cAMP response elementâbinding protein (CREB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>) through a mechanism that involves a signaling complex containing components of a PM-to-nucleus Ca<sup>2+</sup> shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, somatic LTCCs play a unique role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that leads to activation of the NFAT transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wild et al., 2019</xref>). The results presented here suggest that Kv2.1-mediated organization and regulation of somatic LTCCs provides a molecular mechanism to control local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and serve as an organizer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling microdomains. Previous work from us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Misonou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Misonou et al., 2005b</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mulholland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aras et al., 2009</xref>) has shown that acute ischemic or depolarizing events lead to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters and hyperpolarize its <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> activation threshold, potentially as a homeostatic mechanism to reduce neuronal activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload that can lead to excitotoxicity. In our experiments here, we determined that Kv2.1-mediated clustering was associated with enhanced functional coupling of Cav1.2 and RyRs, as well as increased activation of Cav1.2 at polarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> values. Therefore, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters and the resulting dissociation of Cav1.2 and RyRs may represent a negative feedback loop to limit excessive increases in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. By decreasing LTCC- and RyR-mediated CICR, dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters may help to curb excessive accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which inappropriately activates signaling pathways contributing to neuronal damage or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dirnagl et al., 1999</xref>). Activity-dependent declustering of Kv2.1 may also help to reduce currents conducted by LTCCs, both through increased activation of hyperpolarizing Kv2.1 currents at polarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (opposing activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) and also through limiting Cav1.2 activity by altering its spatial organization in the PM. Our findings may also contribute to an understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying mutations in Kv2.1 predicted to selectively disrupt the PRC domain required for Kv2.1 clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Kovel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the findings presented here identify a molecular structure underlying the spontaneous somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals previously observed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. While our live cell experiments were primarily confined to CHNs cultured for 9â15 days in vitro, our data indicate that the spatial association of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs is preserved in intact adult mouse and rat brains and can be recapitulated in heterologous cells. Moreover, somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks have been observed in acute hippocampal slices obtained from rats aged P3-P80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events serve functional roles that emerge early in pyramidal neuron development and continue beyond this period. Although it is unclear whether spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks serve a specific function at their site of generation, or if they instead reflect stochastic events whose primary impact lies in their group behavior (<italic>i.e.</italic>, through modulation of bulk cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>), the results described here have relevance to obtaining a better understanding of their generation as well as their downstream effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (Human)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC Cat # CRL-3216</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Sprague Dawley</td><td>Charles River</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57/BL6J mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Kcnb1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17767909">17767909</ext-link>; PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494598">24494598</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3806050">MGI:3806050</ext-link></td><td>maintained on the <break/>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>numerous</td><td/><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>GCaMP3-Kv2.1</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>GCaMP3-Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>DsRed-Kv2.1</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012696">30012696</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>DsRed-Kv2.1<sub>P404W</sub></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012696">30012696</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>DsRed-Kv2.2</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30012696">30012696</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Kv2.1<sub>S586A</sub></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10719893">10719893</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Kv1.5</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636142">8636142</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>RecombinantÂ DNAÂ reagent</td><td>BFP-Sec61Î²</td><td>Addgene</td><td>PlasmidÂ #49154</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Cav1.2-eGFP</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25714924">25714924</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Cav1.2-tagRFP</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25714924">25714924</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Cav1.3<sub>S</sub>-GFP</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27187148">27187148</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Cav1.2</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Plasmid #26572</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Cav1.2-HA</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090038">15090038</ext-link></td><td/><td>Gift from Dr. Valentina Di Biase</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>CavÎ±2Î´1</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Plasmid #26575</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>CavÎ²3</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Plasmid #26574</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>YFP-RyR2</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17452324">17452324</ext-link> <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20427316">20427316</ext-link></td><td/><td>Gift fromÂ Dr. S.R.

The voltage dependence of <italic>G</italic>/<italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub> was obtained from the recorded currents by converting them to conductances (<italic>G</italic>) using the equation <italic>G</italic>Â =Â <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>/(test pulse potential â <italic>E</italic><sub>rev(Ca)</sub>), plotting the normalized values (<italic>G</italic>/<italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub>) versus the test potential, and fitting them to a Boltzmann function. Steady-state inactivation was measured by subjecting cells to a series of 2500 ms conditioning prepulses from the holding potential to potentials ranging from â60 to +100 mV, returning to the â70 mV holding potential for 5 ms, then measuring the peak current elicited by a 300 ms step to the â20 mV test potential. Data were analyzed and plotted using Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). For experiments in which depolarization-induced increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye were measured, we included 0.2 mM Rhod-2 (AAT Bioquest Cat# 21068) in the patch pipette solution. Images were acquired at 10 Hz using a through-the-lens TIRF microscope built around an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope equipped with an oil-immersion ApoN 60Ã/1.49 NA TIRF objective and an Andor iXON CCD camera using TILLvisION imaging software (TILL Photonics, FEI, Hillsboro, OR).</p><p>To measure gating and ionic tail currents, we first determined the reversal potential for <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> from the <italic>IâV</italic> relationship obtained using the <italic>IâV</italic> protocol described above. Gating currents were then measured by applying a series of depolarizing steps from the holding potential (â70 mV) to potentialsÂ Â±Â 5 mV of the reversal potential in 1 mV increments. Currents were sampled at a frequency of 25 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. We first obtained recordings in cells perfused with KRB alone, then obtained recordings from the same cell after it had been perfused for two minutes with KRB containing 1 Î¼M nitrendipine (Alomone Cat# N-155). To isolate gating currents and <italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub> produced by Cav1.2, we subtracted currents measured in the presence of nitrendipine from those measured in KRB alone. The on-gating charge (<italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub>) was then obtained from these records by integrating the gating current within approximately 2 ms of a depolarizing step to the reversal potential, and maximal <italic>I</italic><sub>tail</sub> amplitudes were measured upon repolarization to the holding potential.</p><p>Somatic whole-cell patch clamp recordings were acquired from WT and Kv2.1 KO mouse CHNs cultured on microscope cover glasses after 15â16 DIV. Pyramidal neurons were selected based upon their morphological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 1994</xref>). Patch pipettes were fashioned and filled with intracellular recording solution as described above. After establishing the whole-cell configuration in KRB, the bath solution was exchanged with an extracellular recording buffer containing (in mM): 135 NMDG, 30 TEA-Cl, 5 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 8 glucose, 20 HEPES, adjusted to pHÂ 7.4 with HCl. Series resistance was 9.9Â Â±Â 0.9 (WT) and 10.4Â Â±Â 0.9 (Kv2.1 KO) MÎ© (p=0.694, Studentâs <italic>t-</italic>test) (before compensation); cell capacitance was 52.9Â Â±Â 4.8 (WT) and 58.4Â Â±Â 4.0 (Kv2.1 KO) pF (p=0.789, Studentâs <italic>t-</italic>test). Prior to recording, cell capacitance was canceled, and series resistance was partially (60â70%) compensated. Recordings of LTCC ionic and gating currents were then performed as described for HEK293T cells. We used 10 ÂµM nimodipine to isolate the contribution of LTCCs to the measured currents.</p><p>For simultaneous measurement of the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks, rat CHNs transfected with GCaMP3-Kv2.1 were recorded using the whole-cell perforated patch clamp configuration. CHNs were patched in KRB using pipettes filled with a solution containing (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 15 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.22 using KOH, and amphotericin B (Millipore Cat# 171375) dissolved in DMSO and added at a final concentration of approximately 50 Âµg/mL. Upon obtaining a GÎ© seal, the amplifier was switched to the current clamp mode to record spontaneous fluctuations in the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Measurement of the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (sampled at 25 kHz) and widefield image acquisition (acquired at 5 Hz) were triggered simultaneously using the same microscope described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sparklets</title><p>We recorded Cav1.2-mediatedÂ Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets using the dual TIRF imaging/patch clamp system described above.

After obtaining a GÎ© seal in KRB, the external solution was exchanged with a solution containing (in mM): 110 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 20 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Cells were maintained at a holding potential of â70 mV, and TIRF images were acquired using TILLvisION software. Sparklets were manually detected and analyzed using Fiji software.

The authors show that CaV1.2 clusters increase in size with expression of Kv2.1, and that this effect also occurs with a mutant channel in which potassium permeation has been abolished, but not with a mutant channel exhibiting diminished clustering of the Kv2.1 channel. They also find that co-expression of Kv2.1 and CaV1.2 modulates the activity of this calcium channel by increasing the amplitude of calcium currents and shifting opening of the channel to more negative membrane voltages, making it easier for the channel to open in response to membrane depolarization. The editors and reviewers agreed that this is rigorous, well-executed study that presents important and original findings concerning the interaction of different ion channels involved in electrical signaling within neurons. The authors use an impressive number of tools and experimental approaches, the data are all very high quality and the manuscript is well-written. The experimental results all support the main claims of the paper and the authors were responsive to issues raised in review and have done an excellent job of revising the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kv2.1 mediates spatial and functional coupling of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors in neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers found your study on the role of Kv2.1 in functional coupling of Cav1.2 and ryanodine receptors (RyR) to be very interesting. The key findings of the manuscript are that clusters of Kv2.1 dynamically associate Cav1.2 and RyR, these associations result in discrete calcium signaling events (calcium sparks), and that Kv2.1 enhances Cav1.2 open probability. Although the functional significance of these clusters and their regulation remains speculative, the manuscript represents an important advance in our understanding of subcellular neuronal signaling and will be great of interest to the broader scientific community. We ask that you revise your manuscript to address the issues raised by the reviewers, as outlined below. Although we normally compile requests as essential or minor, in this case it may be helpful to see the reviewers remarks in the context of their reviews, and all reviewers have been clear about what is required and what is optional.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors investigated the role of Kv2.1 in functional coupling of Cav1.2 and ryanodine receptors (RyR) to endow neurons with somatodendritic subcompartments capable of localized calcium signaling using a combination of antibody labeling with super-resolution microscopy, proteomics, in vitro calcium imaging, and patch clamp electrophysiology. While a nonconducting role for Kv2.1 in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions (EPJs) has been documented, the phenomenon's relevance to cellular function has generally been unclear. The key findings of the manuscript are that clusters of Kv2.1 dynamically associate Cav1.2 and RyR, these associations result in discrete calcium signaling events (calcium sparks), and that Kv2.1 enhances Cav1.2 open probability. The results look pretty solid, particularly as they were replicated in primary neuronal cultures, heterologous expression systems, and demonstrated in both rats and mice. Furthermore, the findings shed light on previous reports of localized RyR-mediated calcium events in acute hippocampal slice preparations. Although in the end, the functional significance of these clusters and their regulation remains speculative, the manuscript represents an important advancement in the understanding of subcellular neuronal signaling and will be great of interest to the broader scientific community.</p><p>1) There are inconsistencies in the quantitative rigor throughout the paper. In particular the lack of quantitative rigor for the results presented in Figure 1 is concerning. The majority of the results presented are strictly qualitative which is peculiar given the authors are equipped to measure colocalization. They do report that spatial distributions of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 are correlated but is unclear exactly how this was ascertained other than using the analyze particles function of FIJI. Throughout the associated text, the authors make comparative statements &quot;increased labeling in&quot;, less intense immunoreactivity&quot;, &quot;comparable to&quot;. These statements should be bolstered by simple, unbiased image quantification and statistics. Furthermore, it is unclear why these experiments did not include an assessment Cav1.2 and ryanodine receptor spatial association in the Kv2.1-KO animal that the authors have access to and use throughout the paper. Quantification of spatial association in WT cultures and cultures from Kv2.1-KO animals is an important and simple experiment. Figure 2 also suffers similarly. Plots of colocalization like Figure 2K seem anecdotal. The use of CV as a relevant metric is not rationalized.</p><p>2) I am disappointed that the authors chose to convey the results of a key experiment, glutamate induced dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters, as a table as opposed to a figure. This seemingly crucial experiment demonstrates the ability of Kv2.1 to dynamically regulate, rather than an epiphenomenon of Cav1.2 and RyR clustering, and so it is unclear why it is relegated to a table. A possible answer is that the results are of marginal significance. If so, perhaps those data should be removed.</p><p>3) In a related concern, it would be beneficial to the interpretation of the experiment if the authors induced dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters with an alternative, preferably more direct, mechanism such as application of a PKA inhibitor. Given the expression of multiple metabotropic glutamate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons, and the potential of metabotropic effects of NMDA receptor activation, the glutamate stimulation may not solely be acting through phosphorylation of Kv2.1. Although not essential to publication, this result would enhance the paper a lot.</p><p>4) In the results presented in Figure 3, the authors note large, synchronized calcium spikes associated with spontaneous action potentials. While the authors are likely correct that these represent a large increase in cytoplasmic calcium through action potential-associated voltage-gated calcium channels, this could be easily tested with the application of TTX. Furthermore, a key conclusion of the paper, that Cav1.2 and RyR associations &quot;generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events independently of action potentials&quot; would be best demonstrated if the calcium sparks indeed persist in the presence of TTX. This experiment would also shed light on whether a neuron's spiking activity can affect frequency or amplitude of calcium sparks.</p><p>5) As with some other figures, the data in Figure 3E-G are presented anecdotally. E.g., the inset of 3E shows that Ca signals did not correspond to spontaneous depolarizations, but these are merely single traces. Do you infer that the apparent absence of a voltage signal associated with the spark implies that the spark is not being driven by a spatiotemporally localized Ca influx through LTCCs?</p><p>6) Figure 4 the black red and blue trace overlap so much one cannot tell anything from the data. For example, the red traces seem to show that thapsigargin did nothing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study by Vierra et al. describes the novel observation that Kv2.1 channel form clusters that interact functionally with L-type Ca channels and ryanodine receptors. The authors show that CaV1.2 clusters increase in size with expression of Kv2.1, and that this effect occurs using a non-conducting mutant but is abolished in a non-clustering Kv2.1 mutant. Interestingly, they also find that co-expression of Kv2.1 and CaV1.2 (in HEK cells) increases the amplitude of whole-cell L-type Ca currents and leads to a leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of activation. In agreement with this finding, recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons from Kv2.1 KO mice show lower amplitude L-type Ca currents.</p><p>This is rigorous, well-executed study that presents important and original findings. The authors use an impressive number of tools and experimental approaches including immunohistochemistry, super resolution and TIRF imaging, electrophysiology, and mass-spec based proteomics. The data are all very high quality and the manuscript is well-written. The experimental results all support the main claims of the paper and the conclusions are all convincing.</p><p>1) The results shown in Figure 2E (effect of Kv2.1 non-clustering and non-conducting on CaV1.2 clusters) are quantified in terms of coefficient of variation (CV), but the rationale for this is not clearly described. Please address this. In addition to CV, the authors should also consider providing analysis/quantification of the absolute cluster size for each mutant tested as shown in Figure 2B.</p><p>2) The functional measurements of calcium sparks in Figure 3 and 5 show somewhat conflicting results. Results in Figure 5 show a reduction in spark amplitude with the non-conducting mutant, suggesting that conductance is necessary for increased amplitude. In Figure 3, however, the non-conducting Kv2.1 (P404W) mutant has no effect on amplitude of sparks (in comparison to the conducting Kv2.1). Why is this the case? Please discuss.</p><p>3) GCaMP3 and Cal-590 differ in their affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which may influence the apparent amplitude and size of the Ca sparks. This point may be helpful in addressing Comment 2. Along those lines, the spatial spread of the Ca signal (FWHM) is provided for the GCaMP3 images while the Cal-590 results are only provided as normalized values.</p><p>4) Along those lines, does expression of the Kv2.1 and the Kv2.1P404W mutants differ? This is relevant to GCamP3 fusion protein experiments. Please quantify.</p><p>5) The example CaV1.2 traces shown in Figure 6A show significant inactivation in the presence of Kv2.1. Was this generally true? Please address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper by Vierra et al. the role for the potassium channel KV2.1 in the clustering and function of both voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) is explored in cultured neurons, cell lines, and tissues. The authors find that KV channels promote clustering of VGCC and RyRs. Furthermore, through imaging and ephys the authors show that this functional interaction lowers the activation threshold for calcium channels, promotes local calcium transients, and has a role in modulating the overall calcium signals in these cells. This tripartite interaction is proposed to occur specifically at PM-ER junction sites. In general, I find this paper well done and thorough. The experiments support the author's conclusions and I think it is a generally useful set of data for the field of cellular neuro-biology. I have some specific recommendations and comments that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The zoom in Figure 1 (and most of the imaging based figures with small structures) makes it very difficult to evaluate the local clustering of these channels. As this concept is a key idea in the work (e.g. that these three proteins colocalize and functionally interact), can the authors please show more zoomed-in images, more direct measurements (plots) of the fluorescent signals, and less &quot;wide-field&quot; general views?</p><p>Also, some standard consistent quantitative way to evaluate co-localization would be helpful throughout the work. Something similar to a Pearson correlation co-efficient or similar type of analysis in most of the co-localization work should be presented across all relevant datasets in the figures.</p><p>2) In Figure 1D the KV signal from SIM looks very odd. Is this PM resident ER? Does a general ER marker have this same localization pattern?</p><p>3) In Figure 2 are the surface images here just single molecule-level KV? Specifically, is the &quot;spottiness&quot; of the KV images due to low labeling efficiency, low expression, or in fact due to clustering? Again, the size of the images makes it very difficult for me to evaluate the co-localization and cluster size of these signals.</p><p>4) The data in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 showing ER morphology at the PM is key. My primary question is how much of the KV and VGCC proteins are inside the ER and how much are exposed at the plasma membrane. Because the effects shown in this paper are due to channels on the plasma membrane surface, a clear separation of these two populations is really important to understand this work. In general, I would like to know how much are functional channels (PM localized channel) and how much are non-functional ER localized channels before they have reached the PM. The data in Figure 2F in many ways addresses this question, but I would like to see these data analyzed and presented in a much more robust way. For example, given the difference between Figure 2A and 2F in the calcium channel signal it appears that most of the clustered VGCC signal is in the ER and not at the surface.</p><p>5) A general cartoon model of this complex should be in the main text of the paper as a figure.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kv2.1 mediates spatial and functional coupling of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors in mammalian neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, and Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The editors and reviewers think you have done an excellent job of revising the manuscript to address the comments of the reviewers. Two of the reviewers have additional suggestions concerning the Pearson CC analysis, and we ask that you address these remaining issues in revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this revision of Vierra et al. the authors have made an excellent effort to address reviewer concerns. A small specific concern is listed below.</p><p>Regarding the added Pearson CC: what is being tested here? Codistribution across the image, or colocalization of pixels? SIM images do not indicate a degree of colocalization expected based on the assertion in the crosslinking analysis of 12 A distances. In fact the SIM images do not clearly show superposition of RYR and Cav1.2, only RYR and nearby 1.3 clusters. Some comment here would help. The Materials and methods do not really discuss the statistical tests, unless I missed it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I am generally satisfied with the revisions to the paper that have been made. The paper is now improved. I still do have one outstanding issue that the authors might consider addressing.</p><p>1) The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis was added to only the first and last figure as far as I can tell. Why was this not used throughout the paper? That being said the PCC values, while different from controls, are very low (0.2). A positive control should be up around 0.7-1. Can the authors discuss these low values as they relate to the findings of the paper? This indicates that the vast majority of these channels in neurons are not co-clustered.</p><p>The most useful place for this analysis would be in Figure 3 and in Figure 3âfigure supplements 1 and 2. Here, the PCC value would appear to be larger than in neurons but I can't tell because only raw line scans are shown and not PCC plots across multiple cells as a comparison.</p><p>In summary, I am trying to understand how common this complex is in both neurons and cultured cells. Do only a subset of ER/PM junctions have these complexes? If so how many? Are these functionally unique or different in some way? This would be useful to understand for this and future work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49953.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] 1) There are inconsistencies in the quantitative rigor throughout the paper.

First, we have split Figure 1 of the original manuscript into two separate figures, now Figures 1 and 2 of the revised manuscript, and have added additional quantification of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 protein localization and/or morphology to Figures 1, 2, and 3. We have also used more precise language in the text to clarify which parameters were quantified and which observations were qualitative (e.g., the general labeling pattern of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs in cultured neurons as compared to pyramidal neurons in brain sections). We have added a discussion of the use of the CV of immunolabeling fluorescence intensity as a measure of channel clustering in the main body of manuscript. With regard to the analysis performed to assess the spatial distributions of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2, we have now updated the manuscript Results and Materials and methods sections to clarify that we used the Interaction Analysis function that is part of the MosaicSuite plugin for Fiji. We also appreciate the reviewer highlighting the important experiments with the Kv2.1 KO mice, which although present in the original manuscript, were presented as a table instead of paneled figure. Therefore, we have moved these data from the table in the original manuscript to scatter plots showing all values for each analysis, now part of Figure 11, to better highlight the analysis of Cav1.2 and RyR spatial association in WT and Kv2.1 KO neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am disappointed that the authors chose to convey the results of a key experiment, glutamate induced dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters, as a table as opposed to a figure.

Additionally, after determining that tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment produces the opposite effect of glutamate by enhancing the clustering and spatial association of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs, we have chosen to present the glutamate dispersal data and the new TTX data in Figure 1. We feel that the new graphs and representative images in Figure 1 will help the reader better assess the results of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In a related concern, it would be beneficial to the interpretation of the experiment if the authors induced dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters with an alternative, preferably more direct, mechanism such as application of a PKA inhibitor.

While we (e.g., Misonou et al., 2004, 2005) and others (e.g., Aras et al., 2009) have previously demonstrated the involvement of calcineurin in glutamate-induced dephosphorylation and dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters, we agree that the pleiotropic effects of glutamate treatment could contribute to the observed dispersal of Cav1.2 clusters from RyR clusters. While we have not previously observed any effects of direct PKA inhibition on Kv2.1 clustering or phosphorylation (J. Trimmer, unpublished results), we reasoned that enhancing Kv2.1</p><p>phosphorylation and clustering might be another approach to evaluate the relationship between Kv2.1 phosphorylation/clustering and the of association somatic Cav1.2 with RyRs. Suppression of neuronal excitability with TTX produces enhanced Kv2.1 phosphorylation (Cerda and Trimmer, 2011) and clustering (Romer et al., 2019) and we determined here that it also increases the spatial association of Kv2.1, Cav1.2, and RyRs relative to controls. Thus, acute stimulation of neurons with glutamate causes dispersal of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 from RyR clusters, while suppression of neuronal activity with TTX promotes the congregation of these proteins. These findings are now presented as graphs and exemplar images of neurons in Figure 1. While the precise mechanism remains unclear, we contend that these observations support our hypothesis that there is a close relationship between the degree of Kv2.1 clustering/phosphorylation and the coupling of Cav1.2 to RyRs at Kv2.1 clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the results presented in Figure 3, the authors note large, synchronized calcium spikes associated with spontaneous action potentials.

To better present the relationship between the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking activity of a neuron and the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events, we have also included a temporal raster plot that depicts local Ca<sup>2+</sup>release events as well as the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events in selected neurons. While we do not have descriptive statistics of the relationship between local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes the raster plots suggest that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events occurred more frequently immediately following a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> release event.

We did not mean to imply that there was not a spatiotemporally localized influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through LTCCs. In contrast, all of our data suggest the opposite: that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events occurring at Kv2.1 clusters required the spontaneous opening of a spatially coupled LTCC.

While we do not have a detailed explanation for this observation, we hypothesize that the high input resistance of HEK293T cells relative to cultured neurons, which possess numerous endogenous ionic conductances (including native Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 channels), enabled K<sup>+</sup> conductance through GCaMP3-Kv2.1<sub>WT</sub> and âKv2.1<sub>S586A</sub> to promote membrane potential hyperpolarization in HEK293T cells, maintaining a greater electrochemical driving force for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and also promoting recovery of Cav1.2 channels from voltage-dependent inactivation. We have now included this discussion in the last paragraph of the subsection âKv2.1 augments LTCC and RyR2-mediated CICR reconstituted in HEK293T cellsâ. Considering the large (and growing) number of point mutations in and near the pore region of Kv2.1 associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay, it will be important for future studies to determine how altered K<sup>+</sup> conductance at Kv2.1 clusters impacts Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at these sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) GCaMP3 and Cal-590 differ in their affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which may influence the apparent amplitude and size of the Ca sparks.

With respect to the presentation of normalized values, we chose to present normalized values as we felt it would assist the reader evaluate the magnitude of the effects in terms of the percent change in each parameter.

However, we have now evaluated whether these two constructs are expressed at different levels in HEK293T cells, which while not primary neurons present a much more facile model to examine expression differences for heterologously expressed constructs. As now shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, we did not observe differences in the expression of these two constructs, as assessed by surface labeling of GCaMP3-Kv2.1 and also raw GCaMP3 fluorescence.</p><p>We also note that in mouse neurons loaded with Cal-590 that we observed no difference in the amplitude or width of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons lacking Kv2.1 â only signal frequency was depressed. We hypothesize that this result is a consequence of the decreased spatial association of Cav1.2 and RyRs, decreased RyR cluster size, and decreased open probability of LTCCs in Kv2.1 KO neurons. Although the Kv2.1 KO mouse neurons could express endogenous Kv2.2 channels, our data support a model which suggests that the impact of Kv2.1 on these spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons is mediated primarily through its structural role at ER-PM junctions, independent of Kv2.1âs K<sup>+</sup> conducting function. While Kv2.1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> conductance is clearly vital for normal neuronal development and function, the functional relationship between Kv2.1 clustering and its K<sup>+</sup> conductance remains unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The example CaV1.2 traces shown in Figure 6A show significant inactivation in the presence of Kv2.1.

While we had reported that steady-state inactivation of the peak current was comparable between control cells and cells coexpressing Kv2.1, we did not assess changes in the sustained current. As now shown in Figure 7D of the revised manuscript, we observe greater inactivation of the sustained Cav1.2 current in the presence of Kv2.1. As this difference in inactivation is abolished by coexpression with STAC1 (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D), which interferes with CDI (Campiglio et al., 2018), the greater inactivation of Cav1.2 in the presence of Kv2.1 presumably reflects greater Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation, a result of the Kv2.1-induced potentiation of Cav1.2 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] I have some specific recommendations and comments that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The zoom in Figure 1 (and most of the imaging based figures with small structures) makes it very difficult to evaluate the local clustering of these channels.

In addition, surface labeling of endogenous Kv2 channels in hippocampal slices with a Kv2-specific toxin (GxTX) conjugated to a fluorescent dye (Thapa et al., 2019) supports that these clusters are present on the PM. To better highlight this quality of Kv2 channels for the readers of this manuscript, we have now demonstrated that surface Kv2 channel clusters align very closely with ER resident proteins in HEK293T cells (Figures 3B and D of the revised manuscript), as we have done previously (Kirmiz et al., 2018). We suspect that the super-resolution SIM images (Figure 1G-I) and also the AiryScan confocal images (e.g., Figure 1C) better reveal the details of the unique PM localization of Kv2 channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2 are the surface images here just single molecule-level KV? Specifically, is the &quot;spottiness&quot; of the KV images due to low labeling efficiency, low expression, or in fact due to clustering? Again, the size of the images makes it very difficult for me to evaluate the co-localization and cluster size of these signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the images we presented in the original manuscript were not optimal for evaluation of the ion channels in the PM. To address this point, we have included new and larger TIRF images of cells expressing these proteins throughout the figures of the revised manuscript. In addition, we have included additional experiments and related quantitation to address the âspottinessâ highlighted above.</p><p>With regard to Kv2.1 channels, we now demonstrate that the Kv2.1 channels are expressed well at the PM, as indicated by the surface GxTX labeling of Kv2.1 now shown in Figure 3 and also Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. We suspect the Kv spots to which the reviewer is referring are the high-density surface clusters of Kv2.1 that are much brighter than the surrounding diffuse Kv2 channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 showing ER morphology at the PM is key. My primary question is how much of the KV and VGCC proteins are inside the ER and how much are exposed at the plasma membrane. Because the effects shown in this paper are due to channels on the plasma membrane surface, a clear separation of these two populations is really important to understand this work. In general, I would like to know how much are functional channels (PM localized channel) and how much are non-functional ER localized channels before they have reached the PM. The data in Figure 2F in many ways addresses this question, but I would like to see these data analyzed and presented in a much more robust way. For example, given the difference between Figure 2A and 2F in the calcium channel signal it appears that most of the clustered VGCC signal is in the ER and not at the surface.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point, and we agree that we are observing both surface and also sub-PM LTCCs, for example those localized to trafficking vesicles (Ghosh et al., 2018) and those retained within the ER as suggested by the reviewer. To address this point, we performed three additional experiments to obtain a better understanding of the relative distributions of surface and subPM channels. First, we performed surface immunolabeling of Kv2.1 channels using GxTX (Figure 3B and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1), which demonstrates that the large Kv2.1 clusters are present in the PM. Next, we performed additional surface immunolabeling and quantitation of the Cav1.2 construct with an extracellular-facing HA tag (Obermair et al., 2004), and determined that approximately 70% of the immunolabeled Cav1.2-HA signal present in the TIRF field was surface localized. Thus, while we observed a Kv2.1-induced increase in surface Cav1.2-HA channel cluster size (Figure 3H), it is possible that we were also observing an increase in the recruitment of non-PM localized Cav1.2-HA channels (e.g., ER-retained channel). Therefore, to determine whether the change in Cav1.2 channel localization in the TIRF field was associated with a change in its function, we also performed recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets (Figure 8, Videos 7 and 8) to evaluate the single-channel activity of all active LTCCs present in the TIRF footprint. Using this approach, we found that Kv2.1 elevated the open probability of Cav1.2 (in agreement with our electrophysiological data), increased the number of active Cav1.2 channels present in the TIRF footprint, and reduced the nearest-neighbor distance of active Cav1.2 channels in relationship to each other (Figure 8J-L). Together, we believe these data are strong evidence in support of the model that Kv2.1 simultaneously reorganizes PM Cav1.2 and also influences its activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A general cartoon model of this complex should be in the main text of the paper as a figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have included a model in Figure 11I of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] Regarding the added Pearson CC: what is being tested here? Codistribution across the image, or colocalization of pixels? SIM images do not indicate a degree of colocalization expected based on the assertion in the crosslinking analysis of 12 A distances. In fact the SIM images do not clearly show superposition of RYR and Cav1.2, only RYR and nearby 1.3 clusters. Some comment here would help. The Materials and methods do not really discuss the statistical tests, unless I missed it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting additional points of clarification regarding our image analyses.</p><p>For the added PCC values, we compared pixel intensities within the ROI (i.e., somatic immunolabeling). We chose this analysis for most of our images as we felt it was applied more consistently than an object based analysis relying on image segmentation. We also thank the reviewer for pointing out an important observation regarding the SIM images their relationship to the results of the proteomic analysis of crosslinked proteins IPd with Kv2.1. Indeed, the super-resolution images indicate that Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 or Cav1.3 immunolabeling did not co-occur within the same pixels (and suggesting that they are beyond 12 Ã reach of the DSP crosslinker). Provided that the immunolabeling is revealing most or all of the somatic LTCCs and Kv2.1 channels (i.e., there is not a population of LTCCs and Kv2.1 channels that overlap yet are not immunolabeled perhaps due to a lack of antibody binding), we hypothesize that the IP of LTCCs with Kv2.1 may be a result of cross-linked intermediary protein serving to âdaisy-chainâ these proteins together. We have now better highlighted this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>We have also now included additional clarification in the manuscript regarding the spatial analysis we performed to assess the localization of Kv2.1 and LTCCs:</p><p>âFor these super-resolution images, we performed an object-based analysis (rather than a pixel intensity correlation-based measurement such as PCC) to determine whether the localization of somatic Kv2.1 and LTCCs were co-dependent. The approach we used relied on evaluation of the nearest-neighbor distances (NND) of Kv2.1 and Cav1.2 or Cav1.3 cluster centroids and a comparison of these values to the predicted NNDs if Kv2.1 and LTCCs were randomly distributed (Shivanandan et al., 2013, Helmuth et al., 2010).â</p><p>The test statistic from the Interaction Analysis test (part of the Mosaic plugin) was computed from <italic>K</italic> (we used <italic>K</italic>=1000) Monte Carlo samples corresponding to the point distributions of randomly distributed Kv2.1 and LTCC clusters (i.e., randomized images corresponding to the null hypothesis of âno interactionâ), and then ranking the actually observed distance distribution against the randomly distributed samples. We rejected the null hypothesis of âno interactionâ based on the rank of the observed distribution compared to the â(1 - <italic>Î±)K</italic>â-th test statistic, using an <italic>Î±=</italic>0.05.

The paper is now improved. I still do have one outstanding issue that the authors might consider addressing.</p><p>1) The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis was added to only the first and last figure as far as I can tell. Why was this not used throughout the paper? That being said the PCC values, while different from controls, are very low (0.2). A positive control should be up around 0.7-1. Can the authors discuss these low values as they relate to the findings of the paper? This indicates that the vast majority of these channels in neurons are not co-clustered.</p><p>The most useful place for this analysis would be in Figure 3 and Figure 3âfigure supplements 1 and 2. Here, the PCC value would appear to be larger than in neurons but I can't tell because only raw line scans are shown and not PCC plots across multiple cells as a comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising important points regarding the images analyses in the paper. The rationale for evaluating the PCC values of images of single cells (we did not attempt these analyses on images of neurons in brain sections) is described above in our response to reviewer 1. We have now included additional analyses of the PCC values of Kv2.1 and LTCCs in Figure 3E, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E. We agree that the PCC values from neurons indicate that the majority of endogenous Kv2.1 and LTCC immunolabeling does not co-cluster, and have now highlighted this in the text of the Results. However, our data indicate that while the absolute PCC values are low, that they reflect a biologically relevant subset of functionally associated Kv2.1, LTCCs, and RyRs whose function is apparent from our live cell imaging results. The spatial association of these channels can be pharmacologically enhanced or dispersed (by TTX or glutamate, respectively), and genetically disrupted by the loss of Kv2.1.</p><p>The PCC values of heterologously expressed Kv2.1 and LTCCs in HEK293T cells were higher than was observed for native channels in neurons. While the molecular basis of the greater colocalization of heterologously expressed channels is not clear, we hypothesize that it may be related to the much larger abundance of LTCC channels relative to Kv2.1 when heterologously expressed. Thus, it may be that the affinity of LTCCs for a Kv2.1-mediated ER-PM junction is not extremely high (as suggested by the relatively low PCC values from neurons indicating that only a subset of endogenous channels associated), but by heterologously expressing the channels we are much better able to see the interaction between Kv2.1 and LTCCs. Future studies are aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatial association of Kv2.1 and LTCCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I am trying to understand how common this complex is in both neurons and cultured cells. Do only a subset of ER/PM junctions have these complexes? If so how many? Are these functionally unique or different in some way? This would be useful to understand for this and future work.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the relative abundance of ER-PM junctions containing the Kv2.1-LTCC-RyR complexes in neurons. ER-PM junctions are abundant on neuronal somata (occupying approximately 10% of the somatic PM (Wu et al., 2017)) and can possess a variety of protein constituents, including the proteins studied here, and also proteins such as STIM/Orai, E-Syts, junctophilins, etc. As Kv2.1 clusters intrinsically represent ER-PM junctions by nature of their formation (i.e., via interaction with the ER-resident VAPs), our observation that localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occurred only at a subset of GCaMP3-Kv2.1 clusters (e.g., see Figure 4A and Video 1) suggests that only a subset of Kv2.1 clusters possess the molecular machinery required to generate these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The reason for this is unclear but we suspect it might underlie the physiological functions of these particular Kv2.1 clusters/EPJs (for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of signaling molecules such as neuropeptides is known to be associated with Kv2.1 clusters in neuroendocrine cells). Future work is focused on identifying the physiological functions of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which we hope will identify why only a subset of the Kv2.1 clusters appear to exhibit these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, LTCCs and RyRs can exist at sites distinct from Kv2-containing ER-PM junctions, including other classes of ER-PM junctions. We have now included a brief discussion of how the Kv2.1 clusters relate to other EPJs present in neurons (subsection âProperties of Ca2+ 642 sparks at Kv2.1-associated EPJsâ, second paragraph</p></body></sub-article></article>
