In this study, we show that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that adopt an antiparallel arrangement in vitro and in vivo. We provide an atomic view of antiparallel protofilaments of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB as apparent from crystal structures.

Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation.

Shape in eukaryotic cells is provided by the cytoskeleton that consists of actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments. Prokaryotes also have a dynamic, filamentous network of proteins, which are homologous to the eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Löwe and Amos, 2009</xref>). In non-spherical bacteria, the actin homologue MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>) is essential for shape maintenance as depletion of MreB through genetic knockouts or MreB-targeted drug treatment results in misshapen cells that eventually lyse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wachi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú and de Boer, 2008</xref>). Incorrect localisation of MreB adversely affects polar targeting of protein complexes and, in some organisms, chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gitai et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowles and Gitai, 2010</xref>). Vital for MreB's role in cell shape determination is the interaction with the elongasome, the protein complex orchestrating peptidoglycan cell wall morphogenesis. The elongasome consists of MreC and MreD (MreB's operon partners), RodA, PBP1A, PBP2, RodZ, as well as MurF, MurG and MraY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alyahya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Favini-Stabile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaballah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holtje, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shiomi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szwedziak and Löwe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van den Ent et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Ent et al., 2010</xref>).

The peptidoglycan layer provides structural integrity to the cell wall and counteracts turgor-induced lysis.</p><p>The existence of helical, cytomotive bundles of MreB originally observed along the length of rod-shaped cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballido-López and Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gitai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Slovak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vats and Rothfield, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Löwe and Amos, 2009</xref>) has been questioned by recent light microscopy studies that suggest MreB forms discontinuous fibres underneath the cell membrane that are driven by the elongasome itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olshausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reimold et al., 2013</xref>). The MreB fibres are attached to the cell membrane via a hydrophobic loop in <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> as well as Gram<sup>+</sup> bacteria and via an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix in Gram<sup>−</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salje et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maeda et al., 2012</xref>). The tendency of purified MreB from Gram<sup>−</sup> bacteria to aggregate can be attributed to the presence of these hydrophobic sequences. Hence, previous biochemical and structural work has focussed on MreB from <italic>T. maritima</italic> (TmMreB) that can be obtained in much higher quantities than <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>) or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayer and Amann, 2009</xref>). MreB assembles into straight, double protofilaments in the presence of ATP or GTP and these can gather laterally into sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nurse and Marians, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>). Although the architecture of a single protofilament is surprisingly conserved within the actin family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gayathri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Popp et al., 2010c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Ent et al., 2002</xref>), the assembly of protofilaments into higher order structures differs greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ozyamak et al., 2013b</xref>). The overall architecture has implications for filament polarity, which affects differential growth of the filament ends and directional movement. Force-generating motors that push plasmids apart all contain pairs of parallel helical protofilaments as their basic building block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Popp et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2010c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Ent et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galkin et al., 2012</xref>). Presumably, the membrane-binding ability of MreB and FtsA constrains their filament architecture to straight (or slightly bent), rather than helical, pairs of protofilaments. But how are these filaments arranged?</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that MreB from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments as revealed by crystal structures, an architecture unprecedented among actin-like proteins. The antiparallel arrangement ensures that the amphipathic helix of each protofilament binds to membranes as shown by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Pairs of protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and these are shown to be oriented in an antiparallel fashion by in vivo cross-linking. The mechanism for protofilament formation of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> MreB is elucidated by crystallography and shown to be reminiscent of that of other actin-like proteins, revealing the typical domain closure upon polymerisation. Finally, co-crystallisation studies of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB with the antimicrobial reagents A22 and MP265 explain their inhibitory mechanism and shed light on the activation mechanism of ATP hydrolysis during polymerisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB reveals double, antiparallel filaments</title><p>Structural insight into MreB from mesophilic bacteria has been hampered by the tendency of the proteins to aggregate upon purification, but through biochemical and bioengineering tools sufficient quantities of stable versions of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> MreB were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) that were amenable to structural studies. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) make the protein (ΔCcMreBdh) less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB (ΔCcMreBdh) reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kabsch and Holmes, 1995</xref>). Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B. Domain II is structurally the most preserved domain within the actin family of proteins, whereas domain IB is the most diverse. But even this domain is very similar in both <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> MreB (TmMreBh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>), superimposing with an RMSD of 0.97 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The protofilament architecture is also very well conserved, with an identical subunit repeat distance of 51.1 Å and a similar arrangement of the longitudinal interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, only single protofilaments were present in the <italic>Thermotoga</italic> MreB crystals, despite the fact that electron microscopy images clearly show doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, the crystals of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> MreB contain doublets that, remarkably, crystallised in an antiparallel arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The electrostatic surface potential of the double protofilaments reveals the hydrophobic loop and the basic charges surrounding the membrane-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of proteins used in this study</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02634.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02634.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> MreB (GenBank: ACL95077.1)</td></tr><tr><td> CcMreB</td><td>M1-CcMreB-A347</td></tr><tr><td> ΔCcMreBh</td><td>M-I9-CcMreB-A347-GSHHHHHH</td></tr><tr><td> ΔCcMreBdh</td><td>M-I9-CcMreB(F102S, V103G)-A347-GSHHHHHH</td></tr><tr><td> ΔCcMreBdmh</td><td>M-I9-CcMreB(F102S, V103G, S283D)-A347-GSHHHHHH</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> MreB1 (GenBank:AAD35673.1)</td></tr><tr><td> TmMreB</td><td>M1-TmMreB-G336</td></tr><tr><td> TmMreBh</td><td>M1-TmMreB-G336-GSHHHHHH</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between crystal structures from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and <italic>T. maritima</italic> MreB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The crystal structure of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> MreB (ΔCcMreBdh, d_3 [see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>] shown in dark colours) superimposes on that of <italic>T. maritima</italic> MreBh (PDB code 1JCG, shown in pastel colours) with an overall RMSD of 0.97 Å over 310 aligned residues and a Z-value of 20.95.

Although the resolution is low, the entire double protofilament structure of ΔCcMreBdh fits nicely into the 2D averaged EM images with a longitudinal subunit repeat of 5.1 nm and the widths of the doublet encompassing 6.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The previously reported placement of two single protofilaments of TmMreB into 2D averaged filaments, though merely an educated guess at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salje et al., 2011</xref>), turned out to be right. By introducing a single point mutation in the interprotofilament interface of CcMreB (V118E), single protofilaments are formed as shown by negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Pairs of protofilaments of CcMreB distort liposomes as seen by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and coat the membrane extensively (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> to uncoated membranes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The irregular arrangement of CcMreB filaments on liposomes makes it unsuitable for subtomogram averaging. Hence, we turned to rigid lipid tubes made of <italic>E. coli</italic> total lipid extract mixed with C24:1 β-D galactosyl ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parmenter and Stoilova-McPhie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parmenter et al., 2008</xref>). These tubes remain straight in the presence of MreB and are suitable for obtaining higher resolution reconstructions revealing a side view that shows how the protein coats the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Although overall appearances are very similar, TmMreB forms much straighter protofilaments on lipid tubes than CcMreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), making TmMreB more amenable to subtomogram averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). Both 2D and 3D averaging unambiguously show how close an MreB filament sits on the tubes, extending the thickness of the density including the lipid bilayer to 12.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the bilayer is resolved well and the longitudinal repeat distance of the columns protruding from the outer leaflet is in agreement with the expected subunit repeat of 5.1 nm in TmMreB protofilaments. Also, subtomogram averaging clearly demonstrates that membrane binding of MreB distorts the outer, but not the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, which is in agreement with the proposed binding mode of TmMreB via a hydrophobic loop. It is not very surprising to us that MreB has not been seen in cells by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Swulius et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swulius and Jensen, 2012</xref>), as tomograms of cells are usually taken at rather low magnification and high defocus, leading to a resolution lower than what is needed to resolve the leaflets of the lipid bilayer, let alone, an MreB filament from the protein-embedded membrane.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MreB forms double protofilaments on a lipid bilayer and distorts liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Negative stained electron microscopy image of untagged CcMreB double protofilaments assembled on lipid monolayer at 0.25 mg/ml in the presence of ATP.

Additional FtsZ is provided indirectly from a second plasmid (pFB112) that constitutively expresses the transcription factor SdiA, ensuring elevated levels of FtsQAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú and de Boer, 2008</xref>).

This complex genetic set up enables investigation of the phenotype of MreB containing mutations that might render the protein non-functional, since MreB is essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Altered versions of MreB were introduced that carried a mutation disrupting either the intra- or interprotofilament interface (EcMreB-S284D or EcMreB-V121E, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), as deduced from the crystal structure. Indeed, a single mutation in the intra-protofilamant interface renders the protein monomeric as shown by structural analysis of the equivalent mutant S283D in CcMreB (presented below), whereas a single mutation in the interprotofilament interface results in single protofilaments as discussed above (CcMreB-V118E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the absence of MreB, cells are spherical (first column <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but they revert back to rod shape when expressing wild-type MreB (second column <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

These results demonstrate firstly that MreB protofilament formation is essential for cell shape maintenance and secondly that these protofilaments need to interact with their flat sides to make functional MreB filaments.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pairs of MreB protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the genetic set-up to examine cell shape maintenance by intra- and inter-protofilament mutants of MreB.

To verify that the antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments observed both in EM and in the crystal structure reflects the functional state of MreB in cells, site-specific cross-linking was performed. Cysteine residues were introduced at specific sites in and outside the protofilament interface and mutated MreB was expressed in the MreB knockout strain as described above. But before that, cysteine residues present in native MreB had to be mutated to serine residues to ensure that any cross-linked product would arise from the newly introduced cysteine(s). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, the cysteine-free form of MreB fully complemented an <italic>mreB</italic> knockout strain. At late log phase, the cysteine mutants were subjected to the thiol-reactive cross-linker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE). Thiol-reactive cross-linkers work by forming covalent bonds between two cysteine residues. As the protofilaments in the antiparallel arrangement are symmetry-related, certain single cysteine locations may produce a cross-linked dimer as long as the distance between the mutated residues is within reach of the cross-linker arm (∼8 Å).

Crystal structures of CcMreB in different nucleotide states, either as a monomer or as a polymer, were determined to a resolution better than 2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Most crystal structures were obtained using ΔCcMreBdh, which behaved biochemically better than the full-length protein, yet was still showing correct filament formation as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. A single mutation in the intra-protofilament interface (S283D, ΔCcMreBdmh) renders the protein monomeric, as shown both by crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This mutant turned out to be most useful in studying the polymerisation cycle. From looking at the crystal structures of MreB in different nucleotide states, it immediately becomes apparent that surprisingly small structural changes can trigger MreB polymerisation. Monomeric CcMreB shows little structural movement between the ADP- and the ATP analogue AMPPNP-bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) with domains I and II overlapping with an RMSD of 1.58 and 0.57 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). An initial domain closure is observed upon binding of AMMPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) by the monomer. This movement progresses into a full propeller twist once it reaches the double protofilament state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Upon polymerisation, domain IB shows a rotation of 21.7° towards the nucleotide binding cleft as analysed by Dyndom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayward and Lee, 2002</xref>). This domain closure is accompanied by a twist between domains IA and IIA, as can be appreciated from the top view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref> and from the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The relatively small conformational change upon polymerisation has a dramatic effect on the chemistry of the active site. In the AMPPNP protofilament conformation, the active site residues E140 and T167 coordinate a water molecule that is in line for the hydrophilic attack on the gamma phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In the monomeric state, the active site residue E140 of MreB has moved away from the nucleotide by just 1 Å. But consequently, it can no longer coordinate the attacking water, which is absent in this structure, and thus renders the monomer inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Once MreB is in the polymeric state, the presence or absence of nucleotide has very little effect on the overall structure, which is presumably stabilised by inter- and intra-protofilament contacts. The mechanism of disintegration of the polymer remains to be elucidated.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of MreB in different nucleotide states reveal a propeller twist.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of crystal structures of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> MreB in different nucleotide states as listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> show movement in domain I rather than domain II.

The anomalous difference map reveals the positions of the chlorine atoms of A22 and the di-phosphate of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). At 1.5 Å resolution, it absolutely defines the exact position of a small molecule like A22. Because MP265 is much more manageable, co-crystals of MP265 and ΔCcMreBdh were obtained in the presence of both ADP and AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The crystal structures of the complexes show that the inhibitor most likely prevents phosphate release in the MreB protofilament: MP265 blocks the exit channel for the phosphate and binds directly to the active site residue E140, preventing it from coordinating the catalytic water. In addition, it binds to the gamma phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, crystals containing the MreB-inhibitor complex always contain single, rather than double protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). A closer look at the inter-protofilament interface explains why double protofilaments can no longer form: as the inhibitor prevents the main dimerisation helix (Ala117-Ala130) from reaching into the interface, it causes weakening of the inter-protofilament contacts and likely reduces stability of the double protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.018</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Crystallographic data</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02634.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02634.018</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Tray</th><th>Protein</th><th>SG</th><th>Cell [Å]</th><th>Res.

It ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments are able to interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Ent et al., 2010</xref>). In vivo evidence shows that the antiparallel arrangement is not an in vitro artefact and does indeed reflect the filament architecture in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>). Filament formation could have a synergistic effect on the elongasome by bringing together components that reach a higher local concentration through the interaction with polymeric MreB. Given the almost surprising high degree of similarity between the structures of MreB from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it is expected that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is conserved among the bacterial kingdom. This has far reaching consequences for the molecular mechanism of MreB's function. Actin, MamK, ParM, and the other plasmid-segregating, actin-like proteins form pairs of protofilaments with subunits facing the same direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ozyamak et al., 2013b</xref>). In F-actin, the polar ends exhibit different growth and shrinkage rates and selectively interact with binding partners that affect filament protection or nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pollard and Mooseker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wegner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pollard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Selve and Wegner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</xref>). Pairs of parallel ParM protofilaments extend from the ParRC-interacting end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>). Discrimination of either end has to be absent in the antiparallel arrangement found in the doublets of MreB protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and hence MreB filaments must grow and shrink from both ends. The bidirectional movement of MreB filaments in vivo is in agreement with the above hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reimold et al., 2013</xref>).

It has to be determined whether MreB filaments fluctuate at a steady state, growing and shrinking from both ends, or exhibit dynamic instability leading to catastrophic disassembly, as described in detail for ParM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gayathri et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All MreB proteins studied to date by EM appear in pairs rather than isolated single protofilaments, indicating that double protofilaments could be more stable and/or that filament nucleation requires inter-protofilament contacts. In vitro, single CcMreB protofilaments can only be formed upon disruption of the protofilament interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the equivalent mutation in vivo renders the protein non-functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the presence of the antimicrobial agents A22 and MP265, MreB forms single but no double protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). By dislocating one of the dimerisation helices and thereby weakening the inter-protofilament interface, the inhibitor might destabilise the MreB filament. This would explain the disruption of MreB filaments by A22 as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Association of protofilaments into filaments is unique for each actin-like protein and appropriate for their function. F-actin forms parallel, two-stranded helical filaments with a right-handed twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huxley, 1963</xref>), plasmid segregating protein ParM forms parallel helical filaments with a left-handed twist, that arrange in an antiparallel fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Popp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>), whereas cell division protein FtsA forms pairs of straight filaments with unknown orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). Low-resolution images of actin-like protein Alp12 suggest that two pairs of parallel filaments twist around each other in an antiparallel fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Popp et al., 2012</xref>), whereas MamK and Crenactin form a two-stranded, non-staggered helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozyamak et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindås et al., 2014</xref>). Despite these variations in overall filament architecture, the head-to-tail arrangement of subunits in a single protofilament is surprisingly conserved, given the low sequence similarity (∼15%). In addition, all protofilaments interact with each other using their flat sides, irrespective of the filament architecture. Moreover, the propeller twist required for filament dynamics in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis is preserved. The result of the propeller twist is the closure of domains I and II and the flattening of one side of the molecule that makes the inter-protofilament interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The recently published molecular dynamics simulations of MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colavin et al., 2014</xref>) are in agreement with this observation. Furthermore, detailed structural studies of the different nucleotide states of the best studied actin-like proteins MreB and ParM show that the polymerisation cycle is fairly conserved, with the largest domain movement taking place upon the transition from the monomeric state to the polymeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>]). In both proteins, the active site geometry in the filament conformation favours nucleotide hydrolysis, which is driven by a catalytic glutamate (E140 in CcMreB and E148 in ParM) that positions the catalytic water in line with the gamma phosphate. The co-crystal structures of AMPPNP-bound CcMreB with the inhibitor confirm the critical role of this catalytic residue E140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the AMPPNP-bound monomer conformation, no catalytic water is present in CcMreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), whereas the catalytic water in monomeric AMPPNP-bound ParM has moved away from the ideal geometry, thus hampering hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gayathri et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported previously that MreB can polymerise in the presence of either ATP or GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>). From the ΔCcMreBdh co-crystal structures with ADP and AMPPNP, it is clear that the active site could well accommodate a guanidine instead of an adenine as the major contacts are with the ribose and phosphate moieties of the nucleotide, a feature, again, shared with ParM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gayathri et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings describe a novel architecture of actin-like protofilament pairs that is unprecedented among the actin family of proteins, whether of eukaryotic or prokaryotic origin. The straight, antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments ensures that each subunit can interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome. The non-polar nature of MreB filaments explains common assembly and disassembly kinetics for both filament ends. Future experiments will explore the implications of the antiparallel architecture of MreB on cell wall synthesis and investigate whether MreB dictates bidirectional growth of the cell wall.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of MreB proteins from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>T. maritima</italic></title><p>Genes of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> MreB (GenBank: ACL95077.1) and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> MreB1 (GenBank: AAD35673.1) were cloned into the small T7-vector pHis17 (Bruno Miroux, personal communication) by means of PCR and restriction cloning, encoding for the his-tagged proteins: ΔCcMreBh (CCM2), ΔCcMreBdh (pFE397), and ΔCcMreBdmh (CCM3).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Laub; Ethan Garner.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, all three reviewers agreed that this is a very nice paper showing that MreB can form an unprecedented, antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments. The use mutagenesis, crosslinking, crystallography, and EM studies yields a very complete story. The exploration of the nucleotide cycle of MreB and data indicating how the small molecule inhibitors A22 and MP265 affect MreB function were also deemed exciting new findings. There was agreement that the paper represents a major advance and will have broad appeal, and is therefore a good candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, before accepting the paper, there were several issues raised by all or, in some cases, two of the reviewers that should be addressed in a revised manuscript. To summarize, these issues are: 1) concern about the claims made regarding potential dynamic instability of MreB filaments, 2) concerns about the interpretation of the effects of point mutants. These concerns are described in more detail below and represent an integration and merging of comments from all three reviewers. Some of the concerns raised can be addressed through additional experiments, while others might be resolved through clarification of the text.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1a, from Reviewer 2) The in vivo dynamics of MreB assembly remain unclear; no motor for MreB movement has yet been established. Existing evidence demonstrates that the bidirectional movement of MreB in E. coli is cell-wall synthesis dependent (van Teeffelen et al, PNAS 2011), and recent models suggest that MreB filaments are stable in vivo, and that their movement may be the result of a passive movement on the membrane (Ursell et al, PNAS 2014). Other in vitro work fails to see any turnover of MreB after polymers are sheared (in contrast to actin) (Esue et al, JBC 2012). Given that the authors only give qualitative monomeric structural comparisons with ParM as evidence for the proposal that MreB dynamics are driven by dynamic assembly, I am skeptical of their conclusions that MreB operates through a dynamic instability mechanism.</p><p>Similarly, the claim that filaments must grow from both ends due to the symmetric nature of the double-protofilaments crystal structure must be considered outside the context of crystallography. For example, actin has not been crystallized as a filament due to non-integer repeat of filament. Similarly, MreB assembly in the presence (this work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salje et al, 2011</xref>) and absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Ent et al, 2001</xref>, many others) of liposomes shows that MreB filaments can take on curved and straight conformations. Indeed, the cryo-EM averaging in this work could only be done on lipid rods that constrained MreB to straight filaments. Crystallographic methods are biased toward solving straight filaments, which leads to a concern and a comment. Firstly, the bending of filaments readily seen in vivo (and presumably required for curvature sensing; see Ursell et al, PNAS 2014) must break the symmetry of the anti-parallel filament. The authors must reconcile this in their discussion of possible MreB dynamics. Secondly, it would be intriguing to hear the authors comment on how monomer conformation (and hence nucleotide hydrolysis) is affected by filament bending.</p><p>A recent paper simulating Thermotoga MreB molecular dynamics (Colavin et. al, PNAS 2014) finds a nucleotide and polymerization dependent monomer conformation in quantitative agreement with the authors' structures; namely that the monomer hinges via a “propeller twist” around the nucleotide binding site. Interestingly, that paper also mentions that recent F-actin fibre-diffraction models (Oda et al, Nature 2009 and others) reveal similar propeller twists upon polymerization (which can add to the authors' discussion of ParM polymerization in the Discussion section). This is in conflict with the discussion of MreB being more ParM-like, but could serve as a resolution to the comments above.</p><p>It is also unclear in the Discussion section what “strained” MreB conformation refers to in the comparison to ParM?</p><p>1b, from Reviewer 3) The most important point that should be addressed in this paper is the authors’ speculation on dynamic instability. The authors offer 2 possibilities for the dynamics of MreB, treadmilling, and dynamic instability. They argue as the filaments are not structurally polar, the filaments are likely to display dynamic instability. This is not an accurate comparison. Structural polarity (or assembly) is different than dynamic instability. One is a spatial property; the other is a kinetic and energetic property.</p><p>a) Filaments that are structurally polar need not only display treadmilling: 1) Actin filaments at steady state can be seen to fluctuate rather than treadmill. 2) ParM has been shown to elongate bidirectionally by both the Mullins group [Garner, E. C, Campbell, C. S., R. D. Mullins, Dynamic instability in a DNA-segregating prokaryotic actin homolog, Science 306, 1021-1025 (2004)] and the Lowe group [P. Gayathri et al., A bipolar spindle of antiparallel ParM filaments drives bacterial plasmid segregation, Science 338, 1334-1337 (2012)]. 3) In fact, much work [D. Sept, A. H. Elcock, J. A. McCammon, Computer simulations of actin polymerization can explain the barbed-pointed end asymmetry, J Mol Biol 294, 1181-1189 (1999)], even back to the beginnings of the study of actin (early Marie France papers) have gone into understanding why filaments undergo polar growth.</p><p>b) Nonpolar filaments, such as intermediate filaments and CreS also are able to fluctuate at steady state.</p><p>c) Third: Dynamic instability is an energetic and kinetic property, that can only arise when here is a substantial energy difference between 2 forms of the polymer, and a stochastic switch between states to yield the fast catastrophes. As of yet, the authors have no kinetic or equilibrium data on MreB polymerization to make this claim.</p><p>In this reviewer's opinion, it would behoove the authors to include a third possibility that MreB filaments are fluctuating at steady state, growing and shrinking. While the ADP bound MreB may fall off far faster than the ATP form, this difference may not be fast enough to cause catastrophes.</p><p>While it is a sound conclusion that MreB filaments are incapable of displaying treadmilling, there is no evidence they display dynamic instability as of yet. It is far more likely that they simply fluctuate at the ends, with the respective ADP / ATP affinities. It would be far safer for the authors to state all three possibilities, especially as photobleaching in B. Subtilis has shown that MreB filaments are remarkable stable [J. Domínguez-Escobar et al., Processive movement of MreB-associated cell wall biosynthetic complexes in bacteria, Science 333, 225-228 (2011)].</p><p>2a) Fully complementing fluorescent fusions of MreB (both wild-type and point-mutants) have proven difficult to construct in the lab, suggesting that many single amino-acid perturbations, be it at the interface or not, can be enough to disrupt proper MreB function.</p><p>In the text, the authors present the monomeric crystal structure of intra-protofilament point mutant S283D as evidence the double-protofilament assembly is disrupted. I have two questions with this experiment as it stands. First, given the comment above, the manuscript is missing a convincing control demonstrating that that double-protofilament assembly can still occur when minor mutations are introduced in parts of the protein not essential for polymerization (such as the RodZ binding interface?)</p><p>Second, wouldn't the prediction of an inter-protofilament mutation be that MreB would be solved as single protofilaments, instead of as a monomer? The authors should address these questions through control experiments in their revision.</p><p>I am similarly confused by the A22 results in the paragraph on lines 328-337 in which they introduce two conflicting observations: that A22 stabilizes single protofilaments in A22 AMPPNP condition, and that this therefore destabilizes filaments in vivo. Why doesn't this perturbation lead to non-polymerized monomer crystals?</p><p>Also, how do the authors reconcile the conflicting data that A22 at once stabilizes the protofilament, but destabilizes all MreB puncta in vivo?</p><p>2b) The mutation V121E is predicted to eliminate inter-protofilament interactions. But does it also impact individual protofilament formation? It seems like the authors should somehow verify that this substitution specifically impacts inter-filament interaction, as predicted by the crystal structure.</p><p>3) The data presented nicely indicate that A22 and MP265 do not prevent nucleotide binding, but instead likely prevent release of phosphate from hydrolyzed ATP. Can this model be directly tested biochemically through detection of free Pi levels?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02634.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1a, from Reviewer 2) The in vivo dynamics of MreB assembly remain unclear; no motor for MreB movement has yet been established.

We only mentioned dynamic instability in the context of what is possible given the newly discovered antiparallel, non-polar filament architecture of MreB. Dynamic instability is a possible mechanism for MreB’s disassembly, if it happens in cells, as it would be compatible with an antiparallel protofilament arrangement, which treadmilling is not. To make this clearer, we have tuned down the discussion on dynamic instability as it is outside the scope of the paper and we provide no evidence for what is happening in terms of disassembly other than stating what is possible in principle. We now briefly mention the consequences of non-polar filament ends on filament dynamics at the end of the first paragraph of the discussion.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the claim that filaments must grow from both ends due to the symmetric nature of the double-protofilaments crystal structure must be considered outside the context of crystallography.

Secondly, filament bending does not necessarily break the symmetry of the anti-parallel protofilaments as they bend perpendicular to the two-fold symmetry axis. Thirdly, as discussed below, the crystal structures of different nucleotide states show CcMreB in straight conformations, indicating that the nucleotide itself is not the sole determining factor of whether a filament is bent or not. This of course is a hornet’s nest – similar discussions have dominated the tubulin field for many years with the ‘lattice model’ and the nucleotide state models fighting it out.</p><p><italic>A recent paper simulating Thermotoga MreB molecular dynamics (Colavin et. al, PNAS 2014) finds a nucleotide and polymerization dependent monomer conformation in quantitative agreement with the authors' structures; namely that the monomer hinges via a “propeller twist” around the nucleotide binding site.

As already mentioned briefly, the only conclusion we wanted to draw from our observations is that the antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments dictates non-polar filaments ends and consequently MreB’s inability to treadmill – a finding the reviewer agrees with and calls it ‘sound’. We fully agree with Reviewer 3 that we know too little to draw any conclusions on the dynamic behaviour of MreB, both in vitro and in vivo at this stage. We have deleted the paragraph on dynamic instability and briefly mention the consequences of non-polar filament ends on filament dynamics, including the possibility of a fluctuating state at the end of the first paragraph of the discussion. We would like to thank the reviewer for such an in depth treatment of the problem – clearly more things to do in the future!</p><p><italic>2a) Fully complementing fluorescent fusions of MreB (both wild-type and point-mutants) have proven difficult to construct in the lab, suggesting that many single amino-acid perturbations, be it at the interface or not, can be enough to disrupt proper MreB function</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree with the comment in #2a that any alterations to a filament forming protein like MreB can be misleading. Having said that, fluorescent fusions of MreB used in most of the live-cell imaging papers are a much bigger intrusion and hence more likely to affect MreB’s polymerisation behaviour than the carefully chosen single point mutations we present. But, even some of those point mutations either in- or outside the polymerisation interface can affect MreB’s function, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>In the text, the authors present the monomeric crystal structure of intra-protofilament point mutant S283D as evidence the double-protofilament assembly is disrupted.

The authors should address these questions through control experiments in their revision</italic>.</p><p>Many thanks for this great suggestion! We performed EM studies with the inter-protofilament mutation V118E in full-length CcMreB and indeed it forms single protofilaments, now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>I am similarly confused by the A22 results in the paragraph on lines 328-337 in which they introduce two conflicting observations: that A22 stabilizes single protofilaments in A22 AMPPNP condition, and that this therefore destabilizes filaments in vivo. Why doesn't this perturbation lead to non-polymerized</italic> <italic>monomer crystals?</italic></p><p>The co-crystals of ΔCcMreBdh with A22 or MP265, show that the main dimerization helix is dislocated, resulting in the occurrence of single protofilaments. This, in combination with the lack of in vivo complementation of the interprotofilament mutation EcMreB-V121E, made us propose that part of the inhibitory function of these antimicrobial agents is interference with double protofilament formation, which is essential for MreB’s function in vivo<italic>.</italic> In the crystals, the single protofilaments are stabilised by crystal contacts. The truth is that this is a speculation, of course, and it is phrased like that in the text.</p><p><italic>Also, how do the authors reconcile the conflicting data that A22 at once stabilizes the protofilament, but destabilizes</italic> <italic>all MreB puncta in vivo?</italic></p><p>We do not propose that A22 stabilises protofilaments; we found that CcMreB-A22 co-crystals exclusively contain single rather than double protofilaments. We do not know whether single protofilaments can actually exist in the cell, but we do know that they are not functional (inter-protofilament mutation). Secondly, the amount of A22 normally used in vivo is high enough to make MreB precipitate, as it is a very small molecule that probably intercalates many proteins including MreB.</p><p><italic>2b) The mutation V121E is predicted to eliminate inter-protofilament interactions. But does it also impact individual protofilament formation? It seems like the authors should somehow verify that this substitution specifically impacts inter-filament interaction, as predicted by the crystal structure</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for raising this clarifying question. As mentioned already, we have now included an EM image of negatively stained single protofilaments obtained with full-length CcMreB-V118E shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (the equivalent mutation in EcMreB, V121E, does not complement an <italic>mreB</italic> deletion strain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The data presented nicely indicate that A22 and MP265 do not prevent nucleotide binding, but instead likely prevent release of phosphate from hydrolyzed ATP. Can this model be directly tested biochemically through</italic> <italic>detection of free Pi levels?</italic></p><p>In our hands, purified TmMreB or CcMreB does not hydrolyse ATP and hence we cannot test the effect of the MreB inhibitors on phosphate release. This is a bit reminiscent of the FtsA situation (which we propose is the ‘analogue’ of MreB in the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szwedziak and Löwe, 2013</xref>)) and we would propose that MreB (like FtsA) requires an external activator for hydrolysis to become measurable. Of course, currently we cannot formally exclude that there is something else wrong, since it is a negative result. The active site of MreB looks complete, though.</p></body></sub-article></article>
