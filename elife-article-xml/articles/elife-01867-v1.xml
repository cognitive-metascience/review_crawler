temporal scale. We used magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous activity to characterize whole-brain functional connectivity dynamics at high temporal resolution. Using a novel approach that identifies the points in time at which unique patterns of activity recur, we reveal transient (100–200 ms) brain states with spatial topographies similar to those of well-known resting state networks. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these states, we demonstrate that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by coordinated neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown. We further evaluate cross-network interactions, and show that anticorrelation between the default mode network and parietal regions of the dorsal attention network is consistent with an inability of the system to transition directly between two transient brain states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01867.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01867.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When subjects lie motionless inside scanners without any particular task to perform, their brains show stereotyped patterns of activity across regions known as resting state networks. Each network consists of areas with a common function, such as the ‘motor’ network or the ‘visual’ network. The role of resting state networks is unclear, but these spontaneous activity patterns are altered in disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>One puzzling feature of resting state networks is that they seem to last for relatively long times. However, the majority of studies into resting state networks have used fMRI brain scans, in which changes in the level of oxygen in the blood are used as a proxy for the activity of a given brain region. Since changes in blood oxygen occur relatively slowly, the ability of fMRI to detect rapid changes in activity is limited: it is thus possible that the long-lived nature of resting state networks is an artefact of the use of fMRI.</p><p>Now, Baker et al. have used a different type of brain scan known as an MEG scan to show that the activity of resting state networks is shorter lived than previously thought. MEG scanners measure changes in the magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the brain, which means that they can detect alterations in brain activity much more rapidly than fMRI.</p><p>MEG recordings from the brains of nine healthy subjects revealed that individual resting state networks were typically stable for only 100 ms to 200 ms. Moreover, transitions between different networks did not occur randomly; instead, certain networks were much more likely to become active after others. The work of Baker et al. suggests that the resting brain is constantly changing between different patterns of activity, which enables it to respond quickly to any given situation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01867.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01867.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>magnetoencephalography</kwd><kwd>resting state</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd><kwd>non-stationary</kwd><kwd>hidden Markov model</kwd><kwd>microstates</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK Digital Economy programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Adam P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolrich</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolrich</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brookes</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health Human Connectome Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U54MH091657-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>The Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088312AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>The Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098369/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK MEG Partnership Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K005464/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolrich</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/J012041/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rezek</surname><given-names>Iead A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Wellcome Trust and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT 088877/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Probert Smith</surname><given-names>Penny J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These so-called resting state networks (RSNs) have been consistently identified across different subjects in the absence of any explicit task from covariations in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). These networks are known to have functional relevance and clinical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, an important limitation in our understanding of spontaneous activity is how the low frequency fluctuations typically associated with RSNs are related to the much faster timescales of cognitive and sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deco and Corbetta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raichle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). This is in part due to the fact that the indirect hemodynamic response measured via the BOLD signal precludes studying the rich temporal dynamics of the underlying electrophysiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logothetis, 2008</xref>). In contrast, non-invasive electrophysiological recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide a direct measure of neuronal activity at high temporal resolution. Recent studies using these modalities have revealed that these networks have an electrophysiological basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laufs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>), and are underpinned by much richer spatiotemporal dynamics that may be better characterized using time-varying measures of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brookes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hutchison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2012</xref>). These studies have shown evidence that functional connectivity within whole brain networks exhibit temporal variability on a time scale of seconds to tens of seconds. However, to provide an effective substrate for cognitive processes, functional networks should be able to rapidly reorganize and coordinate on a sub-second temporal scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bressler and Tognoli, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a study that identifies transient networks of brain activity, with no prior assumptions on the brain areas or time scales involved. This uses a distinct methodology based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), which infers a number of discrete brain states that recur at different points in time. Each inferred state corresponds to a unique pattern of whole-brain spontaneous activity, which is modeled by a multivariate normal distribution and a state time course indicating the points in time at which that state is active. These two outputs are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and allow us to describe both the spatial and temporal characteristics of each inferred state.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the HMM outputs.</title><p>An HMM with <italic>K</italic> states is inferred from band-limited amplitude envelopes of source reconstructed MEG data.

By inspection it is evident that the states are short lived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The temporal characteristics of each state may be quantified in terms of their fractional occupancy (fraction of the total time spent in a state; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), life times (time spent in a state before making a transition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and interval lengths (time between consecutive state visits; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Average life times are between 100 ms and 200 ms. These life times are markedly shorter in duration than the time scales typically associated with resting state networks, which have previously been shown to be dominated by frequencies below 0.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>). We also characterized variations in the rate at which these states are visited by computing the fractional occupancy within a 10-s sliding window.

To confirm that these brain states are consistent with coordinated fluctuations at these rapid time scales, we performed a follow up analysis using the inferred state time courses. We reasoned that if there were coordinated fluctuations at the fastest time scales in the state time course, then low pass filtered versions of the state time courses should do worse at explaining fluctuations in the data. Different low pass filtered versions of the state time courses were obtained by computing fractional occupancy time courses using a range of time windows from 0.1 to 8 s. Note that for the shortest time windows, the fractional occupancy time course approximates the state time course. These fractional occupancy time courses were then separately regressed onto the amplitude envelope time course from a representative voxel of the corresponding brain state (the voxel that most correlated with the state time course). This analysis reveals a peak in correlation for window widths between 200 ms and 400 ms, demonstrating that when using the fractional occupancy the fastest time scales at which we can detect fluctuations in the amplitude envelopes are slower than those suggested by the HMM state life-times (∼100 ms), but still much faster than has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the time scales that best reflect within-network envelope fluctuations.</title><p>Partial correlation maps and fractional occupancy time window dependency are shown for (<bold>A</bold>) DMN, (<bold>B</bold>) visual network and (<bold>C</bold>) sensorimotor network.

The group-concatenated amplitude envelopes were low pass filtered below 0.5 Hz to remove any higher frequency dynamics and an 8 state HMM was inferred from these filtered envelopes. Despite removing the faster envelope fluctuations, a number of states were inferred with similar spatial topographies as the original HMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The life times of these states were longer, at around 1 s, reflecting the slower time scales of these low pass filtered signals. Next, to test whether simply introducing high frequency noise could result in shorter life times, band-limited Gaussian noise (low pass filtered below 10 Hz, reflecting the spectral content of the original envelopes, and therefore with the same non-independence properties between time points), were added to the envelopes prior to inferring the HMM. As before, states with spatial topographies similar to the original HMM states were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the life times of these states were now much shorter, at around 0.3 s.</p><p>As with the real data, we then fitted a GLM with a single regressor that corresponded to the fractional occupancy time course computed using a range of time windows from 0.1 s to 8 s. When applied to the low pass filtered dataset (without added Gaussian noise; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), this analysis reveals a peak in correlation for a window width of ∼1 s, consistent with the longer state life times. However, for the low pass filtered data set with added Gaussian noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while the state life times were reduced to ∼100 ms, the peak in correlation remains at a window width of ∼1 s. This demonstrates that in this control there are no detectable within-network amplitude fluctuations faster than 1 s, which is consistent with the applied 0.5 Hz low pass filtering. This is in stark contrast to the real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where the analysis reveals a peak in correlation for window widths between 200 ms and 400 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>State transitions reveal cross-network interactions</title><p>Networks of whole brain spontaneous activity may be characterized not only in terms of their within-network activity, but also in terms of cross-network interactions. To assess the relationship between different functional networks in the context of the HMM, we examined the relationship between the points in time at which different states are active. An important result from fMRI studies is the observation that the DMN exhibits anticorrelation with networks associated with attention demanding tasks, such as the dorsal attention network (DAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Of particular interest therefore is the relationship between state 1, which represents the DMN, and state 7, which we postulate may represent parietal regions of the DAN. While the correspondence between BOLD and electrophysiological activity has yet to be fully understood, it has been shown that alpha and beta power at rest correlate positively with BOLD in the DMN and negatively with BOLD in the DAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mantini et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, increased activity in the DMN (red/yellow in state 1) and decreased activity in parietal regions of the DAN (blue in state 7) would both correspond to an increase in the BOLD signal. Based on this reasoning, we hypothesized that the antagonistic behavior of these two networks as shown in multiple fMRI studies would manifest in the inferred HMM states as an anticorrelation between the fractional occupancy time courses of these two states. In other words, periods of time in which the DMN state is frequently visited would coincide with periods of time in which the putative DAN state is rarely visited (and vice versa).</p><p>To this end, we computed the correlation coefficient between the fractional occupancy time courses for each state (computed within 10-s sliding windows as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Positive correlations between a pair of states indicate that the two states are visited more frequently during similar periods of time. As predicted, we found strong antagonistic behavior between the DMN (state 1) and the putative DAN (state 7), suggesting an electrophysiological basis to the anticorrelated nature of these networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Relationship between states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation matrix between the fractional occupancy time courses of each state.

There is a clear structure to the matrix showing that transitions between certain pairs of states are more likely than others. A number of these transitions are intuitive, for example the strong probability of transitioning between visual states 2 and 6. There is a very low probability of transitioning between the DMN (state 1) and the putative DAN (state 7), raising the intriguing possibility that anticorrelation between these networks may arise from an inability of the system to transition directly between these two transient states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Occurrence of transient states reflect temporal variability in functional connectivity</title><p>A number of previous studies have assessed the temporal dynamics of resting state connectivity by computing measures of functional connectivity such as band-limited amplitude correlation within sliding time windows of several seconds or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brookes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Pasquale et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate whether any relationship exists between temporal variability in amplitude correlation and the occurrence of states inferred from the HMM, we computed the sliding window envelope correlation between different nodes of the DMN and compared the resulting correlation time courses with changes in the fractional occupancy of the inferred DMN state. Regions of interest were defined in the centers of the nodes corresponding to the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The envelope of oscillatory activity was computed at these six locations for each subject. With reference to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>), envelope correlation was computed within 10-s sliding windows between all six ipsilateral ROI pairs and all three contralateral ROI pairs. The HMM state corresponding to the DMN was identified and the fractional occupancy was computed within the same 10-s sliding window. The time courses of these two measures are shown for a single subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, where the DMN pair shown is the right IPL and right MFG. In line with previous findings, it is evident that the envelope correlation between different network nodes alternates between periods of high and low correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, periods of high envelope correlation are generally associated with an increase in the fractional occupancy of the DMN state, suggesting that fluctuations in interregional functional connectivity represent periods of time in which a particular transient network is frequently visited. This relationship may be quantified as the correlation between the two time series for each subject and node pair. There is a clear positive correlation between the two measures for all inter- and intra-hemispheric pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison between HMM state occupancy and sliding window envelope correlation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Six nodes identified from the DMN state (rIPL, lIPL, rMFG, lMFG, rMTG, lMTG).

Using a distinct methodology that is able to resolve changes in functional connectivity at high temporal resolution, we identified short-lived (100–200 ms) states that represent unique spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. The inferred states revealed spatial topographies that represent networks of spatially segregated brain regions that bear a strong similarity to seed based correlation or ICA derived RSNs in both MEG and fMRI. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these states, we demonstrated that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Large-scale transient networks of spontaneous oscillatory activity</title><p>By inferring an HMM from the amplitude envelopes of group-concatenated data, we identified spatial maps representing state specific increases in oscillatory amplitude in anatomical locations corresponding to well-known RSNs. These networks include the default mode, visual and sensorimotor networks and parietal regions of the DAN.</p><p>In addition to inferring the spatial covariance structure, the HMM also infers the time points at which each state is active. Each state was well represented over the group with all occupancies between 5% and 20% of the total time. The state life times were short, between 100 ms and 200 ms on average. These findings demonstrate that RSNs derived from conventional techniques such as ICA or seed–based correlation may be identified from discrete transient epochs that represent only a small fraction of the total recording, confirming recent studies from both fMRI and MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Duyn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Pasquale et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Due to the assumption of mutual exclusivity of the HMM states, we should be cautious in automatically interpreting the fast switching between states in the form of short life times as a property of the underlying spontaneous activity. After all, an attractive hypothesis is that the brain’s resting state activity consists of a finite number of unique networks that can overlap spatially and temporally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). However, these relatively weak assumptions render the hypothetical networks unidentifiable using existing decomposition techniques (to the best of our knowledge), and so further constraints are currently needed to proceed. For example, in temporal ICA the assumption of temporal independence will discourage temporal overlap. In the HMM, the mutual exclusion approach will also prohibit temporal overlap. As a result, the HMM states can perhaps be best thought of as representing the most dominant unique configurations of these hypothetical networks. Based on this interpretation, the state time courses provide a meaningful window on the underlying network dynamics by indicating the most dominant state at each point in time. Indeed, we have shown that these time courses can provide an insight into the relationship between different functional networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, the rate of occurrence of the inferred states as described by the fractional occupancy allows us to assess the time scales at which within-network amplitude fluctuations are detectable. By modeling these fluctuations using the fractional occupancy time course computed at a range of different window widths, we show that they are best described by sub-second temporal dynamics with coordinated fluctuations on the order of 200–400 ms. Importantly, these time scales were not found for control surrogate data, where the fast network interactions were replaced by uncorrelated noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cross-network interactions</title><p>The HMM assumes that the states themselves are mutually exclusive. It might be thought that this assumption negates the possibility of the HMM providing insight into cross-network (i.e., across-state) interactions. While this is true at the fast (below 100 ms) within-state time scales, this does not mean that we cannot assess cross-network interactions at all. In particular, the HMM furnishes us with the probability of transitioning between different networks. This can tell us if there is a preference for the brain to move between two different networks, or an antagonism such that there is rarely a transition between two different networks. Indeed, the relationship between the DMN (state 1) and parietal areas of the DAN (state 7) was shown to be an example of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We have also demonstrated how cross-network interactions can be assessed using fractional occupancy time courses, which describe how frequently states are visited within 10-s time windows. By computing correlations between these slower time courses, we can assess relationships between networks at the time scales more typically associated with previous investigations into long-range resting state interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). Of particular interest is the anticorrelation between the fractional occupancy time courses of the DMN state and the putative DAN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>The fact that cross-network relationships present in the fractional occupancy time courses are maintained when looking at the faster time scales of the state transitions, suggests a link between these two time scales. However, with the current methodology it is not possible to establish a causal link between these time scales (i.e., whether infrequent transitions arise because these networks are anticorrelated at longer time scales, or that this anticorrelation arises due to these infrequent transitions).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Correspondence with BOLD RSNs</title><p>The states inferred by the HMM show some consistency with RSNs measured using fMRI. The spatial correspondence between the spatial maps obtained via the HMM and RSNs derived from application of ICA to BOLD are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. A notable difference between these maps is the absence of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) or precuneus in the DMN state. One possible explanation is that the PCC may act as a functional ‘hub’, such that it is not strongly represented in any one state. While the HMM allows spatial overlap, we have visualized the states in terms of state-specific amplitude changes, such that any node that is active during a number of states will be suppressed in the spatial maps. It is possible that, as a hub, the PCC has membership in the majority of states and is therefore poorly identified by mapping state specific activity. However, it is not trivial to identify nodes that are active in multiple states because this is confounded by the spatial leakage due to the ambiguities in the source reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schoffelen and Gross, 2009</xref>).</p><p>While there is strong evidence for hub-like behavior of the PCC/precuneus in terms of structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sporns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagmann et al., 2008</xref>) and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomasi and Volkow, 2011</xref>) connectivity, evidence in MEG is more varied. Graph theoretical analyses of MEG band-limited power have revealed strong hubs in dorsal prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and temporal cortex (in essence those areas represented by state 1), but notably not the PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the PCC was not found to be present in RSNs derived from application of temporal ICA to MEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, an MEG-derived DMN comprising the PCC has been shown using seed–based correlation with the PCC as a seed, but only when restricted to time points in which the network was maximally correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Pasquale et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another reason why the PCC may not be present in the HMM is due to the relative insensitivity of MEG to deeper sources. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in the present study, and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hipp et al. (2012)</xref>, the sensor array comprised only axial gradiometers, which measure the spatial gradient of the field and are relatively insensitive to deep sources. Conversely, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Pasquale et al. (2012)</xref>, the array comprised magnetometers that have increased depth sensitivity. It is therefore possible that the PCC is not present simply because it does not generate a measurable signal.</p><p>Finally, it is worth considering to what extent the DMN or DAN, and the particular spatial nodes they incorporate, are definitive networks. The particular form of such networks is tied to the approaches used to identify them, for example spatial ICA. Indeed when other approaches with different assumptions are made, then different networks can be inferred. One good example of this is that, when using temporal ICA on fMRI data, no single DMN is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). In short, the concept of a ‘network’ and the form they take depends on the assumptions made in the data decomposition approach, and none should be considered necessarily better than the other (assuming they show similar objective performance, e.g., Bayesian model evidence and reproducibility), but instead they each offer different perspectives on the nature of the brain’s activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Relation to EEG microstates</title><p>The short life times inferred from the HMM raises the question of whether there exists a relationship between the states shown here and the ‘microstates’ found from EEG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koenig et al., 2005</xref>). Microstates are quasi-stable topographies in which the distribution of EEG power over the scalp remains stable for periods of around 100 ms. Clustering of these topographies into a limited number of classes has revealed that relatively few (typically four) unique maps are consistently identified across multiple time points and subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehmann et al., 1998</xref>). It has also been suggested that EEG microstates may represent the electrophysiological signatures of resting state networks. A number of recent studies have sought to investigate this by correlating fMRI RSNs with simultaneously acquired EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Segmentation of EEG scalp maps into microstates is based on finding repeating distributions of power across multiple recording sites and therefore captures similar interactions to those that drive the HMM. However, a clear distinction is that the HMM explicitly models the temporal dynamics and is therefore tuned to finding states that repeat in a predictable way. Another difference is that our approach exploits the superior spatial resolution available using MEG, by basing the inferred states on source space projections of MEG data. This makes results more directly interpretable in the context of fMRI resting state networks. While it is possible that the HMM states inferred in this paper relate to the source space counterparts of EEG microstates, without measuring EEG and MEG concurrently, a direct relationship cannot be confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Relationship with functional connectivity at slower time scales</title><p>The states inferred using the HMM represent networks of activity that show some consistency with those found previously using spatial ICA on FMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2009</xref>) and using temporal ICA on MEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luckhoo et al., 2012</xref>). In both the ICA and HMM approaches, data from all voxels are used and therefore no prior spatial localization assumptions (e.g., seed voxels) are required. In the case of temporal ICA, two regions will tend to be strongly represented in the same network if their time courses exhibit a strong time-averaged correlation with the same independent component. By contrast, in the case of the HMM, membership of two regions to a particular state (‘network’) depends only on there being a repeated pattern of covariance at those points in time at which the state is active, that is, it is not time averaged over ‘all’ time points. The results in this paper, for example the fact that the two approaches result in similar networks, are consistent with the idea that ICA RSNs derive from the transient time-varying behavior captured by the HMM states. This idea is supported by the findings that seed-based functional connectivity is increased if evaluated only within those time points at which the rest of the network is synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>). In this paper, we provide evidence of a relationship between the sliding window correlation computed between nodes of the DMN and the occurrence rate of the DMN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Accordingly, changes in within-network envelope correlation may reflect variations in the frequency at which a particular connectivity state is visited. One explanation for this observation is the idea that electrophysiological data are characterized by scale-free dynamics that span from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van de Ville et al., 2010</xref>). This fractal property of neural dynamics may provide an explanation for the similar spatial correlation structure that exists between signals at different temporal scales. Hence, slow fluctuations in band-limited amplitude correlations that underlie MEG RSNs may capture similar physiological phenomena as the HMM states, but seen through different temporal filters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>In the present study, the data for individual subjects were temporally concatenated, yielding a single combined data set from which the HMM was inferred. Group concatenation is widely used in unsupervised analyses of resting state activity, particularly in the case of ICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calhoun et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind that this approach assumes that there is an anatomical correspondence between subjects. In the case of ICA, this assumption means that individuals share common group maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calhoun et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of the HMM approach, this assumption extends to the requirement that the data from different individuals within a particular state are drawn from the same multivariate normal distribution, and that the transitions between these states occur in a repeatable manner over subjects. This being said, there is no requirement that all states should be present in all subjects, however it is clear from the fractional occupancy time courses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> that they are. In light of this assumption, states inferred from the group data may best be thought of as representing the spatiotemporal patterns of activity that occur most consistently over the group. An alternative strategy to group concatenation is to infer separate HMMs for each subject individually. This would allow the model to more freely adapt to individual subjects’ patterns of activity and functional connectivity. However, a severe limitation of this approach is that there will not necessarily be a correspondence between states inferred from different subjects, making it difficult to perform subsequent analyses at the group level.</p><p>A limitation of the proposed technique is that HMM inference requires an a priori specification of the number of states, K. Bayesian inference techniques provide a means to test model order selection, by providing an approximation to the model evidence via the free energy. In theory, it should be possible to pick the optimal number of states by selecting the model with the greatest (negative) free energy. In practice however, we observe that the free energy increases monotonically up to K = 15 states, suggesting that the Bayes-optimal model may require an even higher number of states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the absence of a straightforward data driven approach to model order selection, we opted instead to repeat the analysis for values of K from 4 to 15 and arbitrarily chose 8 states as the case to present here, which we believe represents a good trade-off between richness and redundancy. Results for different model orders are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Varying the number of states between 4 and 14 did not change the topographies of the most prominent RSN-like states. It is worth noting that a similar limitation exists for more established data-driven decompositions such as ICA, in which the choice of model order is driven by the application; for example, lower model orders are used to obtain the classic RSNs, and higher model orders are used to obtain finer grained parcellations for use in subsequent network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the observation model used in this paper corresponded to a multivariate normal distribution. The assumption of a Gaussian observation model allows inference of the HMM to be made tractable to variational Bayesian inference and thus permits its application to large amounts of data (40 observations and 1.5 hr of time points). However, it should be recognized that modeling only the first and second order statistics under a Gaussian assumption is likely to be an oversimplification of the underlying network dynamics. The multivariate normal distribution is just one of many potential observation models that may be used in the context of the HMM. For example, binary observation models have previously been used in the context of modeling interictal spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ossadtchi et al., 2005</xref>). Future work will focus on implementing a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model that can model time lagged dependencies between observations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Functional role of transient synchronization</title><p>The work presented here rests on the underlying assumption that resting state activity may be broken down into a set of distinct connectivity patterns that repeat over time and where only one functional state may be active at any one time. In other words, the states inferred by the HMM are mutually exclusive. While this assumption may be an oversimplification of the underlying network dynamics, the concept that there exist distinct functional connectivity states that recur at different points in time is compatible with computational models of neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deco et al., 2011</xref>) and observations from both fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>) and EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). The idea that RSNs represent states in which distributed cortical areas synchronize transiently is also compatible with the idea of a ‘dynamic repertoire’ of states that are continuously explored in order to more quickly adopt the network configuration optimal for a given impending input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deco et al., 2011</xref>). This organization of dynamic activity through transient spatial patterns of coordination may provide the flexibility required to adapt to the rapidly changing computational demands of cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bressler and Tognoli, 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Resting state MEG data were acquired from nine healthy subjects. The subjects were asked to lie in the scanner with their eyes open while 10 min of data were recorded. The MEG data were acquired using a 275 channel CTF whole-head system (MISL, Conquitlam, Canada) at a sampling rate of 600 Hz with a 150 Hz low pass anti-aliasing filter. Synthetic third order gradiometer correction was applied to reduce external interference. Localization of the head within the MEG helmet was achieved using three electromagnetic head position indicator (HPI) coils. By periodically energizing these coils their position within the MEG sensor array was identified. Prior to data acquisition, the HPI coil locations, the position of three fiducial points (the nasion, and left and right preauricular points), and the head shape were recorded using a three-dimensional digitizer (Polhemus Isotrack). MR images were acquired using a 3T Phillips Achieva MR system at 1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> resolution running an MPRAGE sequence. Each subject’s structural MRI was registered to the MNI152 standard brain such that all subsequent source space analysis was performed in MNI space. The locations of the MEG sensors with respect to the anatomy were determined by registering the digitized head surface to the head surface extracted from the structural MRI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p>The data were converted to SPM8 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link> and down sampled to 200 Hz. Each recording was visually inspected to identify channels and/or periods of data containing obvious artifacts or with abnormally high variance, which were discarded. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to decompose the sensor data for each session into 150 temporally independent components (tICs) and associated sensor topographies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/">http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica</ext-link>). Artifact components were classified via the following procedure. Eye-blink, cardiac and mains interference components were manually identified by the combined inspection of the spatial topography, time course, kurtosis of the time course and frequency spectrum for all components. Eye-blink artifacts typically exhibited high kurtosis (&gt;20), a repeated blink structure in the time course and very structured spatial topographies. Cardiac component time courses strongly resembled the typical ECG signals, as well as having high kurtosis (&gt;20). Mains interference had extremely low kurtosis (typically &lt;−1) and a frequency spectrum dominated by 50 Hz line noise. Following artifact rejection the data were frequency filtered into the 4–30 Hz band.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Source analysis</title><p>The pre-processed MEG data were projected onto a regular 8-mm grid spanning the entire brain using a custom scalar beamformer implemented in SPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vrba and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woolrich et al., 2011</xref>).

However, this means that the multivariate normal distributions that define each state span this reduced subspace, and are therefore not readily interpretable in terms of the underlying anatomy. To interrogate those brain areas associated with each state, we mapped state-specific activity by correlating the amplitude envelope at each voxel with the HMM state time courses. This has the advantage of identifying only activity that is unique to each state, and thus reduces components of the signal that are common across states that may obscure state-specific effects.</p><p>State specific changes in oscillatory activity were identified by computing the partial correlation of the state time courses with the source space data. The partial correlation was computed using a general linear modeling (GLM) framework as follows. The maximum a posteriori state <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> at each time point was used to construct a (<italic>K</italic> × <italic>T</italic>) design matrix <italic>X</italic>, where each column <italic>k</italic> is an array of indicator variables that indicates whether state <italic>k</italic> is on or off:<disp-formula id="equ12"><mml:math id="m12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>≠</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This design matrix, together with the full-rank (before whitening) source space data, was used in a GLM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friston et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brookes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woolrich et al., 2009</xref>).

One external reviewer stated, “Overall this is an excellent paper. The topic is important and timely. The results are provocative.”</p><p>While all three reviewers agreed that the paper will make a substantive contribution, there was also a consensus that the manuscript requires revisions to resolve several issues.</p><p>The following four main revisions are required (with further details from the reviewers appended for reference):</p><p>1) Discuss (or provide additional data to address) what the extracted states are reflecting in terms of network processing, particularly the degree to which they reflect stationarity and independence of networks.</p><p>2) Directly address the discrepancies between these results and fMRI RSC networks. Address the concern that some of the differences arise from the constraint that the networks not overlap (such that “hubs” like the precuneus aren't found).</p><p>3) Provide greater methodological detail and justification for the analytic choices made, particularly with respect to the rationale for choosing eight states and collapsing across subjects.</p><p>4) Do not overstate the links to EEG microstates.</p><p><italic>Point</italic> <italic>1</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Electrophysiological data are nonstationary, and periods of oscillatory activity are particularly so, as frequency and amplitude of neural oscillations are quite dynamic; in fact, nonstationarity can be regarded as a characteristic of oscillatory activity (Mäkinen, May, &amp; Tiitinen, 2005). Since each extracted state was multivariate normal, the HMM technique as applied here might be detecting the most-stationary epochs in resting MEG data, which would suggest that rather than detecting networks, it is detecting epochs during which minimal oscillatory (i.e., network) activity is present in a given region. One simple means to assess this would be to describe the characteristic frequency of each of the 8 detected states using e.g., a Fourier transformation at the center of mass for each network as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. If this would constitute too much additional work, the authors should provide a substantial and well-referenced limitations section. Given that HMM is also an effective method of spike detection in M/EEG data (Ossadtchi, Mosher, Sutherling, Greenblatt, &amp; Leahy, 2005) the authors should describe in detail the methodological differences between HMM for spike detection and HMM as used in the present study.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1. The method identifies states that are mutually exclusive. In order to study interactions between networks by definition the networks must be coupled. The authors propose to study interactions by analyzing the time course of the fractional occupancy. While this may be reasonable, the pros and cons of this approach, and how much traction we get biologically, must be clearly stated. At one extreme one could argue that given the methodology allows to tracks the temporal alternation of unique and independent states, it does not tell us anything about across–network interactions.</p><p>2. The identification of the brain states is driven using a fairly simple model. What is the justification for Gaussian models in building the posterior and non informative priors? Should there not be some prior validation on real data?</p><p>3. Relationship RSNs - brain states: please explain whether the approach is somehow circular: from MEG envelope - &gt; PCA - &gt; only 8 brain states and then again the authors compare the states with the data via correlation?</p><p>4. The HMM procedure to identify brain states exclude, by definition, cortical hubs, i.e., nodes involved in more systems (see for example the absence of PCC in DMN). How does this limit the interpretation of results?</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>DMN-DAN anticorrelation. The transition between the states DMN-DAN does not relate to their anti-correlation in my view. It is just telling us that when the DMN is coupled the DAN is not and vice versa but this is obvious based on the HMM state extraction. This is true to some extent for all pairs of networks since again the states are mutually exclusive. The argument is based on the time course of the fractional occupancy (limitations noted above apply here).</p><p>Even if the nets were free to overlap, the results indicate that the transition between DMN and DAN are infrequent. This is in contrast with the fMRI literature where these two networks are strongly coupled, so should show correlated alternations according to this method. I think that the observed infrequent transitions are actually in favor of the opposite hypothesis, namely that these two networks are not correlated. Furthermore, the issue of anti-correlation between DMN and DAN should not be over-emphasized given that even in fMRI there are significant questions with regard to their biological significance.</p><p><italic>Point</italic> <italic>2</italic></p><p>Reviewing Editor:</p><p>One keystone of the paper is the finding that at fine time scales as well as the coarser scale measured by fMRI, activation in the default mode network (DMN) is negatively correlated with activation in the dorsal attention network (DAN). However, the networks measured here show only partial overlap with the standard networks measured by fMRI. For example, the putative DMN network shown here does not include activation in the precuneus and the putative DAN only coarsely overlaps with the fMRI DAN. These discrepancies should be explicitly discussed.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1. The RSN topographies do not seem standard even according to the authors' prior work:</p><p>a) DMN is missing posterior cingulate;</p><p>b) VIS is split in 3 separate states;</p><p>c) The parietal network is quite diffuse, and important nodes such as FEF are not seen? More importantly, what is the meaning of a state that is negatively correlated with the power envelope time course? Does the diffusiveness of the maps may suggest that these states are not truly within-network, but by themselves reflecting across network interactions? What is the actual spatial correlation between RSN measured on slow envelope and HHM states?</p><p>d) Previous work emphasizes bilateral networks, while here some networks are bilateral while other are more unilateral (e.g., temporal). Please comment.</p><p>2. If the brain states efficiently capture all dynamic states, one could expect that all of the brain is covered. What percentage of gray matter is covered by the network states? Are the holes, e.g., PCC potentially reflecting 'hub' like activity?</p><p><italic>Point</italic> <italic>3</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Significant methodological detail is omitted. No rationale is given for the number of states selected. It is unclear whether all states occurred in all subjects, and no rationale is given for temporal concatenation across subjects. As currently presented, it remains possible that the detected states are subject-specific. It is also unclear whether the authors used existing beamformer code (e.g., Fieldtrip; Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, &amp; Schoffelen, 2011) or created their own. In addition, no details are given on possible interactions between beamforming and HMM. Finally, the authors state that after beamformer projection, downsampling, enveloping, and concatenation, the envelopes were pre-whitened into 40 principal components. Some information on the topography of these components should be provided.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Some details are incorrect. For example, in their discussion of ICA in the section headed “Relationship with functional connectivity at slower time scales”, the authors state that “...two regions will tend to be strongly represented in the same component (“network”) if their time courses exhibit a strong time-averaged correlation over all time points.” This is true for spatial ICA as typically applied to fMRI data, but not for temporal ICA which would ordinarily be applied to MEG data.</p><p><italic>Point</italic> <italic>4</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>The posited relationship to EEG microstates is conjecture, unsupported by the presented data. It is also unclear how infrequent bursts of neural activity underlying transient microstates would explain the sustained changes in blood oxygenation required to produce the BOLD timecourses observed in RSNs.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>The discussion points to a paper by Mantini et al 2007 showing that fMRI timeseries in DAN/DMN respectively were negatively/positively correlated with alpha/beta EEG power. However that relationship with EEG does not say anything about their mutual coupling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01867.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We would like to thank the editor and the reviewers for their comments on the manuscript.

If this would constitute too much additional work, the authors should provide a substantial and well-referenced limitations section</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewer highlights, electrophysiological data, and oscillatory activity are characterized by highly non-stationary dynamics. Indeed, the principal motivation for our study was to assess resting state functional connectivity without assuming temporal stationarity across the duration of the recording. We also agree that when an HMM state is active this corresponds to short periods of time in which there is temporary stationarity – this is explicit in the model – and we can interpret the states as corresponding to the most repeatable patterns of oscillatory activity. However, the evidence in the paper suggests that these states do not correspond to when there is minimal oscillatory activity in the constituent regions. Instead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that most states/networks show an increase in the oscillatory power when the state is active compared to when it is inactive.</p><p>To make this clearer we have followed the reviewer’s suggestion, and produced power spectra, comparing the power of the oscillations between when each state is active and when it is inactive. This also provides a useful insight into the frequencies of the oscillations that underlie each network. We computed a time-frequency (TF) representation of the data at each voxel using Morlet wavelets (Morlet factor = 6) and assessed the power across frequency bands by averaging this TF representation both within state and outside of the state, using the time points indexed by the state time courses. We computed a weighted average spectrum by weighting each voxel’s power spectrum using the spatial maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This ensures that the spectra represent the entire network, rather than a single node within the network. It is clear that states whose spatial maps show positive correlations with the state time courses represent increases in oscillatory activity. There is also evidence for some frequency specificity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Power spectra for each state.</title><p>The (pre-enveloped) data for each subject and at each voxel were decomposed into a time-frequency representation using Morlet wavelets (Morlet factor = 6).

The identification of the brain states is driven using a fairly simple model. What is the justification for Gaussian models in building the posterior and non informative priors? Should not there be some prior validation on real</italic> <italic>data?</italic></p><p>We are assuming that the assumption of Gaussianity (within state) is a sufficiently good first order approximation. Indeed, the results show that this is the case, to the extent that the results are biologically meaningful and plausible. However, we acknowledge that it is also possible that other HMM observation models could be better. The principled way to assess different observation model assumption is to do so within the context of the HMM model, using measures such as the Bayesian model evidence, or cross validation. While future work will focus on implementing more advanced observation models, this extension is outside of the scope of the current paper. We have clarified this by expanding the relevant part in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3. Relationship RSNs - brain states: please explain whether the approach is somehow circular: from MEG envelope - &gt; PCA - &gt; only 8 brain states and then again the authors compare the states with the data via</italic> <italic>correlation?</italic></p><p>The approach used to obtain state-specific spatial maps is not circular. There is no constraint in the HMM inference (e.g., there are no pre-specified seeds or spatial map priors) that could bias the form of the HMM inference in this way. The correlation of the state time courses back onto the data is simply a way of projecting the states from the reduced subspace to the original voxel space. An alternative would be to project the observation model means and covariance matrices using the eigenvectors derived from the original PCA. However, performing a multiple regression (partial correlation) has the advantage of identifying only activity that is unique to each state, and thus reduces components of the signal that are common across states, which may otherwise obscure state-specific effects. To make this clearer we have added to the Materials and Methods section the paragraph beginning: “By performing a principal component analysis prior to inferring the HMM, the dimensionality of the data was reduced to a computationally manageable amount.”</p><p><italic>4. The HMM procedure to identify brain states exclude, by definition, cortical hubs, i.e., nodes involved in more systems (see for example the absence of PCC in DMN). How does this limit the interpretation of</italic> <italic>results?</italic></p><p>While the states inferred by the HMM are temporally mutually exclusive, they do allow overlap spatially. The spatial structure is encoded via the observation model (multivariate normal distribution). For example, nodes A and B may be active during state 1, but nodes A and C during state 2. These different patterns will be represented by an increase in the mean and/or variance of the state’s MVN. So in this regard there is no reason why a hub, such as the PCC, should not be represented. However, it is possible that hub activity may be suppressed by the particular method we use for spatially mapping state-specific activity. The mapping uses partial correlation of the state time course with the amplitude envelope to identify brain areas whose band-limited amplitude increases or decreases specifically within a particular state. However, a hub node, through its inclusion in multiple states, might not show state specific increases or decreases in amplitude, and so will not be represented within any one state’s spatial map. We have added to the discussion in the context of the PCC’s absence to make this clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>3:</italic></p><p><italic>DMN-DAN anticorrelation. The transition between the states DMN-DAN does not relate to their anti-correlation in my view. It is just telling us that when the DMN is coupled the DAN is not and vice versa but this is obvious based on the HMM state extraction. This is true to some extent for all pairs of networks since again the states are mutually exclusive. The argument is based on the time course of the fractional occupancy (limitations noted above</italic> <italic>apply here)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Even if the nets were free to overlap, the results indicate that the transition between DMN and DAN are infrequent. This is in contrast with the fMRI literature where these two networks are strongly coupled, so should show correlated alternations according to this method. I think that the observed infrequent transitions are actually in favor of the opposite hypothesis, namely that these two networks are not correlated. Furthermore, the issue of anti-correlation between DMN and DAN should not be over-emphasized given that even in fMRI there are significant questions with regard to their biological significance</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that any statements about correlation need to indicate clearly which particular time courses (from each state) are used to compute the correlation. It is the slower fractional occupancy (FO) time courses that are empirically anti-correlated between the DMN and parietal areas of the DAN. The fact that these FO time courses are anticorrelated, and that the FOs are derived from the HMM state time courses, suggests that these FO anti-correlations (and potentially associated BOLD RSN anti-correlations at the same time scale) are related to the antagonistic behavior identified at the faster time scales of the state time courses. To make this clear we have ensured that any statements about correlation indicate clearly which time courses are being correlated (e.g., FO), and we have also added to the Discussion the paragraph beginning: “The fact that cross-network relationships present in the fractional occupancy time courses are maintained …” We address the issue of the “biological significance” of the DAN and DMN in a later response to a reviewer’s point.</p><p>Point 2</p><p><italic>Reviewing</italic> <italic>Editor:</italic></p><p><italic>One keystone of the paper is the finding that at fine time scales as well as the coarser scale measured by fMRI, activation in the default mode network (DMN) is negatively correlated with activation in the dorsal attention network (DAN). However, the networks measured here show only partial overlap with the standard networks measured by fMRI. For example, the putative DMN network shown here does not include activation in the precuneus and the putative DAN only coarsely overlaps with the fMRI DAN. These discrepancies should be explicitly discussed</italic>.</p><p>We have added an analysis of the spatial correspondence of the inferred HMM spatial maps to the classic fMRI spatial ICA derived RSNs. This shows that there is generally good correspondence. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. However, as pointed out by the reviewing editor, we also acknowledge that there is a degree of dissimilarity between the networks obtained via the HMM and those measured by fMRI (although this discrepancy is less so with those identified in MEG using temporal ICA – as in (Brookes et al., 2011)).</p><p>We have addressed each of the points on this topic in the response to the specific reviewer’s comments below. However, generally we now more clearly acknowledge that we do not necessarily expect complete correspondence between networks identified in this work, and those previously identified using spatial ICA on fMRI data. In particular, to make this clear we have added to the Discussion the paragraph beginning: “Finally, it is worth considering to what extent the DMN or DAN, and the particular spatial nodes they incorporate, are definitive networks.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>3:</italic></p><p><italic>1.

We now refer to this network as “parietal regions of the DAN” or the “putative DAN” when discussed in terms of its relationship with the DMN. Nonetheless, the fact that it is strongly anticorrelated with the DMN adds evidence that this state encompasses at least some aspects of the DAN network. As previously discussed, we must also consider that the use of both MEG and the HMM will result in a decomposition that is somewhat distinct from that of BOLD ICA.</p><p><italic>More importantly, what is the meaning of a state that is negatively correlated with the power envelope time</italic> <italic>course?</italic></p><p>A state that correlates negatively with the power envelope time course indicates that band-limited MEG power decreases at those time points in which the state is active. This is now made clearer in the Methods section as follows: “Each map represents the partial correlation between the state time courses and the group-concatenated amplitude envelope at each voxel. Accordingly, state specific increases and decreases in amplitude are represented by red/yellow and blue colors respectively.”</p><p><italic>Does the diffusiveness of the maps may suggest that these states are not truly within-network, but by themselves reflecting across network</italic> <italic>interactions?</italic></p><p>We suggest that the diffusivity of the HMM spatial maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as compared with fMRI, arises due to the reduced spatial resolution of beamformed MEG. Indeed the spatial specificity is comparable to the spatial maps found using temporal ICA in (Brookes et al., 2011). The apparent extra diffusivity of states 6-8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is due to the use of the same percentile threshold for all 8 states, combined with states 6-8 being less strong.</p><p><italic>What is the actual spatial correlation between RSN measured on slow</italic> <italic>envelope and HHM states?</italic></p><p>As mentioned earlier, we have now included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> to allow a more direct comparison of the inferred states with BOLD RSNs and have stated the spatial correlation in this figure.</p><p><italic>d) Previous work emphasizes bilateral networks, while here some networks are bilateral while other are more unilateral (e.g., temporal).

If the brain states efficiently capture all dynamic states, one could expect that all of the brain is covered. What percentage of gray matter is covered by the network states? Are the holes, e.g., PCC potentially reflecting 'hub' like</italic> <italic>activity?</italic></p><p>It is true that, taken together, the states should explain the mean and variance across the entire brain. However, because the spatial maps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> represent state specific activity (i.e., increases or decreases in amplitude that correlate with each state time course) regions whose activity is common across states will be suppressed, resulting in the apparent “holes”. Another possibility is that the PCA used to reduce the dimensionality of the data removes these regions. To address these issues directly we have now included spatial maps of the variance before and after the PCA, and an averaged map of all the states to demonstrate the proportion of gray matter covered by the network states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>).

In terms of the choice of the number of inferred states, we have added the paragraph beginning: “A limitation of the proposed technique is that HMM inference requires an a priori specification of the number of states, K. Bayesian inference techniques provide a means to test model order selection, by providing an approximation to the free energy.”</p><p>In terms of the choice of the use of temporal concatenation across subjects, we have added the paragraph beginning: “Group concatenation is widely used in unsupervised analyses of resting state activity, particularly in the case of ICA (Calhoun et al., 2009).”</p><p><italic>“It is unclear whether all states occurred in all subjects” and “As currently presented, it remains possible that the detected states are</italic> <italic>subject-specific.”</italic></p><p>The fractional occupancy time courses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> show that this is not the case. We have added the following to the Results section to make this clearer: “These fractional occupancy time courses reveal slower temporal changes in the occurrence of the HMM states. These time courses are shown for all subjects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>. It is clear that each state was represented in all subjects.”</p><p><italic>It is also unclear whether the authors used existing beamformer code (e.g., Fieldtrip; Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, &amp; Schoffelen, 2011) or created their</italic> <italic>own</italic>.</p><p>We used a custom beamformer adapted from the one in SPM8 and based on the standard scalar LCMV beamformer (Van Veen et al., 1997).

This suggests that the cross-network interactions observed in BOLD RSNs and the MEG HMM states are mutually consistent. We acknowledge that the paper by Mantini et al., 2007 does not provide the exploration of the coupling between DMN and DAN band-limited power that would be necessary to more strongly support or refute our claim.</p></body></sub-article></article>
