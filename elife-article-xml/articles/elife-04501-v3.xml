fertilization. By contrast, flowering plants have lost essential components of the centrosome, raising the question of how flowering plants control gamete nuclei migration during fertilization. Here, we use <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to document a novel mechanism that regulates F-actin dynamics in the female gametes and is essential for fertilization. Live imaging shows that F-actin structures assist the male nucleus during its migration towards the female nucleus. We identify a female gamete-specific Rho-GTPase that regulates F-actin dynamics and further show that actin–myosin interactions are also involved in male gamete nucleus migration. Genetic analyses and imaging indicate that microtubules are dispensable for migration and fusion of male and female gamete nuclei. The innovation of a novel actin-based mechanism of fertilization during plant evolution might account for the complete loss of the centrosome in flowering plants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04501.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04501.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04501.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sexual reproduction involves combining the genetic material from two parents to create an offspring. The genetic material in the male sperm cell and the female egg cell is contained in the nucleus of each cell. Once these two cells fuse at fertilization, their nuclei must then navigate towards each other and fuse.</p><p>When an animal egg cell is fertilized, cable-like protein filaments called microtubules guide the two nuclei into contact. These microtubules are organized by a cellular structure called a centrosome. However, flowering plants do not have centrosomes; as such, it was unclear how genetic material from the sperm and egg cells is brought together after fertilization in flowering plants.</p><p>To investigate this, Kawashima et al. turned to a flowering plant commonly used in research, called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and found that microtubules are not needed to guide the nuclei of the sperm and the egg cell after fertilization. Instead, another cable-forming protein—called F-actin—fulfills a similar role in Arabidopsis cells.</p><p>F-actin filaments often connect together to form a network; and when Kawashima et al. disrupted the F-actin in Arabidopsis egg cells, the nucleus of the sperm cell failed to fuse with that of the female. Pollen from Arabidopsis plants actually contains two sperm cells. One sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell; the other fertilizes the so-called ‘central cell’, which develops into a tissue that nourishes the plant embryo. Kawashima et al. found that the fertilization of both of these cells requires an intact F-actin network.</p><p>By looking more closely at F-actin networks in the larger central cell, Kawashima et al. discovered that the sperm nucleus becomes surrounded by a star-shaped structure of F-actin cables and that this F-actin structure migrates together with the sperm nucleus. The F-actin network constantly moves inward, from the edges of the cell towards the nucleus, prior to fertilization. This movement is essential for guiding the sperm nucleus towards the central cell nucleus.</p><p>Kawashima et al. also found that this continual movement of the F-actin network depends on a small signaling protein found in the central cell, called ROP8. It also involves a motor protein that normally transports “cargo”, such as proteins and other molecules, inside cells by walking along the F-actin networks. However, rather than transporting the sperm nucleus as cargo, Kawashima et al. believe that the motor protein instead helps to maintain the inward movement of the F-actin network. One of the next challenges will be to investigate the molecular mechanism that underlies this motor protein's involvement in this dynamic F-actin network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04501.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04501.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>gamete nuclear migration</kwd><kwd>Rho-GTPase</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawashima</surname><given-names>Tomokazu</given-names></name><name><surname>Maruyama</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Yelagandula</surname><given-names>Ramesh</given-names></name><name><surname>Toyama</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Biological Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shagirov</surname><given-names>Murat</given-names></name><name><surname>Toyama</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mechanobiology Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toyama</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maruyama</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004823</institution-id><institution>Nagoya University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maruyama</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamamura</surname><given-names>Yuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The movement of F-actin filaments, which is regulated by actin-myosin interactions together with a female gamete-specific Rho-GTPase, enables migration of the Arabidopsis sperm cell nucleus towards the female nucleus; which might account for the loss of centrosomes in flowering plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flowering plants have evolved a double fertilization process that requires the fusion of two sperm cells with the two female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell. This is achieved in a series of complex processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawashima and Berger, 2011</xref>). Sperm cells are immotile and delivered to the female gametes by the pollen tube. The pollen tube is guided towards the female gametes (pollen tube guidance) and interacts with a synergid cell (two specialized cells associated with the female gametes) to release sperm cells (pollen tube reception) into the area proximal to the female gametes. After the fusion between the female and male gametes (plasmogamy), the male gamete nuclei migrate towards the female gamete nuclei and fuse (karyogamy), thus completing fertilization. Several factors and molecular mechanisms controlling these early events such as pollen tube guidance and reception have been recently characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higashiyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palanivelu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasahara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takeuchi and Higashiyama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leydon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ngo et al., 2014</xref>), and mechanisms governing plasmogamy have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Von Besser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sprunck et al., 2012</xref>). However, how gamete nuclei migrate and fuse in flowering plants still remain largely elusive.</p><p>In most animals, microtubules organized by the centrosome control female pronucleus migration towards the male pronucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schatten, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinsch and Gonczy, 1998</xref>). By contrast, the essential components of the centrosome have been lost before the emergence of flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>), and the sperm cell nucleus moves towards the female gamete nucleus without the participation of centrosomes in flowering plants. During plant evolution, the basal plants developed actin-based organelle movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madison and Nebenfuhr, 2013</xref>), which coincided with the centrosome loss in somatic cells in the basal land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaughn and Harper, 1998</xref>). However, the genomes of bryophytes, ferns, and most likely certain gymnosperms encode components of the centrosome and these organisms produce a centrosome specifically in spermatogenous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaughn and Harper, 1998</xref>). Indeed, microtubules are essential for gamete nuclear migration in the fern <italic>Marsilea vestita</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuligowski et al., 1985</xref>), and these observations imply that gamete nuclear migration without the centrosome in flowering plants evolved separately from the actin-based organelle movement mechanism in somatic cells, leading to the question of how flowering plants control gamete nuclear migration without a centrosome. Immunofluorescence approaches revealed that corona structures of actin filaments around the sperm cells appear at the time of sperm cell release from the pollen tube prior to plasmogamy in many flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Russell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Sheridan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al., 2002</xref>). Changes in F-actin organization in the egg cell during fertilization are also evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2000</xref>), and indeed, an involvement of F-actin in gamete nuclear migration has been suggested during in vitro fertilization in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that in contrast to animals, microtubules are dispensable for fertilization and F-actin is the primary factor controlling sperm cell nucleus migration in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Upon sperm nucleus entry in the central cell, F-actin generates an actin aster-like structure around the sperm cell nucleus while it migrates towards the female nucleus. The F-actin dynamic movement towards the central cell nucleus is established prior to fertilization and is controlled by a central cell-specific Rho-GTPase and myosin. Additional observations of F-actin function during egg cell fertilization suggest similar conclusions. Hence, flowering plants innovated a novel actin-based mechanism of fertilization that made the centrosome dispensable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>F-actin is essential for sperm nuclear migration in the egg cell</title><p>To investigate the requirement and function of F-actin during fertilization, we expressed the fluorescent reporter Lifeact-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Era et al., 2009</xref>) under the control of the egg cell-specific <italic>EC1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sprunck et al., 2012</xref>) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in the egg cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Lifeact-Venus marked cables were disassembled after treatment with the actin polymerizing inhibitor Latrunculin A (LatA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Pharmacological analysis by applying inhibitor drugs is useful to dissect out the cytoskeleton function at the cellular level. However, treatment with actin polymerization inhibitors disrupts functions in all cells when applied to tissues such as ovules and thus prevents the analysis on specific cytoskeleton functions in a specific cell-type. To overcome this problem, the semi-dominant negative <italic>ACTIN</italic> transgene (<italic>DN-ACTIN;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2010</xref>) was introduced to disrupt F-actin specifically in female gametes. DN-ACTIN contains one amino acid substitution in the hydrophobic loop of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ACT8<italic>,</italic> which causes instability and fragmentation of actin filaments, leading to incomplete yet strong disruption of actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the effect of DN-ACTIN reported previously, the filamentous structures shown in the wild-type (WT) egg cell became much shorter and generated aggregates in the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In WT plants, fertilization leads to karyogamy followed by decondensation of the chromatin from the male nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingouff et al., 2007</xref>). Egg cell fertilization initiates embryo development while the fusion of the other sperm cell with the central cell leads to endosperm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,F</xref>). By contrast, fertilization of the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN failed as the sperm nucleus did not fuse with the egg cell nucleus and the sperm chromatin remained condensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; Line 1, 35% defects in <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> [n = 104] compared to 0% defects in WT [n = 98]). Karyogamy was prevented only in the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN but not in the central cell, resulting in a seed containing endosperm without an embryo [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; Line 1, 27% defects in <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> (n = 110) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 389)]. Taken together, these results suggest that actin cytoskeletons are required for egg cell fertilization. Consistently, other independent transgenic lines showed similar seed developmental arrest [Line 2, 20% defects (n = 125); Line 3, 22% defects (n = 114)]. Not all ovules of DN-ACTIN expressing lines showed the fertilization defect, likely because a certain fraction of actin filaments was still functional.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04501.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>F-actin is required for egg cell fertilization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mature ovule. cc, central cell; cz, chalaza; ec, egg cell; mp, micropyle; sy, synergid.

We expressed Lifeact-Venus under the control of the central cell-specific <italic>FWA</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinoshita et al., 2004</xref>). F-actin in the WT mature central cell showed that F-actin is organized in three major distinct structures: (i) a ring-shaped actin network at the micropylar end of the central cell surrounding the synergid cells and the egg cell; (ii) long actin cables at the periphery of the central cell, extending from the chalazal region to the boundary with the egg cell; and (iii) a track formed of a bundle of actin cables, running from the micropylar actin ring to the central cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, these structures disassembled in response to LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). During fertilization, the track of actin cables became associated with the migrating sperm cell nucleus in the central cell from the site of fusion between the sperm cell and the central cell to the central cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Time-lapse image analysis further confirmed F-actin association to the sperm cell nucleus during its migration in the central cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Upon completion of karyogamy, the micropylar actin ring and bundles of F-actin associated with the sperm cell nucleus disassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), suggesting that F-actin assembles transient dynamic structures dedicated for fertilization. The constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN in the central cell prevented fertilization [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; Line 1, 30% defects in <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> (n = 120) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 153)] and endosperm development [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; Line 1, 25% defects in <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> (n = 412) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 233)]. Other independent transgenic lines expressing DN-ACTIN in the central cell also showed similar rates of endosperm developmental defect (Line 2, 22% defects [n = 300]; Line 3, 21% defects [n = 434]).

Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that the constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN in the central cell by the <italic>FWA</italic> promoter might impair the maturation of the central cell, which in turn would be responsible for fertilization failure. To overcome this problem, we designed a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samalova et al., 2005</xref>) to activate <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> after central cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

The reporter construct consists of the nuclear-localized mCherry fluorescent protein (NLS-mCherry) and <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> genes, connected by a self-cleaving 2A peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A), and this transgene was flanked by the four tandem repeats of the <italic>lac</italic> operator with the <italic>cauliflower mosaic virus 35S</italic> minimal promoter (TATA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

As a result, two proteins, NLS-mCherry and DN-ACTIN, are produced in the central cell by DEX application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the NLS-mCherry can be used as a marker for spatio-temporal DEX induction. Consistent with the result from the constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN by the <italic>FWA</italic> promoter, DN-ACTIN induced by DEX in the mature central cell disrupted F-actin organization and prevented sperm cell nucleus migration towards the female nucleus and karyogamy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). Endosperm development was also prevented in DEX-treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>).

In contrast to WT, about half of the female gametes from <italic>por</italic>/+ mutants did not show microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,F</xref>). This proportion was consistent with the requirement of POR function for microtubule assembly. WT and <italic>por</italic> mutant female gametes fertilized with either WT or <italic>por</italic> sperm cells showed successful karyogamy leading to the decondensation of chromatin from the sperm cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>; 97% in WT [n = 102] and 96% in <italic>por/+</italic> [n = 96]). Taken together, these results show that fertilization takes place despite defective microtubule assembly and as a result, <italic>por/por</italic> embryo and endosperm development initiates. Mutations in genes encoding the other subunits (A, D and E) of TUBULIN FOLDING COFACTOR cause a seed abortion phenotype similar to that described in <italic>por</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steinborn et al., 2002</xref>), further demonstrating that microtubules are not absolutely required for fertilization in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

Pronuclear migration in the fertilized egg is microtubule dependent, but both actin filament and microtubules are indispensable for nuclear positioning in many somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinsch and Gonczy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gundersen and Worman, 2013</xref>). In plants, nuclear positioning during cell division and photo-relocation as well as tip growth of root hair and pollen tube has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takagi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higa et al., 2014</xref>), and actin filaments play a critical role in these nuclear positioning events in plant somatic cells. By contrast, very little was known about gamete nuclear migration in plants. During evolution, the centrosome loss in spermatogenous cells of land plants did not coincide with either the centrosome loss in somatic cells or the initiation of the actin-based organelle movement system in plants, indicating that gamete nuclear migration in flowering plants might depend on a distinct mechanism. Here, we identified that the dynamic F-actin movement towards the central cell nucleus from the cell periphery constantly occurs prior to the sperm cell nucleus entry, and this F-actin movement is essential for sperm cell nucleus migration in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Upon entry into the central cell, the sperm nucleus becomes surrounded by F-actin, generating an aster-like structure that migrates together with the sperm cell nucleus to join the central cell nucleus for karyogamy. We also found that this dynamic F-actin movement in the central cell is controlled by gamete-specific Rho-GTPase ROP8 and is myosin dependent. On the contrary, microtubules are dispensable for sperm cell nuclear migration in both female gametes. Taken together, our results show that the sperm cell nuclear migration in flowering plants is controlled by a novel actin-based mechanism that generates a constant F-actin inward movement towards the central cell nucleus. The dynamic movement of F-actin towards the central nucleus, F-actin aster-like structure around the sperm cell nucleus during migration, and precise spatio-temporal disruption of F-actin after central cell maturation by the DEX system suggest direct involvement of F-actin for sperm cell nuclear migration. However, it still remains to be determined whether F-actin directly interacts with the sperm cell nucleus for migration. Further investigations should be made to rule out the possibility that the sperm cell nuclear migration defect by DN-ACTIN expression is not due to general perturbation of cellular structure.</p><p>We also describe that F-actin is organized as unique structures in the central cell. In addition to the F-actin aster-like structure and the F-actin track that associate with the sperm cell nucleus migration, the central cell features a ring-shaped actin network at the micropylar end that surrounds the egg apparatus (the synergid cells and the egg cell). The F-actin ring might maintain the position of the egg apparatus for fertilization or it might act as a clamp to maintain mechanical constraints that are required for efficient sperm cell delivery. Upon completion of karyogamy, all three organized F-actin structures become disassembled, suggesting that these unique actin structures are specialized to achieve fertilization.</p><p>Rho-GTPases are well-studied signaling factors controlling cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang, 2002</xref>). In the WT central cell, the constant inward movement of F-actin from the cell periphery to the nucleus occurs prior to fertilization, and this constant inward movement becomes significantly reduced in <italic>DN-ROP8</italic>, but not in <italic>CA-ROP8</italic> transgenic lines. These results suggest that ROP8 might be constantly active in the entire central cell plasma membrane, generating a constitutive dynamic inward movement of F-actin. This could explain why <italic>DN-ROP8</italic>, but not <italic>CA-ROP8</italic> transgenic lines affected F-actin dynamics significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In general, the activation/inactivation of ROPs is controlled spatially at the plasma membrane, generating subdomains within a cell for downstream events such as secondary cell wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oda and Fukuda, 2012</xref>) and pavement cell indentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Although the machinery by which ROP8 is associated to the plasma membrane is general and the activity of ROP8 in the central cell should be investigated further, this putative constant active mode of ROP8 in the central cell might shed light on a new facet of Rho-GTPase function in plant cells. F-actin function is also important for sperm cell nuclear migration in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> egg cell described here and in the rice egg cell shown by in vitro fertilization assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>). It is plausible that a distinct ROP plays a similar role during egg cell fertilization, but it is also possible that other mechanisms control F-actin-dependent migration of the male nucleus to the egg cell nucleus.</p><p>According to observations in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>), myosin was expected to tether the nucleus and enable its migration as a cargo. However, the impairment of F-actin movement in the central cell halts sperm cell nuclear migration even in the presence of the WT-like structure of actin filaments shown in <italic>DN-ROP8</italic>. Hence, myosin might not transport the sperm cell nucleus towards the female nucleus as a cargo. Our observations rather suggest that myosin affects F-actin dynamics directly. In vitro, myosin also creates bipolar filaments and cross-links two actin filaments, generating a non equilibrium dynamic F-actin movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). This type of dynamics is similar to the inward F-actin movement observed in the central cell, suggesting that myosin is directly involved in the dynamic inward movement of F-actin in this cell type. Yet, we have not identified which specific myosin is involved and detailed myosin function in sperm cell nuclear migration remains to be determined.</p><p>Along with the development of actin-based cellular dynamics in plants, the centrosome loss in somatic cells was established in bryophytes during land plant evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaughn and Harper, 1998</xref>). The diversification and expansion of actin nucleator <italic>formin</italic> genes are already evident in bryophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grunt et al., 2008</xref>); it is still not yet clear how <italic>ROP</italic> signaling pathway genes in plants initiated and diversified during land plant evolution. However, several higher land plant features such as pollen tube tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guan et al., 2013</xref>), secondary cell wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oda and Fukuda, 2012</xref>), pavement cell indentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and actin-based sperm cell nuclear migration described here are controlled by specific <italic>ROP</italic> signaling pathways. These observations suggest that extended roles of actin cytoskeleton at least by ROP signaling pathways through land plant evolution might have paved the way to the complete loss of microtubule–centrosome-dependent processes in flowering plants together with a dramatic impact on plant cell biology including reproduction mechanisms, cell divisions and cell structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant lines used in this study are Columbia-0 (Col) ecotype, except the <italic>porcino (por)</italic> mutant in Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (Ler).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Sheila McCormick, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports a series of sound and creative experiments aimed at understanding how the sperm nucleus migrates to the female nucleus during fertilization in flowering plants. There is currently no mechanistic insight into this process in intact plants and thus this is significant work that impacts our understanding of plant reproduction in an important way. The central conclusions are backed up with multiple experimental approaches. The chief innovation of this study was the use of cell-type specific promoters to drive dominant negative ACTIN (egg and central cell) and ROP8 variants (central cell only). The images of the actin cytoskeleton in these target cells are stunning. Although Ohnishi et al used an artificial fusion system with isolated rice gametes to show an aster-like actin structure in the egg around the sperm nucleus, and that lat B disrupts sperm nuclear migration, they lacked genetic support for their pharmacological data.</p><p>The reviewers felt nevertheless that some of the comparisons of plants to animals should be tempered. Furthermore, additional background information will make the manuscript more accessible to the general reader. We have enumerated below the issues that should be addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) All three reviewers question the importance of the figure supplements devoted to evolution of ROPs and associated pathways; they are not described in the results and it is difficult to determine whether there has been a significant diversification and expansion of these gene families relative to others. These figures are also poor quality relative to the rest of the paper. Is the rate of diversification significantly different from other gene families? Finally, we are not convinced that this analysis is sufficient to make the claim in the abstract that “Expansion and diversification of actin regulators during land plant evolution might have not only enabled the innovation of an actin-based mechanism of fertilization…” These results, if retained in the revised manuscript, need to be substantially improved and incorporated into the Results section, but we think they can equally well be omitted with no loss of impact to the major findings of this manuscript.</p><p>2) <italic>eLife</italic> is an online journal with no space limitations “Several independent <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> transgenic lines were investigated and showed similar defect rates (data not shown)”: “data not shown” is not necessary; show the results from the other lines; “30% defects in <italic>DN-ACTIN</italic> (n=120)…” how many independent lines, as per comment about DN-ACTIN in egg; “Occasionally, a few nuclei divisions were observed in the endosperm (data not shown)”: why data not shown? What is occasionally? 2% 10%?Please show the data; “only <italic>DN-ROP8</italic> lines showed fertilization defects similar to those observed in central cells expressing DN-ACTIN”: lines are mentioned; how many and what was the range of the defective fertilization?</p><p>3) The authors have convincingly shown that actin is required for sperm nuclear migration in the egg and central cell. However, they have not shown that this is due to direct attachment of sperm to actin via myosin. The (unlikely) possibility remains that an intact actin cytoskeleton is necessary for sperm nuclear migration, but this requirement is indirect rather than direct. The authors address this possibility with a very elegant experiment that uses an inducible promoter system to transiently express a dominant negative actin after central cell development is complete. This experiment rules out the possibility that development of the central cell has been altered due to prolonged cytoskeletal disruption, however, it does not rule out the possibility that the defects in sperm nuclear migration are due to general perturbation of cellular structure rather than a direct effect on actin-myosin-based sperm nuclear migration. The discussion of this point should be refined.</p><p>4) ROP8 is specific to the central cell. The authors only address the function of ROP8 in the central cell and conclude that ROP8 is required for sperm cell migration in the central cell. The introduction makes it seem as though ROP8 controls actin dynamics in both female gametes. The authors should make it clear in the discussion and introduction that they have uncovered a potential component of the mechanism that regulates actin dynamics in the central cell, but this mechanism remains unknown for the egg.</p><p>5) The formation of aster-shaped actin structures around sperm nuclei is the best evidence (along with pharmacological disruption by myosin inhibitors) presented for a direct association between actin and sperm nuclei. This section could be improved by clarifying whether asters form in the absence of sperm nuclei and by quantifying the rate the of observed aster formation in the presence of sperm nuclei.</p><p>6) It is well known that ROPs are associated with plasma membranes, so the root epidermal experiment is not necessary. Add to the previous sentences, e.g. “as expected for a ROP”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04501.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) All three reviewers question the importance of the figure supplements devoted to evolution of ROPs and associated pathways; they are not described in the results and it is difficult to determine whether there has been a significant diversification and expansion of these gene families relative to others.

The discussion of this point should be refined</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it is impossible to rule out that the effect of actin disruptions is indirect. Yet, we could not detect any changes of cell structure beside actin filaments in DN-ACTIN lines although these might be below the obvious detection. Therefore, we added a sentence of caution in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“However, it still remains to be determined whether F-actin directly interacts with the sperm cell nucleus for migration. Further investigations should be made to rule out the possibility that the sperm cell nuclear migration defect by DN-ACTIN expression is not due to general perturbation of cellular structure.”</p><p><italic>4) ROP8 is specific to the central cell. The authors only address the function of ROP8 in the central cell and conclude that ROP8 is required for sperm cell migration in the central cell. The introduction makes it seem as though ROP8 controls actin dynamics in both female gametes. The authors should make it clear in the discussion and introduction that they have uncovered a potential component of the mechanism that regulates actin dynamics in the central cell, but this mechanism remains unknown for the egg</italic>.</p><p>The problem resulted from our attempt to avoid botanical terms for animal biologists. We have changed this and specified “central cell” and “egg cell” throughout where it was required. We also added the following statement to clarify that the mechanism in the egg cell remains to be determined: “It is plausible that a distinct ROP plays a similar role during egg cell fertilization, but it is also possible that other mechanisms control F-actin-dependent migration of the male nucleus to the egg cell nucleus.”</p><p><italic>5) The formation of aster-shaped actin structures around sperm nuclei is the best evidence (along with pharmacological disruption by myosin inhibitors) presented for a direct association between actin and sperm nuclei. This section could be improved by clarifying whether asters form in the absence of sperm nuclei and by quantifying the rate the of observed aster formation in the presence of sperm nuclei</italic>.</p><p>We added the following sentence in the result section to clarify our aster-like structure observation: “This aster-like structure of F-actin was only observed around the sperm cell nucleus in the central cell after plasmogamy (100%, n=48) and was never observed in unfertilized central cells (0%, n=72). Consistently, the time-lapse imaging showed the presence of aster-like F-actin structure only during sperm cell nucleus migration [100% (n=5); 0% in unfertilized ovule (n=14)].”</p><p><italic>6) It is well known that ROPs are associated with plasma membranes, so the root epidermal experiment is not necessary. Add to the previous sentences, e.g. “as expected for a ROP”</italic>.</p><p>Even if ROPs are generally associated with the plasma membrane, we show that ROP8 controls novel F-actin dynamics in the gametophytic central cell. Therefore, we think that it is of importance to test as a control that it does localize to the plasma membrane in somatic cell. To make this point clear, we added the following sentences in the result and discussion section, respectively: “indicating that ROP8 sub-localization is controlled by a general machinery common between the gametophytic central cell and somatic root epidermal cell” and “Although the machinery by which ROP8 is associated to the plasma membrane is general and the activity of ROP8 in the central cell should be investigated further, this putative constant active mode of ROP8 in the central cell might shed light on a new facet of Rho-GTPase function in plant cells.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
