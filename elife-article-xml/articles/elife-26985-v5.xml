in cell communication. Although GPCRs can form heteromers, their role in signaling remains elusive. Here we used rat metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors as prototypical dimers to study the functional interaction between each subunit. mGluRs can form both constitutive homo- and heterodimers. Whereas both mGlu2 and mGlu4 couple to G proteins, G protein activation is mediated by mGlu4 heptahelical domain (HD) exclusively in mGlu2-4 heterodimers. Such asymmetric transduction results from the action of both the dimeric extracellular domain, and an allosteric activation by the partially-activated non-functional mGlu2 HD. G proteins activation by mGlu2 HD occurs if either the mGlu2 HD is occupied by a positive allosteric modulator or if mGlu4 HD is inhibited by a negative modulator. These data revealed an oriented asymmetry in mGlu heterodimers that can be controlled with allosteric modulators. They provide new insight on the allosteric interaction between subunits in a GPCR dimer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cooperativity</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>G

complexes for signaling integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">González-Maeso et al., 2008</xref>). Among them, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most abundant and constitute the main targets in drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagerström and Schiöth, 2008</xref>). Although most GPCRs can signal in a monomeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Moustaine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whorton et al., 2007</xref>), increasing studies revealed that they can associate into both homo and heteromeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prezeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albizu et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, GPCR heteromers may generate original functional pharmacological entities different from each of the homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wertman and Dupré, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fribourg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Urizar et al., 2011</xref>). Whether such GPCR association is real in native tissue is still a matter of intense debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier and Hébert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lambert and Javitch, 2014</xref>). Understanding how a receptor can control the activity of its partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">González-Maeso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albizu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fribourg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vilardaga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2009</xref>) will certainly help clarify this important issue, opening ways to control the function of GPCR heteromers.</p><p>Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are class C GPCRs and are well-recognized constitutive homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kniazeff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>). These receptors are divided into three groups: group I (mGlu<sub>1,5</sub>), II (mGlu<sub>2,3</sub>) and III (mGlu<sub>4,6,7,8</sub>), on the basis of sequence homology, pharmacological profile and cellular signaling. Recently, mGluRs were shown to also form heterodimers with specific subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kammermeier, 2012</xref>). Of note, whereas the different mGluRs were commonly described as having specific brain distribution supporting their homodimeric nature, localization studies revealed subcellular co-localization of different mGluRs such as mGlu1 and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pandya et al., 2016</xref>), mGlu2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2014</xref>), mGlu7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferraguti et al., 2005</xref>). Further studies supported the existence of mGlu2-4 and 1–5 heterodimers in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pandya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno Delgado et al., 2017</xref>). Being identified very recently, not much is known about the possible clinical relevance of mGlu heterodimers, but already homodimeric mGlu4, rather than heterodimeric mGlu2-4, were proposed as a better target for Parkinson’s disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niswender et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, mGlu2-4 heterodimers control synaptic activity at the level of the cortico-striatal terminals in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2014</xref>) and lateral perforant path terminals in the dendate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno Delgado et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mGlu subunits are multidomain proteins composed of a Venus flytrap domain (VFT) containing the orthosteric binding site, connected via a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to a heptahelical domain (HD) involved in G protein coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>). In the case of mGlu homodimers, structural and biophysical studies revealed a symmetrical conformational change during activation at the level of the VFTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doumazane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rondard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, while activating one VFT is sufficient to partially activate the homodimers, activating both VFTs is required for full activity both in homodimeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kniazeff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>) and heterodimeric receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno Delgado et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, this symmetric activation of the VFT dimer leads to an asymmetric activation of the HD dimer, only one HD being active at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hlavackova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hlavackova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goudet et al., 2005</xref>). Whether mGlu heterodimer activation is symmetric or asymmetric, and whether either subunit can be involved in signaling remains unknown. Such analysis will likely bring interesting observation for the understanding of the allosteric coupling between GPCRs within hetero-complexes.</p><p>In this study, we choose mGlu2-4 heterodimer as a prototype heterodimer, as its existence in the brain has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno Delgado et al., 2017</xref>). We show that whereas both mGlu2 and mGlu4 HDs are capable of activating G proteins, only mGlu4 HD does it in mGlu2-4 heterodimers. Although a conformational change in the mGlu2 HD occurs that can be prevented by a mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator (NAM), it is not sufficient for a direct activation of G proteins, but important for the G protein coupling by the associated mGlu4 HD. This further documents the asymmetric activation of dimeric GPCRs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that manipulating the conformation of either mGlu2 or mGlu4 HD with positive and negative allosteric modulators can reorient the asymmetry towards mGlu2 activating G proteins. This demonstrates a differential ability of mGlu2 and mGlu4 HD to reach a G protein activating state. But most importantly, these data reveal strong allosteric interactions between two GPCRs in a dimeric complex. Such allosteric coupling can be controlled with small molecules allosteric modulators revealing a way to modulate heteromeric receptor activity, and expanding the possibilities of using such small molecules to precisely control signaling events.

Consistent with this, activating an mGlu2FS mutant with DCG-IV generated a signal providing this subunit is co-expressed with mGlu4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Note that under these experimental conditions, cells expressed three types of dimers, the mGlu2 and mGlu4 homodimers and the mGlu2-4 heterodimer. Accordingly, if mGlu4 was the FS mutated subunit, L-AP4 had no effect, while DCG-IV could generate a signal through mGlu2 homodimers. In contrast, if mGlu2FS mutant was used, DCG-IV could generate a signal through the 2–4 heterodimer, and L-AP4 through the mGlu4 homodimers. Correct expression and function of all constructs was verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This is not only observed with the mGlu2-4 but with any other heterodimers made of mGlu2 and a group-III mGlu subunits, where the group-III HD is always responsible for coupling. Such asymmetric activation of a GPCR dimer has often been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vilardaga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galvez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duthey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levoye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Even in the mGlu homodimers, only one subunit is active at a time, although in that case, each subunit has the same probability of being active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hlavackova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hlavackova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goudet et al., 2005</xref>). For the well-characterized heterodimeric GPCRs, such as the GABA<sub>B</sub> and the T1R taste receptors, also one subunit only is responsible for G protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galvez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duthey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2004</xref>), although this was assumed to result from the inability of the other subunit to signal. Our data suggest that instead, the inability of signaling of one subunit may result from an inhibitory effect of the other subunit while in its fully active state. This is indeed likely the case for the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor for which the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit, not involved in coupling in the heterodimer, has been reported to signal when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baloucoune et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richer et al., 2009</xref>). Similar asymmetric coupling has also been reported for class A GPCR heterodimers, where the activation of one receptor prevents the activation of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vilardaga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levoye et al., 2006</xref>). These observations reinforce the idea of a strong negative cooperativity between the HDs in a dimeric GPCR complex, where the activation of one subunit suppresses the ability of the other to signal. This conclusion is further supported by numerous studies reporting negative cooperativity in agonist binding on dimeric GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albizu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Urizar et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While mGlu4 homodimer coupling efficacy measured is lower than that of mGlu2, it is interesting to note that the coupling efficacy of mGlu2-4 heterodimer is similar to that of mGlu2 receptors. Because in both mGlu4 and mGlu2-4, the G protein activation is mediated by the mGlu4 HD, this means that the mGlu2 subunit potentiates mGlu4 efficacy. Such a low coupling efficacy of mGlu4 homodimers may well be the consequence of a weaker action of the mGlu4 ECD dimer on the HDs, consistent with the weaker coupling of heterodimers containing two mGlu4 ECDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It may also possibly result in part from another level of interaction between the HDs within a dimeric receptor. Even though the mGlu2 HD does not directly activate the G protein in the heterodimer, it is important for the full activation of the mGlu4 HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, the mGlu2 HD likely changes its conformation to exert this positive effect, even though this conformation is not sufficient for G protein coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is well demonstrated by the partial inhibition of the mGlu2-4 activity (mediated by the mGlu4 HD) by a specific mGlu2 NAM known to stabilize the mGlu2 HD in its inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hemstapat et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, State 3a). Such an action of the mGlu2 HD is even more prominent if the VFT dimer is asymmetrically activated, with only one VFT occupied by an agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, States 3b, 3c). Such data revealed important allosteric interaction between two HDs in a GPCR dimer, not expected so far. They are however perfectly in line with the role of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> HD in the activation process of the heterodimeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, the latter being involved in a direct activation of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> HD through an intra-molecular conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monnier et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data then further strengthen the multiple allosteric interactions between class C GPCR domains in the activation process, with the activation of one HD within the dimer being controlled in two ways. The first one is by the reorientation of the VFTs with an efficient coupling when the reorientation is symmetric (both VFTs activated), and a less efficient coupling in case only one VFT is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno Delgado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kniazeff et al., 2004</xref>). Of note, the sequence of the CRDs that link the VFTs to the HDs also plays a role, as indicated here by the differential coupling efficacies of receptor combinations containing either the mGlu2 CRD or the mGlu4 CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The second pathway comes from a conformational change in the associated HD likely through a direct interaction between the two HDs in the dimer, consistent with our previous data with the heterodimeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monnier et al., 2011</xref>). The second component is higher when the first, VFT mediated, is weak, due either to the activation of only one VFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or to specific combinations of the CRDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Such allosteric interaction most likely results from a contact between the two HDs via an interface that can communicate information from one HD to the other. This can be achieved if the interface involves component of the HD that changes conformation depending on the state of the subunit. Recently, we reported that, even though both HDs in a class C GPCR contact each other through TM4 and 5 in the basal state, as also reported for many class A GPCR dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manglik et al., 2012</xref>), we surprisingly identified TM6 as being involved in the dimer interface of the active receptor dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). TM6 is the TM that moves the most during class A GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rasmussen et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rasmussen et al., 2011b</xref>), also likely in class C GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>) for which the allosteric coupling between both HDs in a GPCR dimer is of fundamental mechanistic importance. More work is obviously needed to analyze the TM rearrangement in class C GPCR activation.</p><p>Another major observation is that it is possible, using small molecules to reorient the G protein coupling from one subunit to the other – i.e. from the mGlu4 HD to the mGlu2 HD in the mGlu2-4 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, States 4a, 4b). Indeed, by either preventing the activation of the mGlu4 HD with an mGlu4 specific NAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, States 4b), or by stabilizing the mGlu2 HD in its active conformation with a specific mGlu2 PAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, States 4b), the G protein coupling is transferred from the mGlu4 to the mGlu2 subunit. This observation suggests that the mGlu4 HD is likely more prone to reach a G protein activating state than the mGlu2 HD, and the fully active form of mGlu4 HD prevents the mGlu2 HD from reaching a G protein activating state. Such observation opens interesting possibilities to decipher the specific role of each subunit in this mGlu2-4 heterodimer, especially in specific brain area where it is expressed.</p><p>There is much interest in the development of allosteric modulators, since these are expected to have less side effects for several reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Changeux and Christopoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster and Conn, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">May et al., 2007</xref>). Such small molecules target a site that is under less pressure during evolution, such that it is possible to identify subtype selective molecules, in contrast to compound acting in the orthosteric binding site highly conserved between homologous receptors. In addition, PAMs do not constantly activate the receptor, then do not favor receptor desensitization and internalization. Moreover, because they enhance the action of endogenous ligands, they increase the response when and where needed for an improved physiological response. Here we reveal a novel property of such small molecules: their ability to control the asymmetric activation of a GPCR dimer.</p><p>Taken together, the present study illustrates the complex allosteric interaction occurring between two associated G protein-activating units, with both positive and negative interactions. Indeed, a conformational change in one subunit is needed for a full G protein activation by its associated subunit, although the interaction also prevents the first subunit from activating G proteins. Because more and more data are consistent with the existence of GPCR heteromers, our finding will certainly bring much interest in elucidating their possible roles in integrating signals targeting either subunit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>L-glutamate was purchased from Sigma.

The fluorescence signals (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm) were then measured for 60 s (Flex-Station, Molecular Devices). Agonist was added after the first 20 s. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is given as the agonist-stimulated fluorescence increase. Concentration response curves were fitted using Graph Pad Prism.</p><p>Inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in HEK293 cells co-transfected with indicated subunits was measured after stimulation with agonist for 30 min in 96-well microplates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hlavackova et al., 2005</xref>). After incubation in the presence of LiCl (10 mM, 30 min) and termination of the reaction with 0.1 M formic acid, the supernatant was recovered and purified by ion exchange chromatography using DOWEX resin. Radioactivity was measured using a Wallac1450 MicroBeta microplate liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed on at least three individual data sets analyzed by Graphpad prism using unpaired t-tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC grant nos. 31100548 to SH, and 31420103909, 31711530146, 31511130131), the Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to the Universities of the Ministry of Education (grant no.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Dmitry Veprintsev (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports an investigation of the allosteric control between subunits in a heterodimer of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 and 4, using an elegant and ingenious quality control system that assures surface expression of only the intended dimers. The study reports asymmetric activation of dimeric metabotropic glutamate receptors, such that if a mGlu2 subunit is present, mGlu4 is responsible for the G protein activation in the heterodimer. By using subtype specific agonists, as well as swapping the extracellular domains between the subtypes, the authors were also able to show that it is possible to activate signaling by the heterodimer via activation of the mGlu2 extracellular domain. Using constitutively-active cross-linked extracellular domains the authors also demonstrate that no matter how the extracellular domains are activated, it is the mGlu4 that is responsible for signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are enthusiastic about the manuscript. However, they raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) Two of the reviewers raise serious doubts about the interpretation of the molecular dynamics simulations. These concerns can be summarized as: (1) the fluctuations of loop regions in a homology model during a simulation could have many origins unrelated to the activation mechanism, and since appropriate methodological details were not provided [the sequence identity of the template; the final alignment and curations of the alignment; the loop lengths and templates; structural reliability measures for those segments; providing the model as supplementary material], it is not clear that the models are sufficiently reliable in these regions to avoid such artifacts; (2) even if the models were reliable, it is entirely possible that differences in fluctuations of ~1 Å would not be robust to repeated, parallel simulations (n&gt;1); and (3) critically, the underlying assumption that asymmetric dynamics in a dimer should be detectable as fluctuations on the timescale of microseconds in the monomer is speculative. For these reasons, this section of the manuscript should be removed before resubmission, and the conclusions adjusted accordingly.</p><p>2) The overall message of the manuscript should be communicated more consistently throughout the manuscript. In particular, from the data and from the discussion it is clear that some conformational change, but maybe not the full activation of mGlu2, is required for the allosteric activation of the mGlu4. In other places (abstract, end of introduction) this effect is described too simplistically as 'negative cooperativity'.</p><p>In addition, the statement in the abstract: 'revealed a dynamics &quot;winner-take-all&quot; mechanism in mGlu heterodimers, providing new insight on the allosteric control between subunits in a GPCR dimer’ implies some kinetic aspects and time-resolution of the measurements while no kinetic measurements were presented. Rewording this statement could help avoid confusion.</p><p>3) Cell-surface expression levels are not always clearly reported. Statistical analysis of the expression levels would aid in interpretation of the results, specifically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, cell surface expression is only statistically compared with mock and not among the different heteromers. In this case, the data look similar, but this does not seem to be the case for several of the supplemental figures (see below).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> show the same type of data but use different Y axes (Fluorescence units or fold change over Mock, or normalised to the highest value). This makes it difficult to compare the experiments. It would be better to use the same Y axis – whichever is the most informative.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref> – the signal amplitude for the 2-4 heterodimer seem to be inconsistent on these two panels while it is consistent on others.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> – The data presented are inconsistent with the previously presented data (compounded by the use of a different normalization along Y) and with the statement that the signaling is mediated via mGlu4. In the presence of NAM and a deactivating mutations signaling was observed. Panel D: are the differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release between the two different 2-4 heteromers statistically significantly different? And if so: what could be an explanation for this (it seems that the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is less profound when CRD is also from mGlu2)?</p><p>7) A more in-depth discussion of the following results is required:a) While it is concluded that the allosteric control of signaling is mediated via the 7TM domains, it is also worth discussing the possibility that some allosteric control could be mediated via the 7TM-VFT1-VFT2-7TM path, and only via the direct 7TM-7TM path. Three must be bi-directional allosteric connections between the 7TM and the VFT domains, and the allosteric coupling between the individual VFT domain has also been shown by the authors themselves.</p><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: glutamate has a lower efficacy at mGlu4-4 compared to 2-2, 2-4, 4-2. Is that because 2 positively affects 4? This matter is not discussed. The high efficacy (Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) of 2-4 and 4-2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is not seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.</p><p>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: why does mutation of one of the two monomers in mGlu2-2 lead to a larger decrease in glutamate efficacy than in mGlu4 dimers? Does mGlu2-2 couple to 2 G-proteins to reach highest activity, in contrast to mGlu4-4, 4-2 or 2-4 for which coupling to 1 G-protein is sufficient? Again, the use of different y-axes complicates ready comparison.</p><p>d) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> C: why are there differences between 2x-4 and 4-2x? Could this be due to differences in expression level?</p><p>e) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the receptors consisting of VFT and CRD derived from mGlu2 consistently show a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. This fact is not discussed.</p><p>f) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it is not clear why IP accumulation is monitored in this particular experiment as opposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the others.</p><p>g) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, there are differences in expression levels: do they correlate with efficacy?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised work entitled &quot;Allosteric control of an asymmetric transduction in a G protein-coupled receptor heterodimer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revisions and responses have been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>We are willing to accept the manuscript for publication, provided that the molecular simulations are excluded. Although the nominal accuracy of the models on which the simulations are based appears to be reasonable (50% identity, high coverage), thereby addressing one of our previous concerns, it remains questionable whether the conclusions extracted from these simulations are sufficiently robust and convincing. The fundamental claim that microsecond-scale fluctuations of these two intracellular loops relate to the activation of a ligand-bound dimer is speculation – particularly for an apo, monomeric receptor. Critically, this claim is also not convincingly supported by the simulation data provided, based on the information added to the revision. Only one MD trajectory was calculated for the mGlu2 model, and although the trajectories are 5 microseconds-long, analysis of RMSD versus time shows the models continue to drift away from the starting structure throughout the simulation; therefore, it is unclear whether the observed fluctuations reflect functional dynamics or inaccuracies of the models. Indeed, no molecular explanation is given as to why one protein is &quot;more dynamic&quot; than another, leaving open the strong possibility that this difference owes to the differences in the quality of the models or how the simulations were set up or conducted. On top of this, the simulations include an apo monomer, rather than a ligand-bound dimer whose actions are being monitored in the experiments. In summary, the molecular simulations are insufficient to support the hypothesis put forward, and the relevance of the observations is too tenuous. It is our opinion that the speculation of the underlying mechanism for activation of mGlu4 vs mGlu2 is equally plausible without the simulations.</p><p>– There is a typo in the revised abstract: &quot;their role in receptor remains elusive&quot; (insert signaling)</p><p>– There is no reference to rat mGlu2 being used in the abstract, as indicated in the response regarding the title.</p><p>– In the Discussion section: The phrase: &quot;the consequence of the mGlu4 ECD dimer&quot;, is confusing and possibly incomplete, since it refers also to data relating to mGlu2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26985.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Two of the reviewers raise serious doubts about the interpretation of the molecular dynamics simulations.

For these reasons, this section of the manuscript should be removed before resubmission, and the conclusions adjusted accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referees that molecular modeling and especially MD simulations on 3D models highly depend on the quality of the models, and on the conditions used to conduct the molecular dynamics. We agree also that such data remains theoretical and can thus be criticized, unless supported by experimental data. In addition, we are well aware that the dynamics studies were performed using isolated HDs, not with the heterodimer. As such only part of what is undergoing is being analyzed since our studies did not consider the influence of one HD partner on the dynamics of the other.</p><p>With this in mind, and despite these well-deserved criticisms, we still consider our modeling study brings an interesting idea (not a conclusion) on what is possibly going on, leading to the G protein activation by one subunit (mGlu4) and not the other. We then propose to keep these data (now transferred to Appendix 1), supported by additional information, but we have modified our text, both results and discussion, to take such criticism into account, and to help the reader interpret these data with a degree of caution.</p><p>We have added more data to illustrate how the 3D models were generated, and how they have been validated (seq alignment details, templates, loop lengths etc.). We can also include homology model coordinates for the reviewer(s) to inspect (as separate files). Of note, the mGlu HDs share a similar target-template sequence identity (about 50%), such that 3D models are relatively accurate according to the actual methods used to generate them, especially the helices and their assembly. Specifically, an extra analysis of secondary structure has been included, which shows both 3D models have high structural stability during simulations. Recently, we used a similar approach to study the mode of action of the allosteric modulator MPEP that led us to propose a model to explain why MPEP is a NAM on mGlu5, and a PAM on mGlu4 (Dalton et al., 2017).</p><p>Because of the maintained symmetry at the level of the VFT, we speculated that the asymmetry at the level of the HD dimer comes from specific properties of the HD domains. One possibility being that the mGlu4 HD can reach the active state more easily, then requiring less energy, and as a consequence prevented the mGlu2 HD from reaching a fully functional state. Then, our in silico analysis mainly focused on the ability of the HD core to spontaneously “open” on its intracellular side, as an isolated domain in a lipid bilayer. In this respect we measure both distances between key intracellular loops and between key TM helices (the latter is a new addition). We find these measures to be related, although the difference between loops is more marked than between helices (~7 Å compared to ~2.5 Å). We also found that the mGlu2 3D model is more stable conformationally in its initial inactive state than mGlu4. Because both models were generated using the same methodology with similar target-template seq IDs, and were tested under the same in silico conditions (over long time periods), such an observation is consistent with our proposal. Even with the limitations mentioned above, we think these data provide a way for the reader to better understand what is possibly going on. It may also enable more focused future studies, either by ourselves or by others.</p><p> <italic>2) The overall message of the manuscript should be communicated more consistently throughout the manuscript. In particular, from the data and from the discussion it is clear that some conformational change, but maybe not the full activation of mGlu2, is required for the allosteric activation of the mGlu4. In other places (abstract, end of introduction) this effect is described too simplistically as 'negative cooperativity'.</italic> </p><p>Our observation that mGlu2 HD undergoes a conformational change, not sufficient for G protein activation, but necessary for a full activity of the mGlu4 HD is now presented clearly at the end of the introduction and at the beginning of the discussion. We extended a little the abstract to also indicate this point: “Such asymmetric transduction goes through both a direct activation of mGlu4 heptahelical domain (HD) by the dimeric extracellular domain, and an allosteric activation by a partially-activated non-functional mGlu2 HD”.</p><p> <italic>In addition, the statement in the abstract: 'revealed a dynamics &quot;winner-take-all&quot; mechanism in mGlu heterodimers, providing new insight on the allosteric control between subunits in a GPCR dimer' implies some kinetic aspects and time-resolution of the measurements while no kinetic measurements were presented. Rewording this statement could help avoid confusion.</italic> </p><p>The referee is correct that this way of presenting our conclusion implies some kinetic aspects that we did not examine. The sentence has been modified as follow: “These data revealed an oriented asymmetry in mGlu heterodimers that can be controlled with allosteric modulators. They provide new insight on the allosteric interaction between subunits in a GPCR dimer.”</p><p>We also modified the “One sentence summary” from “In mGlu heterodimers, the subunit that reaches first the active state couples to G protein, and prevents the other from signaling “to “In mGlu heterodimers, an oriented asymmetrical activation revealed complex allosteric interaction between subunit”.</p><p> <italic>3) Cell-surface expression levels are not always clearly reported. Statistical analysis of the expression levels would aid in interpretation of the results, specifically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, cell surface expression is only statistically compared with mock and not among the different heteromers. In this case, the data look similar, but this does not seem to be the case for several of the supplemental figures (see below).</italic> </p><p>The figures reporting the cell surface expression have been simplified (we removed the total expression determined after cell permeabilization since these data did not bring much information), and made clearer to read. The main aim of these measurements was to check whether non-functional receptor dimer combinations were indeed expressed at the surface, to be able to conclude these receptors are not capable of activating G protein upon agonist stimulation. However, due to a non-linear relationship between cell surface expression and Fluo4 fluorescence intensity, we did not attempt to use this information to determine precisely the coupling efficacy of any given receptor combination. To do so, we should be sure we are in a linear relationship for both the signaling response measured and the cell surface receptor generated signal. By experience, we should use the IP One assay, rather than the Fluo4 assay, and use SNAP-tag surface labeling rather that sandwich ELISA for the cell surface quantification. Accordingly, we did not attempt to determine whether the variations on cell surface expression could be significant.</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> show the same type of data but use different Y axes (Fluorescence units or fold change over Mock, or normalised to the highest value). This makes it difficult to compare the experiments. It would be better to use the same Y axis – whichever is the most informative.</italic> </p><p>Data in most figures are now raw data, expressed as the fluo4 fluorescence signal amplitude, as determined with a flexstation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We however kept the normalized representation (% of maximal Glutamate effect, or% of constitutive activity) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in order to make clear the differential effect of the mGlu2 NAM MNI137 on the different receptor dimer combinations.</p><p> <italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref> – the signal amplitude for the 2-4 heterodimer seem to be inconsistent on these two panels while it is consistent on others.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this, since the original panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> corresponded to an experiment where a different transfection protocol was used (lipofectamine, instead of electroporation). We now replaced this panel with data obtained under the same conditions as in the other panels, and as reported in the Materials and methods section. Note however, that differences can still be observed that correspond to variations between individual experiments as expected because of the transient transfection procedure. Since we decided to show raw data, we present data corresponding to means of triplicates from a typical experiment. Each experiment was reproduced at least three times. The mean potencies and relative maximum calculated from n independent experiments are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—source data file 1.</p><p> <italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> – The data presented are inconsistent with the previously presented data (compounded by the use of a different normalization along Y) and with the statement that the signaling is mediated via mGlu4. In the presence of NAM and a deactivating mutations signaling was observed.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the mistake in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and B. This is obviously not the mGlu4 subunit that was made incapable of signaling, but as stated in the text, the mGlu2 subunit. Indeed, the referee is correct, when the mGlu4 subunit is mutated, no signal can be measured, and then, no inhibition by MNI137. The figure has been corrected.</p><p><italic>Panel D: are the differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release between the two different 2-4 heteromers statistically significantly different? And if so: what could be an explanation for this (it seems that the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>release is less profound when CRD is also from mGlu2)?</italic></p><p>The referee is right, MNI137 induced a smaller inhibition (39.2 ± 4.7%, n=3) when both CRDs are from mGlu2, compared to the situation where the mGlu4 HD is associated with the mGlu4 CRD (64.3 ± 3.8% inhibition, n=3, p&lt;0.05). If we accept the idea that they are two main allosteric pathways leading to the mGlu4 HD activation, one coming from the mGlu2 HD, the other from the VFT dimer, we can propose that the VFT dimer component (that insensitive to MNI137) is higher in the receptor combination containing both CRDs from mGlu2. In other words, this suggests a better activation of the HDs by the dimeric mGlu2 ECDs. The influence of the CRD type in receptor activation in now discussed in our revised manuscript in a new paragraph added in the discussion.</p><p> <italic>7) A more in-depth discussion of the following results is required:a) While it is concluded that the allosteric control of signaling is mediated via the 7TM domains, it is also worth discussing the possibility that some allosteric control could be mediated via the 7TM-VFT1-VFT2-7TM path, and only via the direct 7TM-7TM path. Three must be bi-directional allosteric connections between the 7TM and the VFT domains, and the allosteric coupling between the individual VFT domain has also been shown by the authors themselves.</italic> </p><p>We have added a paragraph in the discussion to make this point clearer.</p><p> <italic>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: glutamate has a lower efficacy at mGlu4-4 compared to 2-2, 2-4, 4-2. Is that because 2 positively affects 4? This matter is not discussed. The high efficacy (Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) of 2-4 and 4-2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is not seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.</italic> </p><p>It is true that using this Gqi9-mediated signaling assay, the mGlu4 homodimer displays a lower efficacy compared to the mGlu2 homodimer and mGlu2-4 heterodimer. This is consistent with data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (previously Figure 7—figure supplement 1). As indicated by the referee, the simplest explanation is that the mGlu2 subunit increases the G protein-coupling efficacy of the mGlu4 HD. Alternatively we think this may simply be a specific property of the group-III dimeric VFTs. Indeed, the dimers in which both ECDs are from mGlu4 display a lower efficacy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> even highlights the dimeric mGlu4 CRDs as being important for the low coupling efficacy. More work is clearly needed to better understand this observation. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript at the beginning of the third paragraph of the discussion.</p><p>Regarding the apparent efficacy difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1F</xref>, see our answer to the main point 5 above.</p><p><italic>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: why does mutation of one of the two monomers in mGlu2-2 lead to a larger decrease in glutamate efficacy than in mGlu4 dimers? Does mGlu2-2 couple to 2 G-proteins to reach highest activity, in contrast to mGlu4-4, 4-2 or 2-4 for which coupling to 1 G-protein is sufficient? Again, the use of different y-axes complicates ready comparison.</italic> </p><p>The referee is correct, mutating one subunit in mGlu2 dimer decreased receptor efficacy to 50% of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—source data file 1) as already reported with mGlu1 (Hlavackova et al., 2005). Such a decrease in signaling is proposed to be the consequence that only one HD is active at a time, with an equal probability of each subunit to reach an active state (see also Goudet et al., 2005). As such, a receptor dimer in which the mutated HD is in an active conformation does not couple, then leading to a decrease in coupling efficacy by about 50%. According to this proposal, the mutated HD does not activate the G protein, but is still able to reach an active conformation. It is then interesting to note that a lower decrease in efficacy is observed with mGlu4 upon mutation of one subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—source data file 1). We added a new column in the table <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-source data file 1 where the means maximal responses are presented. More work will be needed to understand why, but we can propose that the loss of function mutation on mGlu4 ic3 not only prevents G protein activation, but also reduces the ability of the HD to reach the active state, such that in the case of a mGlu4 dimer with only one subunit mutated, the wild-type HD will be more keen to activate G protein. We think it is not necessary to describe such a speculative hypothesis in the discussion.</p><p> <italic>d) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>: why are there differences between 2x-4 and 4-2x? Could this be due to differences in expression level?</italic> </p><p>It is true that in the presented experiment, DCG-IV generated a larger response on the 2x<sub>C1</sub>-4<sub>C2</sub> receptor, than the 2x<sub>C2</sub>-4<sub>C1</sub> receptor when the Gqi coupling is being analyzed. Note that such a difference is found neither when both DCG-IV and L-AP4 are applied (suggesting there is no major difference in expression level), nor when coupling to Gqo is being analyzed. When analyzing the data from the two other experiments performed, no such difference was found.</p><p> <italic>e) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the receptors consisting of VFT and CRD derived from mGlu2 consistently show a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. This fact is not discussed.</italic> </p><p>The referee is correct, any receptor combination made of two mGlu4 VFTs display a lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, this is also the case for any other group-III mGluRs. See our answer to main point 7(b) above.</p><p> <italic>f) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: it is not clear why IP accumulation is monitored in this particular experiment as opposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the others.</italic> </p><p>In this figure, we analyzed the coupling capacity of receptor dimer combinations that are made constitutively active through a disulfide bond linking the CRDs in an active position. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are transient, and return close to basal values after few minutes of constant activation, the constitutive activity of Gq coupled receptors cannot be measured with Fluo4 fluorescence assay. We then turned to the quantification of IP1 that can start to accumulate due to the constitutive activity of the mutant receptor, as soon as we block the IP1 degrading enzyme with LiCl. The reason for the choice of this assay is now clearly explained in the Results section.</p><p> <italic>g) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>: there are differences in expression levels: do they correlate with efficacy?</italic></p><p>The surface expression levels were primarily measured to check whether non-functional combinations were indeed expressed at a correct level. Unfortunately, the relationship between the expression at the surface and the Fluo4 signal is not linear, due to a rapid saturation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Then trying to correlate expression level with maximal response in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> assay is rather complex, and I think, not needed for the main take home message of this manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We are willing to accept the manuscript for publication, provided that the molecular simulations are excluded. Although the nominal accuracy of the models on which the simulations are based appears to be reasonable (50% identity, high coverage), thereby addressing one of our previous concerns, it remains questionable whether the conclusions extracted from these simulations are sufficiently robust and convincing. The fundamental claim that microsecond-scale fluctuations of these two intracellular loops relate to the activation of a ligand-bound dimer is speculation –particularly for an apo, monomeric receptor. Critically, this claim is also not convincingly supported by the simulation data provided, based on the information added to the revision. Only one MD trajectory was calculated for the mGlu2 model, and although the trajectories are 5 microseconds-long, analysis of RMSD versus time shows the models continue to drift away from the starting structure throughout the simulation; therefore, it is unclear whether the observed fluctuations reflect functional dynamics or inaccuracies of the models. Indeed, no molecular explanation is given as to why one protein is &quot;more dynamic&quot; than another, leaving open the strong possibility that this difference owes to the differences in the quality of the models or how the simulations were set up or conducted. On top of this, the simulations include an apo monomer, rather than a ligand-bound dimer whose actions are being monitored in the experiments. In summary, the molecular simulations are insufficient to support the hypothesis put forward, and the relevance of the observations is too tenuous. It is our opinion that the speculation of the underlying mechanism for activation of mGlu4 vs mGlu2 is equally plausible without the simulations.</italic> </p><p> <italic>– There is a typo in the revised abstract: &quot;their role in receptor remains elusive&quot; (insert signaling)</italic> </p><p><italic>– There is no reference to rat mGlu2 being used in the abstract, as indicated in the response regarding the title.</italic> </p><p><italic>– In the Discussion section: The phrase: &quot;the consequence of the mGlu4 ECD dimer&quot;, is confusing and possibly incomplete, since it refers also to data relating to mGlu2.</italic></p><p>As requested, we removed any reference to the MD simulations presented in Appendix 1, and of course we also removed the Appendix 1 and the related figures and files of the 3D models.
