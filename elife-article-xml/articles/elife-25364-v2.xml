Neuronal synapses are adhesions specialized for communication and they come in two types, chemical and electrical. Communication at chemical synapses occurs via neurotransmitter release whereas electrical synapses utilize gap junctions for direct ionic and metabolic coupling. Electrical synapses are often viewed as symmetrical structures, with the same components making both sides of the gap junction. By contrast, we show that a broad set of electrical synapses in zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, require two gap-junction-forming Connexins for formation and function. We find that one Connexin functions presynaptically while the other functions postsynaptically in forming the channels. We also show that these synapses are required for the speed and coordination of escape responses. Our data identify a genetic basis for molecular asymmetry at vertebrate electrical synapses and show they are required for appropriate behavioral performance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25364.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25364.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>electrical synapse</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd><kwd>neural circuit wiring</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>connexins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32NS074839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH109498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Granato</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY012857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brien</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD076585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moens</surname><given-names>Cecilia B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS076950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moens</surname><given-names>Cecilia B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00NS085035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrical synapses are neuronal, gap-junction-based connections found throughout the nervous system that, in the escape circuit of zebrafish, are composed of molecularly distinct pre- and postsynaptic junction forming proteins that are required for behavioral performance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain function is derived from the patterns of connectivity and the types of synapses made between neurons within a circuit. Synapses come in two main types, chemical and electrical, that together dynamically define neural circuit function across all life stages and animal phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meier and Dermietzel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereda, 2014</xref>). Chemical synapses are broadly used within the nervous system and are overtly asymmetric at the molecular and functional level, with communication between neurons achieved via presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic neurotransmitter reception. Electrical synapses are best known for their roles in early nervous system development, however they are found throughout the brain from inception to adulthood and contribute to function from sensation to central processing to motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hormuzdi et al., 2004</xref>). Electrical synapses are generally viewed as molecularly and functionally symmetric, allowing for very fast bidirectional ionic and metabolic neuronal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>). This direct route of communication is achieved by neuronal gap junctions (GJs) that are formed from plaques of tens to thousands of channels between the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hormuzdi et al., 2004</xref>). While often viewed as simple channels, work in invertebrates has found that unique GJ-forming proteins can be contributed asymmetrically from each side of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Starich et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the molecular asymmetry can create functional asymmetry (rectification) in ionic flow through the GJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>). In vertebrate nervous systems electron microscopy and electrophysiology suggests that electrical synapse structure and function can also be asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brightman and Reese, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>). However, the genetic basis for such molecular asymmetry at vertebrate electrical synapses has never been identified.</p><p>Neuronal GJs are intercellular channels that establish cytoplasmic continuity between two cells allowing ions and molecules less than ~1 kilodalton to traverse between cells. Each channel is composed of two hemi-channels, one contributed by each neuron, that interact via their extracellular domains to form the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>). Vertebrate GJ-forming proteins are the Connexins (Cx) while invertebrates use an evolutionarily distinct but functionally equivalent set of Innexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phelan, 2005</xref>). In mammals there are 21 genes encoding Cx proteins of which five are known to be expressed in neurons and to form electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Söhl et al., 2005</xref>). A partial genome duplication that occurred in teleost fish has increased the number of Cx-encoding genes, and the ensuing evolutionary trajectories saw some genes being duplicated and others lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eastman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruciani and Mikalsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zoidl et al., 2008</xref>). This diversity of Cxs encoded in the genome results in cases where individual cells or apposed cells express multiple different GJ-forming proteins providing the opportunity for heteromeric hemichannels made from multiple Cxs or heterotypic channels made by pairing hemichannels between cells with different Cxs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palacios-Prado et al., 2014a</xref>). In vertebrates, heterotypic GJs between cells in non-neuronal tissue are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodenough and Paul, 2009</xref>), however it has been notoriously difficult to identify heterotypic Cx configurations at electrical synapses in neurons.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25364.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> is required for electrical synapse formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an electrical synapse, a specialized neuronal gap junction.

We focus on the Mauthner neural circuit, which mediates a fast escape behavior, since it has uniquely identifiable pre- and postsynaptic neurons making stereotyped electrical synapses that contribute to the escape response. We find that two Cx-encoding genes, <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> and <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic>, are required for synapse assembly and function. Both of these Cx proteins are localized to synapses throughout the Mauthner circuit, as well as other synapses within the hindbrain and spinal cord, and each requires the other for recruitment to the synapse. Using chimeric analysis we demonstrate a dramatic asymmetry at electrical synapses in the circuit: <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> is necessary and sufficient postsynaptically while <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> is necessary and sufficient presynaptically for synapse formation. Using high throughput behavioral analysis we find that the electrical synapses contribute to the speed and coordination of the Mauthner-induced escape response. Together our data support a model wherein molecularly asymmetric electrical synapses act in concert with chemical synapses to impart performance onto the neural network output.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>disconnect3</italic> mutation disrupts <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> and electrical synapse formation</title><p>To investigate genes required for electrical synapse formation in vivo we used the Mauthner (M) neural circuit of larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Mauthner circuit coordinates an escape response to a variety of threatening stimuli and produces the fastest sensorimotor reflex performed by fish (~5 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, ~10 ms to complete) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgess and Granato, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). The Mauthner circuit that produces the escape is a combination of electrical, excitatory chemical, and inhibitory chemical synapses contained within a relatively simple set of neurons that must be coordinated to ensure fast and robust escapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>). The circuit is wired to ensure that it makes unidirectional turns away from the stimulus. To do so, vibrational stimuli are transmitted to the Mauthner neurons via the VIIIth cranial nerve auditory afferents, which make prominent and stereotyped mixed electrical and glutamatergic chemical synapses at so-called Club Ending synapses, hereafter called the Aud/M synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). Mauthner in turn sends a contralateral projection down the length of the spinal cord where it activates primary motorneurons (MNs) in each hemisegment and drives the stereotypical C-bend-shaped escape away from stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>). The projecting Mauthner axon concurrently activates CoLo interneurons in each segment via excitatory electrical synapses; CoLo in turn re-crosses the spinal cord and inhibits MNs on the stimulus side, thereby ensuring coordinated turns away from the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). Throughout the paper we use the terms pre- and postsynaptic for electrical synapses based on three main criteria: (1) information flow, as described above, from auditory afferents (pre) to Mauthner dendrite (post), then from Mauthner axon (pre) to CoLo (post) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>); (2) Mauthner itself is a bipolar neuron with unique axonal (pre) and dendritic (post) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimmel et al., 1981</xref>); (3) both the Aud/M and M/CoLo electrical synapses have closely associated chemical synapse components with the neurotransmitter receptors localizing to postsynaptic compartments of the neurons (Mauthner dendrite in the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2014</xref>], CoLo proximal portion of the neurite on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2015</xref>]). The Mauthner and CoLo neurons can be visualized using the transgenic line <italic>zf206Et(Tol-056)</italic>, hereafter called <italic>M/CoLo:GFP</italic>, which expresses GFP in both neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). The electrical synapses of the Mauthner circuit can be visualized by immunostaining using a polyclonal antibody against the human Cx36 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To identify genes required for electrical synapse formation we mutagenized animals with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) to generate random genomic mutations and created gynogenetic-diploid mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker et al., 2009</xref>) to screen for disruptions to the Cx36 staining found at M/CoLo synapses at 3 days post fertilization (dpf)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). We identified a mutation we called <italic>disconnect3</italic> (<italic>dis3</italic>) that caused a complete loss of Cx36 staining at the M/CoLo synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cx36 staining was disrupted at Mauthner electrical synapses and other electrical synapses in <italic>dis3</italic> mutants across all timepoints examined (2 to 14 dpf). The stereotyped number of Mauthner and CoLo neurons was not disrupted in <italic>dis3</italic> mutants: Mauthner –wildtype, heterozygous, and mutant animals had 2 ± 0 Mauthners / animal; CoLo – wildtype, heterozygous, and mutant avg. 1.975 ± 0.06, 2 ± 0.06, and 2 ± 0 CoLos/8 segments / animal, respectively (segments 5–12 were counted, mean ± standard deviation, n = 5, 11, 5 for wildtype, heterozygous, and mutant, respectively). Moreover, in <italic>dis3</italic> mutants the M and CoLo neurites contact one another in the spinal cord similar to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These results suggest that the gene disrupted by the <italic>dis3</italic> mutation may have a specific role in electrical synapse formation.</p><p>To identify the causative gene we used an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach that identifies shared regions of genomic homozygosity in a pool of mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). We separately pooled 108 mutant (<italic>-/-</italic>) and 108 wildtype (<italic>+/+</italic> and <italic>+/-</italic>) siblings and extracted and sequenced mRNA (Illumina Hi-Seq) from each pool. The sequences were aligned to the genome and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the wildtype pool to serve as mapping markers. The SNP frequency was assessed in the mutant pool, identifying an ~1.8 megabase (Mb) region of homozygosity on chromosome 5 in <italic>dis3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Within this region we used the RNA-seq data to look for potentially deleterious mutations and found that there were two missense changes to a Cx-encoding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Cx proteins are labeled for their molecular weight, while the genes encoding the proteins are named for one of five classes in which they reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Söhl and Willecke, 2004</xref>). The missense changes identified in <italic>dis3</italic> mutants disrupts the gene <italic>gap junction delta 1a</italic> (<italic>gjd1a</italic>) encoding a Cx with a predicated molecular weight of 34.1 kiloDaltons (Cx34.1). This gene is highly related to the mammalian <italic>gjd2</italic> gene encoding Cx36 (see below). For clarity throughout, when referring to zebrafish Cxs we will use both the official gene name as well as its molecular weight designation, in this case <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic>. Within the ~1.8 Mb region of mapping there were an additional 10 missense mutations in other genes and one gene with significantly reduced expression compared to wildtype. To determine if the mutations in <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> were causative for the phenotype we generated an eight base pair (bp) frame-shifting mutation at nucleotide 4 of exon 1 (<italic>gjd1a<sup>fh436</sup></italic>) using transcription activator-like-effector nucleases (TALENs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanjana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). We found that larvae homozygous for the frameshift mutation (<italic>gjd1a<sup>fh436/fh436</sup></italic>) phenocopy the loss of Cx36-staining at M/CoLo synapses observed in the <italic>dis3</italic> mutants; moreover, <italic>gjd1a<sup>fh436</sup></italic> failed to complement the <italic>dis3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We renamed the <italic>dis3</italic> mutation <italic>gjd1a<sup>fh360</sup></italic> and conclude that <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> is required for M/CoLo electrical synapse formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>gjd1</italic> (Cx34) and <italic>gjd2</italic> (Cx35/Cx36) are part of a family of highly conserved genes/proteins</title><p>In mammals there are five unique Connexins that form electrical synapses, with the <italic>gjd2/cx36</italic> gene being the most studied due to its widespread use in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Söhl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereda, 2014</xref>). Previous work in zebrafish and goldfish has implicated two Cx36-related proteins, Cx34.7 and Cx35.1, as being present at electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlisle and Ribera, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>). We wondered how <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> related to these and other Connexins and so used its sequence to search the zebrafish genome for similar genes. This identified three highly-related loci, two of these being the previously identified <italic>gjd1b/cx34.7</italic> and <italic>gjd2b/cx35.1</italic>, while the third is predicted to encode a Cx with a molecular weight of 35.5 kD, <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Within this group of four Cx-encoding genes, all of the predicted proteins share greater than 85% amino acid identity to each other and to mammalian Cx36 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The main variation in protein sequence arises in the intracellular loop, with some modest variation in the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We examined the evolutionary relationship between these proteins and found that they represent two distinct Cx sub-families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In basal vertebrates (lamprey) we found only one gene within the family, this gene was subsequently duplicated creating two sub-families – the Cx35/36 proteins encoded by <italic>gjd2</italic> genes and the Cx34 proteins encoded by genes we have named <italic>gjd1</italic>. Genes within both of these families are found in lineages up to and including birds, but in mammals the <italic>gjd1</italic> family has apparently been lost. In bony fishes, including zebrafish, these gene families underwent another duplication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Postlethwait et al., 2004</xref>), resulting in the four extant genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Previous work has found that the <italic>gjd1b/cx34.7</italic> and <italic>gjd2b/cx35.1</italic> genes are expressed in the nervous system of zebrafish, analogous to <italic>gjd2</italic> (Cx36) expression in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlisle and Ribera, 2014</xref>).

To examine these genes we generated mutations in each of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and analyzed the effect of their loss on electrical synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). We examined the electrical synapses made onto the M cell body and dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and particularly focused on the stereotyped Aud/M synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the M/CoLo electrical synapses of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The anti-human-Cx36 antibody used for staining recognizes all four of the proteins generated by the zebrafish <italic>gjd1/2</italic> genes when each is expressed in HeLa cells (see Materials and methods). We found that <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> mutants affected not only the M/CoLo synapses in the spinal cord, but also the Aud/M synapses, as well as other electrical synapses made onto the Mauthner cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). In analyzing mutants for the other three genes, we found that <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> mutants also lost Mauthner electrical synapses in the hindbrain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>) while <italic>gjd1b/cx34.7</italic> and <italic>gjd2b/cx35.1</italic> had no effect on Cx36 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). In quantifying the amount of Cx36-staining at Mauthner synapses we found that in <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> mutants there was a complete absence of detectable Cx protein at synapses throughout the Mauthner circuit. In <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> mutants the Cx36 staining at M/CoLo synapses was lost, but we note that ~ 30% of staining remained (an ~4 fold reduction) at the Aud/M synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,J,K</xref>).

Similarly, when presynaptic neurons (auditory afferent neurons in the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>] or Mauthner in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>]) lacked <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> the electrical synapses were normal. However, when the postsynaptic neuron (Mauthner in the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>] or CoLo in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>]) lacked <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> the electrical synapses were affected. Conversely, we found exactly the opposite requirement for <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5:</italic> removing its function presynaptically, but not postsynaptically, resulted in the loss of associated electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–O</xref>). Moreover, presynaptic removal of g<italic>jd2a/cx35.5</italic> resulted in a complete loss of Cx36 staining at any associated synapse, while postsynaptic loss of <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> resulted in no staining at M/CoLo synapses and an ~4 fold reduction of Cx36 staining at Aud/M synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P,Q</xref>), consistent with the decrease observed in whole mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). This suggests that at M/CoLo synapses Cx35.5 and Cx34.1 are the exclusive pre- and postsynaptic Cxs, respectively, while at the Aud/M synapses Cx35.5 is the sole presynaptic Cx while Cx34.1 is required postsynaptically for the majority of GJ channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P,Q</xref>). We note that even within the single Mauthner neuron both Cx-encoding genes are required for electrical synapse formation, but their functions are spatially restricted to the dendrite (<italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>) versus the axon (<italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). We conclude that <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> and <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> are required pre- and postsynaptically, respectively, at Mauthner circuit electrical synapses.</p><p>The above transplant experiments suggest that some GJ channels at Mauthner electrical synapses are heterotypic, with unique Cxs used on each side of the synapse. Moreover, our results suggest that a trans-synaptic interaction between the Cxs is required for stabilization, and thereby detection via antibody staining, at the Mauthner synapses. This would help explain why when we remove either <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> or <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> we observe reduced staining of the other Cx at the synapse. This model predicts that in a <italic>gjd2a/Cx35.5</italic> mutant the postsynaptic Cx34.1 should still be available to make electrical synapses if provided with an appropriate presynaptic Cx (and vice versa). To test this notion and ask if Cx35.5 or Cx34.1 are sufficient pre- and postsynaptically, respectively, we created chimeric animals as above except we transplanted from wildtype <italic>M/CoLo:GFP</italic> embryos into a non-transgenic mutant host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that when the postsynaptic neuron was wildtype in a <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> mutant host the electrical synapses were rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,D</xref>); however, when the presynaptic neuron was wildtype there was no rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Conversely, a wildtype presynaptic neuron was sufficient to rescue the synapse in a <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), but had no effect when the wildtype neuron was postsynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F,H</xref>). In other words, Cx35.5 is sufficient to rescue the synapse if it is present in the presynaptic neurons while Cx34.1 is sufficient to rescue the synapse if it is present in the postsynaptic neuron. We note that the fold-rescue of Cx36 staining by a wildtype postsynaptic neuron was greater at M/CoLo as compared to Aud/M synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,J</xref>); this ~4 fold rescue is consistent with the fold reduction seen in <italic>gjd1a</italic> mutants and postsynaptic loss of <italic>gjd1a</italic> at these same synapses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P,Q</xref>). Altogether we conclude that electrical synapse formation in the Mauthner circuit requires presynaptic Cx35.5 and postsynaptic Cx34.1 and that robust Cx localization at the synapse requires a trans-synaptic interaction with an appropriate Cx in an adjacent cell.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25364.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The exclusive asymmetric functions of <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> and <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> are sufficient for electrical synapse formation.</title><p>Dorsal views of chimeric larvae containing GFP-marked cells transplanted from a wildtype (wt) donor embryo into a mutant host of noted genotype; throughout the figure the neurons derived from the wt donor embryo are displayed in magenta, while those from the mutant host are in blue.

The Mauthner circuit generates a fast escape response away from threatening stimuli using a combination of both electrical and chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>); for an explanation of Mauthner circuit function see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and associated discussion above. At 6 dpf there are approximately six auditory afferent neurons making mixed electrical/glutamatergic chemical synapses onto Mauthner (Aud/M); the electrical component of the postsynaptic response occurs 1–3 ms after afferent stimulation and happens just prior to that of its glutamatergic counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, electrophysiology at the M/CoLo synapse suggests a single, excitatory electrical coupling allowing Mauthner to activate CoLo during an escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, electrical synapses are suggested to have unique effects on the initiation (Aud/M) and coordination (M/CoLo) of the Mauthner-induced escape response.</p><p>To test mutant behavior animals were placed into individual chambers in a multi-well testing stage illuminated by infrared light and were subjected to startling vibrational (acoustic) stimuli. Behavior was monitored with a high speed camera (1000 frames per second) to capture the kinematics, or body movements, of responses. Each animal and its behavioral response was analyzed using FLOTE software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgess and Granato, 2007</xref>), which automatically tracks movement parameters of the larvae. FLOTE can distinguish between Mauthner-induced short latency C-bend (SLC) escape responses and the longer latency escapes generated by related but distinct circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgess and Granato, 2008</xref>). We analyzed the kinematics of the 6 dpf larval escape response from crosses between heterozygous animals (incross of <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1<sup>+/−</sup> or gjd2a/cx35.5<sup>+/−</sup></italic>). Behavioral testing and analysis was performed blind followed by genotyping of each larva and comparisons of responses between wildtype siblings and mutants. We found that mutants produced SLCs at similar frequencies compared to their wildtype siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, note that we found no difference between wildtype siblings from the <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1<sup>+/−</sup> or gjd2a/cx35.5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> crosses and so have collapsed these two groups into a single wt data point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; individual statistics can be found in the source data and lead to the same conclusions). However, we found that both <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> and <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> mutants initiated escape responses ~2 ms (40%) slower than their wildtype siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In these ‘slow’ SLC responses the kinematics of the escape often had normal turn angles, maximum angular velocity, and other parameters known to be associated with Mauthner induced escapes, albeit happening later than in wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–H</xref>). However, a subset of mutant responses (~20% in each genotype) occurred with an abnormally shallow maximum angle of the C-bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, arrow) as well as abnormally slow maximum angular velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, arrow). These abnormal responses suggested a defect in performing the stereotyped C-bend shape of the escape response and so we reanalyzed the video data from these events and found that both <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> and <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> mutants produced abnormal postural responses to the auditory startle stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–L</xref>). We found that as these animals initiated movements they displayed only slight bends to one side, creating ‘kinked’ or ‘S-shaped’ postures, and also shortening their body axis. These animals would stay in this state for 4–10 ms then produce a secondary movement in the opposite direction of the initial movement, followed most often by swimming behavior. These secondary movements were likely the normal counter bend and swimming motions that occur after a Mauthner induced escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgess and Granato, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>), but in these cases they occurred after a failed escape.

One intriguing possibility is that differences in the pre- and postsynaptic Cxs would bias the passage of ionic flow through the GJ creating a rectified electrical connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palacios-Prado et al., 2014a</xref>). Indeed such is the case for two Innexins, Shaking-B(Neural +16) and Shaking-B(lethal), that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> form a molecularly asymmetric synapse; when these hemi-channels are paired in apposing <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes they allow for biased current flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>). In adult goldfish freeze-fracture immunolabeling and electron microscopy (EM) suggest that the Aud/M (club ending) synapses of Mauthner are molecularly asymmetric (see below for discussion of Cx usage) and electrophysiology found that ionic flow was preferentially directed from the post- to presynaptic terminal; the authors suggested that this functional asymmetry leads to cooperativity amongst the multiple converging auditory afferent axons thereby promoting the Mauthner escape response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the configuration we find here of presynaptic Cx35.5 paired with postsynaptic Cx34.1 is sufficient to produce biased current flow across the channel is unclear; however Cx asymmetry may not act alone in biasing synaptic function. Cx function can be modified by differences in the intracellular milieu such as Mg++ concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palacios-Prado et al., 2014b</xref>) and differential phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereda, 2014</xref>) or perhaps different pre- and postsynaptic protein interactions may bias function. The molecular asymmetry of Cxs we identify suggests that GJ-associated proteins may also be asymmetrically distributed. Intriguingly, we previously found that the autism associated gene <italic>neurobeachin</italic>, which encodes a scaffolding protein thought to act within the trans-Golgi network, was required postsynaptically for electrical synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2015</xref>).

Previous freeze fracture immuno-EM work in goldfish has instead suggested that Cx35.1 and Cx34.7 may create the Aud/M synapses, yet we find that the genes encoding these two Cxs are not required in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). What accounts for this discrepancy? First, it is likely that the goldfish and zebrafish Aud/M synapses are constructed with the same Cxs, but this need not be the case and could account for differences. Moreover, the goldfish synapses were examined at adulthood while our work was in larval stages; it is conceivable that these electrical synapses could change their composition during development and maturation. Second, as others have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2014</xref>), we found that antibodies generated against Cx34.7 and Cx35.1 and used in the goldfish studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>) label zebrafish Aud/M and M/CoLo electrical synapses at larval stages from 3 to 7 dpf (see Materials and methods for antibody details). This, when put in the context of our genetic evidence for the requirement for <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> postsynaptically and <italic>gjd2a/cx35.5</italic> presynaptically, suggests that these previously used antibodies cross react with Cx34.1 and Cx35.5. Given the amino acid similarity of the two <italic>gjd1</italic> proteins and the two <italic>gjd2</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the most parsimonious scenario would be that the Cx34.7 antibody cross reacts with Cx34.1, while the Cx35.1 antibody cross reacts with Cx35.5. If correct, this would make for a consistent picture between the genetic evidence we present here and the goldfish immuno-EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these data strongly support a model wherein the Aud/M synapses contain molecularly asymmetric gap junction channels. We also find that while Cx35.5 appears to be the sole presynaptic Cx at Aud/M synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), Cx34.1 may not act alone on the postsynaptic side of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The nature of the ‘unidentified’ postsynaptic Cx is currently unknown but there are two main possibilities: (1) <italic>gjd2a</italic>/Cx35.5 may be used postsynaptically at these synapses or (2) an unidentified Cx is used postsynaptically to stabilize the observed Cx35.5 presynaptically. Whether the residual staining we observe in <italic>gjd1a/cx34.1</italic> mutants at Aud/M gap junctions represents further Cx complexity (i.e. multiple postsynaptic Cxs) or instead is the result of compensatory changes only found in the mutant will require future experiments to resolve. Our genetic and chimaeric evidence also support Cx molecular asymmetry at M/CoLo synapses in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This configuration is likely common in zebrafish given the broad colocalization of Cx34.1 and Cx35.5 and their frequent co-requirement for localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Molecular asymmetries at electrical synapses are not confined to fish, but are found broadly throughout the nervous systems of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Starich et al., 2009</xref>), medicinal leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandarian et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curtin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>), crab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shruti et al., 2014</xref>), and there have been suggestions, though no definitive proof, that such may occur in mammals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zolnik and Connors, 2016</xref>). If such does occur in mammalian systems it would have to rely on a different set of Cxs than in zebrafish as mammals appear to have lost the <italic>gjd1/cx34</italic> family of genes, leaving only the single, related <italic>gjd2/cx36</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, there are four other Cxs known to make electrical synapses in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Söhl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereda, 2014</xref>), and the extent of their use and the configurations of GJs they create is poorly understood. We expect that molecularly asymmetric electrical synapses are likely to be a part of all nervous systems given that they underlie important functional effects on the properties of neural circuit computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How do the electrical synapses contribute to neural circuit computation and behavioral output? We found that the <italic>cx</italic> mutants are slower to respond to vibrational stimuli, but can still produce many fast escape responses consistent with Mauthner-induced activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We prefer the model that the reduction in response speed is due to the loss of the electrical component of the Aud/M synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) given that these synapses are required for Mauthner activation and sufficient to create the fast escape response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Malley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tabor et al., 2014</xref>). This idea is supported by electrophysiological recordings of Aud/M synapses in wildtype larval zebrafish at stages similar to those we analyzed where the electrical response occurs ~2 milliseconds faster than that of the chemical synaptic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). It is important to note that we cannot rule out the possibility that electrical synapses upstream of Mauthner are required for the observed defects, or that the loss of electrical synapses affects chemical synapse function within the Mauthner circuit. We also observed that a subset of escape responses in <italic>cx</italic> mutants display coordination defects. This is likely due to the loss of the M/CoLo synapses in the spinal cord as similar behavioral defects have been observed when CoLos are laser ablated or when strychnine is used to block inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsden and Granato, 2015</xref>). These uncoordinated responses likely only occur in a subset of escapes given that the CoLos are productively engaged in the behavioral output only in cases where both Mauthner neurons fire in response to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). In wildtype when both Mauthners fire turning is unidirectional; this is achieved by the first-activated Mauthner’s action potential exciting contralateral CoLos, which then recross the spinal cord where they inhibit the motor neurons before the ‘second-activated’ Mauthner’s action potential arrives – this ensures a unidirectional turn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> for circuit diagram)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>). When calcium activity of Mauthner is monitored in experimental paradigms similar to those we used it was found that both Mauthner neurons were activated at rates in line with the behavioral defects we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsden and Granato, 2015</xref>). Thus it is likely that the coordination defects we observe in mutants are due to the loss of the M/CoLo synapses. Our results on Mauthner-induced behavior with and without neuronal gap junctions reveal a critical interplay between electrical and chemical synapses in creating the performance needed for the escape response. While we have focused mainly on the Mauthner circuit here, given the breadth of Cx34.1/Cx35.5-based electrical synapses observed, we expect to identify broad contributions of the electrical synapses to many behaviors in zebrafish. Indeed, loss of <italic>gjd2/cx36</italic> in mice results in defects in an ever increasing list of neurological functions including vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güldenagel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowan et al., 2016</xref>), smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2005</xref>), thalamic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zolnik and Connors, 2016</xref>), estrous cyclicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>), short-term spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2011</xref>), motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frisch et al., 2005</xref>), as well as others. Future work in zebrafish and mouse will illuminate how electrical and chemical synapses collaborate in these complex, vertebrate nervous systems to produce appropriate behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish, lines, and maintenance</title><p>All animals were raised in an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved facility at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Study ID 50552, Submittal ID 7237, IRO # 1392).

After phenotypic identification mutant (-/-) and wildtype sibling (+/+ and +/-) RNA was pooled separately from 108 embryos each. From each pool total RNA was extracted and cDNA libraries were created using standard Illumina TruSeq protocols. Each library was individually barcoded allowing for identification after multiplexed sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine. In brief, mapping was performed by identifying high quality ‘mapping’ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the wildtype pool and assessing these positions in the mutant pool for their frequency. The average allele frequency in mutants, using a sliding-window of 50-neighboring loci, was plotted across the genome and linkage was identified as the region of highest average frequency.

All four are two-exon genes, however the gene encoding Cx35.5 is annotated on the zebrafish Zv10 genome as having the first exon downstream and in the opposite orientation of the second exon. This arrangement is most likely due to an inappropriately assembled region of the genome for three reasons: (1) we cloned a full-length transcript from a cDNA library using primers to the 5’- and 3’-UTRs, (2) the gene results in a protein product, (3) the gene results in a protein detectable by an antibody made against it (see results for points 2 and 3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Antibody generation and validation</title><p>Antibodies were generated at the Fred Hutchinson Antibody Technology Facility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sharedresources.fredhutch.org/core-facilities/antibody-technology">https://sharedresources.fredhutch.org/core-facilities/antibody-technology</ext-link>).

HeLa cells were used as previous work established them as a standard method for Cx protein expression and antibody validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rash et al., 2013</xref>). We found several antibodies against each Cx that specifically recognized only the intended target Cx and not the others and screened each of these using whole-mount immunohistochemistry of 5 dpf zebrafish larvae.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A genetic basis for molecular asymmetry at vertebrate electrical synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Yang Dan, (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that electrical synapses used at many points along a motor circuit of the zebrafish larvae are asymmetric, comprised of connexins of two specific subtypes, polarized in a particular direction, and that this heterotypic arrangement is critical for normal development, function, and behavior. Specifically, the authors identified a mutation, dis3, that caused complete loss of electrical synapses in the circuit of interest (M/CoLo) without apparent changes to the rest of the circuit morphology or development. With genetic analyses they described the familial relationships of four neuronal connexins, Cx34.1, Cx34.7, Cx35.1, and Cx35.5, each of them homologues of mammalian Cx36. They found that dis3 is caused by mutations of the Cx34.1 gene. Genetic deletion of Cx34.1 or Cx35.5 led to complete loss of Cx36-like gap junctions and neurobiotin (NB)-coupling in the M/CoLo circuit. The authors also generated new antibodies specific for Cx34.1 and Cx35.5. Using a chimera approach they further showed that successful development of electrical synapses in the M/CoLo system depends on PREsynaptic expression of Cx35.5 and POSTsynaptic expression of Cx34.1. Testing of an M/CoLo-mediated behavior showed that Cx35.5/34.1 electrical synapses are necessary for full function.</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the study is impressive for its comprehensive, careful approach. The writing is exceptionally clear, and each Results section includes a welcome dose of background and rationale. While the specific findings are likely to hold only for teleost fish, the more general principles about electrical synapse asymmetry may turn out to be relevant to mammals and other classes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Do mutants really have normal structure and function, apart from the loss of many electrical synapses and their functions? The authors state: &quot;dis3 mutants display no gross morphological defects in nervous system morphology and neuronal number, have no defects in general body plan development, have normal developmental timing, are homozygous viable, and crosses between homozygous mutant animals produce viable offspring. We conclude that the gene disrupted by the dis3 mutation has a broad but specific role in electrical synapse formation.&quot; However, quantitative data to support this contention are not provided. If the authors have them, they should be.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors say, &quot;…we have found that the antibodies used in the previous study label all zebrafish Mauthner circuit electrical synapses at larval stages (data not shown).&quot; This is an important point since, a) it addresses the discrepancy between their conclusions and those of Rash et al., 2013) and others, and b) it would be very interesting for other investigators in this field to know. Please at least provide the names and sources of the antibodies in question, and more specific description of the data &quot;not shown&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25364.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Do mutants really have normal structure and function, apart from the loss of many electrical synapses and their functions?

We have therefore chosen to focus on the Mauthner circuit for this section and have included quantifiable results that suggest that the cells of the circuit and their morphology is intact. We have left out other anecdotal references to gross morphology, developmental timing, etc., as we have no quantifiable data. These changes are found in the Results section.</p><p> <italic>2) In the Discussion, the authors say, &quot;…we have found that the antibodies used in the previous study label all zebrafish Mauthner circuit electrical synapses at larval stages (data not shown).&quot; This is an important point since, a) it addresses the discrepancy between their conclusions and those of Rash et al., 2013) and others, and b) it would be very interesting for other investigators in this field to know.

In this section we now specifically reference the appropriate papers that have previously used the antibodies in question and we state directly what we have observed with these antibodies. These changes can be found in the Discussion. We have included the details about each antibody in the Material and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
