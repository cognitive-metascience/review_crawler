sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteriophage PR772 is a ﻿double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus with a 70 nm diameter icosahedral protein capsid encapsulating the internal lipid bilayer along with numerous proteins and a 15 kbp long linear genome. It belongs to the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family and infects gram negative hosts like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, ﻿<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and other bacteria, carrying a R772 plasmid-encoded receptor complex through which DNA can be transported during bacterial conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coetzee et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coetzee and Bekker, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mäntynen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>). Much of the functional knowledge of the viral proteins is inferred from previous studies on PRD1, a close relative of PR772 with a genome sequence identity of 97.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lute et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). The most striking features of phages from those members of the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family that infect Gram-negative bacteria, is the presence of an inner lipid membrane and lack of a tail in the dormant viral particle. During the process of infection, these viruses produce a membranous tube derived from the inner membrane of the viral particle, lined from the inside by proteins P7, P11 and P32. This tube is used to inject the viral dsDNA into the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peralta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Genome analysis of PR772 identified 32 open reading frames (ORFs) containing at least 40 codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lute et al., 2004</xref>). Twenty-eight annotated proteins are known to be expressed from the genome, of which three do not make it into the final assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lute et al., 2004</xref>). In previous studies on PRD1, it was shown that the capsid is formed by proteins P3 (major capsid protein), P30 (capsid associated protein) and the vertex complex. The vertex complex includes the penton protein (P31), the host-recognition protein (P5) and the receptor-binding protein (P2) along with the infectivity protein (P16) that acts as a cementing protein, holding the vertex complex together and also stabilizing the pseudo-icosahedral capsid of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). Proteins P6, P9, P20 and P22 are involved in DNA packaging and proteins P7, P14, P11, P18, P32 and P34 are responsible for DNA delivery to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grahn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lute et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family of viruses are also known to have structural similarities to adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies on bacteriophage PRD1, many models have been proposed to explain the architecture of the penton base and the vertex complex. Most of these models were speculations based on the observations from gene mutation/knock-out and in-vitro studies of proteins P31, P5 and P2 from PRD1. The in-vitro protein expression studies showed that P31 forms pentamers and P5 form multimers of trimers (i.e, (P5<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1</sub>, (P5<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, (P5<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokolova et al., 2001</xref>). The gene knock-out studies showed that P31<sup>-</sup> mutants produced incomplete PRD1 particles that lacked P31, P5 and P2 functions. They failed to form the vertex complex. A P5<sup>-</sup> mutant produced intact viral particle but lacked both P5 and P2 functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rydman et al., 1999</xref>). These observations led to the hypothesis that the vertex complex appears to be a single spike formed by a pentameric P31 base binds the trimeric P5 spike protein to which P2 is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huiskonen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caldentey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rydman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokolova et al., 2001</xref>). Later, a combination of SAXS modeling of the P5 protein and a low resolution cryoem study of the vertex region, showed that P2 and P5 form two spikes, not one, as previously described. Based on the low-resolution SAXS model of P5, it was speculated that the N-terminal base of P5 could have a size similar to P31 due to sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huiskonen et al., 2007</xref>). With the available experimental data, the generally accepted composition of the vertex complex of <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> is that P31 is a homopentamer and forms the penton base. P5 and P2 are attached to the P31 penton base but their arrangement is not known. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huiskonen et al., 2007</xref>). The high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of the P2 protein is known but the location and orientation with respect to the penton base in its functional form is currently not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Putatively, it is suggested that the beta-propeller motif of P2 might be involved in binding to the host receptor.</p><p>Here we present the high-resolution structure of bacteriophage PR772 using electron cryo-microscopy (CryoEM). The high-resolution map helped us to resolve subtle variations in the protein conformations and their influence on the formation of a viable viral particle. The N-terminal region of the P3 subunits have three conformations, not two as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrescia et al., 2004</xref>). The new N-terminal P3 conformation plays an important role in accommodating the P30 protein during particle assembly. The C-terminal region of P3 not only shows the formation of a β-sheet with P30 but also helps in locking the adjacent trisymmetrons through a hinge mechanism, thus facilitating the formation of icosahedral particles and regulating their size. Localized asymmetric reconstruction of the vertex region of PR772 revealed a P5-P31 heteropentameric base and the binding of P2 to P5 in the complex. A combination of high-resolution icosahedral symmetrized single-particle reconstruction, localized asymmetric reconstruction and focused classification has enabled us to answer some of the intriguing questions about the particle architecture, composition of the penton base and arrangement of the vertex complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High resolution capsid map at 2.3 Å</title><p>The structure of bacteriophage PR772 was determined by electron cryo-microscopy.

Due to the high sequence similarity between P31 and the N-terminal domain of P5, we could not rule out that any of these two proteins or if a mixture of these two proteins could potentially form the penton base. Therefore, two initial models were generated. One model used the P31 protein sequence and the other used the P5 protein sequence as part of the input. In the initial observation of all the predicted segments of the two models, the P31 protein segment with residues 112–126 and the P5 protein segment with residues 107–121 occupied the same region of the sectioned map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). On closer inspection of the side chains from the two models and their fit into the CryoEM map densities in this region, the P5 protein side chains fit clearly at 3.2 RMSD and the P31 side chains could only be fitted at RMSD values lower than 2.6.

This suggested that the N-terminal region of either the P31 or P5 could have an alternate conformation. On inspecting the residues from both the P31 model and the N-terminal domain model of P5, that were close to the branch region, P31 was ruled out as a potential candidate. P31 has Val11-Thr10-Met9 residues, which could not be fitted into the branched density without severely distorting the Cα backbone. P5 in the same region has Ser9-Gly8-Gly7.

This could be due to a symmetry mismatch of the proteins present in the region. Accordingly, the smeared region over the five-fold vertex was isolated and resolved by capsid signal subtraction followed by localized asymmetric (C1) reconstruction (see Materials and methods). All the classes generated by 3D classification showed a single protruding density except one of the classes, which revealed two significant densities; one poorly resolved knob-like density and another more well resolved density closely interacting with one of the monomers of the penton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). On closer inspection of every 3D class generated during the process of localized asymmetric reconstruction, we noticed that three of the subunits of the penton base had a stem-like protrusion close to the 5-fold axis, extending outwards and interacting with each other forming a thick stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>).

All the classes from the 3D classification by localized reconstruction showed that only three subunits formed the stem-like protrusion that interacted with one another to form a thicker stalk. P31 terminates close to the fivefold and thus cannot form the stem-like protrusion whereas P5 residues (121-124) continue up and outward and these residues have the potential to form the stem-like protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The overall map:model correlation reduced when the models of P31 and P5 N-terminal domain were swapped with each other in the localized reconstruction and the focused classification density maps.

The fit was good and the density that was resolved by localized reconstruction was sufficient to fit the domains I and II, forming the head and the domain III, forming the tail of P2.

The structure of P16 was only partially resolved. The long C-terminal trans-membrane helix of P16 (Leu7 - Ala28) was poorly resolved and barely visible at 0.6 RMSD. The high-resolution structure of the disorganized region (Tyr58 - Ile96) of P16 also evades us. It was poorly resolved with no visible side chains and part of the density map representing the Cα backbone was missing even at very low RMSD. Due to poor signal to noise ratios, these regions were not modeled, but the difference density map of the vertex region and the modeled penton showed that the C-alpha backbone continued into the empty pocket beneath the penton and also interacts with the penton close to the 5-fold axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the partial model shows that P16 forms a clamp-like complex using the loop Asn44 -Val55 and helix Asn101 - Ala115, which attaches onto the loop Val242 - Tyr247 of one of the P3 subunits of trimer one and locks it with the adjacent P3 subunit of trimer one from the neighboring trisymmetrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This further locks the P3-P30-P3 sandwich and makes it stable. As was mentioned earlier, to accommodate the P30 protein in the P3-P30-P16 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>), the loop formed by residues Tyr351-Val358 of the P3 subunit in trimer one is flipped compared to the orientation seen in this loop of the P3 subunit with a N-terminal long helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>).</p><p>At 2.0 RMSD, we noticed that the density for the C-terminal Gly84 of P30 was pointing towards the penton base and away from the inner lipid membrane.

In case of P5, the C-terminal Gly84 of P30 seems to interact with the Met19 residue of a P5 subunit by a hydrophobic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). With P31, the hydrophobic interaction is not evident.</p><p>Three copies of P5 and two copies of P31 are held together by their N-terminal residues.

As was mentioned earlier, residues Gly8 - Met1 of P5 can in special cases have an alternate conformation where they are wedged in between the adjacent P3 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). There is no obvious direct interaction between the penton and the P3 subunits of the capsid except for the special cases mentioned above. The disorganised region of P16 seems to interact with the penton base and helps in binding the vertex complex to the trisymmetrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Each trisymmetron of PR772 is composed of 12 trimers of the P3 protein that are in turn bound by P30, an overall arrangement similar to that of the close relative PRD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrescia et al., 2004</xref>). The high-resolution structure of PR772 confirms the previously shown variability of the N and C-terminals of the P3 protein depending on the locations within the trisymmetron. The high-resolution also allows us to extend the analysis of these conformations and show that the N-terminal of P3 can adopt three different conformations, not two as previously described. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrescia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). The newly discovered conformation of the N-terminal region of P3, a long helix with a kink, is structurally critical to accommodate the interlocking region formed by the N-terminal hooks of P30 during the initiation of particle assembly. The N-terminal region of P3 shows plasticity and play an important role in both stabilizing the trimer and anchoring the trimer complex to the membrane. The C-terminal region of P3 also shows differences in its conformation as compared to PRD1. In trimer 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C and H</xref>) subunit a and subunit c have elongated C-terminal regions that interact with the adjacent P3 subunits of the neighboring trisymmetrons and in-turn locking on to P30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> right hand side insert; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A similar arrangement can be seen in the C-terminal region from subunit c of trimer two and subunit a of trimer 4 of the neighboring trisymmetrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> left hand side insert). The presence of P16 close to the penton region makes the interaction of all the neighboring trimer one more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and also anchors the whole vertex complex to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), emphasizing the role of P30 and P16 in maintaining the size and structure of the icosahedral viral capsid.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48496.029</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the vertex region.</title><p>Shows the structural arrangement of P5 (P5 N-terminal base shown in bright pink, Collagen-like motif of P5 shown in bright green and P5 Knob is shown in pale blue), P31 (yellow) and P2 (orange) that form the vertex.

P31 has high sequence similarity with the N-terminal domain of P5. Previously, it was shown that P31 can replace P5 to form the penton and produce an intact viral particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamford and Bamford, 2000</xref>). Even though the viral particles were intact, they were non-infectious due to the lack of the viral receptor-binding protein, P2, that is bound to the host recognition protein, P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamford and Bamford, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grahn et al., 1999</xref>). ﻿In another study with the PRD1 sus525 mutant that lacks P31, it was also shown that these particles lacked the vertex complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rydman et al., 1999</xref>). With the current model, P31 would promote the formation of an intact viral particle by avoiding the steric-hinderances that could occur during the formation of the vertex complex, if the P31 subunits were replaced by P5. A penton with 3 copies of the P5 subunits will support (i) the formation of a stable collagen-like motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and (ii) the formation of the C-terminal host recognition domain of P5. A heteropentameric base of the vertex complex with three copies of P5 and two copies of P31 address both these issues.</p><p>The members of the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family have been shown to have structural similarities with adenoviruses despite infecting different hosts. In adenoviruses, the symmetry mismatch seen in the vertex region is solved by the interaction of the tail region of the trimeric fibre with three of the five grooves formed by the subunits of the penton base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike in adenoviruses, a similar problem in PR772 is solved by domain swapping. The trimeric P5 protein responsible for the formation of the spike, swaps the N-terminal base domain with three copies of the P31 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>The localized asymmetric reconstruction shows that P2 is bound to P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the current CryoEM data, the orientation of P2 with respect to the penton base is reversed when compared to what was described for PRD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huiskonen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Here, the beta-propeller motif of P2 with domain I and II, interacts with the N-terminal base of P5 and also with the stalk. This was also speculated on in a previous study, where it was noted that members of the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family with large sequence variation in the beta-propeller motif of P2 also showed variations in the P5 subunit as a compensatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). P2 interacts with both the N-terminal base and the stalk region of P5 but does not interact directly with any other structural protein in PR772. The interaction of P2 with the P5 stalk stabilizes the C-terminal region of P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of PRD1, P2 seems to occupy all vertices except for the unique packaging vertex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caldentey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). In this scenario, the special conformation in which the N-terminal residues of P5 are wedged in between the neighboring P3 subunits was found to be prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrescia et al., 2004</xref>). In the current model of PR772, P2 seems to occupy only 2 vertices of the icosahedral shell. The lower quantities of P2 in PR772 were also indicated in a previous study, comparing the abundance of different viral proteins from various members of the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family using western blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). In PRD1, it was shown that the loss of P2 from a packed viral particle, resulted in spontaneous release of genomic DNA, leading to loss of infectivity and the formation of empty particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grahn et al., 1999</xref>). In a previous study of PR772, it was shown that after purification, the concentration estimates of the particle by plaque assay and nano-particle tracking analysis were similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>). PR772 particles remained intact and infectious after purification. The intact PR772 particles can also be observed in the CryoEM micrographs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). So, it is unlike that P2 was lost during the purification.</p><p>In the icosahedrally averaged model of PR772, we see that the special conformation of P5 where the N-terminal residues are wedged between the P3 subunits of the adjacent trimer one is not prominent, but these P5 densities are visible at lower RMSD values. The presence of P2 in the vertex complex may coincide with the N-terminal region of P5 adopting the special conformation. It was reported that, compared to the CryoEM map of a wild type PRD1 virion, the CryoEM map of <italic>sus690</italic>, a mutant PRD1 virion that lacks P2 and P5, showed absence of density in the region where we see the N-terminal of P5 wedged between two neighboring P3 subunits. The lack of this density was attributed to the conformational changes in P31 due to the binding of P5 or the presence of P5 in between P31 and the P3 trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huiskonen et al., 2007</xref>). In light of the current findings in PR772, P5 is known to be part of the heteropentameric base forming the penton and the absence of the above-mentioned density confirms that P5 adopts the special N-terminal conformation and not P31.</p><p>The above mentioned observations and the quantitative analysis of different proteins from PRD1 and PR772 using western blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>) could explain the discrepancy in P2 packing in PR772. As mentioned earlier, the presence of P2 in the vertex complex may coincide with the N-terminal region of P5 adopting the special conformation. This special conformation of N-terminal region of P5 could be linked to the low copy number of the membrane protein P14 (or higher copy number of P7) observed in PR772 when compared to PRD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). In PRD1, gene VII codes for P7 and the 3’ region of the same gene also codes for P14. P14 is smaller and it consists only of the membrane anchor domain and lacks the trans-glycosylase domain that is seen in P7. These proteins, P7 and P14, are proposed to forms a hetero-multimeric complex located under the vertices of the PRD1 particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rydman and Bamford, 2000</xref>). In an intact PRD1 particle, the copy numbers of P7 and P14 are similar but in case of PR772, the copy number of P14 is significantly lower and the copy number of P7 seems higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saren et al., 2005</xref>). In PR772, the copy number of P14, the occurrence of the special conformation of the N-terminal region of P5 protein and the number of P2 proteins packed in an intact viral particle seems to be related. In PR772, the presence of the larger P7 protein in higher numbers at the vertex (along with other proteins in the disordered region) might hinder the formation of the special conformation of the N-terminal region of P5, which could reduce the number of P2 proteins packed in the particle.</p><p>The penton has no obvious direct interaction with the neighboring P3 subunits of the capsid, except in the rarely occurring special conformation of P5 where the N-terminus is wedged in between the P3 subunits of trimer one as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). The difference density map of the vertex region and the modeled penton shows that the disordered region of P16 interacts with the penton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These interactions of P16 with P3, P5, P31 along with the membrane seem to play a central role in the formation of the vertex complex and anchoring it to the membrane. In earlier Raman spectroscopy studies on PRD1, it was shown that in the initial stages of viral assembly, P3 and P5 formed a precursor shell assisted by assembly factors and other membrane-associated proteins such as P16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bamford et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamford et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, in PR772 the P5 trimers could be accommodated during the formation of the procapsid and two copies of P31 are later added to the penton region, forming a heteropentameric penton.</p><p>From the localized asymmetric reconstruction of the vertex complex, one can notice that there is a variation in the map density below the penton. The map density below the P5 subunits is significantly different when compared to the same region below the P31 subunits. This suggests that, along with the interactions of P16 with P5 and P31, there could also be poorly resolved proteins like P11, P7, P14 or P18, etc; in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rydman and Bamford, 2000</xref>). The variation in the map density in this region is also compounded by other interactions, like that of the C-terminal Gly84 of P30 with the Met19 of P5 subunits and lack thereof with respect to the P31 subunits.</p><p>Preliminary results for the whole particle asymmetric reconstruction using symmetry relaxation in EMAN2 of the wild type PR772 do not show the presence of a unique packaging portal in the dormant particle in contrast to PRD1. All the vertices of PR772 show the heteropentameric arrangement of the penton with three subunits showing the stalk and the other two without the stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows our model of the vertex complex in PR772. Using this model, we propose a mechanism for the initiation of infection. In analogy to studies on PRD1, it is known that P5 is needed for host recognition, but the binding of P5 to the host is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grahn et al., 1999</xref>). The host binding is stabilized by the high-affinity interaction of P2 and its receptor, locking the viral particle to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grahn et al., 1999</xref>). The relative changes between P5 and P2 upon binding to the receptor on the host could trigger the disruption of the vertex complex by pulling the N-terminal region of the P5 trimers that are wedged between the P3 subunits. This will in turn disrupt the interaction between the P5 proteins and P30 as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This disruption cascades further and disturbs the interaction between P30 and P16, rendering the whole vertex complex unstable. P30 dimers could also transduce these effects to the neighboring vertices. The disruption of the vertex complex exposes the viral membrane and membranous proteins like P18, P11/P7, P32 etc; to the host surface to facilitate the formation of the membranous tube for DNA transport. P16, that holds the vertex complex, along with other membranous proteins, could act as a protein tether that would help in moving the lipid membrane closer to the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation and purification of PR772</title><p>Bacteriophage PR772 (ATCC BAA-769-B1) was propagated on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 J53-1. It was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>) and further concentrated to facilitate testing various concentrations of the viral sample during grid optimization for CryoEM. This method yielded about 2–4 mL of viral particles with a concentration of 1 mg/mL using 10–20 agar plates. The sample was further concentrated to 20 mg/mL by using an ultracentrifuge. The sample was added into an ultracentrifuge tube and then a solution of Caesium Chloride in buffer (HEPES 20 mM, NaCl 100 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub>1 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 8.0) at a density of 1.34 g/mL (g/cm<sup>−3</sup>) was gently layered on top. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 mins. The intact viral particles migrated to the top as a fine band and the broken particles along with any free DNA that was released from the broken particles stayed at the bottom of the tube. The top band with the intact viral particles was extracted using a needle and syringe. The concentrated sample was dialyzed over-night with the above-mentioned buffer to remove caesium chloride.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>CryoEM grid preparation and data collection</title><p>The condition for CryoEM grid preparation was optimized for collecting a large number of particle images. For vitrification of the viral sample by plunge freezing into liquid ethane, we used a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher). The best grid condition with uniform sample distribution was obtained by applying 3 μL of 7 mg/mL concentrated viral sample solution on a glow-discharged C-Flat grid CF-2/2–2C under 100% humidity at room temperature.</p><p>The data were collected on a Titan KRIOS (ThermoFisher) equipped with a K2 Summit (Gatan) direct electron detector and a GIF Quantum LS (Gatan) energy filter. All the data were collected at a magnification of 130 k in EFTEM mode with a pixel size of 1.06 Å. The slit width of the energy filter was 20 eV. The dose rate was 4.4 e<sup>-</sup> per Å<sup>2</sup> per second with a total exposure of 9 s resulting in a total dose of ~40 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.

The non-dose weighted image stacks were used to estimate defocus and correct CTF using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). All estimated fits of defocus and CTF were visually inspected. All images with significant astigmatism or a prominent ring due to crystalline ice around 3–4 Å were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Whole particle reconstruction</title><p>A total of ~3200 images were used to auto pick 56275 particles using template matching in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scheres, 2012</xref>) (version 2.1 beta 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>). The 2D classes generated by 2D classification of 710 manually picked particles were used as templates for auto-picking. The auto-picked particles were binned 2 × during the extraction (box size of 429 × 429 and 2.12 Å/pix). Extensive reference free 2D classification was performed to remove any particle images with ethane contaminants or broken/empty viral particles. The classes with good 2D averages were selected and the particles from these classes were extracted. This resulted in 51893 particles that were used for 3D classification. RELION: 3D initial model tool, which is based on stochastic gradient descent, was used to generate an ab-initio reference map for 3D classification. The 2 × binned particle images were used to generate a low-resolution icosahedrally averaged map. This low-resolution map was used as a reference for 3D classification. The 3D classification was performed with icosahedral symmetry (I4) applied. The most dominant class, with 46348 particles, was selected and the particles were extracted for final refinement. Icosahedral symmetry (I4) was also applied during the final refinement. The refinement with the 2 × binned particles reached Nyquist sampling (~4.24 Å here). The particles from the final iteration step of the refinement were re-extracted without binning and further refined. The reference map was also scaled to match the new box and pixel size (858 × 858 and 1.06 Å/pix respectively) using e2proc3d.py from EMAN2.1 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>After refinement, the maps were corrected for Ewald sphere effects using RELION 3.0 beta 2. These maps were post-processed. A soft binary mask was generated using the 15 Å low pass filtered map extended by 10 pixels and with a soft edge of 15 pixels. An initial binarization threshold of 0.001 was used to include all the map features (i.e, internal membrane, etc) in the mask. This was used as a solvent mask during post processing. The map was corrected for the detector’s Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and sharpened with an inverse B-factor. Overall gold standard FSC@0.143 was estimated using two independently processed half maps. ResMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref>) was used to estimate the variation of resolution across the two unfiltered half maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Localized asymmetric reconstruction of the five-fold vertex</title><p>The vertex complex was reconstructed using 2x binned particles by localized reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilca et al., 2015</xref>). Particle images from one half map were symmetry expanded (icosahedral to C1) and signal subtracted to remove the signal of the viral capsid and the genome from the particle images. Sub-particles representing each of the vertex region, with a box size of 100 × 100 pixels were extracted from the signal subtracted particles. This produced about 3,340,224 sub-particles. These particles were 3D classified without imposing symmetry and disabling image re-alignment. An initial reference map was produced by back projecting the extracted sub-particles using the previously calculated Euler angles. This initial reference map was low pass filtered to 45 Å and used as a reference map during 3D classification. The resolution of the expectation step was limited to 10 Å and a spherical mask of diameter 200 Å was added using the mask diameter and flatten solvent options provided by RELION to reduce the effects of systematic noise due to signal subtraction.</p><p>The classes generated from the 3D classification were analyzed and the particles from the class showing two protruding densities were selected and the 3D classification was now further refined with parameters similar to what was mentioned above but with the local image re-alignment enabled. The part of the map density that we were interested in was partially clipped due to the spherical mask that was used. So, the sub-particles were re-extracted with a larger box size of 140 × 140 pixels. These newly extracted particles with a larger box were back projected using the Euler angles calculated during the previous 3D classification.</p><p>To improve the resolution of the penton base region, another set of 3D classification was performed without limiting the e-step to 10 Å using the same set of sub-particles but applying a soft-mask around the penton.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Focused classification of the Penton base</title><p>To validate the penton map generated from the localized reconstruction, we also applied a different method, focused classification using the 2x binned particles. The particle representing the final converged map were symmetry expanded using <italic>relion_particle_symmetry_expand</italic> command. Similar to the localized reconstruction, signal subtraction was performed to remove the signal of the viral capsid and the genome from the particle images using <italic>relion_project</italic> command. We used the final converged map (without post-processing) from the icosahedrally averaged reconstruction to generate projections for signal subtraction. 3D classification with the signal subtracted particles was performed without imposing symmetry and disabling image re-alignment. The penton region extracted from the icosahedrally averaged map was low pass filtered to 45 Å and used as a reference map. A soft mask, around the penton region, was generated by extending the binary map of the penton region extracted from the icosahedrally averaged map by three pixels with a soft edge of 4 pixels. This was used as a focus mask to constrain the 3D classification to this region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>Modeling the whole particle was difficult owing to the large size of the particle and the limited RAM available.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sjors HW Scheres as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carmen San Martin (Reviewer #2); Brenda Hogue (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present the cryoEM structure of PR772 – a large, tailless, membrane containing bacteriophage. PR772 belongs to the same family as PRD1 (<italic>Tectiviridae</italic>), whose structure was solved at ~4 Å resolution by crystallography in 2004. Here the resolution is much higher (2.75 Å on average), allowing a more detailed analysis of the interactions in the capsid. The main findings are the heteropentameric organization of the penton capsomer, formed by the small single jelly roll protein P31 and its homolog P5 N-terminal domain (P5N), which is prolonged into a trimeric spike; a low resolution map of the penton organization together with its double spike, formed by the P5C trimer and the monomeric P2 protein; and a detailed description of the alternate conformations of N- and C-termini in the different copies of the major coat protein P3, as well as in the two penton proteins P31 and P5N</p><p>The resolution is impressive, particularly for such a large specimen, and addresses important issues in complex virus assembly, such as the use of flexible regions to achieve a range of quasi-equivalent interactions in the capsid, and the long standing puzzle on the composition and organization of the heterooligomeric vertex capsomer and its double spike. Therefore, the subject is interesting and the quality of the work is high. However, the manuscript is poorly written, and the most interesting results of a P31/P5 hetero-pentamer and a monomeric copy of P2 binding to P5 are based on extremely poor reconstructions, which are possibly caused by incorrect processing. Therefore, this manuscript would need considerable modification before being suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The asymmetric reconstructions of the hetero-pentamer (Figure 4F) and the monomeric P2 are very low-resolution compared to the icosahedral reconstruction. This is probably the result of incorrect image processing. The icosahedrally-averaged pentamer has resolutions extending well beyond 3 Å. Just by lowering the number of asymmetric units by 5-fold, the drop in resolution of the asymmetric reconstructions is too large. By keeping the orientations the same as in the original icosahedrally refined structure (i.e. by doing focussed classifications on the symmetry-expanded particles without re-alignments), resolutions around 3 Å should still be achievable in the asymmetric reconstructions. A good control is to perform a reconstruction of the symmetry expanded (partial signal subtracted) images without any classification/realignment, which should give a map that is almost identical to the icosahedrally averaged reconstruction. The authors should fix this mistake in a revised version, as it would yield a much higher-resolution, and thus more interesting, view on the asymmetry in the hetero-pentamer. In addition, the authors should present detailed views of the improved density, including side-chains, for regions where the sequence between P5 and P31 differ, which would then replace the ambiguous tracing of both proteins in the icosahedrally averaged map at two different thresholds in the current manuscript.</p><p>To some extent, the same argument also holds for the P2 monomer reconstruction: doing purely focussed classifications (without re-alignments) of symmetry-expanded images should also improve this part of the map. The only caveat (and cause for lower resolution) in this case would be different orientations of the P2 monomer relative to the capsid. However, even this may be captured better by focussed classifications without alignment than by the currently used focussed refinements.</p><p>2) The paper would benefit greatly from extensive editing of the text, while carefully checking for grammar and spelling. In addition, the manuscript organization needs to be improved:</p><p>2.1) Previous knowledge hinting at the possible penton heteropentamer/double spike composition and organization is cited, but a clear account of the subject should appear in the Introduction. For instance: &quot;many models have been proposed&quot;… why? The authors should explain that the basis for these previous models is the sequence similarity between proteins P31 and P5 (see for example, Merckel et al., 2005; Huiskonen et al., 2007; Abrescia et al., 2004).</p><p>2.2) Also lacking is the information on how similar PRD1 and PR772 are at the genome level (Introduction, second paragraph, repeated in the third paragraph: &quot;a close relative&quot;, how close? Should we expect large differences?).</p><p>2.3) The two alternative conformations of the P5 N-terminal tail are described twice: first in the third paragraph of the subsection “Penton base is a heteropentamer of P5 and P31”, then in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Overall Architecture of PR772”.</p><p>2.4) The description of the different conformations of the P3 termini in the subsection “Major Capsid Protein and its conformations” is difficult to follow. For example, &quot;the helix… is not embedded deeply into the adjacent subunit of the trimer…&quot;: what is meant here? And &quot;the loop formed by Tyr351-Val358 is flipped…&quot;: flipped how? Perhaps a superposition of the twelve P3 monomers in the asymmetric units, zooming on the N- and C-termini, would help to better illustrate the mobility of these regions. In general, adding labels to the figures would help the reader to follow the structure description. For example, for some of the residues cited in the text; or for at least one occurrence of each of the P3 N- and C-terminal conformations in Figure 2.</p><p>2.5) Including the length of proteins and of their traced part in the Results section would also help the reader (without having to resort to the PDB validation report).</p><p>2.6) The start of the Discussion section reads like a repetition of (parts of) the Results section.</p><p>2.7) Some sentences seem to be repeated, or at least very similar, e.g. in the paragraph just before Figure 3 and just after Figure 3. Other pieces of text read more like an early draft than like a polished manuscript, e.g. the second paragraph of the subsection “Overall Architecture of PR772”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48496.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The asymmetric reconstructions of the hetero-pentamer (Figure 4F) and the monomeric P2 are very low-resolution compared to the icosahedral reconstruction.

The 2x binned particles have an apix of 2.12 Å, resulting in a Nyquist frequency of 0.2358 (i.e., a resolution of 4.24 Å). So, the reconstructions with these 2x binned particles is limited to a resolution of 4.24 Å. We had also limited the e-step to 10 Å during the classification as recommended by the authors of the localized reconstruction method. We avoided using a mask to remove any bias that could be introduced due to the applied masked. Due to the limitations of storage, we were also limited to using sub-particles from one half map.</p><p>We have currently improved the resolution of the penton to 4.41 Å using a soft mask around the penton region and not limiting the e-step during the localized asymmetric reconstruction.</p><p>Using the focused classification method as suggested, we were able to reproduce the penton map to a resolution of 4.25 Å, a resolution similar to what was obtained by the localized reconstruction method with 2x binned particles. From the localized reconstruction, we knew that all the classes showed the heteropentameric penton. This suggested that the heteropentameric penton was a common feature. So, we chose a random vertex to perform a C1 focused classification on, without re-alignment. The focused classification of the penton region as well as the localized reconstruction method, show a stalk-like protrusion from 3 of the 5 subunits that form the penton. We have added a new Figure 4—figure supplement 6, showing the maps of the penton region from both methods.</p><p>The unmasked localized reconstruction using the sub-particles of the vertex region was performed to determine the orientation of P2 with respect to the viral capsid and avoid any bias by masking. From the localized reconstruction, we now know that the P2 protein is on average present only on 2 vertices of the viral particle. We can also notice that all the vertices display the presence of P5 that would also contribute to map densities (i.e., the highly flexible C-terminal regions with the collagen-like triple helix and the knob domain that are not resolved in the icosahedrally averaged map used to generate the projection for signal subtraction) during the focused classification. These issues along with the caveat mentioned by the reviewers will significantly reduce the resolution. By applying a focus mask around the P2 protein to address some of the issues, we would essentially bias the very orientation that we plan to determine. Hence, we have avoided using whole particles for focused classification of P2. Instead, we provide the P2 map from the masked classification without re-alignment of sub-particles whose orientation was previously determined without using a mask from localized reconstruction. This ensures that the features observed are not due to masking. We have provided two images, one with the map generated by re-aligned sub-particles (previously submitted) and another with a masked map without realignment (submitted here as part of the supporting files). We believe that the Figure 5, currently in the manuscript, illustrates the structure of the vertex complex, best.</p><p>We do agree that having a resolution beyond 3 Å for an asymmetric reconstruction would be better to access the heteropentameric nature of the penton. The resolution of the maps from the localized reconstruction and focused classification should be sufficient to assess the secondary structure and domain fit for the proteins P31, P5 N-terminal domain and P2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The paper would benefit greatly from extensive editing of the text, while carefully checking for grammar and spelling.

The in vitro protein expression studies showed that P31 forms pentamers and the P5 forms multimers of trimers (i.e., (P5<sub>3)1</sub>, (P5<sub>3)2</sub>, (P5<sub>3)3</sub>) (Sokolova et al., 2001). The gene knock-out studies showed that P31<sup>-</sup> mutants produced incomplete PRD1 particles that lacked P31, P5 and P2 functions. They failed to form the vertex complexes. A P5<sup>-</sup> mutant produced intact viral particles but lacked both the P5 and P2 functions (Rydman et al., 1999). These observations led to the hypothesis that the vertex complex appears to be a single spike formed by a pentameric P31 base binds the trimeric P5 spike protein to which P2 is bound (Huiskonen et al., 2007; Caldentey et al., 1999; Sokolova et al., 2001). Later, a combination of SAXS modelling of the P5 protein and a low resolution cryoem study of the vertex region, showed that P2 and P5 form two spikes, not one, as previously described. Based on the low-resolution SAXS model of P5, it was speculated that the N-terminal base of P5 could have a similar size and fold to P31 due to sequence similarity (Huiskonen et al., 2007).</p><p>We have added the above explanation to the manuscript to clarify why many models were proposed to explain the architecture of the vertex complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) Also lacking is the information on how similar PRD1 and PR772 are at the genome level (Introduction, second paragraph, repeated in the third paragraph: &quot;a close relative&quot;, how close?

We have also included the reference (Saren et al., 2005), which describes the genome level similarity between different phages in the <italic>Tectiviridae</italic> family.</p><p>“Much of the functional knowledge of the viral proteins is inferred from previous studies on PRD1, a close relative of PR772 with a genome sequence identity of 97.2% (Lute et al., 2004; Saren et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) The two alternative conformations of the P5 N-terminal tail are described twice: first in the third paragraph of the subsection “Penton base is a heteropentamer of P5 and P31”, then in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Overall Architecture of PR772”.</p></disp-quote><p>In the subsection “Penton base is a heteropentamer of P5 and P31”, we are establishing that it is the P5 N-terminal that is responsible for the special conformation. in the subsection “Overall Architecture of PR772”, we are comparing the N-terminal regions of P5 with P31 and their influence on the overall architecture. We only mention the special conformation of the N-terminal P5 region in one sentence to remind the reader that it exists. This is relevant for the hypothesis we put forward in the discussion regarding the potential infection process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4) The description of the different conformations of the P3 termini in the subsection “Major Capsid Protein and its conformations” is difficult to follow. For example, &quot;the helix… is not embedded deeply into the adjacent subunit of the trimer…&quot;: what is meant here? And &quot;the loop formed by Tyr351-Val358 is flipped…&quot;: flipped how? Perhaps a superposition of the twelve P3 monomers in the asymmetric units, zooming on the N- and C-termini, would help to better illustrate the mobility of these regions. In general, adding labels to the figures would help the reader to follow the structure description. For example, for some of the residues cited in the text; or for at least one occurrence of each of the P3 N- and C-terminal conformations in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that only text makes it a bit hard to follow the reasoning. As suggested, we have added new figures and have tried to refer to figures everywhere possible to make it easier to understand what is being described in the text. We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 3, that shows the superposition of all the P3 monomers of the asymmetric unit. This figure also includes an image showing the flipped Tyr351-Val358 loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.5) Including the length of proteins and of their traced part in the Results section would also help the reader (without having to resort to the PDB validation report)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the details about the proteins, chain length, length of the chain traced and region, where we compare the current model of PR772 with model of PRD1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.6) The start of the Discussion section reads like a repetition of (parts of) the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the start of the Discussion to only include differences compared to the PRD1 structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.7) Some sentences seem to be repeated, or at least very similar, e.g. in the paragraph just before Figure 3 and just after Figure 3. Other pieces of text read more like an early draft than like a polished manuscript, e.g. the second paragraph of the subsection “Overall Architecture of PR772”.</p></disp-quote><p>In these two instances (in the paragraphs before and after Figure 3), we are describing different things.</p><p>In the paragraph before Figure 3, we describe that the N-terminal of P3 can adopt three different conformations not two as previously described for PRD1. The new conformation as compared to PRD1 can only be observed due to the higher resolution model/reconstruction and has relevance for the detailed molecular interplay between proteins building up the capsid.</p><p>In the paragraph after Figure 3 and onwards, we describe how the N and C-terminals of the “same” P3 subunit that form four different trimers have to adopt different conformations depending on where the trimer resides in the trisymmetron and what contacts with other proteins they make at that specific location.</p><p>We have polished the text. It now reads:</p><p>“Five copies of P16 bridge the penton to the five trisymmetrons that meet at the vertex complex. […] As was mentioned earlier, to accommodate the P30 protein in the P3-P30-P16 complex (Figure 6 and Figure 6—video 1), the loop formed by residues Tyr351-Val358 of the P3 subunit in trimer 1 is flipped compared to the orientation seen in this loop of the P3 subunit with a N-terminal long helix (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D-F).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
