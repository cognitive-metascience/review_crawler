Along its longitudinal axis, two types of mechano-sensory cells, referred to as inner and outer hair cells, are arranged in distinct rows, with three rows of outer hair cells and a single row of inner hair cells. To ensure the highly stereotyped arrangement of hair cells, cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation within the auditory sensory epithelium occurs in a spatially and temporally highly coordinated manner. Auditory sensory progenitors (pro-sensory cells) exit the cell cycle in an apical-to-basal gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruben, 1967</xref>), whereas their differentiation into hair cells and supporting cells occurs in an opposing, basal-to-apical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies uncovered that Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling plays a key role in setting up the spatial and temporal pattern of auditory hair cell differentiation. In the undifferentiated cochlea, pro-sensory cells are exposed to high concentrations of SHH protein secreted by the adjacent spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). SGN-specific ablation of SHH or cochlear epithelial-specific ablation of its co-receptor Smoothened results in premature hair cell differentiation and in the most extreme case a reversal of the gradient of hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>). The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor ATOH1 is the earliest marker of nascent hair cells and is both necessary and sufficient for the production of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woods et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng and Gao, 2000</xref>). SHH signaling represses hair cell differentiation, at least in part, through maintaining the expression of HEY1 and HEY2 in pro-sensory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito-Gonzalez and Doetzlhofer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>). The bHLH transcriptional repressors HEY1 and HEY2 have been shown to antagonize ATOH1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doetzlhofer et al., 2009</xref>) and their loss leads to premature hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito-Gonzalez and Doetzlhofer, 2014</xref>). In addition to HEY1 and HEY2, auditory pro-sensory cells express members of the inhibitor of differentiation (ID) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). ID proteins are dominant negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Baker, 2015</xref>). Acting downstream of BMP signaling, ID1-3 are thought to maintain pro-sensory cells in an undifferentiated state by interfering with ATOH1’s ability to bind to DNA and auto-regulate its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamaid et al., 2010</xref>). Through a yet unknown mechanism, <italic>Id1-3</italic> expression is downregulated in a subset of pro-sensory cells at the onset of differentiation, allowing these cells to upregulate ATOH1 and to differentiate into hair cells.</p><p>Much less is known about the signals and factors that promote ATOH1 expression/activity within pro-sensory cells and their role in auditory hair cell differentiation. Over-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to increase <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in differentiating cochlear explants, and in the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling hair cells fail to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacques et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munnamalai and Fekete, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). However, the pattern of Wnt–reporter activity, which at the onset of hair cell differentiation is high in the cochlear apex but low in the cochlear base, does not parallel the basal-to-apical wave of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacques et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Inhba</italic> gene, which encodes the Activin A subunit Inhibin βA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton et al., 1989</xref>), has been recently reported to be expressed in a basal-to-apical gradient within the differentiating auditory sensory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Son et al., 2015</xref>). Activins, which belong to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily of cytokines, control a broad range of biological processes, including reproduction, embryonic axial specification, organogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Namwanje and Brown, 2016</xref>). Canonical TGFβ-type signaling is transduced by receptor regulated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs). Upon receptor mediated phosphorylation, R-SMADs (SMAD1, 2, 3, 5, 9) form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4, which enables them to translocate to the nucleus and activate a broad array of target genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>). In the developing spinal cord, Activins and other TGF-β-related ligands are required in most dorsally located neuronal progenitors for <italic>Atoh1</italic> induction and their subsequent differentiation as D1A/B commissural neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wine-Lee et al., 2004</xref>). The role of Activin-type signaling in cochlear <italic>Atoh1</italic> regulation and hair cell differentiation is currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we identify Activin A and its antagonist follistatin (FST) as key regulators of <italic>Atoh1</italic> gene expression and hair cell differentiation. We find that in the developing murine cochlea Activin A acts as a pro-differentiation signal, and demonstrate that a counter gradient of Activin A and FST within the auditory sensory epithelium times the basal-to-apical wave of hair cell differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a counter gradient of Activin A and FST informs a previously unidentified medial-to-lateral gradient of terminal mitosis that forces inner hair cell progenitors located at the medial edge of the sensory epithelium to withdraw from the cell cycle prior to outer hair cell progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The graded pattern of Activin A expression parallels auditory hair cell differentiation</title><p>The biological activity of Activins and other Activin-type ligands is limited by the secreted protein follistatin (FST). Two FST molecules encircle the Inhibin β dimer, blocking both type I and type II receptor binding sites, thus preventing receptor binding and activation of its downstream signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>).

Hair cell differentiation follows a steep basal-to-apical gradient in which hair cells located within the cochlear mid-basal segment differentiate prior to more apically located hair cells.

We used native GFP (<italic>Atoh1-GFP</italic>) expression, myosin VII a (Myo7a) immunostaining and phalloidin labeling to identify hair cells and SOX2 immunostaining to identify supporting cells. As expected, cochlear tissue from stage E18.5 control embryos contained a single row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <italic>Control</italic>). By contrast, <italic>R26-FST</italic> cochlear tissue contained two rows of inner hair cells throughout the basal half of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <italic>R26-FST</italic>). The observed ectopic inner hair cells were unlikely to be the product of supporting cell-to-hair cell fate conversion, as the density of supporting cells that surrounded inner hair cells-called inner phalangeal cells- was similarly increased in response to FST overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Interestingly, the outer hair cell density and cellular patterning was unchanged in response to FST overexpression except for the cochlear base. The base of FST overexpressing cochleae contained short stretches of sensory epithelium in which the third row of outer hair cells was missing, resulting in a modest reduction in outer hair cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Furthermore, differentiation/maturation of the auditory sensory epithelium was severely delayed in response to FST overexpression. Usually, at stage E18.5, the basal-to-apical wave of differentiation has reached the apex and the initially multilayered auditory sensory epithelium has thinned to a two-layered sensory epithelium, and is near its final length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driver et al., 2017</xref>).

Here, we identify Activin A and its antagonist FST as key regulators of auditory hair cell differentiation. We show that Activin A acts as differentiation signal for sensory hair cells and present evidence that a counter gradient of Activin A and FST times the wave of hair cell differentiation within the developing murine cochlea. Finally, we provide evidence that Activin-type signaling regulates a previously unrecognized radial gradient of pro-sensory cell cycle withdrawal, limiting the number of inner hair cells being produced.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Activin A functions as a pro-differentiation signal in the mammalian cochlea</title><p>We find that exogenous Activin A triggers premature hair cell differentiation in cochlear explant cultures and demonstrate that disruption of Activin A signaling due to <italic>FST</italic> overexpression or <italic>Inhba</italic> deletion results in a delay in cochlear hair cell differentiation in vivo. How does Activin signaling promote cochlear hair cell differentiation? The function of Activin signaling in cell proliferation and cell differentiation is highly dependent on cellular context. This has been attributed to the cross-talk and cross-regulation between the Activin signaling pathway and other key developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo, 2017</xref>). One possible scenario is that Activin signaling promotes hair cell differentiation through mitigating the hair cell-repressive activity of SHH signaling. For instance, Activin signaling has been shown to promote cortical interneuron differentiation, at least in part, through the inhibition of SHH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambray et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found no evidence for direct interference as neither over-activation nor loss of Activin signaling altered the expression of SHH target and effector genes <italic>Hey1</italic>, <italic>Hey2</italic> and <italic>Fgf20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito-Gonzalez and Doetzlhofer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another possible scenario is that Activin-SMAD2/3 signaling directly trans-activates the transcription of <italic>Atoh1.</italic> We did observe a robust increase in <italic>Atoh1</italic> transcript abundance in response to 24 hr Activin treatment. However, a brief 4 hr Activin A treatment failed to significantly increase <italic>Atoh1</italic> transcript abundance, suggesting that Activin signaling does not activate <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression directly but rather through indirect mechanisms. Indeed, our findings suggest that Activin signaling positively regulates ATOH1 activity/expression through inhibiting cochlear expression of <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>Id4</italic>. Members of the ID family of proteins interfere with the ability of bHLH transcription factors to bind DNA and trans-activate their targets genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Baker, 2015</xref>), which in the case of ATOH1 would render it incapable of upregulating its own transcription and inducing hair cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helms et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with an inhibitory role in hair cell differentiation, previous studies found that a failure to downregulate <italic>Id3</italic> expression in hair cell progenitors inhibits the formation of hair cells in both auditory and vestibular sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamaid et al., 2010</xref>). The role of ID4 in inner ear development has yet to be established.</p><p>It should be noted that <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression and subsequent hair cell differentiation is not disrupted, but rather delayed in response to FST overexpression or <italic>Inhba</italic> ablation, suggesting the existence of Activin-independent mechanisms capable of activating <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in pro-sensory cells. A likely candidate is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The Wnt effector β-catenin is required for hair cell specification and has been shown to directly activate <italic>Atoh1</italic> transcription in neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). Taking these recent findings and our findings into consideration, we propose a model in which Wnt/β-catenin signaling initiates <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression, whereas Activin signaling functions to enhance <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression/activity along the longitudinal cochlear axis.</p><p>What are the signal(s)/factor(s) that set up the distinct pattern of cochlear <italic>Inhba</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> expression? Early SHH signaling, presumably from the ventral midline, is critical for establishing regional identity in the developing cochlea, including setting up the distinct basal–apical pattern of <italic>Inhba</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> expression. However, subsequent SHH signaling from the spiral ganglion is dispensable for establishing/maintaining <italic>Inhba</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Son et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the involvement of additional, yet to be identified upstream regulators. A potential candidate for inducing <italic>Inhba</italic> expression at the onset of hair cell differentiation is the Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling is active in pro-sensory cells and has been shown to positively regulate <italic>Inhba</italic> expression in differentiating and terminal differentiated supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maass et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FST maintains pro-sensory cells in a proliferative and undifferentiated state</title><p>We show that FST overexpression delays the onset of pro-sensory cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation. A similar function in timing pro-sensory cell withdrawal and differentiation has been recently reported for the RNA binding protein LIN28B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golden et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Fst</italic> in the developing cochlea largely mimics that of <italic>Lin28b</italic>; each are initially highly expressed in pro-sensory cells and are downregulated upon differentiation following a basal-to-apical gradient. Regulatory and functional connections between Activin signaling and LIN28B have not yet been established and it will be of interest to determine whether a link between LIN28B and FST exists.</p><p>TGF-β-related signaling pathways are known to inhibit proliferation through promoting the expression and/or activity of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Massagué and Gomis, 2006</xref>). In the developing cochlea, the CDK inhibitor p27/Kip1 (CDKN1B) is the main regulator of pro-sensory cell cycle exit and its transcriptional upregulation directs the apical-to-basal wave of pro-sensory cell cycle withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Segil, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). However, we observed no changes in p27/Kip1 mRNA expression in response to FST overexpression, suggesting that the observed delay in pro-sensory cell cycle exit may instead be due to a reduction in p27/Kip1 protein stability and/or activity. In addition, it is likely that the increase in <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>Id4</italic> expression in response to FST overexpression contributed to the observed delay in pro-sensory cell cycle exit. High ID protein expression is associated with a proliferative, undifferentiated cell state and ID4 expression in spermatogonia and mammary glands is a predictor for stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helsel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Baker, 2015</xref>). Does FST target other Activin-type ligands in the developing cochlea? This is quite likely as <italic>Fst</italic> can be detected within the most ventral aspect of the developing otocyst as early as E10.5, preceding Activin A expression by several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Son et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the cochlear defects observed in <italic>Inhba</italic> mutants are much milder compared to the cochlear defects observed in <italic>FST</italic> transgenic animals. A potential candidate is GDF11, which our qPCR-based expression analysis identified as the predominant Activin-type ligand within the developing cochlea. GDF11–FST axis has been shown to regulate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in various sensory tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beites et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gokoffski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2005</xref>).

In certain tissues, including the developing tongue, FST has been shown to interfere with BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beites et al., 2009</xref>). In the mammalian cochlea BMP-receptor signaling is critical for the specification of sensory and non-sensory territories and the medial-lateral partitioning of the pro-sensory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munnamalai and Fekete, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puligilla et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it could be reasoned that the observed increase in inner hair cells in FST overexpressing cochleae is the result of defects in medial-lateral patterning caused by the loss of BMP signaling. However, we found no evidence that FST overexpression disrupted or significantly reduced BMP signaling within the developing cochlea. FST overexpression did not reduce protein levels of the BMP effectors p-SMAD1/5/9, nor did it reduce the expression of BMP target genes <italic>Id1-3</italic>.</p><p>Instead, we propose that the ectopic inner hair cells in <italic>FST</italic> transgenic and <italic>Inhba</italic> mutant animals are the product of prolonged inner hair cell progenitor proliferation. We show that under normal conditions inner hair cell progenitors withdraw from the cell cycle prior to outer hair cell progenitor cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that this distinct medial-to-lateral gradient of terminal mitosis is lost in FST overexpressing cochlear tissue, resulting in a disproportional increase in inner hair cells. What informs the radial gradient of terminal mitosis in wild type cochlear tissue? We show that at the peak of terminal mitosis (E13.5), <italic>Fst</italic> expression becomes restricted to the lateral portion of the pro-sensory domain, suggesting that inner hair cell progenitors experience higher levels of Activin-type signaling (Activin A, GDF11) than more laterally located outer hair cell progenitor cells. This newly identified radial gradient of terminal mitosis constitutes a novel mechanism for limiting the number of inner hair cells that are being produced in the mammalian cochlea.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p> <italic>Atoh1-GFP</italic> transgenic mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3703598">MGI:3703598</ext-link>, Tg(Atoh1-GFP)1Jejo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lumpkin et al., 2003</xref>) were obtained from Jane Johnson, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center. <italic>Pax2-Cre</italic> BAC transgenic mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3046196">MGI:3046196</ext-link>, Tg(Pax2-cre)1Akg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohyama and Groves, 2004</xref>) were obtained from Andrew Groves, Baylor College. <italic>Inhba floxed</italic> mice (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3758877">MGI:3758877</ext-link>, Inhba<sup>tm3Zuk</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pangas et al., 2007</xref>) were obtained from Martin Matzuk, Baylor College.

R0278) supplemented with Roche Protease Inhibitor (Sigma, no. 11697498001) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail no.2 (Sigma, no. P5726) and no.3 (Sigma, no. P0044). Following manufacture recommendations, equal amounts of cochlear protein extract were resolved on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen, no. NP0322BOX) and transferred to Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) by electrophoresis. Membranes were blocked in 5% no-fat dry milk in TBST and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-P-Smad2/3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, no.8828 RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2631089">AB_2631089</ext-link>), P-Smad1/5/9 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, no.13820, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2493181">AB_2493181</ext-link>) and mouse anti-β-actin (1:1000; Santa Cruz, no. SC-47778, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_626632">AB_626632</ext-link>). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson Immuno Research were used at a concentration of 1:10,000 (goat anti-rabbit IgG, no. 111-035-003; sheep anti-mouse IgG no. 515-035-003). Signal was revealed using a Western Lightening Plus ECL kit (Perkin Elmer, no.

Hair cells were identified by their native GFP (<italic>Atoh1-GFP</italic>) expression, as well as by immuno-staining for the hair cell-specific protein myosinVIIa (Myo7a); supporting cells were identified by SOX2 immuno-staining. Classification of cell subtypes was based on their location within the sensory epithelium. Low-power confocal and epi-fluorescent images (ZEISS, Microscopy) of the hair cell layer were used to reconstruct the entire cochlear sensory epithelium. The resulting composite images were used to count ectopic inner hair cells, measure the total length of the sensory epithelia and used to define basal, mid and apical segments (~1400 µm). For hair cell and supporting cell counts a series of high-power confocal (ZEISS, Microscopy) z-stack images spanning the hair cell and supporting cell layer were taken within the basal, mid and apical segments. The apical tip (~300–500 µm) was excluded from the analysis. Images were assembled, viewed and analyzed in Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) and LSM image viewer software (ZEISS, Microscopy). Image J (National Institutes of Health) and FIJI software were used to measure the length of counted segments and total length of the sensory epithelium. The FIJI cell counter plugin was used to count cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Proliferation assay</title><p>EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine, Invitrogen no.

C10337 and no. C10339) was used to detect incorporated EdU according to the manufacturer’s specifications. To quantify the number and percentage of EdU positive hair cells and supporting cells, EdU stained cochlear surface preparations were immuno-stained for SOX2 and Myo7a. Length measurements and cell counts were conducted as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical reporting</title><p>Values are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The sample size (n) represents the number of biological independent samples (biological replicates) analyzed per experimental group. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests were used to determine the confidence interval, p-values≤0.05 were considered significant. p-values&gt;0.05 were considered not significant. Biologically independent samples (biological replicates) were allocated into experimental groups based on genotype and/or type of treatment. A minimum of three biological independent samples were analyzed per group. To avoid bias masking was used during data analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Doetzlhofer Laboratory for the help and advice provided throughout the course of this study.

The data are nicely presented and the overall conclusions, that counter gradients of Activin A and Follistatin regulate the timing of hair cell differentiation along the cochlear axis are well supported. My largest concern with the study is that while discussing three other signaling pathways, Shh, FGF and Wnt, that have been shown to also play roles in regulating hair cell differentiation, meaningful data exploring the links between Activin A/Follistatin and any of these other pathways is not presented. Some possibilities are broached in the Discussion section, but no specific interactions are examined. In particular, additional exploration of the link between the Shh/<italic>Fgf20</italic> pathway, which the authors showed to be important for the gradient of hair cell differentiation in a previous study and Activin A/Follistatin, would greatly strengthen this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Prajapati-DiNubila et al., reports the important observation that Activin A and follistatin play a role in the timing of onset of differentiation of the sensory hair cells in the developing organ of Corti. This question; &quot;What is responsible for timing the onset and progression of HC differentiation along the basal-to-apical gradient?&quot; is an extremely important one, and the identification of a role for Activin in this process may answer this long-standing issue. The paper clearly shows the effects of Activin and follistatin, but there are a fairly large number procedural and control issues to be dealt with, as well as questions about interpretation.</p><p>Using in situ hybridization, in Figure 1, the authors first replicate the observation that Activin A follows a basal-to-apical gradient of expression within the sensory domain of the organ that parallels the timing of hair cell differentiation (Figure 1). They also report a medial-lateral gradient of Activin A and follistatin, that they claim to observe by in situ hybridization, but this is harder to discern in the data as presented (see comment below).</p><p>Using an ex vivo culture system that allows hair cell differentiation to proceed from base-to-apex starting at a time just before the appearance of Atoh1, a crucial regulator of hair cell differentiation, the authors show that incubation of the cultures with Activin A leads to a precocious differentiation process, as measured by the basal-to-apical extent of transgenic GFP, reporting Atoh1 protein level, in differentiating hair cells (Figure 2A-G).</p><p>Interestingly, but perhaps inconsistent with the authors claim that Activin A regulates Atoh1 directly, they observe that once initiated, the process (rate) of differentiation along the basal-to-apical axis is the same as in the untreated cultures, and patterning is unaffected. Since the whole organ is bathed in exogenous Activin A at the beginning of the experiment, one might expect that Atoh1 would be up-regulated in the apex, as well as the base, however this does not seem to occur. Also, that Activin might stimulate Atoh1 in nascent supporting cells inducing transdifferentiation, which also does not seem to occur. This suggests that it is unlikely that Activin A is regulating Atoh1 directly, and that the modest Atoh1 increase shown by qPCR may represent the change in timing of the initiation of the wave of differentiation.</p><p>The Activin A effect on Atoh1 up-regulation is shown to be specific by comparison to BMP4, by qPCR (Figure 2K), though the effect is rather small. Here the data are confounded by use of a different experimental approach, in which a different dissection eliminated surrounding tissue. (subsection “Activin signaling positively regulates Atoh1 gene expression” and Figure 2K) &quot;We shortened the time of Activin A treatment to 3.5-hours, as well as cultured cochlear epithelia without its surrounding tissue.&quot; This requires some explanation. What is meant by &quot;surrounding tissue&quot; and was this included in the previous qPCR experiment (Figure 2I), or not? It seems that these details of the culture conditions could influence the outcome of the experiment, and so defining them precisely is important.</p><p>Activin activity is known to be opposed by follistatin, and in Figure 3, the authors make the case that follistatin limits the differentiation of hair cells. Overexpression of follistatin inhibits the normal basal-to-apical progression of HC differentiation that occurs between E13.5 and E17.5. Together these results suggest a role for ActivinA in timing this progression and a reliance on Folistatin to oppose this process, though why both need to be regulated is not clear. At the gene expression level, it is unclear from the figure whether the change claimed for Atoh1 or Id4 is statistically significant Figure 3F, though the change in phosphor-Smad2/3 in response to follistatin seem to be (Figure 3E). However, the data in Figure 3E needs to be quantified, and the total SMAD 2/3 protein levels shown using a non-phospho-specific antibody. The ability of follistatin overexpression to antagonize the effect of Activin A is shown in Figure 3H-T. Here it would be helpful to better define the &quot;hair cell domain&quot; measurement used.</p><p>Interestingly, the authors show that Follistatin overexpression appears to delay cell cycle exit in an apical-to-basal direction. And also, claim to show a normal medial-to-lateral gradient of cell cycle exit that is also opposed by follistatin overexpression. However, the data presented in Figure 4I is very difficult to understand, perhaps because of the way it is graphed. It might be useful for the authors to show these data from IHCs and OHCs on two separate graphs (with associated statistics). Nonetheless, the numbers seem to indicate that follistatin increases the percentage of OHCs that take up EdU in the mid-cochlea relative to IHC, suggesting differential sensitivity from medial-to-lateral.</p><p>However, this result appears to contrast with the result in the earlier part of Figure 4, which shows the ectopic proliferation in the IHC region to be more robust? Whereas, in Figure 5, where there appears to be an increase in ectopic inner HCs, accompanied by either normal or depleted three rows of outer hair cells in FST-OE. I would have expected, based on Figure 4K, that the opposite might be true</p><p>Finally, in Figure 5, the authors use an Inhba knockout strategy, and discover that there are sporadic ectopic inner HCs present in the KO, with an increase from base-to-apex. However, given the increase in proliferation seen in the follistatin OE, one might expect both IHC and OHC to be affected, and that the effect would be stronger and less organized than that shown in Figure 5Q-S. The phenotype shown, that of ectopic IHC occurring in a single row, seems to indicate a problem with border formation, rather than an overproliferation phenotype?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Acitivin signaling informs the graded pattern of terminal mitosis and hair cell differentiation in the mammalian cochlea&quot; by Prajapati-DiNublia et al., examines the role of Activin A in hair cell differentiation. Specifically, using cochlear explant cultures as well as genetic mouse models the authors provide evidence that Acivin A is a positive regulator of hair cell differentiation along the basal-to-apical axis of the cochlear duct. Further evidence is provided for a role of Acivin A signaling in terminal mitosis along the medial-to-lateral axis of the cochlear sensory epithelium.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In McCullar et al., 2010, the study demonstrated that the addition of Activin A to post-hatch avian auditory sensory epithelium increases proliferation while inhibiting the Activin receptors Acvr2a and 2b results in a decrease in proliferation in the sensory epithelium. This significantly lessens the novelty/impact/advance of the current study. It is unfortunate that the authors did not reference this paper.</p><p>Furthermore, in the 2010 study McCullar et al., also demonstrated the expression patterns of the Activin receptors Acvr2a and 2b as well as the downstream Smad effector proteins pSmad2 and pSmad1/5/8 in the mammalian cochlea and vestibule (Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 and Table 4).</p><p>The expression patterns presented in Figure 1 have been previously published as well. Specifically, the expression of Inhba and Fst have been published by Son et al., 2015 at E13.5 (Figure S5), E15.5 (Figure 5) and E18.5 (Figure S6) clearly demonstrating the spatiotemporal basal-to-apical expression of these two molecules. The Atoh1 and <italic>Sox2</italic> expression patterns have also been previously published by many groups including the current authors. Thus, Figure 1 does not offer any significant new information.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Counter gradients of Activin A and follistatin instruct the timing of hair cell differentiation in the mammalian cochlea&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favourably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor), Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The authors have done a very nice job of addressing the reviewers' comments.

Are they innervated?</p><p>Authors response:</p><p>We quantified the length of Inhba mutant and control cochlear tissue and found no difference; the quantitative data are included in the result section. The question whether these extra hair cells are functional is interesting but beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p>Second review:</p><p>I was not suggesting electrophysiological experiments which I agree would be beyond the scope of this study; rather FM1-43 uptake which would provide evidence of channel/stereociliary function. Furthermore, performing immunohistochemistry to demonstrate innervation phenotypes (if any) is straight forward and would add value to the study.</p><p>Lastly, I do agree with the other reviewer that quantification of P-SMAD should include controls showing total receptor protein using antibodies against the un-phosphorylated SMAD form. This would control for changes in total protein levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47613.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, while the reviewers agreed that the results are potentially significant, they felt that many modifications and new experiments would be required to bring the paper to a standard that would be acceptable for eLife.

Our analysis revealed that Activin A treatment or FST overexpression had no significant effect on the expression of transcriptional targets of SHH/<italic>Fgf20</italic> pathway (Hey1, Hey2 and <italic>Fgf20</italic>), suggesting that there is no direct link between SHH signaling and Activin signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Using an ex vivo culture system that allows hair cell differentiation to proceed from base-to-apex starting at a time just before the appearance of Atoh1, a crucial regulator of hair cell differentiation, the authors show that incubation of the cultures with Activin A leads to a precocious differentiation process, as measured by the basal-to-apical extent of transgenic GFP, reporting Atoh1 protein level, in differentiating hair cells (Figure 2A-G). […] Also, that Activin might stimulate Atoh1 in nascent supporting cells inducing transdifferentiation, which also does not seem to occur.</p></disp-quote><p>The preservation of the basal-to-apical gradient is consistent with our observation that the expression of key regulatory genes controlled by SHH signaling are unchanged in response to Activin A treatment, indicating that Activin signaling does not interfere with SHH signaling, which has been shown to be sufficient to maintain apical progenitors undifferentiated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This suggests that it is unlikely that Activin A is regulating Atoh1 directly, and that the modest Atoh1 increase shown by qPCR may represent the change in timing of the initiation of the wave of differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our current data are most consistent with Activin signaling promoting Atoh1 expression through an indirect mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Activin A effect on Atoh1 up-regulation is shown to be specific by comparison to BMP4, by qPCR (Figure 2K), though the effect is rather small. Here the data are confounded by use of a different experimental approach, in which a different dissection eliminated surrounding tissue. (subsection “Activin signaling positively regulates Atoh1 gene expression” and Figure 2K) &quot;We shortened the time of Activin A treatment to 3.5-hours, as well as cultured cochlear epithelia without its surrounding tissue.&quot; This requires some explanation. What is meant by &quot;surrounding tissue&quot; and was this included in the previous qPCR experiment (Figure 2I), or not? It seems that these details of the culture conditions could influence the outcome of the experiment, and so defining them precisely is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the section that describes the experimental approach and now state that enzymatically purified cochlear epithelia were cultured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Activin activity is known to be opposed by follistatin, and in Figure 3, the authors make the case that follistatin limits the differentiation of hair cells. Overexpression of follistatin inhibits the normal basal-to-apical progression of HC differentiation that occurs between E13.5 and E17.5. Together these results suggest a role for ActivinA in timing this progression and a reliance on Folistatin to oppose this process, though why both need to be regulated is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>The utility of having both a source (Activin A) and a sink (follistatin) in signaling gradients is well documented (e.g. wnt and wnt antagonists in rostral-caudal patterning of the neural plate).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the gene expression level, it is unclear from the figure whether the change claimed for Atoh1 or Id4 is statistically significant Figure 3F, though the change in phosphor-Smad2/3 in response to follistatin seem to be (Figure 3E). However, the data in Figure 3E needs to be quantified, and the total SMAD 2/3 protein levels shown using a non-phospho-specific antibody. The ability of follistatin overexpression to antagonize the effect of Activin A is shown in Figure 3H-T. Here it would be helpful to better define the &quot;hair cell domain&quot; measurement used.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include detailed information about how the hair cell domain measurements were conducted in the Materials and methods section. We also conducted a new set of experiments (increased number of biological replicates), which revealed significant changes in Atoh1 and Id4 expression in response to FST overexpression (Figure 3 E). We added a quantification of normalized p-Smad2/3 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, the authors show that Follistatin overexpression appears to delay cell cycle exit in an apical-to-basal direction. And also, claim to show a normal medial-to-lateral gradient of cell cycle exit that is also opposed by follistatin overexpression. However, the data presented in Figure 4I is very difficult to understand, perhaps because of the way it is graphed. It might be useful for the authors to show these data from IHCs and OHCs on two separate graphs (with associated statistics). Nonetheless, the numbers seem to indicate that follistatin increases the percentage of OHCs that take up EdU in the mid-cochlea relative to IHC, suggesting differential sensitivity from medial-to-lateral.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, in the revised manuscript OHC and IHC EdU incorporation is now graphed separately. We are puzzled by the reviewer’s conclusion that follistatin overexpression increases the percentage of OHCs that take up EdU in the midcochlea compared to IHCs, as this is not what our data indicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, this result appears to contrast with the result in the earlier part of Figure 4, which shows the ectopic proliferation in the IHC region to be more robust? Whereas, in Figure 5, where there appears to be an increase in ectopic inner HCs, accompanied by either normal or depleted three rows of outer hair cells in FST-OE. I would have expected, based on Figure 4K, that the opposite might be true</p></disp-quote><p>See comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in Figure 5, the authors use an Inhba knockout strategy, and discover that there are sporadic ectopic inner HCs present in the KO, with an increase from base-to-apex. However, given the increase in proliferation seen in the follistatin OE, one might expect both IHC and OHC to be affected, and that the effect would be stronger and less organized than that shown in Figure 5Q-S. The phenotype shown, that of ectopic IHC occurring in a single row, seems to indicate a problem with border formation, rather than an overproliferation phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that defects in border formation could attribute to ectopic IHCs. However, as shown in much detail we observe that FST overexpression disrupts the medial-to-lateral gradient of cell cycle exit, disrupting the proportion of inner and outer hair cell that are being produced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>In McCullar et al., 2010, the study demonstrated that the addition of Activin A to post-hatch avian auditory sensory epithelium increases proliferation while inhibiting the Activin receptors Acvr2a and 2b results in a decrease in proliferation in the sensory epithelium. This significantly lessens the novelty/impact/advance of the current study. It is unfortunate that the authors did not reference this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>McCullar et al. investigated the role of Activin signaling in the mature chicken auditory organ. We disagree with the reviewer’s view that the aforementioned study lessens the impact of our current study. The study was conducted in explanted adult chicken tissue examining the role of Activin signaling in regenerative supporting cell proliferation-a process that does not exist in mammals. More importantly, Activin signaling in mature chicken auditory sensory epithelium promotes supporting cell (progenitor cell) proliferation, whereas in the developing murine cochlea Activin signaling promotes progenitor cell differentiation. The striking differences in Activin’s function in the avian and mammalian auditory organ are quite intriguing and we added a brief discussion of the different roles of Activin signaling in birds and mammals in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in the 2010 study McCullar et al., also demonstrated the expression patterns of the Activin receptors Acvr2a and 2b as well as the downstream Smad effector proteins pSmad2 and pSmad1/5/8 in the mammalian cochlea and vestibule (Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 and Table 4).</p></disp-quote><p>The mentioned expression data relates to adult stages and thus has little bearing on the role of Activin signaling during development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression patterns presented in Figure 1 have been previously published as well. Specifically, the expression of Inhba and Fst have been published by Son et al., 2015 at E13.5 (Figure S5), E15.5 (Figure 5) and E18.5 (Figure S6) clearly demonstrating the spatiotemporal basal-to-apical expression of these two molecules. The Atoh1 and Sox2 expression patterns have also been previously published by many groups including the current authors. Thus, Figure 1 does not offer any significant new information.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of Figure1 is to characterize Atoh1, Inhba and Fst expression at the onset of hair cell differentiation, which the aforementioned study did not provide.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have done a very nice job of addressing the reviewers' comments. There are a few remaining suggestions from the reviewers. The further experimental work suggested by reviewer 1 is left to the authors' discretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank our two reviewers and our editors Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing Editor) for the favorable evaluation of our revised article. Please see below our response to the reviewer’s suggestions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a re-submission by Prajapati-DiNublia et al., examining the role of Activin A in hair cell differentiation.</p><p>I was not suggesting electrophysiological experiments which I agree would be beyond the scope of this study; rather FM1-43 uptake which would provide evidence of channel/stereociliary function. Furthermore, performing immunohistochemistry to demonstrate innervation phenotypes (if any) is straight forward and would add value to the study.</p><p>Lastly, I do agree with the other reviewer that quantification of P-SMAD should include controls showing total receptor protein using antibodies against the un-phosphorylated SMAD form. This would control for changes in total protein levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions. As the suggested experiments are not essential and to not further delay the publication of the manuscript, we decided to not conduct additional experimental work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
