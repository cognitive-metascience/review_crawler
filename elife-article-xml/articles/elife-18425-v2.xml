nucleophilic due to unpaired electrons. Little is known about how free radicals induced by natural sunlight are rapidly detected and avoided by animals. We discover that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), previously known only as an electrophile receptor, sensitively detects photochemically active sunlight through nucleophile sensitivity. Rapid light-dependent feeding deterrence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was mediated only by the TRPA1(A) isoform, despite the TRPA1(A) and TRPA1(B) isoforms having similar electrophile sensitivities. Such isoform dependence re-emerges in the detection of structurally varied nucleophilic compounds and nucleophilicity-accompanying hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, these isoform-dependent mechanisms require a common set of TRPA1(A)-specific residues dispensable for electrophile detection. Collectively, TRPA1(A) rapidly responds to natural sunlight intensities through its nucleophile sensitivity as a receptor of photochemically generated radicals, leading to an acute light-induced behavioral shift in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18425.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18425.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Atoms are made up of a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons, which is orbited by electrons. The electrons orbit within shells that surround the nucleus and each shell can contain a specific number of electrons. A particle with an outer shell that is missing one or more electrons will be unstable and highly reactive. It will attempt to achieve a full outer shell either by sharing electrons with another particle, or by donating or stealing an electron. Particles that steal electrons are said to be “electrophilic” (electron-loving) while those that donate them are “nucleophilic”.</p><p>Electrophilic and nucleophilic particles can damage DNA and proteins. In species from fruit flies to humans, electrophilic substances such as formaldehyde activate a type of ion channel called TRPA1. These ion channels contribute to pain signaling, and their activation triggers unpleasant and painful sensations that deter animals from getting too close to electrophilic substances. However, it is not known if animals have an equivalent mechanism to help them avoid toxic nucleophilic compounds, like carbon monoxide and cyanide.</p><p>Du, Ahn, Wen, Seo, Na et al. now show that fruit fly neurons produce two versions of the TRPA1 channel: one that is sensitive to electrophiles, plus a second that is sensitive to nucleophiles in addition to electrophiles. The existence of nucleophile-sensitive TRPA1 helps explain why fruit flies avoid feeding in strong sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight triggers the production of reactive forms of oxygen that behave as strong nucleophiles. These reactive oxygen species – which can damage DNA – activate the nucleophile-sensitive TRPA1 and thereby trigger the fly’s avoidance behavior.</p><p>Human TRPA1 responds only to electrophiles and not to nucleophiles. By targeting the nucleophile-sensitive version of insect TRPA1, it may thus be possible to develop insect repellants that humans do not find aversive. Furthermore, TRPA1s from some insect species are more sensitive to nucleophiles than others, with a mosquitoes’ being more sensitive than the fruit flies’. This means that insect repellants that target nucleophile-sensitive TRPA1 could potentially repel malaria-transmitting mosquitoes without affecting other insect species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18425.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18425.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chemical nociception</kwd><kwd>photochemistry</kwd><kwd>free radicals</kwd><kwd>nucleophiles</kwd><kwd>TRPA1</kwd><kwd>feeding deterrence</kwd><kwd>photobiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2015R1D1A1A01057288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>KyeongJin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015H-1A2A-1034723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Tae Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron-donating nucleophilic compounds activate TRPA1 ion channels in fruit flies and mosquitoes, but not humans, making TRPA1 a promising target for insect repellants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Highly reactive chemical compounds are dangerous because of their ability to covalently modify and incapacitate proteins and nucleic acids. Such reactive chemicals are often perceived as noxious and are avoided by animals through chemical nociception mechanisms, in which Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels play major roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Julius, 2013</xref>). TRPA1 is the only conserved reactive chemical receptor in the bilateria from humans to flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>), and is activated rather than inactivated by covalent modification unlike most proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>). Although chemical reactivity can be categorized into two opposite characters, electron-attracting electrophilicity and electron-donating nucleophilicity, only the former has been shown to provoke TRPA1-dependent nociception. Furthermore, there is no molecular mechanism attributed to the sensory detection of nucleophiles, while nucleophilic compounds are widespread in nature as antioxidant phytochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lü et al., 2010</xref>) and as decomposition gases of animal carcasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dent et al., 2004</xref>), and strong nucleophiles, such as carbon monoxide and cyanide, can be fatal to animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grut, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krahl and Clowes, 1940</xref>).</p><p>In insects, TRPA1 was originally thought to be a polymodal sensory receptor capable of detecting both temperature increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Viswanath et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Corfas and Vosshall, 2015</xref>) and chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>). However, this polymodality would limit reliable detection of chemical stimuli when ambient temperature varies. In fact, the <italic>TrpA1</italic> genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and malaria-transmitting <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> were recently found to produce two transcript variants with distinct 5’ exons containing individual start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). The two resulting TRPA1 channel isoforms, TRPA1(A) and TRPA1(B), differ only in their N-termini, and share more than 90% of their primary structure. TRPA1(A), which is expressed in chemical-sensing neurons, is unable to confer thermal sensitivity to the sensory neurons, allowing TRPA1(A)-positive cells to reliably detect reactive chemicals regardless of fluctuations in ambient temperature. In addition to the insufficient thermosensitivity, TRPA1(A) has been under active investigations for its novel functions, such as the detection of citronellal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2015</xref>), gut microbiome-controlling hypochlorous acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2016</xref>), and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soldano et al., 2016</xref>). Although TRPA1(A) and TRPA1(B) are similarly sensitive to electrophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), the highly temperature-sensitive TRPA1(B) is expressed in internal AC neurons that direct <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent long-term thermotaxis of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), and is thereby inaccessible to reactive chemicals present in the environment. Thus, the functional segregation of TRPA1 isoforms into two distinct sensory circuits is critical for sensory discrimination between thermal and chemical inputs.</p><p>Photochemical conversion of photonic to chemical energy greatly affects organisms, as is evident in vision, circadian rhythm, and photosynthesis. Low-wavelength solar radiation that reaches the surface of the Earth, generally in the range of ultraviolet (UV) to blue light, is a major driving force for such natural photochemical reactions. In contrast to the beneficial effects of photochemistry, the chemical reactivity of free radicals generated by low-wavelength light imposes DNA and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannan et al., 1984</xref>) and accelerates aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Brieva, 2012</xref>). TRPA1 has been characterized in the bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>) as the molecular receptor for oxidative electrophilic reactivity, as reactive electrophilic compounds activate the non-selective cation channel through covalent modification of key cysteines in the ankyrin repeat domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>). Despite its electrophile sensitivity, mammalian TRPA1 requires an extremely high UV intensity (580 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for direct activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill and Schaefer, 2009</xref>), which is at least 4-fold greater than the extraterrestrial solar constant (SC: the total solar irradiation density measured by a satellite, 137 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gueymard, 2004</xref>]). The high UV intensity requirement for TRPA1 activation in mammals indicates that electrophilic sensitivity is inadequate for sensitive detection of photochemically-produced free radicals, although radicals are often regarded as inflicting electrophilic oxidative stress. However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1 has been shown to readily respond to UV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the physiological significance and molecular basis of its enhanced sensitivity unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guntur, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Insects and birds are able to visualize upper-UV wavelengths (above 320 nm) via UV-specific rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salcedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ödeen and Håstad, 2013</xref>). Visual detection of UV in this range by insects generally elicits attraction towards the UV source rather than avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Craig and Bernard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Washington, 2010</xref>). At the same time, lower UV wavelengths, such as UVB (280–315 nm) at natural intensities, have been known to decrease insect phytophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zavala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rousseaux et al., 1998</xref>) via a direct effect on the animals that does not involve the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazza et al., 1999</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of UV-induced feeding deterrence has yet to be unraveled. Here, using feeding assays combined with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> molecular genetics and electrophysiological analyses in in vivo neurons and heterologous <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, we show that TRPA1(A) is a nucleophile receptor, and that the ability to detect nucleophilicity enables TRPA1(A) to detect light-evoked free radicals and mediate light-dependent feeding deterrence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UV irradiation evokes <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent action potentials in <italic>Drosophila</italic> i-bristle sensilla and suppresses feeding</title><p>Insect herbivory is often reduced by solar UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazza et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhlmann, 2009</xref>), suggesting that UV radiation is responsible for acute control of insect feeding through a light-sensitive molecular mechanism. To examine whether UV radiation deters feeding through a direct impact on insect gustatory systems, we turned to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system. First, we tested if the aversive taste pathway responds to UV illumination using extracellular single sensillum recording, which monitors action potentials from <italic>Drosophila</italic> labellum taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">HODGSON et al., 1955</xref>). Aversion to bitter chemicals is in part coded in i-bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>), which house single bitter-tasting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanimura et al., 2009</xref>). Illumination of 295 nm UV light at an intensity of 5.2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>(~85% of the total UV intensity on the ground [6.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>]) received by the fly labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b, d</xref>) rapidly elicited firing of single taste neurons in i-a bristles which was sustained after illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>). Bitter-sensing taste cells in i-bristles also act as receptors for tissue-damaging chemicals through expression of the conserved reactive electrophile sensor TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Because free radicals elicited by UV illumination are often regarded as oxidative electrophiles, we examined the i-bristles of the <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup></italic>mutant flies, which lack a functional <italic>TrpA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenzweig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins </sup></italic>showed an severely reduced UV response in i-bristles, suggesting the importance of <italic>TrpA1</italic> for UV sensing in these sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The cell viability of bristles without UV responses was confirmed with 1 mM berberine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), a bitter chemical that selectively excites bitter-sensing neurons in i-a bristle sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). To assess whether the UV-dependent excitation of <italic>TrpA1</italic>–positive cells pertains to a reduction in the insects’ appetite, a modified capillary feeder (Café) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ja et al., 2007</xref>) was used to appraise the effect of UV on feeding. Pairwise Café experiments were conducted in two groups of overnight-starved flies, which were allowed to drink 30 mM sucrose for 2.5 min from calibrated glass capillaries inserted into a fly vial with or without 312 nm UVB illumination reaching the inside of the vial at ~1.3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, see Materials and methods for details), an irradiance less than 25% of the total UV intensity received on the surface of the Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">RReDC</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gueymard, 2004</xref>). Avoidance indices were calculated to concisely compare the gustatory effect of UV across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). UV illumination substantially decreased the feeding of wild-type flies (WT: <italic>wcs</italic>), but did not disrupt the feeding of <italic>TrpA1</italic><sup><italic>ins</italic> </sup>mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>TrpA1</italic>- and UV-dependent spikings in aversive taste neurons suppress food ingestion.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UV-induced taste neuron firing and feeding deterrence require <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic> but not <italic>TrpA1(B)</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative UV responses from i-bristles of the indicated genotypes. <italic>wcs</italic>: white canton S (wild type). <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup></italic>: <italic>TrpA1</italic> knockout flies.

At an unnaturally high intensity of 350 nm UVA illumination, such as 580 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(~420% of SC and &gt;9,000% of total UV intensity on the ground), mammalian TRPA1 was directly stimulated by UV illumination when heterologously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill and Schaefer, 2009</xref>). In line with the observation that <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) confers a low threshold of UV responsiveness in nonnative cells, heterologous <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing TRPA1(A) but not those expressing TRPA1(B) showed TRPA1-dependent current increases in response to 295 nm UV light at ~62% of the total ground UV intensity, 3.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>; for an estimation of UV irradiance received by oocytes see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). The UV-induced current exhibited the reversal potential and outward rectification previously associated with currents recorded from fly TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">, 2012</xref>). TRPA1 unselectively conducts cations, with reversal potentials close to 0 mV. The UV and NMM responses serially recorded from each cell showed similar reversal potentials of −5.6 ± 1.1 and −5.4 ± 1.0 mV, respectively (not significantly different, paired t-test, n = 7). Rectification was quantitated by calculating the ratio between the conductances at +60 to that at −60 mV. Moderate outward rectification was indicated by the ratios of the net UV and NMM responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,g</xref>), which were 1.8 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.3 (not significantly different, paired t-test, n = 4), respectively, when TRPA1(A) showed a similar degree of activation in response to UV and NMM. Such UV-responsive ability of TRPA1(A) in frog cells indicates the sufficiency of TRPA1(A) as an autonomous UV receptor expressed in fly bitter-sensing neurons. In contrast, human TRPA1 (humTRPA1) expressed in oocytes failed to yield current responses to the UV intensity of 3.8 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as expected from the excessive intensity required previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill and Schaefer, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, inside-out macropatches from TRPA1-expressing oocytes also responded to UV light in an isoform-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,b,e</xref>). To exclude the possibility of leak current induced by UV illumination, we recorded from TRPA1(B)-containing membranes over extended periods of time (up to 350 s) and did not observe a significant increase in current. Activation of TRPA1(A) often showed a delayed onset before UV-evoked current responses, unlike TRPA1(A) in the whole-cell configuration, suggesting that cytosolic reducing power aids in UV-dependent TRPA1(A) activation. The ability to confer UV responsiveness to ectopic fly neurons and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes strongly argues that TRPA1(A) serves as the molecular UV receptor without other upstream signaling molecules or coreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nucleophilicity-bearing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induces robust behavioral, neuronal and heterologous responses through TRPA1(A) but not TRPA1(B)</title><p>Next, we asked why TRPA1(A), but not TRPA1(B), can respond to UV light. The two isoforms differ in their N-termini which comprises less than 10% of the primary protein structure, but their reactive electrophile sensitivity is comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). We conducted conventional Café assays to confirm the similarity of sensitivity of the isoforms to the electrophile N-methyl maleimide (NMM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). WT but not <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup></italic> animals showed NMM-dependent feeding avoidance as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">, 2010</xref>). The reintroduction of either <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic> or <italic>TrpA1(B)</italic> cDNA similarly restored NMM-dependent feeding avoidance in <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup></italic>, demonstrating that the isoforms are similar in their ability to confer electrophile responsiveness in vivo. This raises the possibility that TRPA1(A) detects a property of UV-generated free radicals other than oxidizing electrophilicity. Unpaired electrons in free radicals serve as both electrophiles and nucleophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Domingo and Pérez, 2013</xref>), as the lone electrons favor pairing by either accepting (electrophilic) or donating (nucleophilic) an electron. The primary oxyradical superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·-</sup>) (molecular oxygen that gained an electron), arising from UV illumination, is a well-known nucleophilic reductant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danen and Warner, 1977</xref>). Also, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which can be derived from O<sub>2</sub><sup>·-</sup>,is not only an oxidizing electrophile but also a reducing nucleophile owing to its two key chemical properties. First, when nucleophilic atoms, such as sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen, are adjacent to each other, the nucleophilicity of the compounds is dramatically increased (the alpha effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edwards and Pearson, 1962</xref>]). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (H-O-O-H) contains two consecutive oxygen atoms, which supposedly renders it nucleophilic. Second, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a weak acid, yields the hydroperoxide anion (HOO<sup>-</sup>), a strong nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearson and Edgington, 1962</xref>). To examine if TRPA1 isoforms differentially respond to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent feeding avoidance was tested with Café assays. WT flies increasingly avoided ingestion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing food as the dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was increased from 10 to 100 mM, while <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup> </italic>did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

In particular, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a requisite for the moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (EC50 =~ 230 μM) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting mouse TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>), which is activated directly by an elevation in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zurborg et al., 2007</xref>), providing evidence that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a weak electrophilic oxidant compared to other electrophilic TRPA1 agonists. Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was readily activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at concentrations as low as 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j,k</xref>, EC50 = 5.0±0.8 μM, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The ~450-fold higher sensitivity of TRPA1(A) than TRPA1(B) in oocytes may account for the differential behavioral and neuronal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responses of the TRPA1 isoforms.

The high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration required for neuronal and behavioral responses compared to that required to evoke heterologous responses in oocytes may be due to enzymatic catalysis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> taste bristles, the activity of which may not be robust in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. In addition, chemical doses necessary for in vivo TRPA1 activation are usually much higher than those required for activation of TRPA1 that is heterologously expressed in oocytes according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>). Yet, TRPA1 isoform dependence is consistent in in vivo and in vitro studies, which demonstrates that TRPA1(A) is superior to TRPA1(B) in sensing nucleophilicity-accompanying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in various contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The nucleophilic reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) elicits current responses from TRPA1(A) but not TRPA1(B)</title><p>A peculiar property of TRPA1(A) is that its expression in oocytes effects small standing current at rest.

This observation led to the hypothesis that the intracellular reducing/nucleophilic power for redox homeostasis partially opens TRPA1(A). To examine the idea, TRPA1 isoforms expressed in frog oocytes were subjected to perfusion buffer containing the well-known nucleophilic reductant dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT contains two nucleophilic thiols and is a popular reductant used in the studies of protein biochemistry. Indeed, only the TRPA1 channel that produced the standing current showed dose-dependent responses to DTT in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, EC50 =~92.8 μM and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, C105A and R113A/R116A substitutions compromised the DTT responsiveness of TRPA1(A) such that it was indistinguishable from that of TRPA1(B). The NMM sensitivity of these mutants was previously shown to be very similar to that of TRPA1(A)WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that the mutations specifically impaired DTT-dependent activation. Consistent with a previous study in which high concentrations of DTT completely reversed the mammalian TRPA1 current provoked by reversible electrophilic agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>), we found that cells expressing humTRPA1 seldom showed electrophysiological responses to DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplement file 1</xref>). Notably, these DTT-insensitive mutants and humTRPA1 showed remarkably reduced responses to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref>); the mutants and humTRPA1 were similar to TRPA1(B) in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplement file 1</xref>) and activation kinetics. These results indicate a strong structure-function association between the ability of TRPA1(A) to respond to DTT and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref>). Furthermore, oocytes expressing either mutant failed to respond to 3.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> 295 nm UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), revealing the concomitant requirement of the conserved residues for DTT, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV responses. To demonstrate the in vivo implications of TRPA1(A) nucleophile sensitivity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV responsiveness, cDNAs encoding <italic>TrpA1(A)C105A</italic> and <italic>TrpA1(A)R113A/R116A</italic> were expressed in WT <italic>Gr66a-Gal4</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–j</xref>).

These data demonstrate a specific dominant negative effect of the <italic>TrpA1(A)R113A/R116A</italic> mutant on TRPA1(A)-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV detection in vivo, and strongly support the notion that the <italic>TrpA1</italic>-positive neurons are necessary for UV-dependent feeding avoidance. Taken together, the nucleophile-detecting ability, which is reliant on the isoform-specific N-terminus, allows gustatory TRPA1(A) to sensitively respond to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV light. Thus, the TRPA1(A) N-terminus in the cytosol offers a unique activation modality that is independent of the electrophile-sensing pathway involving cysteines in the ankyrin repeat domain, which are shared between isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mosquito TRPA1(A) exhibits a dramatically enhanced sensitivity to nucleophilic DTT and shows elevated responsiveness to UV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in oocytes</title><p>Next, we examined if nucleophile sensing of TRPA1(A) can be a general underlying mechanism for the detection of UV illumination in insects. TRPA1 isoforms from malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (agTRPA1), were previously reported to be similar to their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts in thermosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>).

Compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A), cells expressing agTRPA1(A) exhibited considerably enhanced responsiveness to all three stimuli, while isoform dependencies existed, similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplement file 1</xref>). DTT more robustly activated agTRPA1(A) with an order-lower EC50 of ~3.8 μM and ~10 times higher peak current amplitudes than <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) when normalized to NMM responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Other structurally distinct nucleophiles, such as imidazole and benzyl thiocyanate (BTC), also preferentially activated agTRPA1(A) over agTRPA1(B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that TRPA1(A) responds to nucleophilicity and not the structures of the compounds. Oocytes microinjected with cRNA of <italic>agTrpA1(A)</italic> but not of <italic>agTrpA1(B)</italic> were often found to be of poor quality for electrophysiological characterization, presumably due to the large conductance resulting from agTRPA1(A) activation by the nucleophilic reducing power in the cytosol. To avoid this problem, 3–4 hr after cRNA microinjection, the TRPA1 antagonist ruthenium red was added to the oocyte media at a concentration of 3 μM to block the agTRPA1(A) activity induced by cytosolic reducing power and to yield cells appropriate for subsequent experiments. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> elicited ~5 times larger NMM-normalized agTRPA1(A) currents with a ~3 times lower EC50 of 1.7 ± 0.3 μM than did <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplement file 1</xref>). Furthermore, UV responses from agTRPA1(A) were ~5 times higher than those from <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) tested at the same settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,f</xref>). Inside-out macropatches from oocytes showed robust UV responses when expressing agTRPA1(A) but not agTRPA1(B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c–e</xref>), which is indicative of direct UV detection. Consistent with its higher nucleophilic sensitivity and responsiveness than fly TRPA1(A), agTRPA1(A) in excised membranes exhibited little latency and larger current amplitudes than did the fly ortholog. Thus, the functional study performed using agTRPA1(A) conveys two important messages. First, detection of nucleophiles, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV is likely a common function of TRPA1(A) in insects. Second, nucleophile sensitivity of insect TRPA1(A) is tightly associated with the ability to rapidly detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV illumination, as the sensitivities to the three stimuli are very well correlated with one another in experiments with agTRPA1(A) as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A)s.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Concomitant natural variations in DTT, UV and H2O2 responsiveness between <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> TRPA1(A)s.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, agTRPA1s show isoform dependence to DTT as do their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts, with larger response amplitudes (n = 5–6).

Accordingly, the requirement of UV irradiances for the TRPA1(A)-dependent responses described above is much higher than the natural intensities of UVA or UVB light that insects receive. On the basis of this observation, it is conceivable that the <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent feeding deterrence is unlikely to occur in natural settings, although TRPA1(A) is more sensitive by far than is humTRPA1, which requires UVA intensities of ~580 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Provided that the ability of nucleophile-detecting TRPA1(A)s to sense free radicals is the mechanistic basis of the UV responsiveness of TRPA1(A)s, we postulated that TRPA1(A) might be capable of responding to polychromatic natural sunlight, as visible light with relatively short wavelengths such as violet and blue rays is also known to generate free radicals via photochemical reactions with essential organic compounds such as flavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Godley et al., 2005</xref>). To test this possibility, <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic>-dependent responses were examined with white light from a Xenon arc lamp which produces a sunlight-simulating spectral output of the wavelengths higher than ~330 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Less than 2% of the total spectral intensity derived from a Xenon arc lamp is UV light from 330 to 400 nm. Indeed, an intensity of 93.4 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is comparable to natural sunlight irradiance on the ground, substantially increased action potentials in <italic>TrpA1</italic>-positive taste neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The increase in spiking was more apparent during the second 30 s illumination, while both the first and second 30 s responses to illumination required <italic>TrpA1</italic>. In parallel with the critical role of UV light in TRPA1(A) activation, blocking wavelengths below ~400 nm with a titanium-dioxide-coated glass filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hossein Habibi et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>, Right) abolished the spiking responses to the level of those seen in the <italic>TrpA1<sup>ins</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Also, polychromatic light at an intensity of 57.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> readily induced feeding inhibition that required <italic>TrpA1</italic>, and UV filtering also significantly suppressed the feeding deterrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In oocytes, TRPA1(A)s but not TRPA1(B)s showed current increases when subjected to a series of incrementing intensities of Xenon light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Fitting the data to the Hill equation yielded EI50s of 9.8 ± 4.1 and 2.5 ± 0.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for fly and mosquito TRPA1(A)s, respectively, revealing that TRPA1(A)s are sufficiently sensitive for detection of natural day light intensities. In terms of current amplitudes, agTRPA1(A) generated ~6 times more robust light-induced currents at −60 mV than did the fly ortholog isoform at the highest light intensity used. The UV filter significantly decreased the current responses, indicating the importance of UV in TRPA1(A) stimulation by white light. Furthermore, the nucleophilicity-specific mutants TRPA1(A)C105A and TRPA1(A)R113A/R116A expressed in oocytes behaved like the nucleophile-insensitive TRPA1(B) isoform in response to white light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>). These results suggest that visible light with relatively short wavelengths can substantially contribute to the excitation of <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic>-positive neurons, as white light from the Xenon arc lamp contains UV light at an intensity insufficient for robust activation of <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic>-positive taste neurons. To test this possibility, the fly labellum was illuminated with 470 nm blue light at 10 s durations at doses that were sequentially increased from 33 to 186 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and action potentials were registered from <italic>TrpA1</italic>-positive i-a bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The serial pulses of illumination elicited spikings above the intensity of 63 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> in a <italic>TrpA1</italic>–dependent manner, indicating that blue light contributes to polychromatic TRPA1(A) activation in assistance of UV. In contrast, 30 sec-long illumination with green light (540 nm) rarely evoked spikings, even at a high intensity (362 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), demarcating the wavelengths capable of sufficient photochemical production of free radicals. Taken together, nucleophile sensitivity enables TRPA1(A) to detect natural solar radiation, and thus suppress feeding behavior in flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>UV responses of TRPA1(A) are repressed by either nucleophile or electrophile scavengers, indicating that amphiphilic free radicals are critical for light-induced TRPA1 activation</title><p>To corroborate the role of free radicals in light-induced TRPA1(A) activation, we investigated whether UV-induced TRPA1 activation could be hindered by quenching either nucleophilicity or electrophilicity, as radicals are amphiphilic. Since electrophiles react with nucleophiles, electrophilic NMM and benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) were used as nucleophile scavengers, while the nucleophiles DTT and BTC were used as electrophile scavengers (BTC and BITC are isosteric but opposite in chemical reactivity).

Therefore, the effect of the nucleophile scavenger NMM on free radical-induced TRPA1(A) activation was tested in heterologous frog oocytes. Addition of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and ammonium persulfate (APS) initiates polymerization reactions, such as solidification of polyacrylamide gel, by generating free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shirangi et al., 2015</xref>). To examine the responsiveness of TRPA1(A) to free radicals, frog oocytes expressing agTRPA1(A) were exposed to a mixture of 0.01 mM TEMED and 0.1 mM APS. APS alone activated agTPRA1(A) but not agTRPA1(B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>), as persulfates, like peroxides, are also nucleophilic due to the alpha effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edwards and Pearson, 1962</xref>). To evaluate the net effect of radicals produced by the joint application of TEMED and APS, the cells were serially challenged in the order of 0.01 mM TEMED, 0.1 mM APS, and the TEMED and APS mixture (0.01 and 0.1 mM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, Left). Beginning thirty minutes after mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>), the APS/TEMED mixture activated agTRPA1(A) more robustly than did APS or TEMED alone. The 30 min latency in efficacy of the mixture is reminiscent of the incubation time necessary for solidification of a typical polyacrylamide gel after addition of APS/TEMED. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of APS/TEMED co-incubation was abolished by adding nucleophile-scavenging NMM at 0.01 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). To test if NMM suppresses the action of each chemical component, either APS or TEMED was mixed with NMM for 1 hr and then applied to agTRPA1(A)-expressing cells. These experiments resulted in increases rather than decreases in the agTRPA1(A) current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), possibly reflecting the typical role of NMM as an electrophilic agonist of TRPA1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that free radicals produced by incubation of APS and TEMED activate agTRPA1(A), which is readily antagonized by nucleophile-scavenging NMM. Thus, the nucleophilic nature of amphiphilic free radicals is critical for activation of TRPA1(A), providing the mechanistic basis of light-induced feeding deterrence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well documented that insect phytophagy is increased when UVB light is filtered out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bothwell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rousseaux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zavala et al., 2001</xref>). The effect of UVB illumination can result from changes in plant physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhlmann, 2009</xref>) or direct detection by insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazza et al., 1999</xref>). We discovered that UV and visible light activate TRPA1(A) via a photochemical reaction that generates free radicals, thus inhibiting food ingestion by fruit flies. TRPA1(A)-expressing taste neurons appear to be responsible for feeding deterrence as light receptor cells, on the basis of three lines of evidence. First, TRPA1(A)-expressing neurons fire robustly in response to UV illumination. Second, misexpression and heterologous expression of TRPA1(A) confer light sensitivity to cells, suggesting that TRPA1(A) expression is sufficient for light responsiveness. Third, expression of a dominant negative mutant TRPA1(A) in bitter-sensing cells via <italic>Gr66a-Gal4</italic> eliminates light sensitivity, as assessed by feeding suppression as well as electrophysiological recordings. Because many insect genomes contain exons encoding TRPA1(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), it would be interesting to further investigate whether TRPA1(A) expression is responsible for light sensitivity in other insects. The high responsiveness of agTRPA1(A) observed in this study implies that TRPA1(A)-dependent light detection might be a general function in insects.</p><p>Our analyses of light irradiance required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> feeding deterrence revealed that feeding inhibition can readily occur in response not only to UV but also to strong white light, which is likely capable of inducing nucleophilic radicals in the intracellular environment. It is conceivable that the balance between attraction by the visual system and repulsion by <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent light sensors shapes overall behavioral outcomes in natural settings under illumination with polychromatic light and that strong solar irradiation, which produces a sufficient amount of free radicals for TRPA1(A) activation, shifts the net behavioral outcomes towards repulsion. Light-induced feeding suppression is expected to occur in the middle of the day when insects are exposed to intense solar illumination. Indeed, the biting rhythm of mosquitoes is mostly out of the day time when solar irradiance is at its strongest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pates and Curtis, 2005</xref>). In order to avoid harmful stimuli, animals need to overcome their urge to attractive stimuli, such as food. Feeding suppression may be a requisite for migration to shaded places, which suggests that flies may exhibit a negative phototaxis driven by light-induced TRPA1(A) activation.</p><p>Photochemical reactions underlie rhodopsin-mediated visual mechanisms, where photon-dependent actuation of retinal covalently bound to opsin triggers a biochemical signaling cascade and an electric potential shift in the photoreceptor. We found that UV and high energy visible light, which induces photochemical generation of free radicals in the biological tissues, can be sensed without the need of a cofactor like retinal, because the basic and shared property of the radicals, such as nucleophilicity, is sensed by TRPA1(A)s. Detecting electrophilicity of reactive chemicals has been regarded as the key feature of the molecular chemical nociceptor TRPA1 in bilaterian animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>), probably because of evolution of bilaterians in oxygen-rich surroundings. Because strong nucleophilicity is short-lived in the oxidative environment on Earth, animals may not have had much opportunity to adapt to the need of nucleophile detection. However, small organisms could have been under greater evolutionary pressure to develop a sensitive nucleophile-sensing mechanism. Their small size likely predisposes such organisms to be vulnerable to the effects of photochemically active light because of their high surface area-to-volume ratios, which translates into more incoming UV toxicity for a given disintoxicating capacity. The solar energy embedded in the form of light induces nucleophilicity in the cytosol while passing through the oxidizing atmosphere. We found that insects can respond to photochemically induced nucleophilicity with TRPA1(A) for sensitive and rapid detection of solar illumination. The domain for reception of nucleophilicity appears to reside in the cytoplasmic side of TRPA1(A), as the conserved residues in the cytosolic N-terminus are required for this function. Presumably, free radicals induced by photochemical reactions in the cytoplasm may remain nucleophilic longer than those in the extracellular oxidative environment due to the reducing environment within the cell. However, a receptor with a high level of nucleophile responsiveness would not well operate in this context. The cytosol is filled with reducing nucleophiles essential for redox homeostasis, which would keep the putative nucleophile receptor open and collapse the transmembrane cation gradients. Capable of synergy between the two opposing activation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and tuned to conduct a limited nucleophile-dependent current, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) is able to detect light-generated amphiphilic radicals without much disturbance from the cytosolic reducing power.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the TRPA1(A) activation mechanism in response to solar UV irradiation.</title><p>Solar irradiation inflict both electrophilicity and nucleophilicity in the cytosol.

In general, nucleophiles carrying extra electrons are able to form stable coordinate bonds with metal ions. Strong nucleophiles such as carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide anions (CN<sup>-</sup>) mainly exert their fatal toxicity by masking Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which is essential for the function of heme proteins such as hemoglobins and cytochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GRUT, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krahl and Clowes, 1940</xref>). Thus, the differential nucleophile responsiveness between TRPA1(A)s may reflect the varying needs for avoidance due to divergent susceptibility of insects to these toxic compounds as well as strong solar irradiation. In addition, plants produce a wide variety of nucleophilic antioxidants such as phenolics, carotenoids and thiol compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pandey and Rizvi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lü et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests that nucleophile sensitivity may represent the ecological relationship of an insect species with plants. While being nectarivorous, hematophagous mosquitoes are apparently less dependent on plants for reproduction than are phytosaprophagous fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Markow and O’Grady, 2008</xref>). It is also plausible that mosquitoes are equipped with a heightened nucleophile detection mechanism in order to avoid dead animals when searching for a fresh blood meal, as decomposing animal carcasses emit nucleophilic gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dent et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the feeding niches of the species seem to be correlated with the nucleophile sensitivities of TRPA1(A)s, although it has yet to be investigated if elevated <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent nucleophile sensitivity invariably accompanies hematophagy in other insect species. Conversely, the residual nucleophile sensitivity of fly TRPA1(A) implies that the ability to detect free radical-producing light is critical to the animal, as the nucleophile responsiveness of TRPA1(A) has been evolutionarily preserved, despite the close association of <italic>Drosophila</italic> with plants, ever since the nucleophile sensitivity evolved in a putative common ancestor of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic>.</p><p>TRPA1(B) has been widely used as a thermogenetic tool to remotely control neurons of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>), and can respond to IR, which elevates the temperature of irradiated tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, TRPA1(A) not only lacks thermal sensitivity for its devotion to a chemosensory role, but also detects photochemically active light such as UV light through its nucleophile sensitivity to radicals. Thus, the isoform divergence of insect TRPA1 extends its ability to perceive solar electromagnetic radiation to UV and IR, the two spectra flanking visible light. As TRPA1(A) independently serves as a UV/light sensor in nonnative cells and TRP channels show much larger single channel conductance than does channelrhodopsin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>), TRPA1(A) would make an excellent optogenetic actuator that can be directly stimulated by UV light without the need for additional other proteins or chemical cofactors. Although UV radiation may be toxic to the illuminated neurons, TRPA1(A) requires a reasonable light intensity (&lt;5.2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>: ~4% of SC and 85% of total ground UV intensity) for substantial neuronal excitation compared to the blue light intensities (2,000 to 7,500 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>: 1,400 to 5,400% of SC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cardin et al., 2010</xref>) used in typical optogenetic applications. Aside from the thermal stress that likely results from intense illumination, blue light irradiation used for excitation of channelrhodopsin-2 also generates free radicals in cells at intensities as low as 2.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Godley et al., 2005</xref>) through ubiquitous and indispensable cellular compounds such as flavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichler et al., 2005</xref>), and prolonged illumination with blue light can result in organismal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hori et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the use of TRPA1(A) in combination with low-density UV illumination might be beneficial in that TRPA1(A) may be sufficiently robust coupled with very weak but specific transcriptional promoters given its large single channel conductance. In conclusion, the nucleophile sensitivity of TRPA1(A) not only aids insects in properly responding to solar irradiation and toxic nucleophiles, but also may potentially be used to develop a superior optogenetic tool for neural circuitry studies in various model systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The <italic>UAS-TrpA1(A)</italic> and <italic>UAS-TrpA1(B)</italic> transgenic lines and <italic>TrpA1</italic><sup><italic>ins</italic> </sup>were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenzweig et al., 2008</xref>).

Briefly, bristles were identified based on the previously described sensillum map of the labellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanimura et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>TrpA1</italic>-dependent response to NMM was observed in most i-bristles as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Tricholine citrate (TCC) at 30 mM was used as an electrolyte in the glass recording electrodes. Chemicals were solubilized in the electrolyte solution, and then applied to taste neurons. Spiking frequencies to chemicals were calculated for entire recordings except for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> recording in L bristles, for which spiking frequencies were calcuclated from the first 10 s. Spike amplitudes from <italic>Gr5a</italic> cells expressing <italic>TrpA1(A)</italic> often gradually decreased to 0 mV within 20 s probably due to exhaustion of robustly firing cells. For the first 20 s of UV response recordings, the basal activity of neurons in the bristle was monitored, after which time UV illumination was administered to the sensilla for 20 s using optical fiber-coupled UV LEDs (FCS-0295–000, Mightex, CA, and UVTOP295, Qphotonics, MI, USA for UVB at 295 nm and M365FP1, Thorlabs, USA for UVA at 365 nm) controlled by an SLA-series two-channel LED driver (SLA-0100–2, Mightex) and a T-Cube LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlab, USA), respectively. The maximal optical fiber output of 295 nm UV was 0.063 mWusing a ball-lens type LED and that of 365 nm UV was 0.3 mW. These net power outputs at the tip of the optical fiber were measured with a photodiode sensor (S120VC, Thorlabs, NJ, USA) connected to a digital console (PM100D, Thorlabs, NJ, USA). Illumination intensity was calculated by considering the size of illuminated area derived from the numerical aperture (NA) values of the optical fibers and the distance to the samples. Due to the complex shape of fly taste bristles on the labellum and various illumination angles between the light beam and tissue, we simplified the calculation by postulating a 45° angle and oval illumination area at a distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). For oocytes, circular areas were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Blue and green light illumination was accomplished using a GFP or RFP excitation filter (470 or 540 nm with a bandpath of 50, respectively) equipped with a typical fluorescence microscope. The UV filter for experiments with white light consisted of glass deposited with nanolayers of titanium dioxide (custom-made, Seoul Precision Optics, Seoul, Korea). Flies prepared for sensillum recording in response to light were used once to record from a single bristle, in order to test only naïve cells. The reference electrode containing hemolymph-like solution 3.1 (HL3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2009</xref>) was inserted close to the labella taste neuron cell bodies from the back of the fly thorax, which held the proboscis in an extended configuration in order to minimize electrical noise stemming from movement of the live animal. Tasteprobe (Syntech, Netherlands) was used as a preamplifier to register the action potentials from the neurons, which were digitized with Powerlab (ADI instruments, Australia). The obtained spiking frequencies were analyzed by Labchart (ADI instruments, Australia). Non-responding bristles were re-tested with other agonists that activate the same neurons as indicated in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Capillary feeder assays</title><p>To quantitatively evaluate the impact of UV irradiation and chemicals on feeding deterrence, the capillary feeder (Café) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ja et al., 2007</xref>) was used with minor modifications. In particular, feeding avoidance upon UV illumination was determined using two sibling populations of 16 hr starved flies. One population, consisting of a vial containing 20–23 flies 2–3 days of age was illuminated with 312 nm UV light with a UV lamp (NB-UVB 311–313 nm, ATObeam, Goyang, Korea; UVB lamp, PL-S 9 W/01, Phillips, Netherlands), 365 nm UV light (LF-204.LS UVlite ultraviolet lamps, UVITEC, Cambridge, UK), or with white light from a DG4 Xenon arc lamp (Sutter, CA, USA) at a distance of 2.5 cm from the standing vial, while the other group, which had a similar number of flies, was allowed to feed freely and was left untreated at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Irradiance was measured as ~1.8, 4, and 57.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>for UVA, UVB, and white light, respectively, using an excised piece of a vial covering the photodiode probe (S120VC, Thorlabs, NJ, USA) to simulate internal irradiation. The vials were made of polypropylene, which has a low rate of UV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kruenate et al., 2004</xref>), resulting in increased internal temperature, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. To minimize thermal accumulation, the UV-illuminated vial was actively cooled by fan-driven air flow while the internal temperature of a separately illuminated vial was concurrently monitored. After each feeding session, the change in the level of the menisci of 30 mM sucrose solutions in three calibrated glass capillary tubes (#2920107, Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany, 15 mm/μl) was measured. Following measurement of the evaporated volume obtained from vials without flies, the distance readings were converted to volume measurements. The ingested volume per animal was then used to calculate an 'avoidance index' by dividing [ingested volume per fly in the sucrose-only vial minus ingested volume per fly in the UV-plus-sucrose vial] by the sum of ingestion volume per fly in either vial. For the Café assay for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, two capillaries containing the same solution were inserted into a vial together with two other capillaries with other tastants. The use of multiple capillaries for a single tastant mixture suppresses experimental variation, presumably owing to higher exposure of flies to tastants and an averaging effect between feeding amounts in separate tubes. To obtain an avoidance index, the volume of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+sucrose consumption was subtracted from the volume of sucrose-only consumption, the result of which was in turn divided by total ingested volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Proboscis extension reflex assay</title><p>The proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay was performed with modifications as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2012</xref>).

Flies that had been starved overnight were glued to glass slides, water-satiated, and illuminated with 254 nm UV light at an intensity of 0.28 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>(LF-204.LS UVlite ultraviolet lamps, UVITEC Cambridge, UK) for 2 min, during which time PER frequency was scored. When a fly fully extended its proboscis 10 times or more, a maximum score of one was given. The PER score of a fly that extended its proboscis fewer than 10 times was calculated by dividing the number of proboscis extensions by 10. For IR-evoked PER, IR from a radiant heater (940 watt, JD07010-1002, iSolar, Inchon, Korea) was administered at a distance of 20 cm from the fly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>UV attraction behavior</title><p>UVA radiation at 365 nm was administered for 20 s from the bottom side of a horizontally placed vial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>) that contained 3–4-day-old adult flies.

Briefly, ovaries were surgically prepared and subjected to digestion with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase for 1.5 hr. Subsequently, the follicular layer of the oocytes was manually removed. One day after microinjection of 50 nl of <italic>TrpA1</italic> cRNA, oocytes were electrophysiologically examined while perfused with the recording solution (96 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6). For UV illumination, the optical fiber terminal was mounted above the cell at a minimal distance to achieve the highest possible intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (HP1002, GeorgiaChem, GA, USA) and DTT (43819 Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) solutions were freshly prepared before use. For UV experiments, the initial voltage was −60 mV, and it was then changed in periods of 300 ms from −60 to +60 mV per second. For H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and DTT responses, the voltage was held constant at −60 mV during recording. The current was amplified with a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and registered by a digitizer (Digidata 1440 A, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Data from dose-dependence experiments were normalized with respect to 0.1 mM NMM currents recorded from the same cells, and fitted to the Hill equation using Sigmaplot12.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Inside-out macropatch recordings</title><p>Patch-clamp recordings were carried out in an inside-out configuration using macropatches excised from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing TRPA1.

All current recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (Hilgenberg-GmbH, Germany) using a Narishige puller (PC-10, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). The patch pipettes had a resistance of 3 ~ 5 M when filled with pipette solution containing 130 mM NaOH, 3 mM HEPES, and 0.5 mM Na-EDTA adjusted to pH 7.6 with HCl.

An oocyte was shrunk in a hypertonic solution and the vitelline membrane was removed with forceps to access the plasma membrane. All recordings were carried out at room temperature. The currents from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were studied by holding the potential at 0 mV and ramped from -100 to +100 mV for 500 ms and then returned to 0 mV.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Leslie C Griffith (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and another is Simon Sprecher (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides very clear and detailed evidence that the (A) isoform of insect TrpA1 detects uv-generated nucleophiles at normal light levels. The channel data are nicely buttressed by behavioral studies showing uv-induced feeding suppression in insects. While the study uses uv light as its main manipulation, the results show that this isoform of TrpA1 can act as a general nucleophile detector. This is an important advance since, in contrast to electrophiles, little is known about how animals avoid the toxic effects of nucleophiles.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are, however, a couple issues lingering from review that the authors should deal with. The main issue can be dealt with in Discussion. The technical issues are ones that require clarification rather than new experiments and addition of control data that have likely already been collected.</p><p>1) They authors should address the biological relevance of nucleophile sensitivity in both the Introduction and Discussion. Under what conditions might light-mediated feeding suppression actually occur? Do <italic>Drosophila</italic> (and other insects) really use TRPA1-expressing neurons as light-sensors to control feeding behaviors? While it is beyond the scope to do more experiments, providing a rationale as to why behaviors might require this aspect of dTrpA1 function would be useful to the reader.</p><p>2) The writing and flow of the paper must be improved. The manuscript is very dense and quite difficult to follow, and we strongly encourage a careful look at (and possibly thorough pruning of) the presentation and description of the results. It was frustrating to have to jump repeatedly between main and supplemental figures, which often contained different subsets of results from the same experiment. The logical links between passages were also quite unclear (for example, what motivated analysis of the mosquito TRPA1?) and the constant shifting between oocyte and in vivo experiments were sometimes confusing. A summary of the chemical properties of all the agonists/antagonists used (DTT, NMM, H2O2, UV etc.) in a brief table might also help navigation of the pharmacological analyses.</p><p>3) The authors need to provide quantitation of some of their major points. Specifically, around the issue of the similarity of rectification and reversal potential mentioned in the subsection “Heterologous expression of TRPA1(A), not TRPA1(B), in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> provides UV-evoked current responses”. To be convincing, there should be a quantitative description of the data. In addition, the inside-out patch data would benefit from at least mention of some controls (e.g. did authors do RR to demonstrate this is not a leak current?).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>There are, however, a couple issues lingering from review that the authors should deal with.

We also included a paragraph that addresses the possible roles of nucleophile sensitivity of insect TRPA1(A)s in terms of ecology and evolution in the Discussion.</p><p>Introduction: “Insects and birds are able to visualize upper-UV wavelengths (above 320 nm) via UV-specific rhodopsins (Salcedo et al. 2003; Ödeen &amp; Håstad 2013). Visual detection of UV in this range by insects generally elicits attraction towards the UV source rather than avoidance (Craig &amp; Bernard 1990; Washington 2010). At the same time, lower UV wavelengths, such as UVB (280-315 nm) at natural intensities, have been known to decrease insect phytophagy (Zavala et al. 2001; Rousseaux et al. 1998) via a direct effect on the animals that does not involve the visual system (Mazza et al. 1999). However, the molecular mechanism of UV-induced feeding deterrence has yet to be unraveled.”</p><p>Discussion: “It is well documented that insect phytophagy is increased when UVB light is filtered out (Bothwell et al. 1994; Rousseaux et al. 1998; Zavala et al. 2001). […] Feeding suppression may be a requisite for migration to shaded places, which suggests that flies may exhibit a negative phototaxis driven by light-induced TRPA1(A) activation.”</p><p>Discussion: “In addition, plants produce a wide variety of nucleophilic antioxidants such as phenolics, carotenoids and thiol compounds (Pandey &amp; Rizvi 2009; Lü et al. 2010), which suggests that nucleophile sensitivity may represent the ecological relationship of an insect species with plants. […] Conversely, the residual nucleophile sensitivity of fly TRPA1(A) implies that the ability to detect free radical-producing light is critical to the animal, as the nucleophile responsiveness of TRPA1(A) has been evolutionarily preserved, despite the close association of <italic>Drosophila</italic> with plants, ever since the nucleophile sensitivity evolved in a putative common ancestor of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic>.”</p><p><italic>2) The writing and flow of the paper must be improved. The manuscript is very dense and quite difficult to follow, and we strongly encourage a careful look at (and possibly thorough pruning of) the presentation and description of the results. It was frustrating to have to jump repeatedly between main and supplemental figures, which often contained different subsets of results from the same experiment. The logical links between passages were also quite unclear (for example, what motivated analysis of the mosquito TRPA1?) and the constant shifting between oocyte and in vivo experiments were sometimes confusing. A summary of the chemical properties of all the agonists/antagonists used (DTT, NMM, H2O2, UV etc.) in a brief table might also help navigation of the pharmacological analyses.</italic> </p><p>For better presentation, we attempted to strengthen the logical links between passages in multiple places. For each agonist we worked with, we provided a more detailed introduction on the properties of the chemical. Regarding mosquito TRPA1, it was included in our study to probe if nucleophile and UV detection by TRPA1(A) is a common function in insects. In the revised manuscript, we make this point clear as follows: “Next, we examined if nucleophile sensing of TRPA1(A) can be a general underlying mechanism for UV detection in insects”.</p><p>Interestingly, the heightened DTT sensitivity of agTRPA1(A) is well correlated with the enhanced ability of the channel to sense UV and H2O2 (correlation of gain-of-function). This observation provides strong support for the conclusion that nucleophile sensitivity underlies light detection by TRPA1(A), in addition to the loss-of-function correlation found with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPA1(A) mutants. Besides, robust nucleophile-dependent activation of agTRPA1(A) in oocytes enabled us to present more convincing evidence that the channel is a nucleophile receptor, with APS/TEMED used for radical responsiveness as well as other agonists such as BTC and imidazole. Finally, natural variation in nucleophile sensitivity between TRPA1(A)s from fruit flies and mosquitoes offers interesting grounds for speculation into the ecological significance of nucleophile detection, which is now included in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p>We split <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2. The introductory panels for the feeding assay in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> have been moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to eliminate the need to flip from the main to the supplementary figures. Although we considered rearranging other figures, we found that it was difficult to squeeze more figure panels in to the main figures in some cases and that other supplementary figures are better off as they are for the flow and presentation of the story.</p><p>As suggested by reviewers, a table is now included as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> that summarizes the response profile of all TRPA1s to various stimuli.</p><p><italic>3) The authors need to provide quantitation of some of their major points. Specifically, around the issue of the similarity of rectification and reversal potential mentioned in the subsection “Heterologous expression of TRPA1(A), not TRPA1(B), in Xenopus oocytes provides UV-evoked current responses”. To be convincing, there should be a quantitative description of the data. In addition, the inside-out patch data would benefit from at least mention of some controls (e.g. did authors do RR to demonstrate this is not a leak current?).</italic> </p><p>We inserted the quantified data for reversal potentials registered for our oocyte recordings in the main text. Regarding quantitation of outward rectification, the ratio between conductances at two extreme voltages, 60 and -60 mV, was calculated as a rule-of-thumb analysis of rectification (subsection “Heterologous expression of TRPA1(A), not TRPA1(B), in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> provides UV-evoked current responses”).</p><p>To test the possibility of non-specific leak current induction by UV irradiation, prolonged UV illumination (up to 350 seconds, vs. 60 seconds for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) was applied to TRPA1(B)-expressing membranes, and we did not observe any current increases (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). To indicate this point, we state: “To exclude the possibility of leak current induced by UV illumination, we recorded from TRPA1(B)-containing membranes over extended periods of time (up to 350 seconds) and did not observe a significant increase in current.”<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18425.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Membrane macropatches from cells expressing TRPA1(B) isoforms fail to show current responses to prolonged UV illumination.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18425.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18425.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18425-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
