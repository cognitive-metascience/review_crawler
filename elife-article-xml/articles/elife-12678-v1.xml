However, too wide or too narrow generalization is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous research suggests that interactions between the dopaminergic system and the hippocampus may play a role in generalization, but whether and how the degree of generalization can be modulated via these pathways is currently unknown. Here, we addressed this question in humans using pharmacology, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling. Blocking dopamine D2-receptors (D2R) altered generalization behavior as revealed by an increased kurtosis of the generalization gradient, and a decreased width of model-derived generalization parameters. Moreover, D2R-blockade modulated similarity-based responses in the hippocampus and decreased midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, which in turn correlated with individual differences in generalization. These results suggest that dopaminergic activity in the hippocampus may relate to the degree of generalization and highlight a potential target for treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12678.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12678.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12678.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the 1920s, two psychologists taught a young child known as ‘Little Albert’ to fear a white rat. They did so by striking a metal bar with a hammer whenever the rat was present. After experiencing the rat and noise together on multiple occasions, Little Albert eventually began to cry whenever the rat appeared. However, he also showed a similar response to a number of other white furry objects, including a rabbit and even a fur coat. By applying knowledge about a familiar object to other similar stimuli, humans and other animals avoid having to learn about each and every stimulus from scratch. However, this stimulus generalization is only effective if it occurs to the correct degree: under- or over-generalization (as shown by Little Albert) can lead to behaviors that are less than optimal.</p><p>Nerve cells use molecules called neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. For example, one nerve cell might release a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which can be detected on the surface of another nerve cell by a protein called the dopamine D2 receptor. Research suggests that dopamine is involved in stimulus generalization in rat and pigeons, but the effects of dopamine have not been studied in humans. Kahnt and Tobler have now explored how the degree of stimulus generalization is determined in human adults.</p><p>For the experiments, volunteers viewed images that contained sets of parallel lines, while lying inside a “functional MRI” brain scanner. The volunteers learned to associate lines with a particular orientation (e.g. 39° from vertical) with receiving a reward, and lines with another specific orientation with the absence of a reward. The next day, half the volunteers were given a drug that blocks the dopamine D2 receptor, while the other half received a placebo. All volunteers were then asked to classify lines of different orientations as either “rewarded” or “non-rewarded”.</p><p>Both groups classified lines that were aligned similarly to the previously rewarded orientation as also rewarded. However, those given the D2 receptor blocker classified a narrower range of line orientations as rewarded than those who received the placebo. In other words, blocking the D2 receptors reduced stimulus generalization. It also reduced activity in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, and the extent to which this activity was connected to activity in another area called the midbrain.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that activation of dopamine D2 receptors in the hippocampus may determine the extent to which we generalize between stimuli. Given that over- and under-generalization is a feature of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, manipulating D2 receptor activity could have therapeutic benefits in these patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12678.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12678.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P1_128574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobler</surname><given-names>Philippe N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P1_150739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobler</surname><given-names>Philippe N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_141965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobler</surname><given-names>Philippe N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of dopamine D2 receptors reduces generalization between stimuli, possibly by reducing interactions between the hippocampus and midbrain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Generalization enables neural systems to apply stimulus-outcome associations that have been acquired for one particular stimulus to other, related stimuli. A key aspect of generalization is the degree to which learned associations are applied to novel stimuli: the width of generalization. Generalization relieves individuals from having to learn outcome predictions for every single stimulus from scratch before using them to guide behavior. However, generalizing too widely can be maladaptive because it leads to the indiscriminate approach (or avoidance) of stimuli that are unlikely to be associated with reward (or punishment). Indeed, aberrant generalization is implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunsmoor and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotlib and Joormann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lissek et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lucantonio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moustafa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shohamy et al., 2010</xref>). Insights into the neurobiological mechanisms controlling the width of generalization are therefore important for understanding adaptive behavior and its disruption in these conditions.</p><p>Two basic forms of generalization can be distinguished based on what constitutes the relation among stimuli; <italic>associative</italic> and <italic>stimulus</italic> generalization. In the case of associative generalization, such as transitive inference and acquired equivalence, the associative relationship among stimuli determines similarity. This relationship can be established for example by sensory preconditioning (e.g., train stimuli A-B and B-C, test whether A comes to predict C) or by a common associate (e.g. train A-C and B-C, test whether A and B are associated). In contrast, in stimulus generalization the relationship among stimuli is based on the similarity along one or more perceptual dimensions (frequency of sounds, color, line orientation, etc.). Most of what we know about stimulus generalization comes from behavioral experiments utilizing intradimensional stimulus discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dunsmoor and LaBar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guttman and Kalish, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanson, 1959</xref>). In these paradigms, one stimulus (e.g. one particular line orientation) is paired with reward (rewarded conditioned stimulus, CS+), while a second stimulus (e.g. a slightly different line orientation), which differs from the first in only one dimension, is paired with no reward (unrewarded conditioned stimulus, CS−). Generalization is then tested using a range of stimuli that vary along the defining stimulus dimension (e.g. line orientation). Although the test stimuli have never been paired with reward, animals and humans show robust generalization in that they respond to test stimuli that are similar to the CS+. Several psychological models have been developed based on these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearce, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shepard, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLaren et al., 2012</xref>), but the neurobiological mechanisms regulating the width of stimulus generalization have remained unknown.</p><p>Early research suggested a role for dopamine in mediating generalization by demonstrating that blockade of dopamine receptors during generalization tests alters response gradients in rats and pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyons et al., 1973a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terrace, 1963</xref>). While the effects of dopamine have not been investigated in humans, evidence from neuroimaging suggests that dopaminoceptive and dopaminergic regions such as the striatum and the midbrain are involved in generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</xref>). However, because standard neuroimaging relies on indirect measurements of neural responses, these studies were unable to inform questions about neurotransmitter-specific activity.</p><p>A candidate brain region for a prominent role in stimulus generalization is the hippocampus, based on its involvement in learning, memory, and associative generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickerson and Delgado, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumaran, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norman and O'Reilly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squire and Wixted, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the hippocampus is thought to contribute to associative generalization by representing higher-order relationships among different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eichenbaum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</xref>). However, human imaging and animal lesion studies suggest that the hippocampus may also be involved in similarity-based stimulus generalization not requiring inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casasola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lissek et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solomon and Moore, 1975</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we directly examined the role of dopamine and hippocampal processing in regulating the width of stimulus generalization. For this purpose, we combined a visual intradimensional discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>) with pharmacologic dopamine D2-receptor (D2R) blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kahnt et al., 2015</xref>) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our central hypothesis was that dopamine is involved in regulating the width of stimulus generalization via the modulation of similarity-based processing in the hippocampus. In order to test this hypothesis, we fit a computational model of stimulus generalization to the behavioral data, and examined the model parameters regulating the width of generalization. We then used model-based fMRI and functional connectivity analyses to identify the brain processes that potentially mediate the effects of dopamine on generalization. We predicted that D2R blockade during the test session would reduce the computational parameters governing the width of generalization, and thus lead to narrower generalization gradients. Moreover, we hypothesized that this reduction would be mirrored in hippocampal activity as well as in reduced functional coupling between the dopaminergic midbrain and the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The experiment was carried out on two consecutive days. On the first day, subjects underwent intradimensional discrimination training to learn stimulus-specific reward associations. On the second day, a generalization test was performed in extinction. All subjects received placebo on the first day, whereas on day two, one group received placebo (PP group) and the other group received 400 mg of the D2R blocker amisulpride (PA group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By verifying that the two groups learned equally well on day one, we ensured that any observed group differences in behavioral or neural responses during day two resulted from effects of dopamine on generalization at retrieval, independent of encoding-related effects. In the following sections we first describe the behavioral data during the training, and then examine how D2R blockade affected the neurocomputational mechanisms governing generalization using fMRI and a model of stimulus generalization.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12678.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subjects were pseudo-randomly assigned into a placebo-placebo (PP) or placebo-amisulpride (PA) group.

The association between orientation and reward was counterbalanced across subjects. In order to track the acquisition of stimulus-outcome associations, subjects were asked to make a discriminatory response after the stimulus was displayed, but before the outcome was shown. Subjects had to indicate whether the current stimulus was the rewarded stimulus, the non-rewarded stimulus, or whether they were unsure, by pressing buttons associated with +, -, or x, respectively. Subjects learned the discrimination within the first 50 trials and performed at high levels afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

One hour later, subjects performed a generalization test session in extinction (without feedback). Specifically, on each trial, one of 15 orientations (17°–73°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was presented, and subjects performed the same discrimination as during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; the original CS+ and CS− orientations were not shown during the test).

However, visual inspection of the gradients suggested that the amisulpride group had a narrower gradient than the placebo group, with enhanced responding at the peak of the curve, reduced responding at both flanks, and enhanced responding at the tail of the curve. These shape features are parsimoniously described by the 4th moment of probability distributions, namely, their kurtosis. Accordingly, a test for differences in the kurtosis of group-specific distributions (Pearson type VII distribution, see Materials and methods) revealed a significantly greater kurtosis in the amisulpride group compared to placebo (PA: 6.73, PP: 3.29; permutation test, P = 0.043). This finding demonstrates that amisulpride narrowed the width and increased the peak of the behavioral generalization gradient, and suggests that D2R activity alters the neurocomputational processes that mechanistically control generalization behavior.</p><p>To further address this possibility, and to identify the specific computational parameters that are affected by D2R blockade, we utilized a mathematical model for similarity-based stimulus generalization (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The model assumes that the reward prediction of a given stimulus reflects the integrated excitatory and inhibitory associations of that stimulus, plus the excitatory and inhibitory associations of stimuli that are similar to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearce, 1987</xref>). Critically, associations of stimuli that are similar to the currently presented stimulus have a stronger contribution than the associations of dissimilar stimuli. Because the shape of the function determining the similarity between the currently presented stimulus and other stimuli (i.e. the generalization coefficient) is of critical importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</xref>), we directly compared the most commonly used models, i.e. one with Gaussian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>) and the other with exponential similarity functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shepard, 1987</xref>). While the exact shape of the similarity functions differs between models, for both models, the extent to which inhibitory and excitatory associations generalize to the current stimulus is controlled by the width of the similarity functions (<italic>s<sub>i </sub></italic>and <italic>s<sub>e</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The larger <italic>s<sub>i </sub></italic>and <italic>s<sub>e</sub></italic>, the stronger the impact of the inhibitory and excitatory associations of dissimilar stimuli on the currently predicted reward, respectively, and thus the more generalization takes place.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12678.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A computational model of similarity-based generalization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the model.

Visual inspections suggested that the model with the Gaussian similarity function fitted the behavioral data better than the model with the exponential similarity function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was confirmed by a formal model comparison using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Gaussian: AIC = 9586.4, BIC = 9629.2; Exponential: AIC = 9691.6, BIC = 9734.4). We also compared the fit of the two models by comparing the regression coefficients from a logistic regression of the trial-by-trial responses on the modeled P(+) responses. Although both models predicted behavioral responses reliably (Gaussian: t = 11.06, P &lt; 0.001; exponential: t = 11.38, P &lt; 0.001), we found significantly higher regression coefficients for the Gaussian model (paired t-test t = 5.34, P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, this demonstrates that in our experiment, a Gaussian similarity function fits behavior better than an exponential similarity function.</p><p>To determine the effects of dopamine on generalization, in a next step, the free parameters of the Gaussian model were estimated separately for each group (see Materials and methods). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the model (with group-specific parameters) accurately reproduced responses in both groups, including the differences in the shape of the generalization gradients. Logistic regression coefficients were significantly different from zero (PA: t = 7.76, P &lt; 0.001; PP: t = 7.95, P &lt; 0.001), and did not differ between groups (t = -0.21, P = 0.84), suggesting that responses in both groups were well described by the model. Notably, comparing the model parameters between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), revealed significant group differences in the width of the excitatory generalization coefficient, with a smaller coefficient in the amisulpride group compared to the placebo group (permutation test, P = 0.035). The width of the inhibitory coefficient was also smaller in the amisulpride group, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.069). Importantly, the learning rate during test did not differ between groups (P = 0.21), demonstrating that additional learning during the test session, which might have been altered by amisulpride, cannot account for the differences in generalization gradients. In order to obtain individual estimates of model parameters, we re-estimated the model using a leave-one-out procedure (see Materials and methods). Comparing the resulting individual estimates between groups confirmed a significant difference in the width of the excitatory (two-sample t-test, t = -2.03, P = 0.024), and to a lesser degree, the inhibitory generalization coefficient (t = -1.59, P = 0.059, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

As a proxy of generalized value, we focused on prediction error responses derived from our model, which reflect the extent to which reward predictions have generalized from the original CS+ and CS− to the current stimulus (please note that because no outcomes were shown, prediction errors are perfectly but negatively correlated with expected value). Accordingly, to identify brain regions involved in similarity-based computations during generalization, we searched for regions in which fMRI activity correlated with generalized prediction errors at the time of the expected outcome.

In line with this prediction, a functional connectivity analysis with the midbrain as a seed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, see Materials and methods) revealed decreased midbrain connectivity in the right hippocampus (x = 33, y = -19, z = -19, t = 3.68, P = 0.02, FWE small volume corrected, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>) and the left striatum (x = -9, y = 8, z = -19, t = 4.26, P = 0.001, FWE small volume corrected), in the amisulpride compared to the placebo group.

Interestingly, this relationship was not observed for midbrain-striatal connections (P &gt; 0.16), and was significantly stronger for midbrain-hippocampal compared to midbrain-striatal connectivity (Z = 2.31, P = 0.011), suggesting that the relation between dopamine and the width of generalization may arise primarily from midbrain-hippocampal connections.

Here, using D2R pharmacology, fMRI, and computational modeling, we demonstrate that D2R blockade results in narrower behavioral generalization gradients and changes in the computational parameters controlling the width of generalization. Moreover, D2R blockade altered similarity-based processing in the hippocampus and decreased the functional coupling between the midbrain and the hippocampus. This coupling was in turn related to the computational parameter controlling the width of generalization.</p><p>Previous empirical and modeling work suggests that the hippocampus contributes to generalization by detecting the relationship between items in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eichenbaum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</xref>). However, this function was thought to only apply to associative forms of generalization involving higher-order relationships, whereas basic stimulus generalization involving perceptual similarity is suggested to be hippocampus-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumaran, 2012</xref>). Opposing this view, here we provide evidence that the hippocampus is involved in stimulus generalization. Accordingly, our findings suggest that hippocampal similarity computations are not restricted to detecting higher-order relationships among stimuli as previously thought, but can also exploit the perceptual similarity between stimuli to establish meaningful relationships. While the hippocampus may not be necessary for stimulus generalization per se, our data suggest that it facilitates generalization by allowing a flexible modulation of its width. Specifically, such flexibility could not be achieved if discrimination and generalization were entirely based on static, hippocampus-independent, stimulus-outcome associations.</p><p>Our results contribute to an ongoing debate regarding the time point at which hippocampal processes support generalization. Two alternative accounts suggest that the relationship among stimuli is established by the hippocampus either during encoding via overlapping neural codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eichenbaum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howard et al., 2005</xref>), or at the time of retrieval by means of recurrent similarity computations that are based on separated neural codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</xref>). The former proposal has received empirical support from studies showing that hippocampal activity during encoding is related to transfer performance at test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</xref>). In contrast, in line with the second account, our model assumes that reward predictions are generalized and integrated during test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearce, 1987</xref>). It should be noted though that this model is mathematically equivalent to a model in which generalization occurs at encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>), and thus, the model alone does not provide evidence for either account. However, only if generalization occurs at retrieval can the width of generalization be modulated after encoding has occurred, and thus, our results are only compatible with a retrieval-based account of generalization. Specifically, because dopamine receptor blockade modulated generalization gradients during test, without affecting additional learning, our pharmacological manipulation provides evidence that stimulus generalization occurs – at least in part – at retrieval.</p><p>Our data suggest that the functional connectivity between the dopaminergic midbrain and the hippocampus is related to the width of generalization. Specifically, we found that participants with D2R blockade showed decreased midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, which in turn correlated with the width of generalization. While the presence of dopamine receptors in the hippocampus is undisputed, it is worth keeping in mind that although direct dopaminergic innervation from the midbrain to the hippocampus is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gasbarri et al., 1994</xref>) and functionally relevant for memory stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNamara et al., 2014</xref>), this pathway is not very strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mingote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swanson, 1982</xref>). Moreover, it is conceivable that some of the hippocampal dopamine is co-released from noradrenergic neurons, in which it may not have been completely metabolized.</p><p>As such, our data is in line with the idea that reduced activity of hippocampal D2R decreases the extent to which reward associations generalize across stimuli. By extension, enhanced dopaminergic activity in the hippocampus may increase the width of generalization. More specifically, dopamine release in the hippocampus could increase the likelihood that ensemble patterns representing similar stimuli are activated, which would effectively lower the threshold for similarity detection, and, by broadening the range of stimuli for which reward predictions are taken into account, facilitate generalization. Conversely, reduced levels of dopamine would decrease the likelihood of ensemble pattern activation, increase the threshold for similarity detection, and, by enhancing fine-tuned discrimination, reduce generalization. This provides a simple neurobiological mechanism by which dopamine may flexibly adjust generalization during retrieval. Such flexibility is highly adaptive as it allows for different levels of generalization based on the state of the organism or the environment. We speculate that tonic dopamine levels, similar to their enabling effects on movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz, 2007</xref>), play an enabling role in generalization. For instance, in situations where dopamine transmission is high, such as in novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ihalainen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisman and Grace, 2005</xref>), elevated levels of dopamine may not only support memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shohamy and Adcock, 2010</xref>), but also broaden generalization and thereby facilitate exploratory behavior.</p><p>Of note, although D2R blockade reduced generalization coefficients for both excitatory and inhibitory associations (albeit less reliably), midbrain-hippocampal connectivity was only correlated with the width of the inhibitory coefficient. This raises the possibility that only the effects of D2R blockade on the inhibitory coefficient are mediated via a modulation of midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, whereas the effects on the excitatory coefficient are mediated via a different, yet to be explored, mechanism. The dissociation between inhibitory and excitatory generalization coefficients is in line with the interpretation of previous results suggesting that administration of chlorpromazine, a nonspecific dopamine receptor antagonist, specifically reduces the strength of inhibitory associations in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyons et al., 1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terrace, 1963</xref>). Moreover, it adds to previous findings indicating that generalization involving appetitive and aversive outcomes may involve different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schechtman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>By revealing the effects of dopamine on generalization, our current results substantially extend those of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the current experiment suggests an association between dopamine and the width of generalization in the hippocampus, and dissociates effects of generalization during retrieval vs. encoding, which could not be achieved with the previous design. However, whereas here we find that prediction errors correlate primarily with activity in the hippocampus, the previous study identified prediction error related activity primarily in the ventral striatum. Also, in the previous study functional connectivity between the striatum and the hippocampus was related to the modeled generalization coefficients, whereas our current results suggest a facilitating role of midbrain-hippocampal connections. Several notable differences in the design of both experiments might explain these discrepancies. Most importantly, the previous design consisted of multiple alternating training and testing blocks, all conducted within one session on a single day, whereas in the current study, training and test did not alternate but were conducted in distinct sessions that were separated by a 24 hr delay. Moreover, in the 2012 study, CS-outcome associations were deterministic (100% contingency), whereas the current experiment involved a 50% reinforcement schedule in order to slow down extinction during test. These differences could have shifted the primary focus of generalization-related processing from the striatum to the hippocampus.</p><p>In conclusion, here we propose a neurobiological mechanism for the control of stimulus generalization, in which midbrain dopamine changes similarity computations in the hippocampus, resulting in altered generalization gradients. As such, our results demonstrate that the width of stimulus generalization is not hard-wired but flexible, and can change under pharmacological interventions. Accordingly, our results have important clinical implications for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders in which generalization is disrupted. Specifically, aberrant generalization is implicated in depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buss and Daniell, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotlib and Joormann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lissek et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shohamy et al., 2010</xref>), and our findings indicate that blocking D2R activity may provide a potential treatment of overgeneralization in these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were assigned to one of three groups in a double-blind and pseudo-random fashion: amisulpride-placebo (AP), placebo-amisulpride (PA), and placebo-placebo (PP). To avoid confounds related to the effects of dopamine on neural processing during discrimination training, only subjects in the PA and PP group are considered in this manuscript. A total of seven subjects was excluded because they either failed to acquire stimulus-outcome associations during the discrimination training on day one (performance &lt;60%, 4 subjects) or because they failed to follow instructions on day two (3 subjects). Subjects in both groups received placebo on the first day of the experiment, whereas on the second day subjects in the PP and PA group received placebo and 400 mg of the D2R blocker amisulpride, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All subjects were healthy and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Groups did not differ significantly in number (PA: N = 25, PP: N=21, chi-square = 0.348, P = 0.56), average age, (PA: 22.72 years ± 2.17 SD, PP: 22.19 years ± 1.83 SD; t = 0.88, P = 0.38), and average weight (PA: 75.04 kg ± 7.89 SD, PP: 75.48 kg ± 10.92 SD; t = -0.03, P = 0.98). Moreover, subjects were not aware of whether they received placebo or amisulpride on both days as assessed by a post experimental questionnaire (day I, chi-square = 0.49, P = 0.48, day II: chi-square = 0.29, P = 0.60). The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Review Board of Zurich, and subjects provided informed consent to participate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design and stimuli</title><p>On the first day, subjects were briefed about the details of the experiment, signed the consent form, and were administered a pill that was swallowed in front of the experimenter. To minimize and equalize absorption time across subjects, subjects were asked to not eat 6 hr before the experiment.</p><p>One hour after taking the pill, subjects entered the MRI scanner to perform an intradimensional discrimination task. During the task, subjects learned the association between oriented Gabor patches (CS+ and CS−) and reward or no reward (0 and 20 cents, respectively). In each trial, subjects were presented with an oriented Gabor patch for 600 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immediately after the stimulus, subjects had to indicate whether the currently displayed stimulus may lead to reward (+) or no reward (-), or whether they did not know (x) by pressing a button with the index, middle, or ring finger of their right hand, corresponding to the signs (+/-/x) on a response mapping screen. The mapping between buttons (fingers) and +/-/x was randomized in each trial to dissociate signals related to motor preparation and execution from reward predictions and prediction errors. When subjects pressed a button, the brightness of the signs on the screen slightly decreased to indicate that a response has been made. The screen disappeared after 1500 ms (maximum decision time) and was replaced by an outcome screen (1000 ms) indicating the amount of money they received (20 or 0 cents). When subjects failed to respond within 1500 ms, “‘too slow”’ was presented instead of the outcome. The CS+ was paired with reward and no reward in 50% of the trials, whereas the CS− was always paired with no reward. The outcome was independent of the correctness of the behavioral response, and the association between stimulus orientation (39° and 51°) and reward was counterbalanced across subjects. The training phase consisted of 100 repetitions of CS+ and CS− trials, in pseudorandom order. Trials were separated by a variable interval ranging from 1.9 to 9.9 s (1.9 s fix, plus a variable interval drawn from an exponential distribution, truncated at 8 s).</p><p>On the second day of the experiment, subjects performed the generalization test in extinction, one hour after taking the pill containing either placebo (PP) or amisulpride (PA). In each trial, subjects saw one of 15 orientations (17°, 21°, 25°, 29°, 33°, 37°,41°, 45°, 49°, 53°, 57°, 61°, 65°, 69°, and 73°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) for 600 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The original CS+ and CS− were not shown during the test. Each orientation was presented 14 times in pseudorandom order resulting in a total of 210 trials. Directly after presentation of the stimulus, subjects had to make the same discrimination response as during training (see above). Importantly, the test was performed in extinction, i.e. no outcomes were shown for all orientations. This design ensured that subjects made motor responses to all stimuli and thus allowed us to observe reward prediction error responses to all orientations independent of potential confounds attributable to reward feedback, different visual stimulation, and different cognitive or motor demands. Trials were separated by a variable interval ranging from 2.9 to 10.9 s (2.9 s fix, plus a variable interval drawn from an exponential distribution, truncated at 8 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Orientation discrimination performance</title><p>In order to control for potential effects of D2R blockade on perceptual performance per se, subjects performed an orientation discrimination task. In each trial, two oriented Gabor patches were presented for 200 ms each, separated by a blank screen of 300 ms. The first stimulus had an orientation of 135° (i.e.orthogonal to the stimuli used in the main experiment), whereas the second stimulus was tilted -4°, -1.9°, -0.9°, -0.4°, -0.2°, 0.2°, 0.4°, 0.9°, 1.9°, or 4° relative to the first stimulus. Thus, the task consisted of 10 trial types, reflecting 5 levels of difficulty (i.e. absolute difference between first and second orientation). Subjects had to indicate as fast and accurately as possible whether the second orientation was tilted counterclockwise or clockwise relative to the first orientation by pressing a button. No feedback was provided to minimize feedback-based perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>). Each trial type was repeated 7 times, resulting in a total of 70 trials. Discrimination performance was computed by averaging accuracy across trials and difficulty levels. The task was administered twice on each day: once immediately after administration of the pill to obtain a baseline measure in the absence of drug effects, and once after the scanning session (2 hr after drug/placebo administration) to measure discrimination performance under the influence of the drug (amisulpride plasma levels have a first peak after ~1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenzweig et al., 2002</xref>)).

Specifically, we randomly assigned all subjects into one of the two groups, estimated a set of parameters for each group, and computed the difference between the estimated model parameters between groups. This was repeated 10,000 times, resulting in a distribution of group-wise parameter differences that should be expected by chance (i.e. if group assignments were random). This random distribution was then used to generate P-values for the empirically observed group-wise parameter differences.</p><p>To obtain an individual difference measure of model parameters, and as an alternative way to perform inference on the model parameters, we used a leave-one-out estimation procedure. For this, we first fitted the model using the data from all but one subject (N-1). The resulting model parameters were then subtracted from the parameters obtained when using all subjects (N). This difference (parameter based on N-1 subjects – parameter based on N subjects) is proportional to the relative contribution of the left-out subject to the entire group. For instance, if the left-out subject has a large “‘true”’ parameter, leaving this subject out when estimating the model will reduce the parameter obtained in the reduced sample (N-1) relative to the parameter obtained from the entire sample (N). In other words, this procedure generates estimates that reflect the individual differences in model parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>Functional imaging was performed on a Philips Achieva 3 T whole-body scanner equipped with an eight-channel head coil.

For each subject, the average time course was extracted from voxels in a 50% probabilistic mask of the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murty et al., 2014</xref>), and together with the six head movement parameters regressed against the time course in each voxel. The parameter estimate of the midbrain-seed regressor reflects the correlation between activity in the midbrain and activity in every other voxel in the brain. To identify regions where connectivity differed depending on D2R blockade, the connectivity maps were compared between groups using a two-sample t test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To identify significant voxels in the fMRI analysis (prediction error during test or training), we used one-sample t-tests and a threshold of P &lt; 0.05, FWE whole brain corrected, in combination with a cluster extent threshold of k&gt;10. To test for group differences, parameter estimates were extracted from significant voxels in the striatum (training) and hippocampus (test), and compared between groups using two-sample t-tests at a statistical threshold of P &lt; 0.05. Significant group differences in functional connectivity were identified using a threshold of P &lt; 0.05, FWE small volume corrected for a functional region of interest in the hippocampus that was identified in the independent prediction error contrast during test in the entire group of subjects (P &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). A priori comparisons using t-tests and correlations with directed hypotheses are tested one-tailed.</p><p>Although amisulpride is generally known to not alter RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jocham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenzweig et al., 2002</xref>), we found a trend-level group difference in RT (t = 1.83, P = 0.074), with slower responding in amisulpride (mean RT ± SEM = 816 ± 16.6) compared to placebo (mean RT ± SEM = 770 ± 18.5). Importantly, all group comparisons remained significant when RT was included as a covariate in the statistical models, suggesting that non-significant differences in RT did not confound the imaging results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Haker, T Baumgartner, S Weber, and M Wälti for assistance in subject recruitment and data acquisition, and JD Howard for helpful comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>TK, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>PNT, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Review Board of Zurich (Ref.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Dopamine controls stimulus generalization in the human hippocampus&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor), Michael Frank (Reviewing Editor), and two peer reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form.</p><p>All reviewers and editors expressed interest in the findings and framework, but questioned the level of advance over and above what your group has published in 2012 with a similar model and relation to hippocampal-striatal connectivity. The main issues that came up in the review discussion (some of which are reiterated by the individual reviewer comments below) are as follows.</p><p>– First and foremost, while the dopaminergic effect is of real potential interest, all were concerned that there was no observable effect of the drug on generalization behavior, but only through the lens of the model parameters. In general a model can certainly be helpful to refine behavioral analysis, but (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">1</xref>) it has to be shown to fit the data well before its parameters can be interpreted, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2</xref>) it should be compared to alternative potential models, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">3</xref>) if both of these are successful the winning model should then guide an analysis of the behavioral data that would reveal the significant effects. Reviewers were also concerned that other (unmodelled) factors (e.g. new learning during testing session affected by dopamine) could be at play which make it less clear that dopamine is specifically changing the hippocampal generalization gradient, and that the current findings weren't well integrated with your previous findings.</p><p>– The specificity of the effects was not fully established. Reviewers suggest control analyses that would address whether indeed what was seen in the hippocampus is something that is unique to the hippocampus, or whether it was a general effect of pharmacology in BOLD signal that was not observed elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> This study examined the role of dopamine in modulation of perceptual generalization, combining pharmacology, fMRI and computational modeling.</p><p>On the first day participants trained on a visual discrimination task. On the second day they were tested for generalization of the training to new samples varying in similarity to the trained items. The generalization test took place either under drug (D2 receptor blocker) or under placebo, in a between-subject design. The results suggest that both groups generalize similarly, overall. But the application of a computational model of generalization revealed subtle but interesting differences in the width of the generalization gradient, with a narrower gradient in the drug-treated group. This difference in the generalization gradient was associated with differences in BOLD activity in the hippocampus, with the drug group showing a weaker generalization-related BOLD response.</p><p>Overall this is a solid and informative study using a convergence of methods to address an interesting question. I have just a few comments:</p><p>1) As with any pharmacological study, one must raise concerns about selectivity. How do you know the effects of the drug are not due to global differences in dopamine transmission, that are having an impact on BOLD activity in multiple places in parallel with (but not necessarily related to) the subtle differences in behavior? The study already addresses this somewhat by showing selectivity of effects on functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the midbrain, but not with the striatum. And the findings ruling out mere differences in perception also help address this point. But similar control analyses are also needed for the generalization gradient, to determine whether there is really a selective effect of the drug in the hippocampus, as the authors currently conclude. For example, Paz and colleagues have suggested an important role for the amygdala and the PFC in perceptual generalization. These regions are also targets of midbrain region and it would be useful to know whether or not they show parallel effects.</p><p>– Related to the point about possible global differences between drug and placebo, were there any reaction time differences between the groups?</p><p>2) The Discussion makes the important distinction between associative and perceptual generalization, but this distinction is muddled in the introduction where the two appear to be conflated. It will help readers if this distinction is clarified earlier on.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> The study by Kahnt and Tobler investigates the role of dopamine in stimulus generalization using fMRI, computational modeling and dopamine blockade (D2R). Two groups of subjects first learnt which of two oriented gabor patches (CS+ 39 deg, CS- 51) were associated with positive or neutral outcome. Following drug (PA) or placebo (PP) administration they then performed the generalization test where they responded to 15 different orientations not presented during training (between 17-73 deg; no outcome presented) with multiple repetitions of each item. Main findings of interest: i) as in their (2012) and other studies a classic peak shift generalization curve was observed (i.e. away from CS-) ii) whilst there was no significant difference between the groups in the raw data, groups different when a similarity based model of generalization was used (i.e. excitatory generalization coefficient was larger in PP group; n.s. trend for inhib coefficient). Iii) Modelled prediction errors during generalization were observed in the hippocampus, and greater in the PP group. Further there was a reduction in midbrain-hippocampus functional connectivity in the PA group, that was associated with individual differences in modeled inhibitory coefficient. Overall findings are discussed as implicating dopaminergic circuit and hippocampus in flexible stimulus generalization based on neuromodulatory state.</p><p>This study addresses a question of importance and the findings are potentially of interest. However, I have some concerns about the interpretation of the findings (see below). In addition I am not sure whether the current paper represents a substantial enough advance above their published 2012 work (where an analogous computational model was used and interactions between the hippocampus-striatum implicated) to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The main novel aspect is the dopaminergic manipulation, but as I see it there are some inconsistencies between the 2012 and this paper which make it difficult to have a coherent picture.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Given the effect of drug on generalization curve is relatively small (i.e. only detectable by model fitting), it seems important that the authors consider alternative models. If these also showed a significant difference in group parameters this would make the findings appear more robust. In particular, exemplar models (e.g. Nosofsky, 1984) and models of similarity based generalization (e.g Shepard, 1987) typically use an exponential similarity function. Was there a particular reason for opting for a Gaussian function instead, and could the authors please provide results from an analogous model with exponential function for comparison? This would be particularly useful given the possible relationship between exemplar models and the hippocampus.</p><p>One important claim of the paper is that dopamine widens the generalization curve (e.g. modeled by increase in excitatory coefficient relating to width of Gaussian). Whilst this makes sense at face value, I wonder whether that there are potentially complicated interactions at play during the generalization test that may (also/instead) be affected by dopamine. In brief, and detailed subsequently: dopamine is known to affect the strength of hippocampal encoding and perhaps this is the reason for changes in the generalization curve. This would be important (apart from changing the mechanistic explanation) because it suggests that the dopamine/hippocampal effect is to some extent paradigm specific: it does not apply to &quot;one-shot&quot; generalization (perhaps more naturalistic), but only under settings where lots of stimuli are presented and generalization required.</p><p>To state this in more detail: subjects are learning during the generalization phase: i.e. storing new representations of the previously unseen test items and their predicted values (which are being constantly updated). It certainly seems conceivable that in this setting the hippocampus is important in setting up these representations, and the behavioral generalization curve then reflects the concurrent retrieval of these representations in parallel (i.e. as in exemplar models) to compute an EV for the current stimulus (as the authors suggest). My question is how a difference in the strength of these item representations in the hippocampus could influence the generalization curve? At present this is not modeled, and given the known role of dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal encoding this seems an additional factor to consider. Assuming the authors agree with this, could they incorporate this as an additional parameter in the model (distinct from the learning rate, which applies to value updating), and report the results?</p><p>It seems important for the authors relate these findings more closely to those of their previous study, which is not discussed in detail at present and consider possible inconsistencies. Firstly, no hippocampal PE signals were reported in that study: can the authors comment on any reasons for why this might be the case (e.g. paradigm differences etc? Secondly, stronger hippocampal-striatal connectivity in that study was associated with narrower generalization: here stronger midbrain-hippocampal connectivity was associated with broader generalization. Can the authors comment on the difference in findings, and also whether the midbrain-hippocampal connectivity result is replicable in the original dataset?</p><p>Hippocampal activity is reported to correlate with generalized PE during test phase. Given that no outcomes are presented, is the PE not equivalent to EV? If so, it would be worth stating this, partly because in recent years a number of studies have found EV to be reflected in hippocampal activity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dopamine regulates stimulus generalization in the human hippocampus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor), Michael Frank (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers. We all agreed that the manuscript has been substantially improved and that you have done a nice job addressing the main issues. Still, there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below by each reviewer in turn.</p><p>I highlight two points here.</p><p>First, both Reviewers appreciated the new analyses showing specificity of the effects to the hippocampus, but each would like to see a follow-up analysis to further evaluate this specificity. Reviewer 1 notes that any strong claims regarding specificity need to show a region by drug effect interaction and not just a significant effect in hippocampus and null effect elsewhere (see e.g., Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann &amp; Waenmakkers 2011 Nature Neuroscience who emphasize this point strongly). Reviewer 2 asks whether you also see specificity in the PPI analysis.</p><p>Second, Reviewer 2 would like to see a somewhat more fleshed out motivation for the prediction error analysis and to clarify whether the PE was evaluated at the outcome or during the choice.</p><p>Please address these and the other comments below, and we will be able to make a decision without further review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> This is a resubmission of a previous paper relating to the role of the hippocampus &amp; dopamine in stimulus generalization. Overall, the authors have been very responsive to the concerns I had with the original paper: I was convinced by the new findings that distinguish the effect of drug in the absence of a model (through differences in kurtosis), the results of the inclusion of a similarity based model with exponential function, and consideration of learning during test as a possible explanatory factor. Also the discussion of the current findings with respect to their previous paper is informative.</p><p>I have few remaining concerns:</p><p>– The authors report a significant difference between drug/placebo groups in terms of prediction error signals in the hippocampus, but report that this effect was not significant in other regions showing prediction error signals (e.g. amygdala). Can they confirm whether there was a significant interaction (i.e. drug/placebo x brain region), for example in an appropriately constructed region of interest analysis? This seems important to demonstrate the specificity of the drug effect on PE signals.</p><p>– They observe that midbrain-hippocampal functional connectivity correlates with the inhibitory (but not excitatory) generalization coefficient of the model. Although there is a comment that relates to this in the Discussion, could the authors expand on why the behavioral findings between drug groups should be driven by differences in the excitatory coefficient, but not the functional connectivity findings? Also was there a significant difference between placebo and drug group in this correlation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> The authors did an extensive revision in which they addressed the main concerns raised in the last round, particularly the lack of a behavioral difference under drug and the lack of specificity of the fMRI findings. The result is an interesting paper presenting solid findings that are likely to be of broad interest.</p><p>I have a couple of remaining comments:</p><p>1) The rational for the prediction error analysis in the test phase is not spelled out clearly enough. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought the authors were arguing that the effect of dopamine at test is essentially on the retrieval of a learned representation, the generalization itself, and that it is explicitly not related to trial by trial updating during the test phase. This leaves me questioning what the link is to the prediction error at the outcome phase rather than the response/choice at the stimulus presentation phase.</p><p>2) The selectivity of the fMRI effects to the hippocampus are reassuring. What about the PPI effects? Here too it seems important to show regional selectivity, ideally using the same control regions, to show that the PPI differences are not generally related to pharmacological effects on BOLD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12678.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We have now thoroughly revised the manuscript based on these comments. Specifically, we provide evidence for an effect of amisulpride on generalization behavior by showing significant group differences in the shape (i.e., kurtosis) of the behavioral generalization gradients (see reviewer #2, point 1). We also show that the effect of amisulpride on model parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the choice of the specific model (see reviewer #2, point 1). We have now compared our model to alternative models, including a model with an exponential similarity function and a model with additional sensory learning during test (see reviewer #2, point 2). We demonstrate that a Gaussian similarity function explains the data better than an exponential similarity function and that additional learning during test cannot account for our results. Importantly, we now show that the effects of dopamine on generalization related fMRI signals are specific to the hippocampus and do not extend into other regions involved in generalization such as the amygdala and the mPFC (see reviewer #1, point 1). We also clarify the conceptual advances over our previous study (Kahnt et al. 2012, J Neurosci), provided by using a pharmacological manipulation of dopamine, and a dissociation of encoding- and retrieval-based generalization (see reviewer #2, point 3).</p><p><italic>All reviewers and editors expressed interest in the findings and framework, but questioned the level of advance over and above what your group has published in 2012 with a similar model and relation to hippocampal-striatal connectivity. The main issues that came up in the review discussion (some of which are reiterated by the individual reviewer comments below) are as follows. – First and foremost, while the dopaminergic effect is of real potential interest, all were concerned that there was no observable effect of the drug on generalization behavior, but only through the lens of the model parameters. In general a model can certainly be helpful to refine behavioral analysis, but (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">1</xref>) it has to be shown to fit the data well before its parameters can be interpreted, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2</xref>) it should be compared to alternative potential models, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">3</xref>) if both of these are successful the winning model should then guide an analysis of the behavioral data that would reveal the significant effects. Reviewers were also concerned that other (unmodelled) factors (e.g. new learning during testing session affected by dopamine) could be at play which make it less clear that dopamine is specifically changing the hippocampal generalization gradient, and that the current findings weren't well integrated with your previous findings. – The specificity of the effects was not fully established. Reviewers suggest control analyses that would address whether indeed what was seen in the hippocampus is something that is unique to the hippocampus, or whether it was a general effect of pharmacology in BOLD signal that was not observed elsewhere.</italic></p><p>We have now revised the manuscript in light of these comments and believe that they have strengthened the manuscript considerably. Specifically, we now demonstrate an effect of amisulpride on the shape of behavioral generalization gradients by showing that compared to placebo, gradients in the amisulpride group have a significantly greater kurtosis. We also show that our model fits the behavioral data well, and compare our model to alternative potential models. Specifically, we demonstrate that the effect of amisulpride on model parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the choice of the specific model. Moreover, we show that our original model with a Gaussian similarity function outperforms a model with an exponential similarity function and that adding a sensory learning mechanism does not improve the fit of the model. We then use the winning model to guide the analysis of the behavioral and neural data and characterize significant effects of the dopamine manipulation on model parameters. We also show that additional learning during test does not explain our results.</p><p>Importantly, we show that the effects of dopamine on generalization related fMRI signals are specific to the hippocampus and do not occur in other regions such as the amygdala, middle temporal gyrus and mPFC.</p><p>We also clarify the conceptual advancements over our previous study (Kahnt et al. 2012, J Neurosci), provided by using a dopamine receptor type-specific manipulation as opposed to a simple correlation between brain activity and behavior, and the dissociation of encoding- and retrieval-based generalization. The point-by-point responses below describe in detail how we addressed each of the reviewers’ comments.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This study examined the role of dopamine in modulation of perceptual generalization, combining pharmacology, fMRI and computational modeling.</italic></p><p><italic>On the first day participants trained on a visual discrimination task. On the second day they were tested for generalization of the training to new samples varying in similarity to the trained items. The generalization test took place either under drug (D2 receptor blocker) or under placebo, in a between-subject design. The results suggest that both groups generalize similarly, overall. But the application of a computational model of generalization revealed subtle but interesting differences in the width of the generalization gradient, with a narrower gradient in the drug-treated group. This difference in the generalization gradient was associated with differences in BOLD activity in the hippocampus, with the drug group showing a weaker generalization-related BOLD response. Overall this is a solid and informative study using a convergence of methods to address an interesting question. I have just a few comments: 1) As with any pharmacological study, one must raise concerns about selectivity. How do you know the effects of the drug are not due to global differences in dopamine transmission, that are having an impact on BOLD activity in multiple places in parallel with (but not necessarily related to) the subtle differences in behavior? The study already addresses this somewhat by showing selectivity of effects on functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the midbrain, but not with the striatum. And the findings ruling out mere differences in perception also help address this point. But similar control analyses are also needed for the generalization gradient, to determine whether there is really a selective effect of the drug in the hippocampus, as the authors currently conclude. For example, Paz and colleagues have suggested an important role for the amygdala and the PFC in perceptual generalization. These regions are also targets of midbrain region and it would be useful to know whether or not they show parallel effects.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. There are two potential sources of non-selectivity that need to be considered:</p><p>1) First, there could be pharmacological effects on global blood flow that are independent of dopaminergic activity. Because the early visual cortex contains only very few dopamine receptors (Lidow et al. 1989, PNAS), visual activity provides a good control for non-specific (i.e., non-dopaminergic) effects of the drug on blood flow and the BOLD response. We therefore tested for drug-related differences in visual cue-related activity in the early visual cortex (AAL, calcarine sulcus). We did not find any differences in cue-related activity in early visual cortex between groups (t = -0.80, P = 0.42), suggesting that amisulpride did not affect global blood flow. This is in line with previous studies that found no differences between amisulpride and placebo in visually evoked activity (e.g., Jocham, et al. 2011, J Neurosci).</p><p>2) Second, because we delivered amisulpride systemically rather than by intracerebral infusion, it could have altered BOLD responses in all brain regions that contain dopamine receptors (such as the amygdala), independent of their role in generalization. In other words, the question is whether the observed effects of amisulpride on hippocampal activity are unique to the hippocampus, or can also be identified in other dopaminoceptive brain regions that are involved in generalization. As a control, we therefore tested whether generalization-related activity in the amygdala and middle temporal cortex was also altered by amisulpride. We did not find significant differences in generalization-related activity in either the amygdala (P = 0.43) or the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.31), suggesting that the effects of amisulpride on generalization-related activity are specific to the hippocampus.</p><p>While we do not find generalization-related activity in the PFC at our corrected threshold, we do find a cluster in the medial PFC (mPFC, x, y, z = -3, 56, 8, t = 4.03) at a more liberal, uncorrected threshold (P &lt; 0.001). In order to test for potential drug effects in the PFC, we compared activity in this cluster across groups. The comparison between groups did not reveal any differences (t = -0.023, P = 0.98), further supporting the specificity of the hippocampus finding. Because the mPFC finding is not based on a corrected, but a more liberal uncorrected threshold, we decided to not include this finding in the manuscript. However, we would be happy to include these results if the reviewer feels this would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Taken together, the results from the two control analyses demonstrate that our findings cannot be explained by non-specific drug effects on blood flow, and that the effects of dopamine on generalization-related processing are specific to the hippocampus. We now include the results of these control analyses in the manuscript:</p><p>Methods:</p><p>“To test for global effects of amisulpride on blood flow, and thereby BOLD response, we tested whether cue-evoked activity in visual cortex differed between groups. For this, we set up a GLM including one regressor for the onset of the visual cue (HRF convolved) and the six head movement parameters. Cue-related activity in an anatomical mask of the calcarine sulcus (AAL) did not differ between groups (t = -0.80, P = 0.42), suggesting that amisulpride did not unspecifically affect the BOLD response. This is in line with previous studies that found no differences between amisulpride and placebo in visually evoked activity (Jocham et al., 2011).”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To examine whether these effects of dopamine on generalization-related activity are specific to the hippocampus, as a control, we tested for similar group differences in the amygdala and middle temporal cortex.

Although amisulpride is generally known not to alter RT (e.g., Rosenzweig 2002, Hum Psychopharmacol Clin Exp; Jocham et al. 2011, J Neurosci), we found a non-significant group difference in RT (t = 1.83, P = 0.074), with slower responding in amisulpride (mean RT +/- SEM = 816 +/- 16.6) compared to placebo (mean RT +/- SEM = 770 +/- 18.5). All group comparisons remained significant when RT was included as a covariate in the statistical models, suggesting that non-significant differences in RT did not confound the imaging results.

In the case of associative generalization, such as transitive inference and acquired equivalence, the associative relationship among stimuli determines similarity. This relationship can be established for example by sensory preconditioning (train stimuli A-B and B-C, test whether A comes to predict C) or by a common associate (e.g. train A-C and B-C, test whether A and B are associated). In contrast, in stimulus generalization the relationship among stimuli is established by the similarity along one or more perceptual dimensions (frequency of sounds, color, line orientation, etc.).“</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Major concerns: Given the effect of drug on generalization curve is relatively small (i.e. only detectable by model fitting), it seems important that the authors consider alternative models.

This would be particularly useful given the possible relationship between exemplar models and the hippocampus.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We now report evidence for an effect of amisulpride on the shape of the observed behavioral generalization gradients independent of a specific computational model. Specifically, while none of the individual data points along the generalization gradient individually differed between groups, overall, gradients in the amisulpride group were reduced at both flanks and enhanced at the peak and tail of the curve. These features of the shape of the gradients are parsimoniously captured by the kurtosis of the underlying distributions. We therefore compared the kurtosis of the group-specific distributions (Pearson type VII distribution), and found significantly greater kurtosis in the distribution of the amisulpride group (permutation test, P = 0.043). This result provides evidence for effects of the drug on the overall shape of the behavioral generalization gradients. We now include this in the manuscript.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“Blocking dopamine D2-receptors (D2R) altered generalization behavior as revealed by an increased kurtosis of the generalization gradient, and a decreased width of model-derived generalization parameters.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Direct group comparisons of the individual data points along the generalization gradient did not reveal any significant differences (two-sample t-tests, all Ps &gt; 0.29). However, visual inspection of the gradients suggested that the amisulpride group had a narrower gradient than the placebo group, with enhanced responding at the peak of the curve, reduced responding at both flanks, and enhanced responding at the tail of the curve. These shape features are parsimoniously described by the 4th moment of probability distributions, namely, their kurtosis. Accordingly, a test for differences in the kurtosis of group-specific distributions (Pearson type VII distribution, see Materials and methods) revealed a significantly greater kurtosis in the amisulpride group compared to placebo (PA: 6.73, PP: 3.29; permutation test, P = 0.043). This finding demonstrates that amisulpride narrowed the width and increased the peak of the behavioral generalization gradient, and suggests that D2R activity alters the neurocomputational processes that mechanistically control generalization behavior.”</p><p>Materials and methods: “Comparing the kurtosis of behavioral generalization gradients”.: “In order to compare the overall shape of the behavioral generalization gradients, we estimated the 4th moment of the distributions underlying the behavioral gradients (because the behavioral gradients were bounded (17-73 degrees) and not centered on 45 degrees, direct numerical estimation of the kurtosis was not possible). For this, we fitted a Pearson type VII distribution to the behavioral generalization gradient of each group and numerically computed the kurtosis of the group-specific distributions according to:</p><p><disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The kurtosis was then compared between groups, and statistical inference on the observed group difference was performed using a permutation test.”</p><p>Regarding the shape of the modeled similarity function (i.e., generalization coefficient), we note that Shepard (1987) indeed proposed that similarity decreases exponentially with distance from the CS. However, he also listed several factors, such as repeated discrimination training and delays between training and test (both apply to our current experiment), that can render similarity functions Gaussian. Accordingly, and in line with the results of systematic reviews of empirical data (Ghirlanda &amp; Enquist, 2003, Animal Behaviour), we initially opted for a Gaussian similarity function for modeling the behavior.</p><p>To assess the validity of our choice, and as suggested by the reviewer, we formally compared models with Gaussian and exponential similarity functions. The exponential similarity functions for the inhibitory and excitatory gradients were implemented as:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>and<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, compared to the Gaussian model, the exponential model was substantially worse in capturing the behavioral generalization gradients of both groups. Also, the exponential model was unable to capture the group differences in the shapes of the generalization gradients, and accordingly, the estimated generalization coefficients did not differ between groups (inhibitory coefficient, P = 0.34, excitatory coefficient, P = 0.24). A formal model comparison showed that the model with the Gaussian similarity function outperformed the model with the exponential similarity function as indicated by smaller AIC and BIC scores (Gaussian: AIC = 9586.4, BIC = 9629.2; Exponential: AIC = 9691.6, BIC = 9734.4). We also compared the fit of the two models by comparing the average regression coefficients from a logistic regression of the trial-by-trial responses on the modeled P(+) responses. This revealed significantly better fits of the Gaussian compared to the exponential model in the entire group of subjects (paired t-test t = 5.47, P &lt; 0.001), as well as in both groups individually (PA, t = 3.34, P = 0.003 and PP, t = 5.72, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Taken together, these findings are in line with the observations by Shepard (1987) and demonstrate that the Gaussian model fits our data better than a model with an exponential similarity function. As suggested by the Editors, we now address this point by including a formal model comparison before testing for group differences in the estimated parameters of the winning (i.e., Gaussian) model.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Because the shape of the function determining the similarity between the currently presented stimulus and other stimuli (i.e., the generalization coefficient) is of critical importance (Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003), we directly compared the most commonly used models, i.e. one with Gaussian (Kahnt <underline>et al.</underline>, 2012) the other with exponential similarity functions (Shepard, 1987). While the exact shape of the similarity functions differs between models, for both models, the extent to which inhibitory and excitatory associations generalize to the current stimulus is controlled by the width of the similarity functions (si and se) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). […] Although both models predicted behavioral responses reliably (Gaussian: t = 11.06, P &lt; 0.001; exponential: t = 11.38, P &lt; 0.001), we find significantly higher regression coefficients for the Gaussian model (paired t-test t = 5.34, P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, this demonstrates that in our experiment, a Gaussian similarity function fits behavior better than an exponential similarity function. “</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“In order to compare models with Gaussian and exponential similarity functions, we estimated the free parameters of both models by combining the LLE from subjects in both groups, and compared the aggregate LLE from the best fitting parameter sets using AIC and BIC.”</p><p>It is important to note that the effect of amisulpride on the model parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the a priori choice of the Gaussian model. Specifically, the difference between the exponential and Gaussian similarity functions is determined by the exponent of the (absolute) difference between xj and xk (1 and 2 for the exponential and Gaussian model, respectively). Instead of comparing the fit of different theoretical shapes (exponential and Gaussian), we have also directly estimated the best fitting exponent by including the exponent as an additional free parameter in the model. This resulted in a parameter of 2.04, close to the assumed Gaussian model. Also for this model, the width of the inhibitory and excitatory generalization coefficients differed significantly between groups (P = 0.013 and P = 0.016, for the inhibitory and excitatory coefficients, respectively). However, because this exponential model came at the expense of an additional parameter, without substantially increasing the LLE, it was outperformed by the Gaussian model as indicated by lower AIC and BIC values for the Gaussian model (AIC = 9586.4 vs. 9588.3 and BIC = 9629.2 vs. 9638.2 for Gaussian vs. exponent as free parameter, respectively). These results demonstrate that the effect of amisulpride on the parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the choice of the specific model. In the interest of parsimony, we tentatively opted against including this model in the manuscript. However, if the reviewer feels this should be included, we would be happy to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p> <italic>One important claim of the paper is that dopamine widens the generalization curve (e.g. modeled by increase in excitatory coefficient relating to width of Gaussian). Whilst this makes sense at face value, I wonder whether that there are potentially complicated interactions at play during the generalization test that may (also/instead) be affected by dopamine. In brief, and detailed subsequently: dopamine is known to affect the strength of hippocampal encoding and perhaps this is the reason for changes in the generalization curve. This would be important (apart from changing the mechanistic explanation) because it suggests that the dopamine/hippocampal effect is to some extent paradigm specific: it does not apply to &quot;one-shot&quot; generalization (perhaps more naturalistic), but only under settings where lots of stimuli are presented and generalization required. To state this in more detail: subjects are learning during the generalization phase: i.e. storing new representations of the previously unseen test items and their predicted values (which are being constantly updated). It certainly seems conceivable that in this setting the hippocampus is important in setting up these representations, and the behavioral generalization curve then reflects the concurrent retrieval of these representations in parallel (i.e. as in exemplar models) to compute an EV for the current stimulus (as the authors suggest). My question is how a difference in the strength of these item representations in the hippocampus could influence the generalization curve? At present this is not modeled, and given the known role of dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal encoding this seems an additional factor to consider. Assuming the authors agree with this, could they incorporate this as an additional parameter in the model (distinct from the learning rate, which applies to value updating), and report the results?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer addresses an interesting point here, namely that dopamine-related differences in learning during the test session could have affected the shape of the generalization gradient. It is important to point out that our original model already accounts for additional associative learning during test. That is, test stimuli acquire stimulus-outcome associations by means of the same learning mechanism that is used during training (δ rule). The estimated learning rates for value learning during test (α<sub>test</sub>) did not differ between groups (P = 0.214), and therefore cannot account for differences in the shape of generalization gradients between groups.</p><p>If we understand correctly, the reviewer proposes that dopamine could affect a different form of learning during test, instead of, or in addition to, value learning. Specifically, it is possible that dopamine alters the sensory encoding of novel test stimuli for which further associative learning takes place. Such sensory representations could gradually build up over the test session as test stimuli are repeatedly encountered. In this scenario, test stimuli can contribute to generalized expected value (V) only to the degree that sensory representations for these stimuli actually have been established.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we modeled the gradual encoding of test stimuli using a mnemonic stimulus buffer M. Before a given test stimulus x<sub>k</sub> is encountered for the first time, this buffer is zero, and is then updated on a trial by trial basis using the δ rule and a sensory learning rate (α<sub>sensory</sub>):</p><p><disp-formula id="equ10"><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo/><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo/></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Please note that a sensory learning rate of 1 (α<sub>sensory</sub> = 1) renders the model equivalent to our original model, in which sensory representations of test stimuli (M) are fully established after the first encounter.</p><p>When the generalized expected value (V) is computed on a given trial, M serves to discount the contribution of the test stimuli’s excitatory and inhibitory associations (I<sub>k</sub> and E<sub>k</sub>):</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" mathsize="140%"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>As in our original model, the excitatory and inhibitory associations of the test stimuli (I<sub>k</sub> and E<sub>k</sub>) are updated using the value learning rate (α<sub>test</sub>):</p><p><disp-formula id="equ11"><label>and</label><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo/><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo/><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>With <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>Fitting α<sub>sensory</sub> for the entire group of subjects revealed an α<sub>sensory</sub> of 1, demonstrating that the fit of our initial model was not enhanced by adding the gradual sensory encoding mechanism.

Specifically, within certain ranges (i.e., α<sub>sensory</sub> &gt; 0 and α<sub>test</sub> &gt; 0), changes in α<sub>sensory</sub> can be compensated by changes in α<sub>test</sub>, and vice versa. This is because across test trials the δ rule for the update of I<sub>k</sub> and E<sub>k</sub> similarly induces a gradually increasing contribution of individual test stimuli to the generalized value prediction V. Nevertheless, the fact that both learning rates did not differ between groups indicates that additional learning during the test session was not altered by dopamine, and can therefore not account for the differences in generalization gradients.</p><p>In summary, these analyses suggest that our results cannot be explained by effects of dopamine on the encoding of sensory stimulus representations during test. Even though this is an interesting possibility, for the sake of clarity, we tentatively opted to not include the above results in the manuscript.

Firstly, no hippocampal PE signals were reported in that study: can the authors comment on any reasons for why this might be the case (e.g. paradigm differences etc? Secondly, stronger hippocampal-striatal connectivity in that study was associated with narrower generalization: here stronger midbrain-hippocampal connectivity was associated with broader generalization. Can the authors comment on the difference in findings, and also whether the midbrain-hippocampal connectivity result is replicable in the original dataset?</italic> </p><p>We now describe the differences between our previous (2012) and the current study more clearly. Most importantly, our previous study was silent about the pharmacology and timing of stimulus generalization. Procedurally, it consisted of several alternating training and testing sessions on a single day, whereas the current study used a single training and a single test session, which were separated by a 24 h delay. Moreover, in the 2012 study CS-US associations were deterministic, whereas the current study involved a 50% reinforcement schedule in order to slow down extinction during test. These factors could have caused the differences in PE related activity in the striatum vs. hippocampus. However, it is worth stating that in the 2012 data we did observe PE related activity in the hippocampus (left [-36, -25, -8], t = 3.84; right [30, -7, -14], t = 3.97, P &lt; 0.001), but these activations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and were therefore not reported in the final manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, in the 2012 study, hippocampal-striatal connectivity was negatively correlated with the width of the excitatory vs. inhibitory gradients (excitatory minus inhibitory). As such, this negative correlation could have been driven by a negative correlation with the excitatory gradient, and/or a positive correlation with the inhibitory gradient. In fact, going back to the original data, we find only a relatively weak negative correlation between striatum-hippocampus connectivity and the excitatory gradient (r = -0.42, P = 0.053), but a strong and positive correlation between connectivity and the inhibitory gradient (r = 0.57, P = 0.005). This shows that the relationship between striatal-hippocampal connectivity and the inhibitory gradient in the previous study is compatible with the results reported here.</p><p>We also revisited the data from the 2012 study with regard to the current finding of a positive correlation between midbrain-hippocampal connectivity and the width of the inhibitory coefficient. Replicating the results of our current study, we find that midbrain-hippocampal connectivity was significantly correlated with the inhibitory generalization coefficient (r = 0.44, P = 0.036), but not with the excitatory coefficient (r = 0.15, P = 0.49).</p><p>We now discuss the differences to our previous study, and relate the findings more thoroughly.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“By revealing the effects of dopamine on generalization, our current results substantially extend those of our previous study (Kahnt et al., 2012). Specifically, the current experiment suggests that dopamine is involved in regulating the width of generalization in the hippocampus, and dissociates effects of generalization during retrieval vs. encoding, which could not be achieved with the previous design. However, whereas here we find that prediction errors correlate primarily with activity in the hippocampus, the previous study identified prediction error related activity primarily in the ventral striatum. […] Thus, the two studies converge in showing a preferential relation of the connection between the midbrain and the hippocampus to inhibitory generalization.”</p><p><italic>Hippocampal activity is reported to correlate with generalized PE during test phase. Given that no outcomes are presented, is the PE not equivalent to EV? If so, it would be worth stating this, partly because in recent years a number of studies have found EV to be reflected in hippocampal activity.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that because no outcomes were shown in the test session, PEs are perfectly (but negatively) correlated with EV. We now mention this in the paper and include references reporting value signals in the hippocampus.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Please note that because no outcomes were shown, prediction errors are perfectly (but negatively) correlated with expected value.”</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</italic></p><p><italic>First, both Reviewers appreciated the new analyses showing specificity of the effects to the hippocampus, but each would like to see a follow-up analysis to further evaluate this specificity. Reviewer 1 notes that any strong claims regarding specificity need to show a region by drug effect interaction and not just a significant effect in hippocampus and null effect elsewhere (see e.g., Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann &amp; Waenmakkers 2011 Nature Neuroscience who emphasize this point strongly). Reviewer 2 asks whether you also see specificity in the PPI analysis. Second, Reviewer 2 would like to see a somewhat more fleshed out motivation for the prediction error analysis and to clarify whether the PE was evaluated at the outcome or during the choice.</italic> </p><p>We thank the editors for the positive evaluation of our resubmitted manuscript. Below we address the remaining comments. Most importantly, we now include explicit tests of drug-by-region interactions to formally evaluate the specificity of the drug effects in the hippocampus. We also address the remaining interpretative issues.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This is a resubmission of a previous paper relating to the role of the hippocampus &amp; dopamine in stimulus generalization. Overall, the authors have been very responsive to the concerns I had with the original paper: I was convinced by the new findings that distinguish the effect of drug in the absence of a model (through differences in kurtosis), the results of the inclusion of a similarity based model with exponential function, and consideration of learning during test as a possible explanatory factor. Also the discussion of the current findings with respect to their previous paper is informative. I have few remaining concerns:</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments on the resubmitted version of our manuscript. Below we address the remaining comments.</p><p> <italic>– The authors report a significant difference between drug/placebo groups in terms of prediction error signals in the hippocampus, but report that this effect was not significant in other regions showing prediction error signals (e.g. amygdala). Can they confirm whether there was a significant interaction (i.e. drug/placebo x brain region), for example in an appropriately constructed region of interest analysis? This seems important to demonstrate the specificity of the drug effect on PE signals.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in order to demonstrate specificity, interactions need to be computed. In line with specificity, post-hoc analyses comparing the effect of the drug in the hippocampus to the drug effect in the other regions (i.e., group-by-region interactions), demonstrated that the drug effect in the hippocampus was significantly stronger than in the mPFC (P = 0.02). However, similar interactions involving the amygdala (P = 0.097) and the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.127) did not reach significance. This suggests that while the drug effects are specific to the hippocampus relative to the mPFC, they do not exceed the non-significant drug effects in the amygdala and the middle temporal gyrus. We now add these results to the manuscript and adjust our interpretation regarding specificity accordingly.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“No significant group differences were observed in the amygdala (P = 0.43), the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.31), or the medial PFC (P = 0.98). However, post-hoc analyses directly comparing the effect of the drug in the hippocampus to the drug effect in the other regions (i.e., region-by-group interactions), demonstrated that while the effect of D2R blockade in the hippocampus was significantly stronger than in the mPFC (P = 0.02) similar interactions involving the amygdala (P = 0.097) and the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.127) did not reach significance. These data suggest specificity of the effects of D2R blockade on similarity-based processing in the hippocampus relative to the mPFC, but not necessarily relative to the amygdala and middle temporal lobe.”</p><p> <italic>– They observe that midbrain-hippocampal functional connectivity correlates with the inhibitory (but not excitatory) generalization coefficient of the model. Although there is a comment that relates to this in the Discussion, could the authors expand on why the behavioral findings between drug groups should be driven by differences in the excitatory coefficient, but not the functional connectivity findings? Also was there a significant difference between placebo and drug group in this correlation?</italic> </p><p>One possibility is that the decrease in the inhibitory and the excitatory coefficient induced by D2R blockade relies on separate neural mechanisms. Specifically, it is possible that only the effects of D2R blockade on the inhibitory coefficient are mediated by connectivity between midbrain and the hippocampus, whereas the D2R effects on excitatory coefficient are mediated via a different mechanism. The difference in the correlation between the placebo and the drug group was only at trend level (p = 0.054). We now spell out this possibility more explicitly in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“This raises the possibility that only the effects of D2R blockade on the inhibitory coefficient are mediated via a modulation of midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, whereas the effects on the excitatory coefficient are mediated via a different, yet to be explored, mechanism.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors did an extensive revision in which they addressed the main concerns raised in the last round, particularly the lack of a behavioral difference under drug and the lack of specificity of the fMRI findings. The result is an interesting paper presenting solid findings that are likely to be of broad interest. I have a couple of remaining comments: 1) The rational for the prediction error analysis in the test phase is not spelled out clearly enough. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought the authors were arguing that the effect of dopamine at test is essentially on the retrieval of a learned representation, the generalization itself, and that it is explicitly not related to trial by trial updating during the test phase. This leaves me questioning what the link is to the prediction error at the outcome phase rather than the response/choice at the stimulus presentation phase.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right, our results do suggest that the effect of dopamine is on the retrieval of learned information. Because no outcomes are shown during the test phase, we can use prediction errors as a proxy for generalized retrieved value. The prediction error was modeled at the time of outcome. However, we note that because of the fast timing of our task, it is difficult to dissociate effects during the stimulus/choice period from that of the outcome. We now make this more explicit in the manuscript.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“As a proxy of generalized value, we focused on prediction error responses derived from our model, which reflect the extent to which reward predictions have generalized from the original CS+ and CS− to the current stimulus (please note that because no outcomes were shown, prediction errors are perfectly but negatively correlated with expected value). Accordingly, to identify brain regions involved in similarity-based computations during generalization, we searched for regions in which fMRI activity correlated with generalized prediction errors at the time of the expected outcome.”</p><p> <italic>2) The selectivity of the fMRI effects to the hippocampus are reassuring. What about the PPI effects? Here too it seems important to show regional selectivity, ideally using the same control regions, to show that the PPI differences are not generally related to pharmacological effects on BOLD.</italic></p><p>We examined the specificity of the connectivity effects and now include these results in the manuscript.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To examine the specificity of these findings, we tested for similar drug-related effects on functional connectivity in the regions involved in similarity-based processing defined above. While connectivity estimates differed significantly between groups in middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.01), no drug effects were observed in the amygdala (P = 0.296) and the mPFC (P = 0.17). Accordingly, for all regions except the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.13), the corresponding drug-by-region interactions were significant (all Ps &lt; 0.05), suggesting that amisulpride-related decreases in midbrain connectivity are relatively specific to the hippocampus.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
