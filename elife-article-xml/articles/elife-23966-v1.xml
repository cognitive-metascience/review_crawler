death. There are conflicting reports regarding the role of Angiomotin (Amot) in regulating this pathway. While some studies suggest a YAP-inhibitory function other studies indicate Amot is required for YAP activity. Here, we describe an Amot-dependent complex comprised of Amot, YAP and Merlin. The phosphorylation of Amot at Serine 176 shifts localization of this complex to the plasma membrane, where it associates with the tight-junction proteins Pals1/PATJ and E-cadherin. Conversely, hypophosphorylated Amot shifts localization of the complex to the nucleus, where it facilitates the association of YAP and TEAD, induces transcriptional activation of YAP target genes and promotes YAP-dependent cell proliferation. We propose that phosphorylation of Amot<sup>S176</sup> is a critical post-translational modification that suppresses YAP’s ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by altering the subcellular localization of an essential YAP co-factor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23966.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23966.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23966.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in animals and other multi-cellular organisms need to know when and where they should grow and divide. Individual cells communicate with their surrounding environment and each other via signaling pathways such as the Hippo-YAP pathway, which stimulates cells to grow and therefore influences the size of organs. When the Hippo part of the pathway is active it causes a protein known as YAP to move out of a compartment in the cell called the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, YAP helps to activate genes that promote cell growth. If the Hippo pathway can no longer respond to cues from the environment, YAP becomes over-active and can contribute to the development of various cancers. Therefore researchers are trying to better understand how it is regulated.</p><p>Many signals both from inside and outside the cell influence YAP activity. For example, some signals block YAP from entering the nucleus, whereas others cause YAP to be broken down entirely. Several studies have recently identified a signal protein called angiomotin as a regulator of YAP. However, the studies provide conflicting reports as to whether angiomotin promotes or inhibits cell growth.</p><p>Like many other proteins, angiomotin can be tagged with a small molecule called a phosphate group that can alter its activity. Moleirinho, Hoxha et al. studied human cells containing versions of angiomotin that mimic different forms of the protein with or without the phosphate. The experiments indicate that when a phosphate is attached at a particular position (known as serine 176), angiomotin predominantly interacts with YAP and another protein called Merlin at the cell surface. On the other hand, when angiomotin does not have a phosphate attached to it, all three proteins can move into the nucleus, where YAP is able to activate genes and promote cell growth.</p><p>Overall, these findings indicate that adding a phosphate group to angiomotin can act as a switch to regulate where in the cell it and YAP are found and thus, whether YAP is active. Future experiments will investigate which enzymes add the phosphate group to serine 176, and when they are able to do so.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23966.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23966.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Hippo</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>Angiomotin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA124495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kissil</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS077952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kissil</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001545</institution-id><institution>Children's Tumor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moleirinho</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of Angiomotin regulates YAP localization and activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiomotin (Amot) was originally identified as an angiostatin-binding protein involved in the regulation of endothelial cell polarization, migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kikuno et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levchenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Troyanovsky et al., 2001</xref>). Amot is expressed as two isoforms generated by alternative splicing, full-length Amot-p130 (referred to as Amot in this manuscript) and truncated Amot-p80, which lacks the 409-amino acid N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernkvist et al., 2006</xref>). Amot, Angiomotin-like 1 (AmotL1) and Angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2) compose the Motin family of proteins, which share an N-terminus with conserved glutamine-rich domains and PPxY motifs, and a C-terminus containing conserved coiled-coil (CC) and PDZ-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bratt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). Although structurally similar, the functions of Motin family members appear to be distinctive, as divergent spatiotemporal and expression levels have been described across human and mouse tissues and cell lines for each of the family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, Amot is required for endothelial cell migration, by binding to the Syx:Patj/Mupp1 polarity complex to localize RhoA activity to the leading edge of migratory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernkvist et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been implicated in epithelial cell polarity, as an inhibitor of the GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) Rich1 and shown to compromise the integrity of tight junctions by promoting Rich1-mediated hydrolysis of Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wells et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). Amot regulates collective migration of epithelial cells as part of a signaling axis composed of Merlin-Amot-Rich1 and the Rac1 small GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 2015</xref>). At tight junctions (TJ), TJ-associated Merlin inhibits Rac1 activation through the Amot-Rich1 axis, relocalizing Merlin to the cytoplasm during cell migration and releasing Rac1 from a suppressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). Amot also directly binds to YAP, a central effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, via <sup>106</sup>LPTY<sup>109</sup>/<sup>239</sup>PPxY<sup>242</sup> motifs present in the N-terminal domain of Amot-p130 and WW domain present in YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, originally characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is highly conserved in mammals and regulates organ size, cell contact inhibition, proliferation, apoptosis and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramos and Camargo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yi and Kissil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). At the core of the mammalian pathway, MST1/2 promote phosphorylation of WW45 (also known as Sav1), Lats1/2, and MOB1 (MOBKL1A/B). Once activated, Lats1/2 phosphorylates the primary downstream effector YAP, promoting ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation by a SCF<sup>beta-TRCP</sup> E3 ligase and sequestering YAP from the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2007</xref>). Among the different transcription factors activated by YAP, the DNA-binding TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors are thought to mediate a YAP-driven pro-proliferative gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2007</xref>).</p><p>YAP’s involvement in cancer has been demonstrated in several tissues, including liver, intestine, heart, pancreas, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerrant et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, recent studies revealed YAP plays a key role in developing resistance to RAF- and MEK-targeted therapies in lung and colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>) and cancer relapse in <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven colon and pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2014</xref>). Upstream of the core kinase cassette is the tumor suppressor Merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein), which is inactivated in Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McClatchey et al., 1998</xref>). Functions for Merlin have been described in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2010</xref>) as well as at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse-liver, homozygous deletion of <italic>Nf2</italic> results in tumor formation. However, heterozygous deletion of <italic>Yap</italic> significantly suppresses the loss-of-<italic>Nf2</italic> phenotype, thus implicating YAP as a major downstream effector of NF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Analysis of liver-specific <italic>Nf2</italic> knockout mice and <italic>Nf2:Amot</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice showed Amot is required for hepatic ductal cell proliferation and tumor formation in the context of either <italic>Nf2</italic> loss or DDC (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine)-induced injury. Additionally, substantially increased expression of Amot was observed in <italic>NF2</italic>-null human schwannomas samples, which primarily displayed localization of Amot in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Further evidence demonstrated that in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Amot promotes the proliferation of renal epithelial and RCC cells, and is crucial for YAP transcriptional activity by promoting its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has also been reported that Amot functions as a negative regulator of YAP activity, as direct association of Amot and YAP results in translocation to cytoplasm/cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung and Zernicka-Goetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a number of studies suggest that Amot acts as a scaffold protein to promote localization of YAP, as well as other Hippo/YAP core kinases, to the cytoplasm/cell junctions/actin cytoskeleton and promote Lats1/2-mediated phosphorylation of YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paramasivam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). One possible explanation for these opposing regulatory functions of Amot could be attributed to post-translational modifications. Phosphorylation of Ser175 on human Amot (corresponding to Ser176 in mouse) at the conserved HVRSLS motif by Lats1/2 has been reported as a key post-translational modification controlling Amot function and association with YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>). Here we show that Amot-p130 functions as a scaffold protein mediating YAP and Merlin association and that phosphorylation of Amot at Ser176 induces translocation of the complex from the cytoplasm and nucleus to the plasma membrane. This relocalization of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex significantly impacts the activity of YAP and regulates YAP’s ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These results uncover an unrecognized layer of regulation in the Hippo-YAP pathway and resolve questions regarding the seemingly opposing functions of Amot.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amot, YAP and Merlin form a complex that localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm</title><p>Previous work by multiple groups identified the p130 splice isoform of Angiomotin (Amot) as a binding partner of YAP and Merlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). We first thought to assess whether Amot-p130, YAP and Merlin form a complex and subsequently whether this is dependent on Angiomotin phosphorylation. We used HEK293, as they express relatively high levels of endogenous Angiomotin. First, to determine the interaction between Merlin and YAP, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged Merlin and V5-tagged YAP. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses using anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies revealed association between YAP and Merlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Merlin-YAP interaction was also confirmed in another independent cell type – the hSC2λ immortalized human Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, further validation of the association between YAP and Merlin was confirmed at the endogenous protein levels, using antibodies directed against Merlin or YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23966.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>YAP associates with Merlin in the nucleus and cytoplasm.</title><p>Co-immunoprecipitation of YAP and Merlin.

Flag-tagged Merlin and V5-tagged YAP were co-transfected in both HEK293 and hSC2λ cells and the localization and association of these proteins were examined by subcellular fractionation coupled to IP with an anti-Flag antibody. These subcellular fractionation studies showed an association between Merlin and YAP primarily in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and to a much lesser extent at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Further confirmation of Merlin and YAP co-localization was provided by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, in HEK293 and hSC2λ cells, where we observed co-localization of IF signal predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Amot-p80 lacks the 409 amino acid N-terminus present in Amot, which harbors the PPxY motifs (<sup>239</sup>PPEY<sup>242</sup> and <sup>284</sup>PPEY<sup>287</sup>), and an unconventional LPTY motif (<sup>106</sup>LPTY<sup>109</sup>) that mediate the interaction with YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernkvist et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, attempting to IP HA-Merlin or V5-YAP demonstrated that Amot-p80 was unable to support the association between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, mutation of the individual PPEY/LPTY motifs or combinations thereof, significantly impaired the association between Merlin and YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results show that Amot functions as a scaffold that supports the YAP-Merlin association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Angiomotin phosphorylation does not impair formation of a YAP/Merlin complex</title><p>Several reports have shown the importance of Amot post-translational modifications in regulating its function, specifically phosphorylation of Serine 176 (Serine 175 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paramasivam et al., 2011</xref>).

These analyses demonstrated that all three forms of Amot support the formation of the complex, as evidenced by the co-IP of Merlin and YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Further validation of these results were demonstrated by co-IP experiments in which Amot was IPed using an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we examined whether phosphorylated Amot is still able to bind both YAP and Merlin, by using an antibody that specifically binds phosphorylated S176 (p-S176). The antibody was used to IP phosphorylated Amot and co-IP of Merlin and YAP was assessed by western blotting. These experiments showed that Amot phosphorylated at S176 binds to both YAP and Merlin. Similarly, IP with antibodies against YAP or Merlin also showed co-IP with phosphorylated Amot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

These analyses confirmed the fractionation findings, demonstrating a stronger intensity of Amot in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells expressing Amot-p130, a shift to nuclear staining in Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> expressing cells and cytoplasmic/plasma membrane localization in Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined if the status of S176 can regulate localization of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex. First, we examined Amot/YAP localization using co-IP studies in fractions prepared from 293-shAmot cells transfected with expression vectors for Amot-p130, Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> or Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup>. In agreement with our previous results, in 293-shAmot cells transfected with Amot-p130 and YAP, Amot co-IPed with YAP mainly in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus with little to no interaction detected at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, in cells expressing the Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> allele, the Amot-YAP complex mainly localized to the nucleus with little to no interaction detected in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Significantly, in cells expressing the Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> allele an increase in the Amot-YAP association was detected at the plasma membrane, in addition to the cytoplasmic fraction. Little to no interaction was detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, the distribution of Amot/YAP complex mimics the distribution observed for Amot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to the analysis in the 293-shAmot cells, a similar analysis carried out in the hSC2λ and HepG2 cells confirmed a similar distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2B–D</xref>).</p><p>These findings were extended and confirmed by IF analysis of the YAP-Merlin association in 293-shAmot cells, where the localization of YAP and Merlin to the plasma membrane is significantly enhanced in cells expressing the Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Overall our findings demonstrate that while Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation does not impact the formation of the Amot/YAP/Merlin complex, it mediates the localization of the complex through phosphorylation of Serine 176 that leads to recruitment of the complex to the plasma membrane or a shift to a nuclear localization in the hypophosphorylated state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphorylation of Amot promotes localization to junctional structures at the plasma membrane</title><p>Previous studies showed binding of Amot to the tight junction-associated proteins Pals1 and Patj at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernkvist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wells et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). To further characterize the mechanisms by which phosphorylated Amot shifts from the cytoplasm and nucleus to the plasma membrane, we examined the interactions between Amot-p130, Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> and Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> with Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin. Using co-IP, we found that Flag-tagged Patj strongly associates with Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup>, compared to weaker or null interaction with Amot-p130 and Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup>, respectively. In a reciprocal approach, IP of the different Amot forms demonstrated a stronger association between Patj and Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Similar results were obtained when examining the association of Pals1 or E-cadherin with Amot.

Towards this goal we analyzed the status of active Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) in these cells compared to control 293-shAmot cells. As expected, transfection with the different Amot alleles resulted in increased Rac1-GTP levels. However, we found no significant differences in Rac1-GTP levels between the cells, suggesting the status of Amot serine 176 phosphorylation does not affect Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We next determined whether the observed increased rates of cell proliferations induced by Amot-p130 and Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> expression are YAP-dependent, by introducing two independent siRNAs against YAP into these cells. Indeed, the increased proliferation afforded by Amot-p130 and Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> was completely inhibited by YAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We used two independent luciferase reporter assays, the HIP/HOP-flash and 8xGTIIC luciferase reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leask and Abraham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The HIP (Hippo-YAP signaling incompetent promoter)/HOP (Hippo-YAP signaling optimal promoter)-flash reporters contain, respectively, seven mutated TEAD-binding sites and multimerized (x8) TEAD-binding sites from the promoter of YAP’s direct target <italic>CTGF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leask and Abraham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The former is a negative control for HOP-flash activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Gumbiner, 2015</xref>). In agreement with our previously reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>), the activity of YAP in the HOP-reporter assay was suppressed in 293-shAmot cells, while the reintroduction of Amot fully rescued YAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Moreover, the expression of Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> resulted in a substantial increase in the activation of the HOP-flash reporter when compared to Amot. Significantly, Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> was unable to rescue the function of YAP in the 293-shAmot cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). As expected, no significant changes in activation of the HIP reporter were observed under similar experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

To gain a deeper understanding of Amot function, we employed multiple cell types originating from tissues in which dysregulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway is observed under pathological conditions. Our study reveals that Angiomotin phosphorylation at serine 176 mediates YAP localization. This post-translational modification is the key event determining a promoting or repressing regulation of YAP by Angiomotin. We found that phosphorylation at serine 176 does not mediate Angiomotin’s scaffolding functions but does impact the localization of a tertiary complex composed by Amot, YAP and Merlin, which is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus for the wild type protein. The serine 176 phosphomimetic mutant (Amot<sup>S176E</sup>) is recruited to the plasma membrane where it is found co-localized and associated with Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin at junctional structures. Our previous studies indicate that Amot is required for YAP function in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the relocation of Amot out of the nucleus and sequestration of Amot/YAP complex to the plasma membrane, function to prevent YAP from operating as a growth-promoting transcriptional activator. The non-phosphorylated mutant (Amot<sup>S176A</sup>) is preferentially localized to the nucleus, where it facilitates YAP interactions with TEADs and concomitant activation of target gene transcription.</p><p>Angiomotin’s involvement in regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling arises from studies showing that Amot functions as a scaffold protein for several components of this signaling cascade including YAP, Merlin, Kibra, Lats, and F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings extend Amot scaffolding functions to the formation of the YAP-Merlin complex independent of Amot Ser176 phosphorylation, although it is possible that additional PTMs might regulate the complex specifically at different sub-cellular localizations. Multiple reports describe the role of Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation on Amot interactions with binding partners and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mana-Capelli et al., 2014</xref>). While these reports converge towards the idea that Amot serine 176 phosphorylation is mediated by Lats1/2 and that this impacts Amot’s binding to F-actin, they differ significantly when examining the influence on Amot localization and function. Whilst the discussion of these differences merits a separate review, we highlight a few points that agree or conflict with our current findings. In regards to the effect of Amot phosphorylation on binding to F-actin or YAP, previous reports conclude that serine 176 phosphorylation impairs the interaction between Amot and F-actin and suggest that this can favor binding to YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mana-Capelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings suggest that serine 176 phosphorylation does not impact association with F-actin. However, in agreement with one of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2013</xref>) our findings suggest that phosphorylation on Amot has little impact on the Amot-YAP association. Possible explanations for the differences between our current findings and previous reports could be attributed to the use of HEK293 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Amot, which might mask some of the interactions with the mutated alleles. To circumvent this possibility, our studies incorporated HEK293 cells in which endogenous Amot expression was knocked-down and the different mutant alleles reintroduced. Additionally, previous studies used different cell types, which not only could impact the stability of the Amot/YAP interaction but also explain the observed differences in Amot localization. In MCF10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, hypophosphorylated Amot showed junctional localization and co-localization with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Although we cannot exclude differences in the actin cytoskeleton between the different cell lines used in those studies, we observe enrichment of Amot<sup>S176E</sup> to the plasma membrane, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al. (2013)</xref>, and enrichment of Amot<sup>S176A</sup> to the nucleus. Furthermore, our studies confirm previous findings and show that Amot is required for YAP activity and that the Amot<sup>S176A</sup> mutant displays prominent nuclear function by means of increased levels of YAP target gene expression, increased cell proliferation rates and higher colony formation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, in vivo studies are needed to clarify the role of Amot in different cell and tissue types. We further extended the analysis of Amot phosphorylation on the Amot-YAP-Merlin complex, by determining whether its formation depends on YAP<sup>S127</sup> phosphorylation site. In agreement with previous reports showing that the Amot-YAP interaction is independent of phosphorylation at YAP<sup>S127</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that the YAP-Merlin-Angiomotin complex also occurs independently of YAP<sup>S127</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of serine in each of YAP’s five HxRxxS consensus sites (S5A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2010b</xref>) precluded formation of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced association between the S5A and the Amot-merlin complex remain to be elucidated. However, this is not likely as a result of increased nuclear localization of YAP-S5A, since wild-type Amot can also be found in the nucleus in complex with wild type YAP. Therefore, it is likely that at least one additional post-translational modification of YAP could regulate the formation of the Amot-YAP-Merlin complex and future studies are needed to identify this modification.</p><p>We found that Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation induces association of the YAP-Merlin complex with Patj, Pals1 and E-cadherin, and that plasma membrane sequestration inhibits YAP activity. Several reports have described the localization of Amot at junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ernkvist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patrie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wells et al., 2006</xref>) and its colocalization with Patj/Pals1 via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). However, binding to Patj is not required for Amot’s localization to the plasma membrane, as a mutant lacking the PDZ binding motifs still localize to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugihara-Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that an additional mechanism can regulate Amot membrane localization, which is in agreement with our findings where phosphorylation of Amot<sup>S176</sup> induces localization of Amot-YAP-Merlin complex to the cell cortex. In HeLa, HEK293 and MDCK cells, Amot mediates YAP localization at the plasma membrane resulting in suppression of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paramasivam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we propose that phosphorylation of Amot triggers a shift of the YAP-Merlin complex from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, thus suppressing the nuclear activity of YAP and exerting cell growth and tumor suppressive functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Amot associates with Merlin and Rich1 at junctional structures and inhibits Rac1 and downstream signaling into the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation does not impact the ability to modulate Rac1 activity at the cell membrane. Yet, it is possible that Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation modulates Merlin’s nuclear function. Previous studies showed that nuclear accumulation of Merlin results in inhibition of the CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase. In <italic>NF2</italic>-mutant tumors, CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup> ubiquitinates Lats, suppressing phosphorylation and activating YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2010</xref>). In light of our findings, we can speculate that in the nucleus, Lats is inactivated by CRL4<sup>DCAF1</sup>-driven ubiquitylation and becomes unable to phosphorylate Amot, resulting in an increase of YAP transcriptional activity. However, if Lats remains active and Amot phosphorylation occurs, Amot-YAP-Merlin tertiary complex translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, resulting in suppression of YAP nuclear functions. Future studies will be required to shed light on this possibility.</p><p>Another open question pertains to what mechanism/s regulate Angiomotin/YAP localization. Lats1/2 are obvious candidates, as they were shown to phosphorylate both YAP and Amot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mana-Capelli et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of Lats1/2 in regulation of these proteins and the relationship between Lats, YAP and Angiomotin is complex. For example, a number of reports suggest that Lats phosphorylates Amot, leading to reduced binding to F-actin and increased YAP binding and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mana-Capelli et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Amot has been proposed to activate Lats2 and increase phosphorylation of YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paramasivam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we have previously shown that in multiple systems, Amot antagonizes the association of Lats and YAP and inhibits phosphorylation of YAP by Lats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Given the complexity of the interactions between Amot and YAP, addressing the role of Lats1/2 in regulating the translocation and activity of the Amot-YAP complex will require future studies. Another potential regulatory mechanism stems from the lack of interaction between Amot and YAP-S5A mentioned above. This finding suggests that additional phosphorylation events could regulate the complex. As a number of other kinases such as AMPK and CK1delta/epsilon have been shown to phosphorylate YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2010a</xref>). Further work will be required to determine the relevant phosphorylation sites and responsible kinases</p><p>In conclusion, our studies suggest a mechanism to explain the previous conflicting observations regarding the role of Amot by demonstrating that Amot<sup>S176</sup> phosphorylation state is a key event that dictates a positive or negative regulation of YAP by Amot by targeting the Amot-YAP-Merlin complex to the plasma membrane, sequestration in the cytoplasm or translocation to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and siRNAs</title><p>The expression plasmids for HA-Amot-p130, HA-Amot-p130<sup>S176A</sup> and HA-Amot-p130<sup>S176E</sup> were a gift from Dr. Hiroshi Sasaki (Kumamoto University, Japan).

The supernatant was kept as the plasma membrane fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoprecipitation and Rac1-GTP pull-down</title><p>HEK293-shAmot cells were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA (empty vector control/ wild type Amot-p130/Amot<sup>S176A</sup>/Amot<sup>S176E</sup>) and 48 hr later lysed in RIPA buffer and precipitated with indicated antibody overnight. Rac1-GTP was pulled down according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, #17–441).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>BrdU incorporation assay</title><p>HEK293-shAmot cells were seeded at a cell density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates. On the following day cells were co-transfected with 40 nM of siRNAs (targeting either YAP or a non-targeting siRNA duplex (control)), and 2 μg of plasmid DNA (empty vector control/ wild type Amot-p130/Amot<sup>S176A</sup>/Amot<sup>S176E</sup>) using TransIT-LT1 and TransIT-TKO (Mirus, Fisher Scientific, Illinois) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 hr, cells were trypsinized and 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well were reseeded in sterile 96-well tissue culture plates. 48 hr, 72 hr, and 96 hr after co-transfection, plates were processed and analysed using BrdU cell proliferation assay kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, #2750). Plates were read using a spectrophotometer microplate reader set to 450 nm (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>The HIP/HOP-flash luciferase reporter system was a kind gift from Dr. Barry Gumbiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gumbiner and Kim, 2014</xref>) and the GTIIC-luciferase reporter was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). HEK293 and HEK293-shAmot cells were seeded at a concentration of 40 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/50 μl in 96-well plates. On the following day the indicated luciferase reporters and plasmids were transfected to a total of 160 ng and incubated overnight at 37<bold>°</bold>C. Luciferase activity was then measured with Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega; #E1910) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The reporter’s firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the levels of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase used as an internal control reporter. The relative luciferase activity displayed on the Y-axis indicates the ratio between Firefly/<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)</title><p>Extraction of RNA from cell lysates was performed using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) followed by cDNA synthesis of 1 μg DNase-digested RNA, using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for quantitative RT–PCR (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR of the synthesized cDNA was conducted using SYBR Green 2x Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 10 ng of each sample were used in each analysis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and analysed using StepOne Software v2.2.2. All measurements were conducted three times in triplicate and standardized to the levels of GADPH. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated according to the 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Livak et al., 2001</xref>).

Fixation was halted with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer and chromatin was sheared with sonicator to obtain 0.3–0.5 kb DNA fragments. Angiomotin antibody (5 μg) and Dynabeads Protein A were added to the cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed with buffer 1 (150 mM NaCL, 20 mM TrisCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 65% w/v sucrose, 10% Triton-X-100, 20% SDS) and then washed with TE buffer. DNA was eluted by resuspending the beads in TE/1%SDS. ChIP DNA and Input were treated with RNase A (5 μg) for 1 hr at 37°C. Proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) was added and incubated overnight at 65°C to reverse crosslinking. DNA was then purified phenol:chloroform and resuspended in a 30 μL of elution buffer. DNA was used for real time-PCR using SYBR Green PCR kit. A standard dilution curve was obtained for each Input and 1 μL of ChIP DNA was used in each PCR reaction. Melt curves were analyzed to confirm specificity of the amplified target.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

Interestingly, however, the mutation of S176 to E induces a clear relocalization of Amot from the nucleus to the plasma membrane and the cytosolic fraction (with the plasma membrane localization very apparent by microscopy), while mutation to A result in strong nuclear signal. This is accompanied by a redistribution of YAP and Merlin (and in consequence of the complex) to the plasma membrane in the S176E cells, perhaps through augmented association with Pals1/Patj. The consequence of the phosphorylation status of Amot on proliferation / YAP activity was investigated, revealing strong activity of the S to A mutant in all assays, and inactivity of the S176E mutant. It provides evidence that AMOT facilitates YAP nuclear and transcriptional function, unless phosphorylated at ser 176, which facilitates AMOT interaction with plasma membrane proteins. The authors’ findings disagree with some previous conclusions about the role of AMOT, which they address well, and which makes the finding of importance.</p><p>All reviewers thought that this work was novel and interesting. However additional controls are considered necessary to demonstrate some of the reagents are specific, quantification is needed, and some of the conclusions should be moderated or caveats considered in the Discussion.</p><p>1) What is the expression level of the ectopically expressed Amot, compared to that endogenously expressed in HEK cells? Almost the entire analysis depends on exogenous expression of AMOT and AMOT mutants. It is well known that overexpression of proteins often leads to their accumulation in inappropriate compartments. Since so much of the conclusions and model depend on the idea of compartments and pools, it is essential that the authors ensure that their proteins are expressed at normal cellular levels, and that all mutants are expressed at similar levels</p><p>2) Ectopically expressed PATJ and PALS1 co-Ips with Amot and AmotS&gt;E, but not AmotS&gt;A. This may be due to Amot localization at the membrane versus nucleus. Is association of Amot with Patj/PALS1 really needed for the membrane localization of the complex? The authors should knockdown Patj/PALS1 (to see if localization of AmotS&gt;E changes) to support this conclusion.</p><p>3) Could the interaction (or non-interaction) of the Amot constructs with Patj and Pals1 be only a reflection of the differential proportion of the Amot constructs in the plasma membrane fraction where Patj and Pals1 reside? (i.e. is the differential association the cause of the localization or the consequence of altered localization?). As presented, this set of experiments is supportive of the differential localization, but does not necessarily demonstrate a direct role for association with Patj/Pals1 (especially as the PDZ motif is dispensable for Amot localization to the cortex). Is the association with Patj/Pals1 bringing Amot to the cortex? If more direct evidence for a preferential association of Amot S176E to Patj/Pals1 cannot be experimentally determined, the authors may want to revise the presentation of the associated results and conclusions.</p><p>Specific comments/suggestions to address in the Discussion:</p><p>4) Is it possible that overexpressed protein does not reveal a change in affinity upon altered phosphorylation?</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the 5A YAP results. Do they believe this can be explained by increased nuclear localization of 5AYAP?</p><p>6) The authors ignore the role of Lats, which is also thought to bind to AMOT, and the role of its phosphorylation of YAP in YAP regulation. Most studies on the hippo pathway agree that this phosphorylation event controls both the levels and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of YAP, but these two properties are not addressed. The authors do show that phosphorylation of YAP on ser 127 does not affect binding to AMOT, but do not show how AMOT regulates YAP phosphorylation or stability. Also, they do in fact see a change in binding of 5 ser &gt; ala YAP mutations, which have been shown to regulate YAP function in addition to s127. This difference must be considered.</p><p>7) There is no consideration of any upstream regulation of the pathway in either the experimental analysis or in the evaluation of the models and literature. What controls AMOT phosphorylation? Are Mst/hippo kinases involved in AMOT regulation? Are the authors imagining that this regulation has something to do with cell-cell contact control of the pathway? Or control by soluble growth factors and signaling receptors? In the absence of this broader context, it is very difficult to think about mechanisms and models. At the least this should be touched on in the Discussion.</p><p>8) Their model implies a constitutive binding of YAP to AMOT in the control YAP localization by AMOT, without considering catalytic effects, especially those that might be conferred by Lats phosphorylation. Similar to other models, it invokes simple sequestration at the membrane via AMOT-PATJ binding to restrain YAP. Yet only a small fraction of S176 AMOT seems to associate with membranes or PATJ. Similarly, the model implies that the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of YAP are all bound to AMOT. If a large fraction of YAP in the cytosol or nucleus is free, different mechanisms from the one proposed must be involved in controlling its localization.</p><p>9) The authors discuss previous studies showing that AMOT interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and that this interaction is regulated by AMOT phosphorylation. However, they do not address this potentially important pool of AMOT in their study. How does the actin associated pool fractionate in their protocol – with cytoplasmic, nuclear, or membrane fractions?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> vs. A and C. The amount of flag PATJ IPed by anti-flag seems extremely low in this panel compared to others, so lack of HA-AMOT S176A co-IPing doesn't seem to be a well-controlled finding.</p><p>11) Others have reported that cadherins can also interact with merlin-AMOT complexes at the membrane in addition to PATJ. Do the authors think that this may also be a significant interaction worth examining?</p><p>12) The interpretation that the interaction between YAP and Merlin is predominantly occurring in the nucleus and the cytoplasm is supported by the data, but quantification of these experiments would help providing an assessment as to whether this simply reflect the relative levels of YAP across the different fractions or whether there is evidence for a truly differential interaction across fractions. [This would also be consistent with all the results presented for the phosphorylation experiments, so I would suggest considering this possibility in the text]. Perhaps an alternative way to provide support for a compartment-specific interaction would be to employ a fluorescence-based approach (e.g. split GFP, FRET).</p><p>13) The presentation of the western blots (IP/western) should be accompanied by quantification. I was surprised that experiments that I would assume should be loaded on the same SDS page gel (e.g. different constructs for the rescue experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were shown as separate panels. In the absence of quantification, this makes it very difficult to comment on whether a reduction/increase in complex formation occurs following mutation at this site (though clearly, the interaction is not abrogated by these mutations).</p><p>14) What is the intracellular localization of endogenous Merlin (and YAP)? The localization experiments currently presented all depend upon transient transfection.</p><p>15) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, please provide supporting evidence for efficient Amot KD (if the same results have been also obtained with a different Amot hairpin, please also add the results in supplementary to confirm the specificity of the effect on complex formation).</p><p>16) If the phosphospecific antibody works in IF, it would be nice to provide additional evidence that the phosphorylated form is enriched in the plasma membrane fraction (alternatively, this could be done by immunoblotting). This would support the results obtained with the S to E mutation.</p><p>17) What is the relative level of expression (in relation to the endogenous) of the different Amot constructs? Similarly, the authors may want to comment on the expression levels of the other constructs they used in relation to the respective endogenous proteins. Could some of the results observed due to overexpression / tagging artifacts?</p><p>18) Concerning the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> (as per Discussion), since a YAP protein in which the 5 serines are mutated to alanines predominantly resides in the nucleus, could it be that the nuclear sequestration is the primary cause of the absence of complex formation?</p><p>19) Other comments: – this likely happened through PDF generation during submission, but the quality of the images is problematic. Labels do not display clearly, and microscopy images are extremely difficult to evaluate. The authors need to provide high quality images with the revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23966.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] All reviewers thought that this work was novel and interesting.

Assessment of expression of the different Amot alleles and comparison to endogenous Amot levels are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Overall, we find the levels of exogenous Amot to be approximately 1.5 to 2 –fold higher than endogenous.

In addition, while responding to other review comments, we are able to detect enhanced association of the AmotS&gt;E mutant with E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

If one hypothesizes that phosphorylation at S176 has an impact on the affinity of Amot towards merlin or YAP, it would be expected that the S176A or S176E mutants would have different effects on affinity and association with their binding partners, which is not what we observed in our studies.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should discuss the 5A YAP results. Do they believe this can be explained by increased nuclear localization of 5AYAP?</italic> </p><p>The literature indicates the S5A mutant is preferentially localized to the nucleus. The experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> suggests that the YAP-S5A mutant is no longer associated with the Amot-merlin complex. We don’t think it has to do with the increased nuclear localization of YAP-S5A, since wild-type Amot (which was used in the study shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) can also be found in the nucleus in complex with wild type YAP (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Clearly additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved. We included a discussion of this in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The authors ignore the role of Lats, which is also thought to bind to AMOT, and the role of its phosphorylation of YAP in YAP regulation. Most studies on the hippo pathway agree that this phosphorylation event controls both the levels and nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of YAP, but these two properties are not addressed. The authors do show that phosphorylation of YAP on ser 127 does not affect binding to AMOT, but do not show how AMOT regulates YAP phosphorylation or stability. Also, they do in fact see a change in binding of 5 ser &gt; ala YAP mutations, which have been shown to regulate YAP function in addition to s127. This difference must be considered.</italic> </p><p>Although we did briefly discuss the role of Lats in the paper, the role of Lats is complicated and not straightforward. Indeed Lats1/2 phosphorylate and regulate YAP localization and levels and a number of studies have shown Lats regulates phosphorylation of Amot on S176. However, the relationship between Lats, YAP and Angiomotin is complex. For example, a number of papers suggest that Lats phosphorylates Amot, leading to reduced binding to F-actin and increased YAP binding and inhibition (Chan, JBC, 2013 and Mana-Capelli, MBC, 2014). Moreover, Amot has been proposed to activate Lats2 and increase phosphorylation of YAP (Paramasivam, MBC, 2011 and Chan, JBC, 2013). In contrast, we have previously shown that in multiple systems, Amot antagonizes the association of Lats and YAP and inhibits phosphorylation of YAP by Lats (Yi, Sci Signal, 2013). Given the complexity of the interactions between YAP, Amot and YAP, we believe this question requires a more extensive and in depth analysis which is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Some of the issues raised in our response are also addressed in the Discussion of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) There is no consideration of any upstream regulation of the pathway in either the experimental analysis or in the evaluation of the models and literature. What controls AMOT phosphorylation? Are Mst/hippo kinases involved in AMOT regulation? Are the authors imagining that this regulation has something to do with cell-cell contact control of the pathway? Or control by soluble growth factors and signaling receptors? In the absence of this broader context, it is very difficult to think about mechanisms and models. At the least this should be touched on in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this point. We initially left this out due to space considerations. In particular, while are many possible scenarios involving regulation of Amot activity by upstream events, since S176 has been shown to be phosphorylated by Lats, we can speculate that many of the upstream events regulating the Hippo cascade will also regulate Amot. We now include this in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>8) Their model implies a constitutive binding of YAP to AMOT in the control YAP localization by AMOT, without considering catalytic effects, especially those that might be conferred by Lats phosphorylation. Similar to other models, it invokes simple sequestration at the membrane via AMOT-PATJ binding to restrain YAP. Yet only a small fraction of S176 AMOT seems to associate with membranes or PATJ. Similarly, the model implies that the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of YAP are all bound to AMOT. If a large fraction of YAP in the cytosol or nucleus is free, different mechanisms from the one proposed must be involved in controlling its localization.</italic> </p><p>We agree that examining the dynamics of the association of the complex would be useful, however, given space and time limitations we did not yet get to do these types of analyses.</p><p>We agree that a fraction of Amot-S176E appears to be localized to the PM, while additional protein is found in the cytoplasm and none in the nucleus (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In the same figure, YAP is found in all 3 fractions. Importantly, our previous studies (Yi et al., 2013) and those of others suggest that Amot is required for YAP function in the nucleus. Thus, if Amot is the limiting factor and is excluded from the nucleus this should impair the nuclear function of YAP regardless of whether there is “free” YAP elsewhere in the cell. In this model, it is not just simply the exclusion of YAP from the nucleus, but also the exclusion of a limiting factor, namely Amot, that impairs the nuclear function of YAP. In a reciprocal manner, the Amot-S176A mutant is distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and the majority of YAP is nuclear and bound to AmotS176A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Overall this is an excellent point raised by the reviewer and we expanded on this in the discussion of the model in the manuscript. Having said all this, it is indeed quite likely that additional mechanisms are involved in regulation of YAP function.</p><p><italic>9) The authors discuss previous studies showing that AMOT interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and that this interaction is regulated by AMOT phosphorylation. However, they do not address this potentially important pool of AMOT in their study. How does the actin associated pool fractionate in their protocol – with cytoplasmic, nuclear, or membrane fractions?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the revised version of the manuscript we include data assessing the association of the different Amot alleles with F-actin. While most of the other reports relied on co-localization by IF and in vitro studies using purified protein, we wished to directly assess the interaction of Amot with F-actin in cells. To achieve this, we used biotin-XX-phalloidin which preferentially binds F-actin. We then precipitated the F-actin from cells transfected with the different Amot mutants and assessed the levels of Amot that were co-precipitated. This analysis shows that there are no differences in the association of the different mutants with F-actin. While our findings contrast with some of the previous reports regarding the association of Amot with F-actin, we believe that the approach we employed directly assess the interaction between F-actin and Amot, while other reported efforts employed methods that are either indirect (IF) or in vitro. We include this new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and Discussion.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> vs. A and C. The amount of flag PATJ IPed by anti-flag seems extremely low in this panel compared to others, so lack of HA-AMOT S176A co-IPing doesn't seem to be a well-controlled finding.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. We now provide a revised figure in which the levels of IPed PATJ are similar between the different conditions.</p><p><italic>11) Others have reported that cadherins can also interact with merlin-AMOT complexes at the membrane in addition to PATJ. Do the authors think that this may also be a significant interaction worth examining?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We indeed examined this and find that Amot can co-IP with E-cadherin. Moreover, as in the case of PATJ/Pals1 the association is enhanced with the Amot-S176E mutant. We include this new information in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and in the text of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>12) The interpretation that the interaction between YAP and Merlin is predominantly occurring in the nucleus and the cytoplasm is supported by the data, but quantification of these experiments would help providing an assessment as to whether this simply reflect the relative levels of YAP across the different fractions or whether there is evidence for a truly differential interaction across fractions. [This would also be consistent with all the results presented for the phosphorylation experiments, so I would suggest considering this possibility in the text]. Perhaps an alternative way to provide support for a compartment-specific interaction would be to employ a fluorescence-based approach (e.g. split GFP, FRET).</italic> </p><p>As noted by the reviewer, the data support the formation of the Merlin/YAP/Amot complex predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and this interaction does not appear to be regulated by phosphorylation status of S176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We agree that while the data suggests that the relative levels of YAP in the different compartment might underlie the reason for detecting the complex mostly in cytoplasm and nucleus, there could be other factors regulating the interaction. For example, other PTMs on YAP and/or Amot could impact the interaction at the plasma membrane. However, identifying and characterizing these potential events will require an extensive amount of time and effort and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. As suggested by the reviewer, we included a brief discussion of this possibility in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>13) The presentation of the western blots (IP/western) should be accompanied by quantification. I was surprised that experiments that I would assume should be loaded on the same SDS page gel (e.g. different constructs for the rescue experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were shown as separate panels. In the absence of quantification, this makes it very difficult to comment on whether a reduction/increase in complex formation occurs following mutation at this site (though clearly, the interaction is not abrogated by these mutations).</italic> </p><p>We agree that it would have been beneficial to have all the samples run on the same gel. However, given the number of samples and the need for clear boundaries between the lanes we had to run the samples on separate gels. Regardless, western blotting using film is only semi-quantitative and therefore for relying on relatively small changes in band intensity, such as those referred to in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, is problematic. Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility of minor changes to the affinity of the complex, as the reviewer noted the interaction between Merlin and YAP is not abrogated by the changes in status of Amot-S176. This point does not really alter our interpretation of the results. Further detailed analysis using purified proteins and assessment of complex affinity by sophisticated biochemical approaches will be needed to further resolve this issue.</p><p><italic>14) What is the intracellular localization of endogenous Merlin (and YAP)?
