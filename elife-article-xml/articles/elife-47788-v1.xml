bivalves. We investigated a disseminated neoplasia affecting geographically distant populations of two species of mussels (<italic>Mytilus chilensis</italic> in South America and <italic>M. edulis</italic> in Europe). Sequencing alleles from four loci (two nuclear and two mitochondrial) provided evidence of transmissible cancer in both species. Phylogenetic analysis of cancer-associated alleles and analysis of diagnostic SNPs showed that cancers in both species likely arose in a third species of mussel (<italic>M. trossulus</italic>), but these cancer cells are independent from the previously identified transmissible cancer in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> from Canada. Unexpectedly, cancers from <italic>M. chilensis</italic> and <italic>M. edulis</italic> are nearly identical, showing that the same cancer lineage affects both. Thus, a single transmissible cancer lineage has crossed into two new host species and has been transferred across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47788.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells can grow and spread in one individual, but they normally do not spread to others. There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, there are cancers in Tasmanian devils, dogs and bivalve shellfish that can spread to other members of the same species. In these creatures, cancer from one individual evolved the ability to spread throughout the population. These cancer cells infect animals like a pathogen.</p><p>A fatal cancer called disseminated neoplasia affects many species of bivalves. In four bivalve species, including the marine mussel <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic>, scientists have shown that the cancer can spread from one individual to another. This transmissible cancer has been found in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> mussels in British Columbia, Canada; but related species of mussels in other parts of the world also develop disseminated neoplasia. It is possible these other cancers are transmissible and have spread from one population of mussels to another.</p><p>Yonemitsu et al. performed genetic analyses to show that cancers found in two other mussel species – <italic>Mytilus chilensis</italic> in South America and <italic>Mytilus edulis</italic> in Europe – are transmissible and arose in <italic>M. trossulus.</italic> The cancers in the South American and European mussels were nearly identical genetically, which suggests that they came from a single <italic>M. trossulus</italic> mussel with cancer at some point in the past. Somehow cancer cells spread between the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres and across the Atlantic Ocean, infecting multiple species across the world. The analyses also show that this cancer lineage is different from the one previously identified in British Columbia.</p><p>These analyses show that bivalve transmissible neoplasia was able to spread worldwide, most likely through accidental transport of infected mussels on international shipping vessels. This suggests that human activities unwittingly introduced the disease to new areas. Learning more about transmissible cancers may help scientists understand how cancers evolve with their hosts in extreme situations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transmissible cancer</kwd><kwd>bivalve</kwd><kwd>bivalve transmissible neoplasia</kwd><kwd><italic>Mytilus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mytilus chilensis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mytilus edulis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22 CA226047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Metzger</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Goff Lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goff</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXROP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polo-Prieto</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDECYT1180705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arriagada</surname><given-names>Gloria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Montpellier Université d'Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BLUECANCER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammel</surname><given-names>Maurine</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Alexis</given-names></name><name><surname>Bierne</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE35-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammel</surname><given-names>Maurine</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Alexis</given-names></name><name><surname>Bierne</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-0670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vázquez</surname><given-names>Nuria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A transmissible cancer that arose in a marine mussel spread from a single animal to become a global pathogen affecting two other mussel species in both Europe and South America.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancers normally arise from mutations in an organism’s own cells, and they either regress or continue to grow until they kill the host organism. In a few cases, however, including Tasmanian devils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pye et al., 2016</xref>), dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murgia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rebbeck et al., 2009</xref>), and bivalves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>), cancer cells naturally transfer from one animal to another as an infectious allograft, leading to lineages of transmissible cancer that spread through the populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger and Goff, 2016</xref>). In bivalves, disseminated neoplasia (also called hemic neoplasia) is a leukemia-like disease that has been found in more than a dozen marine species, characterized by an amplification of rounded, polyploid cells in the hemolymph of animals that infiltrate into tissues. This disease often occurs in outbreaks and has led to significant population losses in many bivalve species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carballal et al., 2015</xref>). Pollution and retroviruses had been investigated as suspected causes, but until recently the etiology of disseminated neoplasia in bivalves was unknown. In four of the bivalve species affected by disseminated neoplasia (soft-shell clams, <italic>Mya arenaria</italic>; cockles, <italic>Cerastoderma edule</italic>; golden carpet shell clams, <italic>Polititapes aureus</italic>; and bay mussels, <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic>), recent investigation has shown that the diseases are bivalve transmissible neoplasias (BTNs), showing that transmissible cancer may, in fact, be a common phenomenon in marine invertebrates.</p><p>Disseminated neoplasia has been reported in marine mussels as early as 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farley, 1969</xref>), and has been observed consistently throughout Europe in both <italic>M. edulis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Alderman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowe and Moore, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rasmussen, 1986</xref>) and <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciocan and Sunila, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gombač et al., 2013</xref>), albeit at lower prevalence than has been observed in some <italic>M. trossulus</italic> populations, which reached &gt;20% in some locations in the 1980s and was associated with population losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bower et al., 1994</xref>). Mussels in the genus <italic>Mytilus</italic> form a complex of species, including <italic>M. trossulus</italic>, <italic>M. edulis</italic>, and <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic>, native to the northern hemisphere, and <italic>M. chilensis, M. platensis, and M. planulatus</italic>, native to the southern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zbawicka et al., 2018</xref>). These species have an anti-tropical distribution, spanning the temperate waters of the world, and they can hybridize, leading to widespread introgression of allospecific alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fraïsse et al., 2016</xref>) as well as hybrid zones in several locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bierne et al., 2003</xref>). Disseminated neoplasia has been reported in four of these <italic>Mytilus</italic> species across multiple continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carballal et al., 2015</xref>), but so far the only lineage of disseminated neoplasia in the genus that has been directly confirmed to be a transmissible cancer is in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> along the Pacific coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A population genetics analysis of <italic>M. edulis</italic> from France, conducted to detect hybridization and introgression between <italic>Mytilus</italic> species by detecting species-specific SNPs, identified a few individuals with unexpected ‘chimeric’ signals. The DNA samples from these individuals included <italic>M. trossulus</italic> alleles in a population where that species was absent, and the ratio of the <italic>M. edulis</italic> and <italic>M. trossulus</italic> alleles were not consistent with a diploid hybrid genome. Instead, this could be better explained by a mixture of two genotypes (one <italic>M. edulis</italic> and one <italic>M. trossulus</italic> in origin) within a single individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riquet et al., 2017</xref>). This suggested the hypothesis that <italic>M. edulis</italic> in France are affected by a BTN originating from <italic>M. trossulus</italic>, possibly the same lineage as previously identified in Canada. More recently, analysis of a severe mass mortality event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benabdelmouna and Ledu, 2016</xref>) in French mussels that began in 2014 led to the observation of disseminated neoplasia in many populations of <italic>M. edulis</italic> and <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benadelmouna et al., 2018</xref>), although it has not yet been determined whether this neoplasia is transmissible.</p><p><italic>M. chilensis</italic> mussels are found along the western coast of South America, and disseminated neoplasia has been reported in multiple populations in Chile and Argentina since 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lohrmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cremonte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campalans et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremonte et al., 2011</xref>).

DNA was extracted from tissues of three diseased animals and three normal animals, and an intron-spanning region in the nuclear gene Elongation Factor one alpha (<italic>EF1α</italic>) was amplified and sequenced. A normal individual would be expected to have one or two alleles (depending on whether it was homozygous or heterozygous at that locus), and a cancer would be expected to have its own set of alleles, derived from its original host. All three normal animals had one or two alleles, as expected, but two of the diseased animals (Mch41 and Mch42) had four distinct alleles, consistent with a mixture of two host alleles and two cancer-specific alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, each diseased sample had two alleles that were unique (corresponding to host alleles), but two alleles from animal Mch41 were nearly exact matches to two alleles from Mch42 (here notated as G and H). This is consistent with the presence of a transmissible cancer containing alleles G and H. These cancer-associated alleles were not cloned from one of the three diseased animals (Mch23), but cloning of PCR products is not very sensitive.

This finding of a single lineage crossing into multiple species across such vast distances is unexpected. Phylogenetic evidence from four loci and SNP data from 13 diagnostic nuclear SNPs show that the lineage identified here (<italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2) is distinct from <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1, and that it too arose from a <italic>M. trossulus</italic> individual before crossing into other <italic>Mytilus</italic> species, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riquet et al., 2017</xref>).

The most likely route of transmission is human intervention, specifically the transportation of animals harboring neoplastic cells in or on shipping vessels. While it is difficult to experimentally prove that a particular disease transmission was due to accidental transport on shipping vessels, examples of anthropogenic introduction of invasive species via shipping transport and aquaculture are common throughout the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molnar et al., 2008</xref>). The accidental anthropogenic introduction of <italic>Mytilus</italic> species includes <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic> introduced in northern Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daguin and Borsa, 2000</xref>) and Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zbawicka et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>M. edulis</italic> introduced in BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crego-Prieto et al., 2015</xref>) and the Kerguelen Islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fraisse et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>M. trossulus</italic> into Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). Since <italic>Mytilus</italic> species are known to adhere to ships and spread accidentally across the world, and transmissible cancer can have an incubation period of weeks to months, any diseased animal which adheres to a ship could lead to the spread of a transmissible cancer to new and potentially susceptible populations. If transmissible cancers are able to readily travel along shipping lines and infect closely related species, then this and other lineages of transmissible cancer have the potential for world-wide reach.</p><p>When identifying identical or nearly identical sequences in samples from different locations, care must be taken to prevent a small amount of contamination from leading to a false positive. In this case, the initial sequencing and amplification of the <italic>EF1α</italic> loci from <italic>M. edulis</italic> and <italic>M. chilensis</italic> samples were conducted by different people at different sites before any plasmids containing the sequence from one site had been transferred to the other. The <italic>EF1α</italic> qPCR assay was independently replicated on European <italic>M. edulis</italic> infected individuals in two labs, in USA and France. Also, the finding of slight differences between the two subgroups of this cancer lineage argue against a single source of contamination. Additionally, qPCR verification confirms that a significant fraction of the DNA of each sample contains the cancer-associated allele, and that it is not found in DNA samples from normal animals, which have been treated in the same way. Therefore, the data could not be due to contamination with a small amount of DNA and represents genuine identification of a nearly identical cancer from mussels of different continents and species.</p><p>Invertebrates do not possess a vertebrate-like adaptive immune system or a major histocompatibility complex, which vertebrates utilize for discriminating self from nonself. However, in most previously identified cases of BTN, the neoplasia has only been identified in the species of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>), and attempts to experimentally transfer neoplastic cells from <italic>M. trossulus</italic> or the soft-shell clam <italic>Mya arenaria</italic> into several bivalve species have only been successful when the transfer is between members of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kent et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>). The species in the <italic>Mytilus</italic> complex are able to hybridize, so the barrier to cross-species transmission may be relatively low. However, it has been reported that the disseminated neoplasia found on the Pacific coast of North America (which was identified as originating from <italic>M. trossulus</italic>) was found in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> at a much higher prevalence than <italic>M. edulis</italic> in the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muttray et al., 2007</xref>), which suggested that the <italic>M. trossulus</italic> cancer preferentially infected <italic>M. trossulus</italic> hosts. It is currently unknown whether <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 would be able to infect its original host species or if the original host has evolved resistance, as was suggested with the cancer derived from the pullet shell clam <italic>Venerupis corrugata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>M. chilensis</italic> is closely related to <italic>M. edulis</italic>, and it has even been suggested that it could be considered a subspecies, <italic>M. edulis platensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borsa et al., 2012</xref>), although this is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zbawicka et al., 2018</xref>), so once the cancer was able to cross into either <italic>M. chilensis</italic> or <italic>M. edulis</italic>, the second jump into the other species may have presented a lower barrier. Based on analysis of transmissible cancers in devils and dogs it has been hypothesized that transmissible cancers primarily occur in inbred populations, but the finding of this cancer spreading into highly outbred individuals from multiple different species within the same genus shows that this constraint is not universal.</p><p>The evidence for mitochondrial heteroplasmy and recombination observed in this cancer lineage and its loss or gain is a very interesting observation that suggests a dynamic mitochondrial population in BTN, which may not exactly match the nuclear evolutionary path. It has been shown that mitochondria in CTVT has been replaced several times by mitochondrial capture of new normal mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rebbeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strakova et al., 2016</xref>), so a dynamic mitochondrial population may be a common feature among transmissible cancers. It is also possible that one of the two cancer-associated mtCR regions could be a nuclear-to-mitochondrial transfer (numt) of a copy of the control region instead of mitochondrial heteroplasmy, as this possibility cannot be excluded by PCR of total extracted DNA. If this were the case, the sequences would still be evidence of an <italic>M. trossulus</italic>-derived transmissible cancer that is distinct from <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1. Mitochondrial replacement has not yet been described in any BTN, so further analysis will be required to determine the full recombinant cancer mitogenomes and to test whether there is any selective advantage of this recombinant mitogenome in <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2.</p><p>Comparison of cancer-associated sequences to those found in normal <italic>M. trossulus</italic> populations may allow us to identify the location of the origin of these cancer lineages. BLAST searches for the neoplasia-associated alleles most closely match <italic>M. trossulus</italic> from the Baltic and BC. The <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 recombinant mitochondrial sequences closely match the recombinant sequence first identified in the Baltic (62mc10), but this haplotype is actually rare in the Baltic, with similar recombinant haplotypes more commonly found on the coast of Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Śmietanka and Burzyński, 2017</xref>). This suggests that this cancer lineage originated in Northern Europe, but it may not necessarily be from the Baltic. However, there are populations of <italic>M. trossulus</italic> in many locations around the world, and not all have been sequenced at the loci analyzed here. Additionally, the mtCR C and D alleles may be directly related to 62mc10, or they may represent novel recombinations in the same region (there is a single base difference in the recombination region between the D allele and 62mc10 which suggests that the recombination points are not identical). Multiple recombination events in which male sequence has recombined into the female mitochondrial lineage in that region (including several cases with tandem duplications) have been identified in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burzyński et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, while exact matches of a <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 <italic>H4</italic> allele was identified in <italic>M. trossulus</italic> from BC, exact matches of the alleles at other loci have not been identified in any wild <italic>M. trossulus</italic> populations. Therefore, the exact population of origin of this cancer remains uncertain.</p><p>Overall, these data show that two lineages of cancer from two separate <italic>M. trossulus</italic> individuals have turned into BTN lineages, and one of these lineages (<italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2) has spread world-wide throughout multiple host species. This spread also suggests that anthropogenic influence may exacerbate the spread of cancers and may allow access into new environments and new populations, where the pathogenic potential is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>M. chilensis</italic> collection and diagnosis</title><p>60 individual market-sized mussels (mean, 67.6 mm; range, 52–92 mm in the longest axis) were collected in February 2012 from a culture at Bahía Brown (54°52´S, 67°31´W), Beagle Channel, Argentina.

For all targets, one primer set was designed to specifically amplify a cancer-associated allele for a given locus (<italic>EF1α</italic>: Allele H; <italic>H4</italic>: Allele RM and KNS; mtCR: Allele C and D: mt<italic>COI</italic>: Allele B). A second pair of universal control primers were designed to amplify all <italic>Mytilus</italic> alleles at each locus. Primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Standards for all targets consisted of a single plasmid containing the relevant cancer-associated allele target, which was linearized by NotI-HF (NEB) restriction digest before qPCR. Serial dilutions (10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>1</sup> copies) of linearized standard plasmid in triplicate were used to generate a standard curve for each qPCR run. In all experimental cases, 10–100 ng of each genomic DNA sample was run in triplicate 10 µl reactions.</p><p>All qPCR assays were performed using the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and associated software. Allele-specific qPCR at the <italic>EF1α</italic> locus was comprised of a 3-step cycling stage (95°C for 15 s, 50°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 30 s, respectively) for 40 cycles, whereas qPCR at the <italic>H4,</italic> mtCR, and mt<italic>COI</italic> loci were run using a 2-step cycling stage protocol (95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s) for 40 cycles. A melting curve was generated to determine amplification specificity according to the following parameters: an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 15 s, followed by a gradual temperature increase from 60°C to 95°C (Ramp of +0.3°C). The ratio of the cancer-associated allele to all alleles present at a given locus was calculated for each sample using the average copy number amplified by cancer-associated primers in triplicate reactions divided by the average copy number amplified by the universal primers in triplicate reactions. For each sample, the limit of detection for the allele-specific qPCR was set at 10 copies/reaction, and DNA samples were discarded if the universal <italic>Mytilus</italic> reaction at any of the loci yielded &lt;5000 copies/reaction (upper limit of detection of 0.2%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SNP array</title><p>The SNPs used were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2018</xref>). They were identified as being diagnostic (nearly fixed for alternative alleles) in a large sequence dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fraïsse et al., 2016</xref>) and were subsequently verified to remain diagnostic with larger sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2019</xref>). Non-hybrid individuals can nonetheless occasionally be heterozygous at one, or very rarely at two, of these diagnostic loci because incomplete lineage sorting and introgression is pervasive in the <italic>M. edulis</italic> complex of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fraïsse et al., 2018</xref>), but never at more than two loci. Genotyping was subcontracted to LGC-genomics and performed with the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semagn et al., 2014</xref>). The results are a combination of two fluorescence values, one for allele 1 (x), and another for allele 2 (y), the <italic>M. trossulus</italic>-specific allele. Following a method used for genotyping polyploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuenca et al., 2013</xref>), we transformed the data to have a single measure of the relative fluorescence of the two alleles, from 0 when the fluorescence of allele one dominates, to one when the fluorescence of allele 2 (<italic>i.e.</italic> the <italic>M. trossulus</italic> allele) dominates, using the following formula: y’=y/(x+y). The fluorescence of the <italic>M. trossulus</italic> alleles was averaged over all 13 diagnostic loci for each species to obtain a compound multi-locus estimate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors express their gratitude to Lic.

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A single clonal lineage of transmissible cancer identified in two marine mussel species in South America and Europe&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom served as guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The identification of an independent origin of a transmissible cancer has the potential to impact the field significantly. This can inform on the likelihood of neoplastic transformation and transmission. In this paper the authors argue that an infectious cancer in two mussel species likely originated in a third species. Bivalve neoplasia had been previously documented in this third species (<italic>M. trossulus</italic>), but the authors claim that the cancer from this study differs from the previously identified cancer in <italic>M. trossulus</italic>. The authors are making two claims: (1) BTN2 is distinct from BTN1, and (2) BTN2 has spread from the Pacific coast of South America to the Atlantic coast of Europe.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Sequencing additional loci is needed to definitively show that BTN2 in Chile/Argentina is in fact the same cancer strain found in Europe. Also, sequencing less than 1kb over 3 loci makes drawing conclusions about origin and hybridization tricky. As example, how did they determine that the EF1a 'cancer' alleles were not copy number variants in the host? Were noncancerous tissues tested for absence of these alleles in carrier individuals? Finally, with such small sequencing, how are the authors certain they are not sequencing numts, which are common in numerous marine invertebrate species. Additional sequencing will be needed to respond to this.</p><p>2) Gene trees and species trees are often discordant, and the authors have not sampled enough loci and enough of the coalescent history to resolve this discordance. Gene discordance across the genome is now more the rule than the exception. The single coalescent history of the asexual BTN lineage should help ameliorate some of this, but more than three markers are needed. Also, in the same vein, the authors themselves highlight, their &quot;tree&quot; is incompatible with the G and H alleles coming from BTN1S. But this is based on one locus, which is insufficient.</p><p>Issues that affect interpretation of the data: response should either include significant clarification or rewriting of sections:</p><p>1) What is meant by &quot;a fraction&quot; of <italic>M. trossulus</italic>&quot; SNPs? How many? Might this be sequencing error?</p><p>2) What is meant by: We sequenced…and found more than the normal two alleles in &quot;most&quot; of them…What is &quot;most&quot;? There are many such examples.</p><p>3) The qPCR results from attempted cloning of disease alleles is confusing. Finding that two of four disease <italic>M. chilensis</italic> animals have high levels of the cancer associated allele while the other two did not – are the authors suggesting yet another transmissible cancer lineage?</p><p>4) Given the inability to consistently amplify cancer alleles in various samples, it is unclear how any conclusions regarding the contribution of the Canadian samples and <italic>M. trossulus</italic> can be made.</p><p>5) It is also unclear how to interpret the fact that H4 cancer associated alleles are found in several normal <italic>M. trossulus</italic> animals. How many is &quot;some?&quot;</p><p>6) Sequencing less than 1kb over 3 loci makes drawing conclusions about origin and hybridization tricky. As example, how did they determine that the EF1a 'cancer' alleles were not copy number variants in the host? Were noncancerous tissues tested for absence of these alleles in carrier individuals? Specifically, looking only at normal alleles, there is a clear grouping based on species of origin in a phylogenetic tree There are three exceptions to this clustering, from one normal <italic>M. trossulus</italic> (MW59) and two diseased <italic>M. chilensis</italic> (Mch41 and Castro26) with some distinctly <italic>M. edulis</italic>-like alleles. These may reflect introgression or true hybrid individuals-MW59 also has an EF1α allele corresponding to <italic>M. edulis</italic> and likely represents a hybrid with this species, which has been introduced into Canada (Crego-Prieto et al., 2015).&quot; This sort of noise, although expected, becomes problematic when it encompasses a third of the data. Please explain in more detail your rationale for your conclusions and include a discussion of caveats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47788.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Sequencing additional loci is needed to definitively show that BTN2 in Chile/Argentina is in fact the same cancer strain found in Europe.

We have sequence data from an additional mitochondrial locus (mt<italic>COI</italic>), which confirms that alleles from <italic>M. edulis</italic> and <italic>M. chilensis</italic> are identical and derived from <italic>M. trossulus</italic>, and that they are distinct from <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1 (Figure 4). We did find that two samples from Chile showed evidence of recombination (the only evidence of recombination detected so far across all loci tested). We also used a SNP array on cancerous mussels as well as a large sample of healthy individuals to identify the presence of SNPs that are unique to <italic>M. trossulus</italic> (Figure 6). This allowed us to look at many independent nuclear loci to confirm that the cancer cells are <italic>M. trossulus</italic> in origin, and that this signal of <italic>M. trossulus</italic> SNPs could not be found in any normal animals from <italic>M. chilensis</italic> or <italic>M. edulis</italic> populations.</p><p>Regarding the question of whether the additional alleles could be simply copy number variation, the reviewers are correct that the finding of multiple alleles alone is not sufficient to support the claim of a transmissible cancer – the key finding is that there are multiple alleles and that some of those are cancer-associated alleles that are identical between independent individuals. Genome duplication within an <italic>M. chilensis</italic> individual, for example, would be expected to give rise to multiple alleles phylogenetically related to normal <italic>M. chilensis</italic> alleles. It would not be expected to give rise to a second allele which is nearly identical to that of a different species. And it would not be expected to generate exactly the same sequence in multiple individuals from two different species.</p><p>Additionally, we saw no evidence of multiple alleles in any normal samples. When conducting PCR and sequencing from total DNA it is not possible to distinguish a true mitochondrial gene from a nuclear-to-mitochondrial transfer (numt). The reviewers are correct that we cannot rule this out, and we have clarified this in the text. However, if one of the cancer associated “mtCR” alleles were to be a numt, for example, it would not change the conclusion that there is sequence derived from <italic>M. trossulus</italic> mitochondrial DNA that is nearly identical in cancers across multiple individuals in two species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Gene trees and species trees are often discordant, and the authors have not sampled enough loci and enough of the coalescent history to resolve this discordance. Gene discordance across the genome is now more the rule than the exception.

Also, in the same vein, the authors themselves highlight, their &quot;tree&quot; is incompatible with the G and H alleles coming from BTN1S. But this is based on one locus, which is insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>Gene trees and species trees are often discordant, but as the reviewers mention, a clonal transmissible cancer is asexual, so we do not expect to see discordance between a gene tree and a cancer lineage tree except in the case of recombination. We do see some discordance in the normal sexual mussel samples, as expected (i.e. <italic>M. chilensis</italic> has introgressed <italic>M. trossulus</italic> sequence at the <italic>EF1alpha</italic> locus and a small number of individuals appear to be hybrids), but we see no discordance between any of the gene trees in any of the four loci, with the exception of the mitochondrial recombination at one locus in two Chilean samples. Also, at all loci, the gene trees support a clonal expansion of a nearly identical asexual lineage derived from <italic>M. trossulus</italic> and distinct from <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1. We had specifically highlighted the evidence that neither allele G nor H were likely to have a common cancer ancestor with allele S, as noted, but we had not specifically mentioned that each other locus provides similar evidence. For example, at <italic>H4</italic>, normal <italic>M. trossulus</italic> samples were identified with alleles that were exactly identical to the alleles found in both <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1 and 2. It is therefore unlikely that BTN1 and 2 arose from a single individual and multiple loci diverged to become more closely related to other normal sequences in the population. We have clarified this in the text. The addition of the fourth locus and the data from 13 <italic>M. trossulus</italic>-specific SNPs should also provide further evidence of these claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issues that affect interpretation of the data: response should either include significant clarification or rewriting of sections:</p><p>1) What is meant by &quot;a fraction&quot; of M. trossulus&quot; SNPs? How many? Might this be sequencing error?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a brief explanation of previously published data in which a SNP array was used to assay diversity in a population of <italic>M. edulis</italic> individuals, and it was worded unclearly. The authors of that study noted that at some loci, there was a fluorescence signal corresponding to the <italic>M. trossulus</italic> allele, which should not be present in the population. More unexpected, however, was the fact that the alleles were not the expected fraction of the total alleles. A single SNP would be expected to be present at 0% (allele 1 homozygous), 50% (heterozygous with both alleles 1 and 2), or 100% (allele 2 homozygous) of the DNA at a single locus in a sample, but in these samples the fraction of the <italic>M. trossulus</italic> alleles were between these numbers (e.g. 30%). This suggested that the DNA sample tested could be a combination of two genomes, one a normal <italic>M. edulis</italic> genome and one a cancer from <italic>M. trossulus</italic>. This by itself is clearly not conclusive, and it led to the current study of those samples and others. We have attempted to expand and clarify our explanation of this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is meant by: We sequenced…and found more than the normal two alleles in &quot;most&quot; of them…What is &quot;most&quot;? There are many such examples.</p></disp-quote><p>In every case of ambiguous words, such as “many” or “most,” we have replaced them with specific numbers. In the case specifically mentioned, “most” of four samples was three samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The qPCR results from attempted cloning of disease alleles is confusing. Finding that two of four disease M. chilensis animals have high levels of the cancer associated allele while the other two did not – are the authors suggesting yet another transmissible cancer lineage?</p></disp-quote><p>That is a likely possibility. Based on the complete absence of <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 alleles at all four loci in those two <italic>M. chilensis</italic> samples, we conclude that those two samples do not have <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2. They therefore either 1) were misdiagnosed, 2) have conventional cancers that are not transmissible, or 3) have yet another transmissible cancer lineage that has not yet been described. We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the inability to consistently amplify cancer alleles in various samples, it is unclear how any conclusions regarding the contribution of the Canadian samples and M. trossulus can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unable to consistently clone alleles from some cancer samples, but we are able to consistently amplify cancer-associated alleles by qPCR from all samples diagnosed as cancerous from <italic>M. edulis</italic> and <italic>M. chilensis</italic>, with the exception of the two <italic>M. chilensis</italic> samples that are negative at all four loci (and which therefore do not have <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2). We included analysis of the Canadian <italic>M. trossulus</italic> samples to determine if the <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 alleles could be detectible in the normal population or in the samples positive for <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1. We did not find any <italic>M. trossulus</italic> samples with alleles that match <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 at all loci (indeed no Canadian <italic>M. trossulus</italic> sample amplified at all with the <italic>EF1alpha</italic> cancer-specific primers). This showed that these diagnostic primers consistently identify <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2, and that <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 was not found in that <italic>M. trossulus</italic> population and is distinct from <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is also unclear how to interpret the fact that H4 cancer associated alleles are found in several normal M. trossulus animals. How many is &quot;some?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified ambiguous words in the text, like “some.” Specifically, since all transmissible cancers arose from a single normal individual that had the first cancer that gave rise to the lineage, it is expected that alleles nearly matching the cancer could be found in normal animals in the population. Therefore, it is expected that some normal <italic>M. trossulus</italic> animals would have <italic>H4</italic> alleles nearly identical to <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN1 and some other would have alleles nearly identical to <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2. Notably, no normal animal has yet been found with <italic>Mytilus</italic> BTN2 or BTN1-like alleles at all loci. The two individuals in which these cancer lineages first arose would, but those two individuals are long dead. We have elaborated on this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Sequencing less than 1kb over 3 loci makes drawing conclusions about origin and hybridization tricky. As example, how did they determine that the EF1a 'cancer' alleles were not copy number variants in the host? Were noncancerous tissues tested for absence of these alleles in carrier individuals? Specifically, looking only at normal alleles, there is a clear grouping based on species of origin in a phylogenetic tree There are three exceptions to this clustering, from one normal M. trossulus (MW59) and two diseased M. chilensis (Mch41 and Castro26) with some distinctly M. edulis-like alleles. These may reflect introgression or true hybrid individuals-MW59 also has an EF1α allele corresponding to M. edulis and likely represents a hybrid with this species, which has been introduced into Canada (Crego-Prieto et al., 2015).&quot; This sort of noise, although expected, becomes problematic when it encompasses a third of the data. Please explain in more detail your rationale for your conclusions and include a discussion of caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, the gene trees shown in this study would be insufficient to resolve the coalescence and complete evolutionary history of the three sexual <italic>Mytilus</italic> species tested here.</p><p>We do have evidence of both introgression (at the <italic>EF1alpha</italic> locus) as well as hybrid individuals (such as MW59, noted above). However, the data on the cancer-associated alleles strongly support clonal, asexual lineages, and all four trees are completely concordant (with the exception of the finding of mitochondrial recombination in two individuals).</p></body></sub-article></article>
