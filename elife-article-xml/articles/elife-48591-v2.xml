is mainly dictated by the quality of the oocyte. Here, we explore the utility of the maternal spindle transfer (MST) technique as a reproductive approach to enhance oocyte developmental competence. Our proof-of-concept experiments show that replacement of the entire cytoplasm of oocytes from a sensitive mouse strain overcomes massive embryo developmental arrest characteristic of non-manipulated oocytes. Genetic analysis confirmed minimal carryover of mtDNA following MST. Resulting mice showed low heteroplasmy levels in multiple organs at adult age, normal histology and fertility. Mice were followed for five generations (F5), revealing that heteroplasmy was reduced in F2 mice and was undetectable in the subsequent generations. This pre-clinical model demonstrates the high efficiency and potential of the MST technique, not only to prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations, but also as a new potential treatment for patients with certain forms of infertility refractory to current clinical strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infertility is a growing problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Medical procedures known as in vitro fertilization (IVF) help many individuals experiencing infertility to have children. Typically in IVF, a woman’s egg cells are collected, fertilized with sperm from a chosen male and grown for a few days in a laboratory, before returning them to the woman’s body to continue to develop.</p><p>However, there are some women whose egg cells cannot develop into a healthy baby after they have been fertilized. Many of these patients use egg cells from donors, instead. This greatly improves the chances of the IVF treatment being successful, but the resultant children are not genetically related to the intended mothers.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that a cell compartment known as the cytoplasm plays a crucial role in allowing fertilized egg cells to develop normally. A new technique known as maternal spindle transfer, often shortened to MST, makes it possible to replace the entire cytoplasm of a compromised egg cell. This is achieved by transplanting the genetic material of the compromised egg cell into a donor egg cell with healthier cytoplasm that has previously had its own genetic material removed. Using this technique, it is possible to generate human egg cells for IVF that have the genetic material from the intended mother without the defects in the cytoplasm that may be responsible for infertility. However, it is not clear whether this approach would be a safe and effective way to treat infertility in humans.</p><p>Costa-Borges et al. applied MST to infertile female mice and found that the technique could permanently correct deficiencies in the cytoplasms of poor quality egg cells, allowing the mice to give birth to healthy offspring. Further experiments studied the offspring and their descendants over several generations and found that they also had higher quality egg cells and normal levels of fertility.</p><p>These findings open up the possibility of developing new treatments for infertility caused by problems with egg cells, so experiments involving human egg cells are now being performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the technique.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Infertility</kwd><kwd>Spindle transfer</kwd><kwd>oocytes</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>heteroplasmy</kwd><kwd>embryo development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD-15-1-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa-Borges</surname><given-names>Nuno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HD092550-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Dagan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternal spindle transfer is a feasible approach to enhance embryonic developmental of compromised oocytes, which can represent a new strategy for patients with forms of infertility refractory to current treatments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility disorders are a growing problem that affects millions of couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">WHO, 2017</xref>). Although assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have evolved and can now successfully address many challenging cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Rosenwaks, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niederberger et al., 2018</xref>), conventional IVF treatment continues to fail a significant percentage of infertile women, with many ultimately ending-up being enrolled in egg donation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lutjen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trounson et al., 1983</xref>). The use of donated oocytes is effective at significantly improving the chances of successful IVF treatment, however, the resultant children are not genetically related to the intended-mothers. Therefore, it is desirable to develop new reproductive strategies that can allow the treatment of these patients with genetically related oocytes.</p><p>Oocyte quality is defined as the competence of the oocyte to develop into a chromosomally normal blastocyst with potential to sustain a pregnancy up to a healthy live birth. Frequently, poor quality oocytes fail to fertilize or produce embryos that arrest during the first stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meskhi and Seif, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer et al., 1995</xref>) either due to nuclear or cytoplasmic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conti and Franciosi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eppig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Keefe, 2004</xref>). Accumulated evidence suggests that aberrant meiosis or early developmental failure is caused mainly by deficiencies in the oocyte cytoplasmic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Keefe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reader et al., 2017</xref>), which contains a vast diversity of critical components, including organelles, mRNAs, proteins, ribosomes and many other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sathananthan, 1997</xref>). Mitochondria are the most numerous organelles in the cytoplasm and play an essential role by supplying the ATP needed for the oocyte to support critical events, such as: maturation, spindle formation and segregation of chromosomes and chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chappel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">May-Panloup et al., 2007</xref>). Dysfunctions at the mitochondrial level and deficiencies affecting other cytoplasmic factors have been correlated with inadequate oocyte developmental competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eichenlaub-Ritter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Blerkom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Blerkom et al., 1995</xref>), particularly in older infertile patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babayev and Seli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fragouli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Igarashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wells, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Techniques like cytoplasmic transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanzendorf et al., 1999</xref>) or the injection of purified mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fakih MHSM et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kristensen et al., 2017</xref> have been proposed as potential methods to restore the viability of compromised oocytes in IVF patients with a history of poor embryo development or repeated implantation failures with conventional treatments. Although live births have been reported following the use of these techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fakih MHSM et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanzendorf et al., 1999</xref>) their safety and/or benefits to treat infertility has been questioned. Cytoplasmic transfer experiments were abandoned due to concerns that heteroplasmy (i.e., the co-existence of two distinct mtDNA genomes) might have negative clinical consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darbandi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isasi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kristensen et al., 2017</xref>). An alternative strategy, which avoided heteroplasmy by utilizing autologous injection of mitochondria from the patient's own germline cells attracted much attention as a possible new treatment to revitalize deficient oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple studies in animal models showed apparent benefits of the addition of mitochondria to oocytes of compromised quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Shourbagy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hua et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yi et al., 2007</xref>) and IVF births were reported after transfer of oogonial precursor cell-derived mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fakih MHSM et al., 2015</xref>). However, the source and quality of the mitochondria used are unclear and a recent randomized clinical study conducted using mitochondria derived from autologous oogonial stem cells failed to demonstrate improvements in embryo developmental or clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Labarta et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, current data from human clinical research do not support the notion that the addition of further mitochondria derived from the same individual is capable of correcting cytoplasmic deficiencies (mitochondria or other) that may be present in poor quality oocytes. Furthermore, the safety of the procedure is yet to be verified. Of note, a recent study suggested that autologous mitochondrial supplementation may induce a phenotypic effect in the heart of resultant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">St John et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An approach that may offer greater promise in terms of its capacity to address infertility problems of maternal (oocyte) origin is the transfer of the nuclear genome from an affected oocyte or zygote into a new ‘healthy’ cytoplasm. These techniques, known globally as mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRTs) were originally proposed to prevent the transmission of inherited mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craven et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paull et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tachibana et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, a clinical application of maternal spindle transfer (MST) to prevent the transmission of Leigh Syndrome was recently reported, resulting the birth of an unaffected child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the potential of MRTs to overcome infertility remains unclear, as most studies utilizing this approach have not had this as their main focus, instead concentrating on their potential to avoid mitochondrial diseases; examination of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in oocytes and zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Keefe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Keefe, 2007</xref>); the origin of female aneuploidies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palermo et al., 2002</xref>; or the decreased developmental capability of aged oocytes in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamada and Egli, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explored the feasibility of the MST technique as a reproductive tool to overcome embryo developmental arrest. To test our hypothesis, a detailed series of proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to assess the safety and the efficiency of the technique using mouse models, which, in a clinical context, could represent donors and patients with oocytes of good and poor developmental competence, respectively. Additionally, advanced molecular techniques were used to evaluate in detail the heteroplasmy levels induced by the procedure in early embryonic-stages and in multiple important organs, including some with high metabolic demand, collected from male and female mice generated by MST. The mice were bred and followed up to ascertain their health, fertility and welfare, as well as, to study the fate of the heteroplasmy in the offspring of the MST female progenitors over five generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MST among sibling B6CBAF1 oocytes is feasible without impairing embryo development</title><p>In a first set of experiments we aimed to optimize the MST protocol and to determine whether the manipulation of the spindle-chromosome complex is feasible without impairing the developmental potential of reconstructed oocytes. We performed reciprocal MST among sibling oocytes from the mouse hybrid <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Enucleation and reconstruction (karyoplast-cytoplast fusion) of oocytes were first assessed with freshly collected oocytes. Enucleation was successful in 98.9% of oocytes (n = 790) and reconstruction was achieved in 96.1% (n = 321), confirmed using a microscope with polarized light that allows visualization of the birefringence of the spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, MST was carried out with both fresh and cryopreserved <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> oocytes that were vitrified and warmed using the open <italic>Cryotop</italic> system (97.7% survival, n = 600). In this set of experiments, spindles were taken from fresh oocytes and transferred into either fresh (<italic>fresh-sp/fresh-cyt</italic>) or vitrified-warmed cytoplasts (<italic>fresh-sp/vitrified-cyt</italic>) and vice-versa, that is spindles from vitrified oocytes transferred to fresh (<italic>vitrified-sp/fresh-cyt</italic>) or vitrified-warm cytoplasts (<italic>vitrified-sp/vitrified-cyt</italic>). The resultant oocytes from the different groups were then fixed after reconstruction and processed for evaluation of the spindle apparatus and chromosomes distribution by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All oocytes analyzed presented a spindle with a normal barrel shape and with the chromosomes aligned at the MII plate (<italic>fresh-sp/fresh-cyt</italic> n = 20, <italic>fresh-sp/vitrified-cyt</italic> n = 15, <italic>vitrified-sp/fresh-cyt</italic> n = 15, <italic>vitrified-sp/vitrified-cyt</italic> n = 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>), regardless of whether fresh or vitrified gametes were used as spindle or cytoplast donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations indicated that the conditions used to perform the manipulation of the spindle-chromosome complex were neither damaging to its structure nor altering of the distribution of the chromosomes.

Two different oocyte strains were employed: the hybrid B6CBF1 (resultant from the cross between C57BL/6JRj females and CBA/Jrj males), and the <italic>New Zealand Black</italic> (<italic>NZB/OlaHsd</italic>) strains. The <italic>NZB</italic> strain holds two interesting characteristics. Firstly, <italic>NZB</italic> mice present a poor reproductive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandes et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen CT and Whitney, 1973</xref>) and, secondly, the genetic background of the <italic>NZB</italic> strain has diverged genetically from most other mouse laboratory strains, including the hybrid <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> strain, accompanied by characteristic differences in mtDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bielschowsky and Goodall, 1970</xref>). These two features are particularly relevant to the experimental design of this study as, in a clinical context, the <italic>NZB</italic> strain could be considered analogous to a subfertile patient (especially those with a history of poor in vitro embryo development), and the <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> strain, a donor of proven fertility. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the divergent mtDNA of the <italic>NZB</italic> strain provides an opportunity to evaluate the carryover of organelles and resultant heteroplasmy induced by MST procedures (see Materials and methods). Experiments were thus carried out between the two mouse strains, so that meiotic spindles were transferred from fresh <italic>NZB</italic> oocytes into fresh <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> cytoplasts and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Once reconstructed, oocytes were inseminated using ICSI in parallel with non-manipulated oocytes from both strains and cultured in vitro until the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Enucleation and fusion rates were identical in both MST groups, and no differences were found in terms of survival to ICSI compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). As expected, <italic>NZB</italic> control oocytes presented significantly lower fertilization rates than <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> control oocytes, measured as two-cell stage development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, while blastocyst formation rates were close to 80% in the <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> control group (77.8%, n = 144), most of the injected oocytes from the <italic>NZB</italic> control group arrested their development before reaching this stage (5.6% developed into blastocysts, n = 159, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Remarkably, when the meiotic spindles from <italic>NZB</italic> oocytes were transferred into <italic>B6CBAF1</italic> cytoplasts (<italic>NZB-sp/B6-cyt</italic>), the blastocyst formation rates were 10-fold higher (51.4%, n = 212, p&lt;0.0001) compared to the non-manipulated NZB control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Four mice (two males and two females) were selected at random from each litter, through five generations. Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy levels were reduced to 0.4 ± 0.6% (mean ± SD, n = 4) on average in F2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and decreased to undetected levels in subsequent generations (F3 to F5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These quantifications based on a single SNP in an Ion PGM sequencer were corroborated by using an additional sequencing platform (Illumina’s MiSeq) and 5 SNPs, as described above. Artificially constructed samples, composed of gDNA from both mouse strains mixed in different ratios, and gDNA from 5 organs of selected adult mice from F1-3 generations were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref>). These results suggest that low levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy resultant from MST typically result in a homoplasmic state in offspring within a few generations, without reversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary files 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref>). However, it is acknowledged that different mtDNA haplogroups or mtDNA genomes affected by specific mutations might have differences in the efficiency with which they replicate, influencing the speed at which homoplasmy is attained as well as the risk if reversion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>MST is a technique that was originally proposed to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. This proof of concept study provides insights into the feasibility of this technique as a potential new reproductive approach to overcome infertility problems characterized by repeated in vitro embryo development arrest caused by cytoplasmic deficiencies in the oocyte.</p><p>Herein, it is shown that MST can be carried out with high efficiency in the mouse, with successful enucleation and reconstruction achieved for &gt;95% of oocytes. Furthermore, the data produced indicate that, as long as all the steps of the protocol are well optimized and care is taken to minimize the risk of damage to the oocyte, the procedure does not negatively affect the spindle apparatus or early embryo development. In the event of a future clinical application of MST in humans, it may be difficult to coordinate the retrieval of mature oocytes from patients and donors, due to the inherent variation in ovarian responses to hormonal stimulation. For this reason, the capacity of cryopreserved oocytes to substitute for fresh oocytes, when serving as spindle or cytoplast donors, was evaluated. The results indicated that fresh and vitrified oocytes are equally suitable for use as spindle donors, but superior results are obtained if the recipient cytoplast is fresh. This agrees with a previous report performed in non-human primates that had shown that fresh spindles transplanted into vitrified cytoplasts results in impaired (50%) fertilization after ICSI, while the reciprocal spindle transfer resulted in fertilization (88%) and blastocyst formation (68%) rates similar to fresh controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tachibana et al., 2009</xref>). This also represents an advantage in the clinical setting, where low-responders to ovarian stimulation could vitrify oocytes from repeated oocyte collections, and the accumulated oocytes be used for MST using freshly collected donor cytoplasts.</p><p>Additionally, MST was conducted between two distantly related mouse strains with the aim of simulating a clinical context, in which donors with oocytes of good reproductive competence provide cytoplasts for patients with a history of poor oocyte fertilization and/or high rates of failed embryo development. The experiments demonstrated how the successful replacement of the entire cytoplasm of compromised oocytes has the potential to overcome the massive embryo development arrest phenotype, which is observed in non-manipulated controls from a sensitive mouse strain (NZB). This strategy resulted in a highly significant (10-fold) increase in blastocyst formation rates, as well as an increased likelihood of embryo development to term, compared to non-manipulated control oocytes. These results highlight the importance of the cytoplasm on the potential of the oocyte to support embryo development in vitro and to lay the foundations for a successful pregnancy. Consistent with this data, Mitsui and colleagues showed that oocyte genomes from mice aged 10–12 months transferred into oocytes of young mice aged 3–5 months, resulted in increased term-development from 6.3% for in vivo aged oocytes to 27.1% for the reconstructed oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitsui et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, a recent study demonstrated that in vitro aged oocytes accumulate cytoplasmic deficiencies if they are maintained in culture for an extended period prior to fertilization, and that these deficiencies can be overcome with spindle transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamada and Egli, 2017</xref>). However, in both cases, studies were performed between oocytes from the same mouse strain and thus the potential of the technique to overcome infertility in a strain with poor fertility competence remained undetermined. It is noteworthy that the current study employed ICSI to inseminate oocytes, rather than conventional IVF, which resembles closely the standard protocol used in humans for oocytes that have been denuded of the surrounding cumulus cells.</p><p>Levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy caused by carryover of mitochondria in close proximity to spindle during the MST procedure were also evaluated. Clearly, this is an important consideration when utilizing MST technology to avoid transmission of mtDNA mutations responsible for serious inherited disorders, but it is also relevant to other variations in the mtDNA, or other defects affecting the mitochondrial organelle, which may potentially contribute to certain forms of embryonic developmental arrest. As well as assessing the extent of heteroplasmy at different embryonic stages, the levels were also assessed in multiple tissues in adulthood and over several generations. There are conflicting reports regarding the dynamics of mtDNA heteroplasmy during the lifetime of an individual, between organs or even during in vitro culture when ESCs have been derived from MRT embryos with heteroplasmic mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paull et al., 2013</xref>). It is also unclear to what extent divergent mtDNA haplotypes in heteroplasmic organisms might lead to functional incompatibility, either between the two types of mitochondria or between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.</p><p>This study confirms that cells biopsied from MST embryos at the morula or blastocyst stages present minimal levels of heteroplasmy (&lt;2.9% mtDNA from the spindle donor) and that these biopsy specimens are representative of the remainder of the embryo. On the contrary, the heteroplasmy levels were significantly higher in second polar bodies than in blastomere or trophectoderm biopsies. This agrees with data from Neupane and colleagues, who have shown that, in comparison to second polar bodies, mtDNA heteroplasmy in TE cells is more closely correlated with the levels in the blastocyst as a whole or the corresponding ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neupane et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, oocytes might be actively removing mitochondria transferred along with the spindle, since they may be disadvantageous as compared to the recipient’s own organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Fanti et al., 2017</xref>). However, perhaps the most likely explanation is that when the meiotic spindle is transferred, a number of mitochondria accompany it. These mitochondria are likely to remain in the vicinity of the MII spindle and consequently it is inevitable that a disproportionate number of these mitochondria will pass into the second polar body. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, our data suggest that testing of blastomeres or TE biopsies is preferable to second polar body analysis for the quantification of mtDNA heteroplasmy levels. This also has relevance for the preimplantation genetic testing (PGT, also known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis – PGD) of mitochondrial disease in the human.</p><p>The data from our current study revealed that mtDNA heteroplasmy levels were low in all the adult mice produced, regardless of gender, or the type of organ (range 0–6%). Previous studies in monkeys and humans have shown that a minimal number of donor mitochondria are transferred using MRT (below 1–2%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craven et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paull et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tachibana et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, since the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes is much larger than that of the human, and given that multiple mitochondria are found in the vicinity of the spindle, it was expected that MST in mice would lead to higher mtDNA carryover levels. The surprisingly low heteroplasmic levels achieved during this study can likely be attributed to the use of birefringence microscopy during enucleation, which assists in minimizing the carryover of cytoplasm transferred along the meiotic spindle.</p><p>It has also been suggested that organs with a high-metabolic demand tend to accumulate higher heteroplasmy mtDNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenuth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meirelles and Smith, 1997</xref>), however, our data do not confirm this observation. This result could be explained by differences in mitochondrial haplotypes from mouse strains used, which could have a differential replication rate.</p><p>Some studies of heteroplasmic ESC lines derived from embryos carrying mtDNA mutations have shown changes in the levels of normal and mutant mtDNA during prolonged in vitro culture, with reversion back to a situation where mutant mtDNA predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paull et al., 2013</xref>). This delayed efforts for the direct application of MRT-derived techniques in the clinical setting and raises some concerns for the first baby born using MST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the results presented here show a low level of mtDNA carryover in all adult organs analyzed, suggesting that the mechanism seen in ESCs in vitro might not necessarily represent the in vivo process. The results also agree with Sharpley et al, who showed that NZB and 129S6 mtDNA heteroplasmic haplotypes decrease over generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharpley et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, heteroplasmy was very low in the F2 progeny and undetected in the offspring of the subsequent generations (up to F5). The data collected from the analyzed organs suggests that heteroplasmy resultant from MST can be stable within an individual and can lead to an homoplasmic state within a few generations. However, additional work should be done in order to comprehensively assess how mtDNA heteroplasmy segregates in other organs.</p><p>On the other hand, the MST mice followed over five generations were apparently normal and showed good fertility (average of 7.8 pups per litter). This is a notable observation, as based on the literature, NZB/OlaHsd mice are expected to have small litter sizes (3.8 at weaning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandes et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen CT and Whitney, 1973</xref>). Additionally, histological examinations in F1 MST mice did not reveal any lesions in a selection of organs. Whether the MST technique can potentially reveal mitochondrial causes of infertility that are hereditary or aggravated with lifestyle or age is a question that remains to be answered and will require additional studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that MST can overcome a severe developmental arrest phenotype, associated with poor fertility and greatly reduced chances of an individual oocyte producing a pregnancy following in vitro fertilization. The results show that embryos produced using optimized MST techniques can give rise to apparently normal and fertile animals. Levels of heteroplasmy were low in the initial generation and undetectable in subsequent generations, indicating that homoplasmy for the mtDNA of the cytoplast donor is rapidly attained in this model. Given the high proportion of IVF cycles which are unsuccessful due to poor embryo development related to low oocyte quality, we believe that there is a need to further explore the potential of MST as a clinical treatment for infertility. Pre-clinical and clinical trials involving human oocytes, undertaken in a regulated and carefully controlled manner, is desirable, since such a therapy could represent the last chance for infertile patients to have genetically related children.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal care and procedures were conducted according to protocols approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research (DAMM-7436) of the <italic>Parc Cientific of Barcelona</italic> (PCB), Spain.

Afterwards, the meiotic spindle was aspirated into an enucleation pipette (Humagen) trying to remove the minimum amount of surrounding cytoplasm possible, and enucleation confirmed using a microtubule birefringence system (PolarAide, Vitrolife) to visualize the spindle apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). If the karyoplast removed contained a larger amount of cytoplasm, the extra cytoplasm was eliminated by pressing the cytoplasm against the zona pellucida. Karyoplasts were inserted below the zona pellucida of another enucleated oocyte (cytoplast) and fused using inactivated Sendai virus HVJ-E (GenomeOne, Cosmo Bio). All manipulations were performed on a 37°C heated stage (Okolab) of an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope, using Eppendorf micromanipulators. Non-manipulated control oocytes and those generated by MST were inseminated using a modified piezo-actuated ICSI technique, known as the ‘hole removal technique’.

Products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a genetic analyser (ThermoFisher). The resulting data were analyzed using GeneMapper v4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). DNA mixing experiments were performed to ensure accuracy and sensitivity of the SNP quantification protocol. Sample mixtures were created by combining gDNA (extracted from tail tips) from both mouse strains at different ratios (B6CBAF1/NZB: 100/0; 98/2; 96/4; 94/6; 92/8; 90/10; 75/25; 50/50; 25/75; 0/100). Samples were sequenced and obtained ratios compared to those expected.</p><p>To ensure both the validity of assessment of a single SNP for mtDNA carryover analysis and the accuracy of the utilized sequencing platform (Ion PGM); a second set of experiments was performed, which included analysis of four additional SNPs (B6CBAF1 &gt; NZB: m.2798C &gt; T; m.2814T &gt; C; m.3194T &gt; C; m.3260A &gt; G) utilizing Illumina’s MiSeq System sequencing platform. Minisequencing was used to confirm presence/absence of SNPs in B6CBAF1 and NZB mouse strains. PCR and minisequencing procedures were performed as described above. In brief, PCR was performed to amplify additional SNPs in gDNA from B6CBAF1 and NZB tail tips (m.2798 and m.2814: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AACACTCCTCGTCCCCATTC</named-content>-3; and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGGACCAACAATGTTAGGGC</named-content>-3’; m.3194 and m.3260: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCCGTAGCCCAAACAATTTC</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGTCAGGCTGGCAGAAGTAA</named-content>-3’). Amplicons were subjected to minisequencing with following primers: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTCCCCATTCTAATCGC</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGTTAGGAAGGCTAT</named-content>-3’ (m.2798T); 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATAGCCTTCCTAACA</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGATTTTGCGTTCTACTA</named-content>-3’ (m.2814); 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATGAAGTAACCATAGCTAT</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATAGAACTGATAAAAGGAT</named-content>-3’ (m.3194); 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CACTTATTACAACCCAAGA</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGAAGTAATCATATGTG</named-content>-3’ (m.3260). Sequencing libraries were prepared from PCR amplicons using the TruSeq DNA Nano LT kit from Illumina and sequenced on the MiSeq System. Analysis was performed with Miseq Reporter and Illumina’s Somatic Variant Caller. Again, gDNA mixtures (B6CBAF1/NZB: 100/0; 99/1; 97/3; 90/10; 75/25; 50/50; 0/100) were sequenced and obtained ratios compared to those expected. Furthermore, gDNA samples from organs of three individual mice were sequenced and results compared to those obtained by PGM sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Experiments involving micromanipulation procedures were usually repeated between 6 to 9 times. Results obtained in the different replicates were pooled and analyzed together. Oocytes used for manipulation were always taken randomly from a common pool of oocytes collected from the 4–6 female mice used on each experimental day. In all experiments that involved embryo culture, control groups with non-manipulated oocytes were always processed and cultured in parallel together with the manipulated groups. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 program (GraphPad). For comparisons of mean cell numbers, placentas and mice weights, mtDNA carryover values in embryo species and adult mouse tissues, a <italic>t-test</italic> or one-way <italic>ANOVA</italic> was performed, where the significance was set at p&lt;0.05. For the analysis of oocyte/embryo proportions, chi-square test was performed and a p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>- Validation of established sequencing protocol for mtDNA carryover analysis measured by Ion PGM sequencer.

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present results of their study on the efficacy of cytoplasmic replacement in oocytes using mitochondrial spindle transfer (MST) for overcoming poor preimplantation development in the mouse model. MST can be performed after oocyte vitrification and frozen/thawed cytoplasts but not spindles show poor development after MST. Whole cytoplasmic replacement in mature oocytes from NZB/OlaHsd mice with donor cytoplasm derived from B6CBAF1 mice can rescue poor fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst formation typical for NZB mice.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and summary of the literature: &quot;The introduction is very selective especially related to autologous mitochondrial supplementation and appears to have been crafted to sell the authors' point of view. There are data to suggest that mitochondrial supplementation works and the effect that is has on gene expression in embryos and on litter size. Furthermore, children have been produced using this approach. The authors are requested to ensure that there is scientific balance in the Introduction for each aspect discussed.&quot; Please revise.</p><p>2) &quot;There is no detail about the depth of the sequencing. Ion Torrent is not a reliable sequencing platform – it produces too many unreliable reads – you need to use a more reliable platform such as MiSeq. The levels of heteroplasmy need to be assessed on a range of tissues to determine if you see uniform similarities in transmission. At the moment, these data are not convincing as too few tissues are assessed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Conclusions on mtDNA heteroplasmy are weak because results are based on detection of only one SNP difference between NZB/OlaHsd and B6CBAF1 strains. It is likely that mtDNA haplotypes of these two strains differ on more than 90 SNPs. Therefore, authors should monitor heteroplasmy on each of these positions. This should be done by whole mtDNA sequencing, which is required for conclusive heteroplasmy assays post MRT.&quot;</p><p>Please provide additional sequencing data to solidify this key point.</p><p>3) &quot;All pups (F2) were born alive, respired normally and grew to adulthood without manifesting any physiological or behavioral alteration.” and “Gross necropsies of the parents and offspring were also performed during the 5 generations, with no pathological findings observed.” Where are these data and how much depth was there to these analyses? This is critical given that a recent paper has shown that autologous mitochondrial supplementation can lead to a heart defect. Clarify to what depth mice were studied at autopsy.</p><p>4) &quot;Authors used NZB strain as an example of a poor breeder strain. Strikingly, F1 females derived from MST that are still genetically NZO produced large litters (~8 pups) according to Supplementary file 1. It seems that authors show only one litter, which seems to be large even in unmanipulated NZO strain. It would be useful to show if F1 females maintain high productivity over time compared to NZO females (which should be also included in the table). If MST transfer improved NZO female's fecundity this could indicate that their breeding problems are mitochondria related and replacing mitochondria could improve the performance of this strain. Which would be of interest also from the clinical perspective. This technique could potentially reveal mitochondrial causes of infertility in patients which can be hereditary in the female lineage Women treated for ooplasm deficiency could pass this to their daughters.&quot; Please comment on the reviewer's observation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maternal spindle transfer overcomes embryo developmental arrest caused by ooplasmic defects in mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, I am surprised to see that they have restricted themselves to four organs. Likewise, as argued by one of the other reviewers, they do not carry out mtDNA analysis on all tissues. Therefore, the arguments they present are only partially valid. The reason for this is that mtDNA, and specifically mtDNA mutations (as in disease) or variants (in non-pathological situations), do not segregate neutrally, or evenly, amongst all the tissues / organs but rather in a random manner. Therefore, without having analysis of all tissues and organs (or at least 10 as agreed by another reviewer), the outcomes are only indicative of what has been analysed. I, further, note that muscle has not been analysed and myopathies are associated with mtDNA disease and, in the disease state, muscle often carries high loads of mutant mtDNA, which affects OXPHOS function (mtDNA encodes for key genes of the electron transfer chain that performs OXPHOS).</p><p>In conclusion, I think this is an important study but it is being held back though either reluctance or a lack of understanding of mtDNA genetics and, specifically, transmission and segregation of the mitochondrial genome. Either way, this results in the conclusions being inconclusive.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48591.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction and summary of the literature: &quot;The introduction is very selective especially related to autologous mitochondrial supplementation and appears to have been crafted to sell the authors' point of view.

This was due to the need to fully convey essential details to introduce our hypothesis, while keeping the text as succinct as possible. As stated by the reviewers, there are multiple studies in animal models that have described benefits of the technique to treat infertility (Yi et al., 2007; El Shourbagy et al., 2006; Hua et al., 2014) and, importantly, children resultant from the application of this technique have been born (Fakih et al., 2015).

In fact, care was taken to ensure that each sample was sequenced at great depth (mean: ~60,000 reads) to ensure high accuracy and sensitivity of variant calling. We now included mean sequencing coverages (± SDs and ranges) of alleles at the variant site in footnotes of Supplementary file 1, Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 4. In addition, we prepared an excel file for reviewers with source data for these analyses (see Source data files), listing exact sequencing coverages at the variant site in all processed samples. These files, together with footnotes included in relevant tables, show that sequencing depth was consistently high and sufficient for variant calling throughout all samples tested.</p><p>We agree that it is essential to obtain accurate sequencing reads when determining variant ratios. We believe that the Ion Torrent is a highly reliable sequencing platform and well‑suited for variant analysis. It is routinely used for this purpose in research as well as clinical diagnostics and forensics (see referencesYang et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2013; Heeke et al., 2018; Churchill et al., 2018; below for recent examples). Furthermore, comparison of the Ion Torrent to other sequencers, including MiSeq, has not shown differences in performance (see referenceQuail et al., 2012). In our laboratory we use both platforms, the MiSeq and the Ion Torrent. For the present project we decided to use the Ion Torrent because it allows deep sequencing at much lower cost and much higher sample throughput than the MiSeq. Importantly, the Ion Torrent is coupled with a powerful server for direct processing of generated sequencing data, utilising software specifically developed for Ion Torrent raw data analysis. The verified Torrent Variant Caller plug‑in was used to determine variant ratios. Optimised, pre-set parameters were applied for variant calling. Some parameters were further customised to increase variant calling accuracy: (1)Settings for “Somatic” variants analysed at “High Stringency” were applied to enable low frequency variant detection at a minimal false‑positive call rate. (2)The read depth was down sampled to 20,000, rather than 2,000 reads as recommended, to increase accuracy of variant calls. (3)A “HotSpot Region” BED file, defining the exact genomic coordinate of the assessed nucleotide, in addition to a “Target Region” BED file, was applied to increase variant calling sensitivity at the assessed locus. Additionally, sequencing results of all samples were visualized in the integrative genomics viewer (IGV) to confirm variant calls and to ensure variant calls/low-level heteroplasmies were not ignored. Overall, we believe that our data is very accurate. Of note, in addition to the known variant site we also assessed all other nucleotides in sequences flanking the variant site. No sequencing artefacts/errors were detected in any position in the ~100bp amplicons in any of the samples.</p><p>We have edited the Materials and methods section to further clarify this point.</p><p>We agree that it is important to assess heteroplasmy levels in a range of adult mice tissues to determine mtDNA transmission and possible unequal distribution. For these reasons, we tested a total of 110organs and tissues of different energy needs (22tails, 22hearts,22livers, 22brains and 22kidneys). These were derived from 22animals (10female and 12male mice) from five consecutive generations (6xF1, 4xF2, 4xF3, 4xF4 and 4xF5, please see Supplementary file 4). Detected heteroplasmy levels were always comparable between organ/tissue types of individual mice and between mice of same generation. Moreover, heteroplasmy levels in organs/tissues of F1mice were comparable to the heteroplasmy levels detected in embryo biopsies. This data suggests that the types of organs/tissues and numbers of mice/generations analysed were sufficient to assess mtDNA transmission. Of note, published studies of similar type assessed similar numbers and organs/tissues (see referencesJenuth et al., 1997; Sharpley et al., 2012) to what we present here.</p><p>Accurate mtDNA heteroplasmy levels can be obtained from the analysis of a single SNP, since all polymorphic sites are inherited together. In fact, the analysis of a single polymorphic nucleotide is routinely used for the quantification of heteroplasmy levels and mtDNA carry-over rates (see referencesJenuth et al., 1997; Sharpley et al., 2012; Tachibana et al., 2009; Hyslop et al., 2016). The SNP at position m.3932 was used for mtDNA quantification in the present study. Differing B6CBAF1 and NZB alleles were initially confirmed by minisequencing. High accuracy and high sensitivity in heteroplasmy detection using the specified polymorphic nucleotide was confirmed using artificial mixtures of genomic DNA (see Supplementary file 1). Of note, the analysis of single nucleotides for mtDNA heteroplasmy quantification is a well‑established procedure in our laboratory and has been extensively validated on a range of samples (including human) for several other research projects as well clinical diagnostics. Therefore, we believe that the conclusions drawn in the present study are legitimate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;All pups (F2) were born alive, respired normally and grew to adulthood without manifesting any physiological or behavioral alteration.” and “Gross necropsies of the parents and offspring were also performed during the 5 generations, with no pathological findings observed.

Our data indicate that over the five generations the MST-derived mice were crossed and followed, the litter size was large and stable (average of 7.4 pups, see Supplementary file 3). Based on the literature and information provided by the commercial provider (Invigo), poor reproductive performance is expected for NZB/OlaHsd mice, with litter sizes of 3.8 at weaning and colony output 0.5 young/female/week (Festing, 1976; Fernandes et al., 1973; Hansen et al., 1973). Unfortunately, we did not follow the NZB controls after F1, as the main aim of our study was to evaluate the health, welfare and reproductive performance of the mice resultant from MST. We could hypothesize based on this observation that the MST technique can potentially reveal mitochondrial or cytoplasmic causes of infertility, but we do not have a direct control group to support this finding. Our group is currently investigating this question as part of another study that is being carried out.</p><p>We have added this to the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers remain concerned about the strength of the evidence to show that the animals were indeed normal.

I, further, note that muscle has not been analysed and myopathies are associated with mtDNA disease and, in the disease state, muscle often carries high loads of mutant mtDNA, which affects OXPHOS function (mtDNA encodes for key genes of the electron transfer chain that performs OXPHOS).</p><p>In conclusion, I think this is an important study but it is being held back though either reluctance or a lack of understanding of mtDNA genetics and, specifically, transmission and segregation of the mitochondrial genome. Either way, this results in the conclusions being inconclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version of our revised manuscript we had included histopathological examinations that had been performed in vital organs, including heart, kidney, liver and brain. We have now extended these examinations to additional tissues from the same animals, as suggested. We included the analysis in both skeletal tibial and quadriceps muscle and urinary bladder for smooth muscle. Additionally, we have also processed organs from the reproductive tract and accessory glands in both males (testis, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate, coagulating glands, ampullary glands and bulbourethral glands) and females (ovaries, oviducts, uterine horns). Taken together we have examined over 10 organs/tissues from each animal. None of the animals showed any lesions or visible abnormalities. Representative images from additional stainings are now included in Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><p>On the other hand, we have tried to tone down the claims that the MST animals were “healthy” and emphasized in the revised Discussion that the conclusions regarding the animals health and heteroplasmy levels are drawn only from the organs we assessed.</p><p>References:</p><p>Churchill, J.
