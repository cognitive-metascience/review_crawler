Understanding how the neuronal network interacts to control these physiological systems is essential for comprehending our ability to promote the appropriate responses and avoid failures in the face of these challenges. One of the physiological systems that is essential to maintain homeostasis is the respiratory system. Therefore, the process of breathing is a complex and dynamic behavior divided into three phases (inspiration, post-inspiration and active expiration), whereby respiratory muscles produce a pressure difference allowing airflow into and out of the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richter and Smith, 2014</xref>). These three phases are the results of the recruitment of different muscles (in general: diaphragm, upper airways and abdominal muscles). Their rhythms are controlled by two distinct oscillators: the pre-Bötzinger Complex (preBötC), which drives inspiration; and the lateral parafacial region (pFRG), which drives active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramirez and Baertsch, 2018</xref>). There is a hypothesized third oscillator located at the post-inspiratory complex (PiCO) which drives the post-inspiratory phase of the breathing cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Respiration influences the cardiovascular system through two different mechanisms: Traube-Hering waves, which are related to oscillations in arterial pressure, and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which is related to oscillation in the heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Traube, 1865</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hering, 1869</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Anrep et al., 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). The respiratory oscillators are located in the ventrolateral medulla, intermingled with neurons that are involved with cardiovascular control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guyenet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richter and Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyenet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that they can interact to coordinate respiratory and cardiovascular adjustments.</p><p>The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contains many types of neurons that regulate the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflows as well as breathing output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guyenet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyenet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Respiratory physiologists have named at least four functional segments within the RVLM, not counting the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus, which can be viewed as the rostral-most extension of the so-called ventral respiratory column (VRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>), whereas cardiovascular physiologists have named two groups of neurons in the RVLM that are involved in sympathetic control: catecholaminergic C1 neurons and non-C1 neurons. In the so-called ‘cardiovascular/sympathetic’ area of the RVLM, catecholaminergic C1 neurons were first identified more than 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McAllen and Dampney, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guyenet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). C1 neurons have distinct projections to the whole brain, demonstrating that these neurons are involved in more than just cardiovascular regulation, as had been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ross et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Guyenet, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreihofer and Guyenet, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ritter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Abbott et al., 2013b</xref>). Selective stimulation of C1 cells causes a rise in arterial pressure and breathing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Abbott et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018a</xref>). These effects mimic the cardiovascular and respiratory responses elicited by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). There is evidence that C1 cells are highly collateralized, overlap with respiratory neurons in the VRC and contribute to hypoxic responses via connections with pontomedullary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guyenet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyenet, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia is considered a very potent stimulus that produces different physiological perturbations, including breathing activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prabhakar and Semenza, 2015</xref>). During a hypoxic challenge, expiration (which is passive at rest) turns into an active process, with dilatation of the upper airways and the recruitment of abdominal expiratory muscles during the second phase of the expiratory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iscoe, 1998</xref>). A group of expiratory neurons located in the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) has been considered to be a conditional expiratory oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). The pFRG is located ventrolateral to the facial motor nucleus and becomes rhythmically active when it is necessary to increase lung ventilation, for example during physical exercise or during the stimulation of central and/or peripheral chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korsak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we postulate that adrenergic C1 neurons are in synaptic contact with the pFRG region to recruit expiratory muscles via glutamatergic signaling in order to regulate breathing during hypoxia properly. This notion stems from the following three observations: a) we anatomically verified that C1 neurons are activated by hypoxia and project to the pFRG region; b) active expiration elicited by hypoxia was blunted after blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors at the level of the pFRG; and c) selective depletion of C1 neurons eliminated the active expiration elicited by hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Active expiration elicited by activation of the parafacial respiratory group is mediated by ionotropic glutamatergic receptors</title><p>Under resting conditions, expiration occurs passively as a consequence of the passive deflation of the lung and chest wall to a resting state from a stretched position at the end of inspiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E and H</xref>). Physiologically, active expiration (high ventilatory demand) corresponds to an increase in the airflow in the late expiratory phase, immediately before inspiration, that is due to the recruitment of expiratory muscles. According to others, active expiration is present when the abdominal (Abd<sub>EMG</sub>) amplitude during the final 20% of the expiratory period is &gt;50% larger than that in the first half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). In adult rats, the pFRG region (a conditional expiratory oscillator) is inactive at rest and can became rhythmically active as a result of changes in the balance of inhibition and excitation, which recruit abdominal muscles by local disinhibition or activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huckstepp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Considering the ideas that pFRG neurons are involved in active expiration and that C1 neurons use glutamate as the main neurotransmitter, we began by confirming that the activation of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors in pFRG neurons is able to generate active expirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huckstepp et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of glutamatergic receptors in the pFRG region evoked active expiration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

According to our histological analysis, the injections were located in the ventral aspect of the lateral edge of the facial nucleus, juxtaposed to the spinal trigeminal tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Unilateral injection of glutamate into the pFRG triggered active expiration, as noted by bursts of Abd<sub>EMG</sub> during late expiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).

Our transductions were restricted to the C1 region, indicating that GFP fibers and varicosities located in the pFRG belong to C1 neurons residing in the rostral aspect of the ventrolateral medulla. The strongest evidence that C1 neurons do in fact project to the pFRG is the presence of GFP and VGLUT2 double-labeling in this region. TH and CTb double-labeling in the C1 region, observed in rats that received retrograde tracer injection (CTb) into the pFRG, reinforces our hypothesis.

In addition, the anatomical origin, mechanism of generation and modulation of the breathing rhythm have been, and continue to be, intensely investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Our results add the information that the recruitment of active expiration under activation of peripheral chemoreceptors in anesthetized, vagotomized and artificially ventilated adult rats depends on the integrity of C1 cells.</p><p>As described before, active expiration may also be generated in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Abdala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017</xref>). We propose the existence of a catecholaminergic mechanism for the generation of active expiration because selective ablation of catecholaminergic C1 neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla attenuated the late-expiratory flow and the late-E peak of Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity observed during hypoxia in non-anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017</xref>) and in anesthetized, vagotomized and artificially ventilated rats (present study). This effect seems to be exclusive to the activation of peripheral chemoreceptors because ablation of the C1 cells did not affect the generation of active expiration elicited by the activation of central chemoreceptors (hypercapnia condition). These results suggest that the recruitment of abdominal muscles by chemosensory drives could be mediated through different neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leirão et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Halloran, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The control of expiratory activity by C1 neurons is consistent with their function in increasing lung ventilation according to the intensity of the hypercapnic or hypoxic stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>). The former and present data do not clarify whether inspiratory and expiratory activities are regulated by the same C1 neurons; however, active expiration triggered by hypoxia depends on the integrity of C1 neurons located in the rostral aspect of the ventrolateral medulla. The main question that needs to be addressed is how these neurons are involved in breathing regulation, especially under hypoxia. A direct connection between the C1 cells and elements of the ventral respiratory group has already been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lipski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Agassandian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abbott et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stornetta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018a</xref>). C1 neurons are activated by hypoxia and then activate pFRG neurons through a direct glutamatergic mechanism to trigger active expiration. The hypoxic activation of C1 neurons is relayed by a direct input from the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives carotid body afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitravanshi and Sapru, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aicher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koshiya and Guyenet, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreira et al., 2006</xref>).

Until now, all previous studies showed strong evidence that glutamate is required for the autonomic and respiratory effects mediated by the activation of C1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Abbott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holloway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DePuy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018b</xref>). In the present study, the blockade of ionotropic receptors in the pFRG and depletion of C1 cells eliminated the active expiration that was induced by activation of peripheral chemoreceptors. Our work, taken together with previous work from others, indicates that catecholaminergic neurons in the C1 region use glutamate primarily, if not exclusively, as a transmitter to influence downstream autonomic and/or respiratory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Histology and experimental limitations</title><p>As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018a</xref>), most neurons that expressed GFP (94%) were catecholaminergic.

The selective activation of C1 cells in anesthetized, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats increased breathing frequency, but was not sufficient to induce an intense activation of breathing, and consequently to recruit active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018a</xref>; unpublished results from our laboratory). We tried to perform a higher transduction of C1 cells; however, the PRSx8 promoter is also expressed in the RTN, making it a very difficult task to increase the number of C1 cells transduced by the lentivirus without a significant transfection of RTN chemoreceptor neurons.</p><p>There are strong and direct pieces of evidence that show that glutamate, but not catecholamines, determine the cardiovascular and respiratory responses evoked by activation of C1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abbott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Abbott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DePuy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holloway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holloway et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018a</xref>). This evidence is also support by the absence of plasmalemmal monoamine transporter, which is necessary to replenish the catecholaminergic stores via reuptake in 90% of C1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Comer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, the depletion of catecholaminergic neurons in the RVLM or the blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors in the pFRG completely abolished active expiration induced by KCN. Although we do not have direct evidence to show that C1 cells release only glutamate into pFRG, on the basis of all previous data, we suggest that the short-term effects elicited by C1 neurons on active expiration may operate via ionotropic glutamatergic transmission.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that the depletion of C1 cells reduces the late-expiratory flow associated with active expiration during hypoxia in conscious rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that other pathways act as a recurrent system to control active expiration. Contrary to what might be expected, in the present study, the blockade of glutamatergic receptors and the depletion of C1 cells eliminated the abdominal activity evoked by the activation of the peripheral chemoreceptors. This result suggests that glutamatergic signaling from C1 cells determines the control of active expiration, at least under anesthesia. KCN bolus injection activates peripheral chemoreceptors, but the physiological responses differ from those seen during environmental hypoxia exposure; thus, it is difficult to make a translational extrapolation from our data. Considering the experimental protocol differences, we suggest that under anesthesia, the activation of peripheral chemoreceptors using KCN induced a fast and intense increase in ventilation, which would explain the crucial importance of ionotropic glutamatergic signaling to trigger active expiration. In conscious rats, the hypoxic condition was sustained for 10 min, so that it is plausible to suggest that other mechanisms contribute to recruit and sustain the expiratory activity. One additional hypothesis is that the glutamate could be essential to produce a fast recruitment of the active expiration, with additional neurotransmitters contributing to maintaining expiratory activity. During prolonged exposure to hypoxia that was used to evaluate the c-fos staining, the metabolic, thermoregulatory and respiratory responses differed from those seen under the previous protocols, which could result in different pattern of abdominal activity recruitment. In summary, we suggest that different excitatory transmitters could be released by different stimuli (physical exercise, sleep, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and so on), so that the importance of each excitatory or inhibitory transmitter is associated with the nature, intensity and duration of the stimulus, but this assumption still needs to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we observed that C1 cells are activated by hypoxia and send projections to the expiratory oscillator located in the pFRG region to trigger active expiration. Once activated by hypoxia, C1 cells release glutamate to activate pFRG neurons and to generate active expiration, which is an emergent respiratory property that maintains physiological homeostasis when ventilatory demand is increased. Therefore, our study provides evidence that these two populations interact in a way that requires glutamatergic inputs from the C1 to the pFRG regions for the activation of expiratory neurons during hypoxia, which in turn is responsible for the generation of an active expiratory pattern. The revealed C1 and pFRG microcircuitry helps us to understand the neural organization of the respiratory pattern generator in conditions of peripheral chemoreceptor activation. Therefore, our findings have potential implications for understanding the developmental mechanisms that match respiratory supply and demand during hypoxia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed in 48 adult, male Wistar rats weighing 250–330 g.

Sections were subsequently rinsed in PBS and incubated for 2 hr in a) murine blue donkey anti-mouse (1:500) for NeuN; b) Alexa488 or Cy3 goat anti-mouse (1:200) for TH; c) Alexa488 donkey anti-chicken (1:200) for eGFP; d) Alexa488 donkey anti-goat (1:200) for CTb; e) Alexa 488 or Cy3 goat anti-guinea pig (1:200; Molecular Probes, USA) for VGlut2 and f) Cy3 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Molecular Probes) for fos immunostaining. All the secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA) unless otherwise stated. The sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides in sequential rostrocaudal order, dried, and covered with DPX (Sigma Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Coverslip were affixed with nail polish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mapping</title><p>A series of six 40 µm transverse sections through the brainstem were examined for each experiment under bright field and epifluorescence using a Zeiss AxioImager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). Neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, TH, eGFP, VGlut2, CTb, and/or fos were plotted with the Stereo Investigator software (Micro Brightfield, Colchester, VT) utilizing a motor-driven microscope stage and the Zeiss MRC camera according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>). Only cell profiles that included a nucleus were counted and/or mapped except in the cases where collaterals were mapped. The Stereo Investigator files were exported into the Canvas drawing software (Version 9, ACD Systems, Inc) for text labeling and final presentation. The neuroanatomical nomenclature is from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paxinos and Watson (2007)</xref>. Photographs were taken with a Zeiss MRC camera (resolution 1388 × 1040 pixels), and the resulting TIFF files were imported into Canvas software. Output levels were adjusted to include all information-containing pixels. Balance and contrast were adjusted to reflect true rendering as much as possible. No other ‘photoretouching’ was performed. Figures were assembled and labeled within Canvas.</p><p>The total number of TH- (TH-ir), CTb- and/or fos-positive cells in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM: between 11.60 and 12.80 mm caudal to bregma level), commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS: between 14.28 and 14.76 mm caudal to bregma level), and parafacial respiratory group (pFRG: between 10.64 and 11.60 caudal to bregma level) were plotted as the mean ± SEM (RVLM: six sections/animal; cNTS: three sections/animal; pFRG: five sections/animal). The profile counts from the animals that received bilateral microinjections of anti-DβH-SAP reflected the sum of both sides of the brainstem and were compared with the counts from the control rats. The neuroanatomical nomenclature employed during experimentation and in this manuscript was defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paxinos and Watson (2007)</xref>. The profile counts from the animals that received PRSx8-ChR2-eYFP or CTb injections reflected only one side of the medulla and were compared with the counts from the control rats. Confocal images (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) were used to evaluate the colocalization between axonal varicosities of eGFP and VGlut2 in the pFRG region. Terminal fields were mapped using an x63 oil-immersion objective by taking 0.3 μm z-stack images of both red and green fluorescence through tissue where discernible eGFP-labeled fibers were sharply in focus. These stacks were usually between 5 μm and 10 μm in depth. Terminals were marked as positive only when both eGFP and VGlut2 immunofluorescent profiles were in focus in at least two consecutive z-sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and normally distributed data were expressed as the means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA, with or without repeated measures, as appropriate. When applicable, the Bonferroni post hoc test was used. The significance level was p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP; grants: 2016/23281–3 to ACT; 2015/23376–1 to TSM) and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq; grant: 408647/2018–3 to ACT).

expiration during breathing. The insights gained in this study are novel and contribute to our understanding of cardiorespiratory integration in general. The authors have placed the work firmly in the context of integration of different behaviors and homeostatic functions by the CNS. Breathing is a dynamic behavior divided into three phases (inspiration, post-inspiration and active expiration. These three phases are the results of different muscles recruitment (in general: diaphragm, upper airways and abdominal muscles) and their rhythm are controlled by three distinct oscillators: pre-Bötzinger Complex driving inspiration; post-inspiratory complex driving post-inspiration and the lateral parafacial region (pFRG) driving active expiration. The authors verify anatomically that C1 neurons project to the pFRG region and demonstrate that blocking glutamatergic receptors at the pFRG level and depleting C1 neurons blunts the hypoxic activation of active expiration. A significant finding is that depletion of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation where C1 neurons are located did not change breathing parameters at rest.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Adrenergic C1 neurons are part of the circuitry that recruits active expiration in response to hypoxia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jan-Marino Ramirez as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Huckstepp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present manuscript presents a sequence of experiments that provide evidence of an excitatory role of C1 cells in the brainstem as part of the circuitry involved in the generation of active expiration in hypoxia. Despite the fact that the authors approached related questions (in previous recent articles), the present manuscript presents useful new data. The neuronal processes involved in the generation of active expiration have been elucidated recently and the theme is in the central stage of neural control of breathing. Importantly, few studies have looked at active expiration during hypoxia exposure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors verify anatomically that C1 neurons project to the RTN/pFRG region and demonstrate that blocking glutamatergic receptors at the RTN/pFRG level and depleting C1 neurons blunts the hypoxic activation of active expiration. The authors have not directly shown that C1 neurons release sufficient amounts of glutamate into the pFRG to elicit active expiration. Since the authors have shown that they are able to transfect 94% of C1 neurons with the PRSx8-ChR2-eYFP virus, the authors should be able to activate these neurons to show that they can induce active expiration and then inject kynurenic acid to block it. This would provide much stronger evidence of their hypothesis as it would show directly that glutamate release from the C1 neurons into the pFRG alters active expiration. The authors have already used both of these techniques in this manuscript and should be able to easily combine them. In this experiment after a rest period they could photoactivate the C1 neurons and use adrenergic blockers to test the catecholaminergic input as well. Please try to add this experiment within a two months period or if this is not possible, please provide a strong argument, why this has not been done and address this in the Discussion.</p><p>2) An important question is related to the fact that active expiration is completely suppressed by one isolated pathway/mechanism evaluated presently. This would suggest the absence of recurrent control systems that are well known in respiratory networks. For example, the blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the pFRG completely eliminated active expiration elicited by KCN and hypercapnia. Is the glutamatergic transmission the only excitatory one existing onto the pFRG? There are some evidence in the literature supporting the view that cholinergic and serotonergic transmission are also a source of excitation at the pFRG level to elicited active expiration. Another example: Depletion of catecholaminergic neurons in the RVLM completely abolished active expiration induced by KCN. There is evidence showing A2 projections to pFRG. Moreover, the TH terminals labeled in the pFRG may derive from different catecolaminergic source (other than C1). Conversely, the present evidence strongly supports that, under the present experimental condition, a fraction of RVLM catecholaminergic neurons are needed to express active expiration in hypoxia exposure. Such a result may be circumstantial and specific to the animal model (anaesthetised rodent). Please chose to address the questions in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Along the same lines, since you did not always use hypoxia, but KCN bolus injections, please avoid &quot;hypoxia&quot; in the title and specify:.…&quot;in response to peripheral chemoreceptors activation&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52572.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors verify anatomically that C1 neurons project to the RTN/pFRG region and demonstrate that blocking glutamatergic receptors at the RTN/pFRG level and depleting C1 neurons blunts the hypoxic activation of active expiration.

We already used a similar protocol, combining the optogenetics and pharmacological manipulation to evaluate if the C1 cells activation increase breathing frequency by releasing glutamate and/or catecholamines into the pre-Bötzinger complex (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018). We would like to emphasize two important points about the use of the same approach to evaluate if C1 cells contribute to increase active expiration using glutamate as neurotransmitter.</p><p>1) We previously performed the experiments suggested by the reviewers and we found some problems regarding this protocol in order to evaluate active expiration induced by C1 cells stimulation in our experimental condition. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for a representative tracer from one rat, in which 74% of C1 cells from one site were transduced by the PRSx8-ChR2-eYFP virus. It shows the effect of C1 cells stimulation on cardiorespiratory parameters in urethane anesthetized rats. In conscious rats, it was previously demonstrated that the activation of C1 cells promotes an intense increase breathing frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation (Abbott et al., 2014). Note that activation of C1 cells in anesthetized, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats is not enough to promote an intense activation of breathing, and consequently to recruit active expiration. We tried to perform higher transduction of C1 cells. However, the PRSx8 promoter is also expressed in the retrotrapezoid nuclei, making it impossible to increase the number of C1 cells transduced by the lentivirus without a significant transfection of RTN neurons, which are well known by their involvement with breathing control using glutamate as neurotransmitter. It is a huge challenge for us combining photostimulation of C1 cells and pharmacological manipulation of pFRG region in conscious rats. The distance between C1 and pFRG regions is too small (less than 200 μm) to allow the concomitant implantation of the fiber optic and the guide cannula (23G needle).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cardiorespiratory effects elicited by optogenetic activation of C1 cells in urethane anaesthetized, vagotomized and artificially ventilated adult rats.</title><p>The arterial pressure (AP); diaphragm electromyography activity (Dia<sub>EMG</sub>); and abdominal electromyography (Abd<sub>EMG</sub>) were measure before, during and after the 30 seconds of C1 photostimulation (474 nm blue laser).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52572-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>2) There are strong and direct evidences that glutamate release, but not catecholamine, determines the cardiovascular and respiratory responses evoked by activation of C1 cells (Guyenet et al., 2014; Holloway et al., 2013; 2015; Abbot et al., 2012; 2014; DePuy et al., 2013; Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018). These evidences are also supported by the absence of plasmalemmal monoamine transporter, necessary to replenish the catecholaminergic stores via reuptake, in 90% of C1 cells (Guyenet et al., 2014; Commer et al., 1998; Lorange et al., 1994). We also would like to emphases that, specifically in our study, the depletion of catecholaminergic neurons in the RVLM or the blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors in the pFRG completely abolished active expiration induced by KCN. Although we do not have a direct evidence showing that C1 cells release only glutamate into pFRG, we suggest, based in all previous evidences, that the short-term effects of C1 neurons on active expiration elicited by KCN may operate via ionotropic glutamatergic transmission.</p><p>Taking all this points into account, unfortunately, we are not able to add new experiments showing that C1 cells release glutamate into pFRG to produce active expiration. We estimate that would need at least 4-5 months to perform new experiments in conscious rats. Therefore, we add these caveats in the Discussion and hope that reviewers understand our decision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An important question is related to the fact that active expiration is completely suppressed by one isolated pathway/mechanism evaluated presently.

Studies from our group demonstrated that the blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors into pFRG eliminates active expiration during hypercapnia in two experimental conditions: i) using anesthetized, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats (Silva et al., 2019) and ii) using in situ working heart-brainstem preparation (Zoccal et al., 2018). However, our previous work showed that the depletion of C1 cells reduces the late-expiratory flow associated with active expiration during hypoxia in conscious rats (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018). Thus, we did not expect that the blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors in the pFRG and the depletion of C1 cells would suppress the active expiration induced by KCN in anesthetized, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats. Therefore, we suggest that the magnitude of contribution of the glutamatergic signaling into the pFRG will precisely adjust the recruitment of abdominal muscles according to the lung ventilation demand, differing between hypoxic hypoxia and cytotoxic hypoxia. Another hypothesis is that the glutamate could be essential to initiate but not to sustain the active expiration for long periods. In addition, we suggest that other transmitters will be released by different stimulus (physical exercise, sleep, hypoxia, hypercapnia, etc.), being the importance of each excitatory or inhibitory transmitter associated with the nature and intensity of the stimulus. We added this information in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along the same lines, since you did not always use hypoxia, but KCN bolus injections, please avoid &quot;hypoxia&quot; in the title and specify:.…&quot;in response to peripheral chemoreceptors activation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct, we modified the title, as suggested.
