that facilitates recovery from the stress. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <italic>dmsr-1</italic>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <italic>in vivo</italic>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19837.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19837.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19837.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People often feel fatigued and sleepy when they are sick. Other animals also show signs of sleepiness when ill – they stop eating, move less, and are less responsive to changes in their environment. Sickness-induced sleep helps both people and other animals to recover, and many scientists believe that this type of sleep is different than nightly sleep.</p><p>Studies of sickness-induced sleep have made use of a simple worm with a simple nervous system. In this worm, a single nerve cell releases chemicals that cause the worm to fall asleep in response to illness. Animals exposed to one of these chemicals, called FLP-13, fall asleep even when they are not sick. As such, scientists would like to know which cells in the nervous system FLP-13 interacts with, what receptor the cells use to recognize this chemical, and whether it turns on cells that induce sleep or turns off the cells that cause wakefulness.</p><p>Now, Iannacone et al. show that FLP-13 likely causes sleep by turning down activity in the cells in the nervous system that promote wakefulness. The experiments sifted through genetic mutations to determine which ones cause the worms not to fall asleep when FLP-13 is released. This revealed that worms with a mutation that causes them to lack a receptor protein called DMSR-1 do not become sleepy in response to FLP-13. This suggests that DMSR-1 must be essential for FLP-13 to trigger sleep. About 10% of cells in the worm’s nervous system have the DMSR-1 receptor. Some of these neurons tell the worm to move forward or to forage around for food. The experiments also showed that FLP-13 is probably not the only chemical that interacts with the DMSR-1 receptor, but the identities of these other chemicals remain unknown.</p><p>Additional experiments are now needed to determine if sickness-induced sleepiness in humans and other mammals is triggered by a similar mechanism. If it is, then drugs might be developed to treat people experiencing fatigue associated with sickness as well as other unexplained cases of fatigue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19837.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19837.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>sickness</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>RFamide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS088432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iannacone</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Raizen</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS091500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iannacone</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Raizen</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-ADG-340318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beets</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoofs</surname><given-names>Liliane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beets</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoofs</surname><given-names>Liliane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30ES013508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raizen</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Office of Research Infrastructure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40-OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raizen</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During sickness, sleep is induced by neuropeptides, which contain an amidated arginine-phenylalanine motif, acting in a neuroendocrine fashion on a G-protein coupled receptor called DMSR-1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When acutely ill, animals engage in a behavioral sequence that includes cessation of feeding and body movements as well as reduced responsiveness to the environment. During acute infectious illness in mammals, electrophysiological correlates of sleep behavior are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Toth and Krueger, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1989</xref>), indicating that the behavioral sequence is sleep. In the arthropod <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lenz et al., 2015</xref>) and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), acute illness results in cellular stress, which then induces a sleep behavior: the animals stop moving and feeding, do not respond to weak stimuli but move normally in response to strong stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). This stress-induced sleep (SIS, also known as sickness sleep) is beneficial to the animal and helps it recover from the acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spiegel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo and Williams, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fry et al., 2016</xref>). In fruit flies and round worms, environments that induce SIS include bacterial pathogens, bacterial toxins, heat shock, cold shock, osmotic shock, and ultraviolet light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lenz et al., 2015</xref>). A comparison between mammalian sickness sleep and invertebrate SIS was recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davis and Raizen, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Nematode SIS is a distinct sleep state from a larval sleep state known as developmentally timed sleep (DTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trojanowski et al., 2015</xref>), which is regulated by a homolog of the core circadian protein PERIOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of stress, nematodes experience sleep only when they transition between larval stages but do not sleep in the adult stage. Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not have an identifiable circadian rhythm of sleep, adult nematodes are an ideal system to study SIS in the absence of the circadian and homeostatic effects of animals that require daily sleep.</p><p>The mechanism of SIS is poorly-understood, yet a few common themes have emerged from studies across phylogeny. The acute illness can occur outside of the brain yet affect behavior, suggesting that communication occurs between non-neural and neural tissues. Cytokine signaling is involved. For example, in mammals, the cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, whose levels increase during an infectious challenge, are each sufficient to induce sleep when injected into the brain (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krueger, 2008</xref>). In nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</xref>), arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foltenyi et al., 2007</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kushikata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>), signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF) is sufficient to induce sleep behavior and, at least in nematodes, EGF signaling is necessary for SIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). These cytokines act on central nervous system (CNS) neurons, which then induce sleep.</p><p>In mammals, CNS neurons that regulate sleep reside in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saper et al., 2005b</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the target for EGF action is a single interneuron called ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</xref>), whose developmental program has similarities to the developmental program of mammalian neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2010</xref>). With EGF activation, ALA depolarizes to release neuropeptides encoded by the gene <italic>flp-13</italic> (<underline>F</underline>MRFamide-<underline>L</underline>ike <underline>P</underline>eptide-13) to promote sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>). FLP-13 peptides are characterized by an amidated Arginine-Phenylalanine (RFamide) motif at their C-termini. RFamide neuropeptides are involved in many physiological functions in both invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López-Vera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peymen et al., 2014</xref>), and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rőszer and Bánfalvi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim, 2016</xref>). In fruit flies, several RFamide neuropeptides regulate sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shang et al., 2013</xref>), including the RFamide neuropeptide FMRFamide, which regulates SIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lenz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we focused on understanding the downstream mechanism of the sleep-promoting activity of FLP-13 RFamide peptides. Both locomotion quiescence and feeding quiescence induced by <italic>flp-13</italic> can be reversed by activation of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trojanowski et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that <italic>flp-13</italic> mediates quiescence at the level of the nervous system. Furthermore, quiescence induced by <italic>flp-13</italic> requires the G protein alpha subunit GOA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trojanowski et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that these peptides signal through a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). There are more than 150 genes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome predicted to encode neuropeptide receptor GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frooninckx et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobert, 2013</xref>). In prior detailed analysis of one of these GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>), we showed that while FRPR-4 can be activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell-based assay, its genetic removal does not abrogate <italic>flp-13</italic> induced quiescence in vivo, suggesting that it is not the receptor mediating the quiescence-inducing effects of FLP-13 peptides in response to cellular stress. Since we had no strong <italic>a priori</italic> reason to implicate other specific GPCRs, we took a hypothesis-independent forward genetic screen approach to identify the FLP-13 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). We here identify the GPCR DMSR-1 (<underline>D</underline>ro<underline>M</underline>yo<underline>S</underline>uppressin <underline>R</underline>eceptor related-1) as required for <italic>flp-13</italic> somnogenic effects. DMSR-1 is expressed in about one tenth of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons and localizes diffusely to membranes. FLP-13 peptides can activate the receptor directly, indicating that DMSR-1 is likely an in vivo receptor for FLP-13 neuropeptides. Inhibition of neurons where <italic>dmsr-1</italic> is expressed enhances the effect of <italic>flp-13</italic>, suggesting that DMSR-1 transduces the FLP-13 signal by reducing activity of wake-promoting neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>dmsr-1</italic> is required for <italic>flp-13</italic> induced sleep</title><p>Our goal was to characterize the downstream mechanism for the sleep-inducing FLP-13 neuropeptides.

The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value.

Each of the six mutants had a mutation in <italic>dmsr-1</italic>, a gene predicted to encode a GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Four of the mutants (<italic>qn44</italic>, <italic>qn49</italic>, <italic>qn51</italic> and <italic>qn53</italic>) contained premature stop codons. One mutant (<italic>qn45</italic>) contained a complex rearrangement in exon 4 consisting of deletion of 332 nucleotides coupled with insertion of 54 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This rearrangement results in a frame shift that eliminates the three transmembrane domains at the C-terminus of the protein. One mutant (<italic>qn52</italic>) contained an alanine to valine mutation in exon 3. We Sanger sequenced the <italic>dmsr-1</italic> gene in <italic>qn40</italic>, and found a premature stop mutation in exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The six mutations which caused premature stops or a deletion are predicted to eliminate gene function. We do not know whether the missense mutation in <italic>qn52</italic> eliminates genes function; however, based on the phenotype and the relatively conservative alanine to valine mutation, the second extracellular loop where this mutation occurred likely plays an important role in the function of DMSR-1. We performed subsequent analyses using the <italic>qn45</italic> allele because it was a convincing null mutation and because the genotype could be easily determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p>DMSR-1 is one of 41 <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins in the RFamide receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frooninckx et al., 2012</xref>) and is orthologous to <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptors for the neuropeptides dromyosuppressin and FMRFamide. Like FLP-13 peptides, Dromyosuppressin and FMRFamide are neuropeptides with an amidated Arginine-Phenylalanine (RFamide) motif at their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nachman et al., 1993</xref>). We grouped the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DMSR and other RFamide receptor proteins based on their sequence homology to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosuppressin receptors MsR1 and MsR2, which are known to respond to RFamide peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Other RFamide receptors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> include FRPR (<underline>F</underline>M<underline>R</underline>Famide <underline>P</underline>eptide <underline>R</underline>eceptor family) proteins, and the neuropeptide receptor family (NPR), although these FRPR and NPR receptors are more closely related to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMRFaR than they are to the myosuppressin related receptors. We included in the phylogenetic tree other identified RFamide receptors from the arthropods <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Rhodnius prolixus,</italic> which also share homology to the Drosophila myosuppressin receptors.

In support of this suggestion, we found that a DMSR-1 protein with a GFP fluorescent tag at its C-terminus was localized diffusely to neuronal cell membranes and was not localized to synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This GFP-tagged DMSR-1 protein rescued the mutant phenotype of <italic>dmsr-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that it was functional.</p><p>Taken together, these results support a model whereby ALA releases FLP-13 peptides in a neuroendocrine fashion to directly activate DMSR-1 expressed in neurons and thus promote sleep in response to cellular stress.

Similarly, a given receptor may be activated by multiple neuropeptides. Does the somnogenic effect of FLP-13 neuropeptides result exclusively from the activation of DMSR-1? Do other neuropeptides activate DMSR-1 to induce sleep? We used a double mutant analysis to answer these questions.

Cellular stress leads to the release of the EGF/LIN-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2014</xref>) either from the stressed cells directly or from other cells. EGF activates the ALA neuron through the EGF-receptor LET-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</xref>). This activation requires depolarization of ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>).

FLP-13 neuropeptides then act in a neuroendocrine fashion to activate the G-protein coupled receptor DMSR-1 and thus to inhibit wake-promoting neurons, which include the AIY interneurons.

Our double mutant analyses support the notion that FLP-13 peptides act on other receptors in addition to DMSR-1, and that DMSR-1 is activated by peptides other than FLP-13 peptides. The additional receptors responding to FLP-13 peptides may include one or more of the 15 other DMSR proteins encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the additional peptides acting on DMSR-1 may include one or more of the other neuropeptides released from ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nath et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We showed that selective <italic>dmsr-1</italic> expression in the AIY neurons conferred a small but significant rescue of the <italic>flp-13</italic> overexpression-induced movement quiescence but did not confer a rescue of SIS. Three possibilities could reconcile these observations. (1) The endogenous FLP-13 peptides that act on the AIY neurons are released from a neuron other than ALA. (2) FLP-13 peptides act on AIY only when expressed at high levels and do not normally do so under physiological conditions. (3) Our SIS assay conditions were not sufficiently sensitive to identify a small rescue in SIS. Regardless of the explanation of these results, since the AIY interneurons are known to promote worm locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>), our observations that <italic>dsmr-1</italic> is expressed in AIY and may function in AIY are consistent with the model that FLP-13/DMSR-1 signaling functions to inhibit wake-promoting neurons.</p><p>Although selective <italic>dmsr-1</italic> expression in neither AIY nor PHA neurons fully rescued the mutant quiescence phenotype, our findings do not exclude the possibility that <italic>dmsr-1</italic> functions selectively in a neuron type that we have not yet tested. Several of the other neurons expressing <italic>dmsr-1</italic> remain unidentified and may also promote waking activity. One possibility is the neuroendocrine RID neuron, which promotes forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). The alternative to the model that <italic>dmsr-1</italic> functions in a small subset of the neurons where it is expressed is that <italic>dmsr-1</italic> is simultaneously required in several neurons to promote sleep in response to FLP-13 signaling. In this model, which we favor, restoring <italic>dmsr-1</italic> gene expression in only a subset of the neurons in which <italic>dmsr-1</italic> is required would not be sufficient to fully rescue the mutant phenotype.</p><p>In mammals, wake-promoting centers are distributed broadly across brainstem, basal forebrain, midbrain, and diencephalic structures, but sleep promoting neurons are anatomically restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saper et al., 2005b</xref>). The ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, which is proposed to be sleep-promoting, contains inhibitory projections to several wake-promoting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saper et al., 2005a</xref>). It is possible that <italic>C. elegans</italic> similarly has a diffuse wake-promoting circuit that can be inhibited by a central sleep-promoting system, the single ALA neuron. It remains to be seen whether sleep in response to acute illness in other animals functions in a similar fashion, but since RFamide and EGF signaling regulates sleep in arthropods too, it would not be unreasonable to propose that the molecular details and signaling concepts elucidated here are conserved across phylogeny.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm cultivation</title><p>Worms were cultivated on the agar surface of NGM medium (1.7% agar), fed the OP50 derivative bacterial strain DA837 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 1995</xref>), and maintained at 20 degrees Celsius unless noted otherwise.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The RFamide receptor DMSR-1 regulates stress-induced sleep in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Patsy Dickinson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please note that both reviewers felt the paper would have substantial impact on the field, but also felt that editorial work would strengthen its impact. In this case, I believe it will be helpful for you to see the initial reviews because they are in essential agreement, and focus on queries that you should answer to make the manuscript more broadly accessible and useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper provides convincing evidence that the gene dmsr-1 encodes a receptor (DMSR-1) that is activated by FLP-13 peptides, and is important in controlling 'stress-induced sleep', that is, quiescence induced by the effects heat stress or of EGF (presumably acting on the ALA neuron). Using a mutagenesis screen, the authors found that a number of mutants that failed to respond to overexpression of <italic>flp-13</italic>, and therefore presumably over-stimulation by the FLP-13 peptides had a variety of mutations in the <italic>dmsr-1</italic> gene, leading to a failed DMSR-1 receptor. They went on to show that the DMSR-1 receptor binds to the FLP-13 peptides, that it is required for stress-induced sleep, that the <italic>dmsr-1</italic> gene is expressed in the nervous system (in a number of specific neurons), and finally that the likely mechanism for the effects of DMSR-1 activation on stress-induced sleep are likely mediated by an inhibition of wake-promoting neurons rather than by an activation of sleep-inducing neurons.</p><p>The writing is clear, and it appears to me that the data are appropriately interpreted and make a strong case for their interpretation. Moreover, the manuscript should be of interest to a reasonably wide range of neuroscientists. The ability to manipulate the genetic makeup of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, together with the existing knowledge of the nervous system, make this a system that works very well for this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript identifies the GPCR DMSR-1 as a novel regulator of stress-induced sleep through an unbiased forward genetic screen for genes that suppress the effects of a sleep-promoting neuropeptide. Complex neural circuits regulate sleep, and investigating sleep regulation in the nematode's relatively simple nervous system has potential to identify defined circuits regulating this process, and how they are modulated by environmental change. These findings build upon previous work identifying the ALA neurons as mediating stress-induced changes in sleep by release of FLP-13 neuropeptide. The identification of DMSR-1 as a target of FLP-13 provides a system for examining neurohormonal modulation of sleep in response to environmental or physiological changes. The experiments are technically sound and will have broad impact on the sleep community. Below I list a number of comments, mostly minor, that I believe would increase the accessibility and impact of this manuscript.</p><p>1) Because this journal is geared towards a generalist audience, greater description of the assays and interpretations of results would be helpful.</p><p>2) It is not clear why heat was selected as a stressor to characterize SIS in DMSR mutants while UV was used in the HisCL experiments. Using 35 degrees? What about other stressors? It would be very interesting to know if the role of DMSR-1 is generalizable across difference stressors.</p><p>3) The impacted would be aided by localizing DMSR-1 function. Speculate on what other.

We performed additional experiments in an attempt to localize the function of <italic>dmsr-1</italic> within the nervous system. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Because UV induces quiescence over a longer time course, we have found that it is more sensitive for detecting the differences found in this figure. This rationale has been clarified in the text. In addition, we now introduce the use of UV at an earlier point in the paper, now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Using 35 degrees? What about other stressors? It would be very interesting to know if the role of DMSR-1 is generalizable across difference stressors.</italic> </p><p>SIS can be triggered at other temperatures – in general, the higher the temperature, the greater the subsequent behavioral response. Please see Figure 3 in Nelson et al., Current Biology 2014. To test whether <italic>dmsr-1</italic> is required for SIS after exposure to temperatures other than 35 degrees C, we performed an additional experiment in which we exposed cohorts of animals to 30 minutes of heat at temperatures ranging from 29 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees C. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>To determine whether the role in <italic>dmsr-1</italic> can be generalized to other stressors, we performed an additional experiment in which we tested the effect of the mutant on sleep following exposure to ultraviolet C radiation. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Hence, indeed the role of <italic>dmsr-1</italic> in SIS appears to be generalizable to different degrees of stress and to different types of stress.</p><p><italic>3) The impacted would be aided by localizing DMSR-1 function. Speculate on what other. Is it at least possible to separate head and tail populations?</italic> </p><p>We performed two cell-specific (AIY and PHA) rescue experiments but were unable to fully rescue the <italic>dmsr-1</italic> quiescence defect. With AIY-specific expression, we did find a small but statistically significant rescue of the <italic>flp-13</italic> overexpression-induced body movement quiescence, but no rescue of the <italic>flp-13</italic> overexpression-induced feeding quiescence and no rescue of the body movement or feeding movement quiescence during SIS. While it is certainly possible that <italic>dmsr-1</italic> function is required in a neuron type that we did not yet test, the explanation we favor is that <italic>dmsr-1</italic> function is simultaneously required in several neurons. We discuss these results in the context of our model of a distributed wake-promoting system.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the double mutant effect almost looks additive, which is somewhat surprising. This experiment may benefit from a more detailed analysis e.g. a number of different UV intensities or heat gradients.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the double mutant has a stronger effect than either of the single mutants. We explain this finding by proposing that FLP-13 peptides are acting on other receptors and that the DMSR-1 receptor responds to other peptides. Performing a full dose response analysis of the stressors is unlikely to illuminate the interpretation of this double mutant phenotype.</p></body></sub-article></article>
